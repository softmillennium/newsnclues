            Britain's Queen Camilla once fended off the unwanted advances of a man on a train, according to a new book, which reveals that she told the story of how she took off her shoe “and whacked him in the nuts with the heel.”
    


            The anecdote is part of an excerpt from “Power and the Palace” by Valentine Low, a former royal correspondent for Britain's The Times newspaper, which was published in the Sunday Times on Sunday.
    


            Low was told the story by Guto Harri, who worked as communications director for Boris Johnson during his time as Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016.
    


            Harri recalled how Johnson and Camilla, who was known as the Duchess of Cornwall at the time, had “got on like a house on fire” during a meeting at Clarence House.
    


            “But the serious conversation they had was about her being the victim of an attempted sexual assault when she was a schoolgirl,” Harri told Low in the book.
    


            “‘She was on a train going to Paddington — she was about 16, 17 — and some guy was moving his hand further and further …”
    


            At that point, Johnson had asked what happened next, Harri told Low. According to Harri, Camilla replied: “I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel.”
    


            “She was self-possessed enough when they arrived at Paddington to jump off the train, find a guy in uniform and say, ‘That man just attacked me', and he was arrested,” Harri continued.

            CNN has reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment on the account in the new book, which is due to be published on September 11.
    


            The palace has not released an official statement but does not appear to be disputing the reported details.
    


            Camilla became Queen in 2022 when her husband, King Charles, acceded the throne following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.
    


            She has become known for her dedication to ending violence against women, working to raise awareness of the issue for more than 10 years.
    


            Camilla has used her position to highlight organizations that help the victims of both domestic violence and sexual violence, as well as supporting survivors of sexual assault through initiatives such as the Wash Bag Project, which provides toiletries for them to use after undergoing a forensic examination.

Carlos Alcaraz produced a sensational behind-the-back shot during his victory over Arthur Rinderknech at the US Open, winning the point from his quick-thinking improvisation.
    


            The moment of skill came early in the first set of the Spaniard's 7-6(3), 6-3, 6-4 victory when Rinderknech attacked a looping shot close to the net. Alcaraz initially ran past the ball before throwing his racket behind his back and firing a return to the Frenchman, who hit his volley into the net.
    


            The moment had members of the crowd inside Arthur Ashe Stadium on their feet, while Alcaraz soaked up the applause with a huge grin.

            The world No. 2 produced a similar shot against Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals of the 2022 US Open. On that occasion, he also went on to win the point.
    


            “Sometimes, I practice it, I'm not going to lie,” Alcaraz said in his on-court interview. “I don't practice it too many times, just in the practice if the opportunity is there, I will try it.
    


            “In the match, it's kind of the same. If I have the opportunity, why not? People like it, I like playing tennis like this, so it just came naturally.”
    


            It set the tone for another impressive performance from Alcaraz in New York. With the two-hour, 12-minute victory, he surpassed Boris Becker as the youngest man in the Open Era to reach 13 grand slam quarterfinals.
    


            Chasing a sixth grand slam title and second at the US Open, Alcaraz is yet to drop a set in this year's tournament and now faces Czech Republic's Jiří Lehečka in the final eight.
    


            The pair have already met twice this year, with Lehečka winning their quarterfinal at the Qatar Open in February and Alcaraz getting revenge at Queen's Club four months later.
    


            “I'm just going to the court thinking: I'm playing well and just feeling great physically,” Alcaraz told reporters. “I just hitting the ball really well, as well. I'm thinking about playing my best tennis and enjoying myself when I step on the court. That's all I am thinking about when I'm approaching every match.”

            The wrestler who was beaten while motionless by the son of former UFC champion Rampage Jackson has been released from hospital and revealed the extent of the injuries he suffered in the incident.
    


            Footage from an event last month in Sun Valley, California, posted on social media showed Jackson's son, Raja Jackson – a professional MMA fighter – sliding into the ring during another bout and throwing Syko Stu, whose real name is Stuart Smith, to the mat.
    


            The video, which bears a watermark suggesting it was livestreamed on the video platform Kick, showed Jackson straddling Smith before repeatedly punching him in the face and the side of his head, even when Smith was lying motionless. Other wrestlers then restrained Jackson.
    


            CNN has not been able to independently verify the video, but Kick confirmed to CNN that Raja Jackson's account has been banned from the platform.
    


In a joint post on Facebook from Smith and his wife Contessa Patterson, they said that the wrestler had been released from hospital and was at home.
    


            The post also detailed the severity of the injuries he sustained in what his wife had previously called an “unscripted assault.”
    


            “He sustained a serious head injury and was unconscious upon arrival at the ER. His injuries include trauma to both the upper and lower jaws, a laceration to his upper lip, and a fracture to the maxilla bone, which unfortunately resulted in the loss of several teeth,” the post said.
    


            It continued: “He has a long road of recovery ahead, but he remains in good spirits despite everything he has been through.
    


            “We are deeply grateful for all the love and support we've received during this time.Thank you to everyone who has contributed in any way – whether through monetary donations, food, flowers, or gifts. Your kindness means more than words can express.”
    


            Patterson organized a fundraising page to help cover Smith's medical costs and loss of income. At the time of writing, the page has raised over $216,000.
    


            After the incident involving Smith and the younger Jackson, Rampage Jackson took to social media to condemn his son's actions.
    


            “I don't condone my son's actions AT ALL!” he wrote in a post on X on August 24.
    


            “He (Raja Jackson) suffered a concussion from sparring only days ago and had no business doing anything remotely close to physical contact.
    


            “As a father, I'm deeply concerned with his health AND the well-being of Mr. Smith.That being said I'm very upset that any of this happened, but my main concern now is that Mr. Smith will make a speedy recovery. I apologize on his (Raja Jackson's) behalf and to KICK for the situation.”
    


            A statement by organizer KnokX suggested that the incident started off as a scripted part of the show, known as a “work” in wrestling, but was not intended to go as far as it did.
    


            “What was supposed to be a planned and agreed upon wrestling spot, turned into a selfish, irresponsible act of violence against Mr. Smith,” the organizer wrote.
    


            “This egregious act is reprehensible and never should have occurred. In the 17 years of operation of KnokX Pro Wrestling Academy, there has never been anything as heinous take place such as this and we apologize to our patrons and fans.”

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) could become the leading vehicle to usher in a more fair system of global governance, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said, adding that he supports China's initiatives in this regard.Speaking at the extended session of the SCO summit in Tianjin, China, Putin noted that the high attendance of the gathering is proof of a “genuine interest and attention to the multifaceted activities” of the organization. He noted that since its inception in 2001, the SCO has sought to build “an atmosphere of peace and security, trust and cooperation on the common Eurasian continent.” “It seems that the SCO could take a leading role in efforts to form a more just and equitable global governance system,” Putin suggested, adding that it would be based on the primacy of international law and the key provisions of the UN Charter. In light of this, the Russian president continued, Russia has taken note of Chinese President Xi Jinping's ideas on the matter. The topic, according to Putin, has become “especially relevant in a situation where some countries still do not abandon their pursuit of dominance in international affairs.” The Russian president did not elaborate on this statement, but the comments come against the backdrop of unprecedented Western pressure on Russia.Putin further said that SCO members have traditionally shown respect for each other's history and civilizational diversity. He added that later this month Moscow is hosting the Intervision song contest, which is being presented as an alternative to Eurovision and will be attended by performers from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. “This large-scale project is aimed at promoting universal values… Traditional values are already fading into the background... It is time to bring them back to the international agenda,” he said.

US President Donald Trump has warned that America could became a “third world nation” if his tariffs are scrapped. He made the remarks after a federal appeals court declared most of them unlawful.

Trump launched his tariff drive in April, accusing US trade partners of creating unfair trade imbalances and calling it a reciprocal response to secure better trade terms. Most country-specific rates ranging from 10% to 41% took effect on August 7.

The policy has drawn criticism from US lawmakers over the potential damage to the economy. On Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Trump misused his authority by imposing tariffs under an emergency-powers statute, saying only Congress can authorize these measures. The court stopped short of canceling the tariffs, giving the administration until mid-October to appeal to the Supreme Court.

Trump blasted the ruling, warning of dire consequences if it stands.

“More than 15 Trillion Dollars will be invested in the USA, a RECORD. Much of this investment is because of Tariffs,” he wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “If a Radical Left Court is allowed to terminate these Tariffs, almost all of this investment, and much more, will be immediately cancelled! In many ways, we would become a Third World Nation, with no hope of GREATNESS again.”

The court ruling covers two sets of tariffs: Broad “reciprocal” tariffs on most US trade partners, and tariffs on goods from Canada, China, and Mexico linked to drug trafficking claims. The decision does not affect targeted tariffs, such as those on foreign steel, aluminum, and autos, as they were enacted under separate laws.

Trump has argued that tariffs are good for the economy, presenting them as tools to secure better trade terms, revive manufacturing, and cut deficits. Economists, however, warn that the policy risks pushing the US into recession.

Russia has not been targeted with tariffs due to the existing sanctions, but Trump has threatened higher tariffs on its trade partners if the Ukraine conflict is not resolved. Last month, he doubled tariffs on India to 50%, accusing it of aiding Moscow by buying Russian oil, and hinted at new measures against China.

Members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) should continue to resist “hegemonism and power politics” to help build a fairer international system, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday as he opened the group leaders' meeting in Tianjin.

Delivering a keynote speech to leaders and representatives of member and partner nations, Xi invoked what he called the “Shanghai spirit” of “mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations, and pursuit of shared development.”

Xi praised the progress made by the SCO since its founding in 2001 and outlined new priorities. He said members must “oppose the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation, and bullying practices” – terms often used by Beijing to criticize US and Western policies.

“We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and make the global governance system more just and equitable,” he added.

The Chinese leader also urged members to pursue win-win cooperation while respecting their national differences, strengthening exchanges between their peoples, and pushing for greater efficiency and evidence-based policymaking within the SCO.

The regional group's collective economic output has reached $30 trillion, Xi noted, adding that its global influence was expanding accordingly. Members are working together to address challenges including security, environmental issues, and innovation, he added.

China's cumulative trade with SCO nations has surpassed $2.3 trillion, Xi said, highlighting projects under Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative and other mechanisms. He pledged further investments, including in education and the training of scientific and engineering skills required to sustain future growth.

More than 20 nations from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East are participating in the Chinese-hosted gathering, as well as representatives of leading international organizations, including the UN and ASEAN.

International Association of Genocide Scholars resolution backed by 86% of members who voted

An overwhelming majority of members of the world's leading genocide scholars' association have backed a resolution stating that Israel's actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of the crime.

Eighty-six per cent of those who voted in the 500-member International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) supported the motion. The resolution states that “Israel's policies and actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide in article II of the United Nations convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide (1948).”

The three-page resolution passed by the body calls on Israel to “immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of the population.”

The resolution said the IAGS recognised that “since the horrific Hamas-led attack of 7 October 2023, which itself constitutes international crimes”, the government of Israel had engaged in systematic and widespread crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, including indiscriminate and deliberate attacks against the civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, homes and commercial buildings, of Gaza.

Melanie O'Brien, the IAGS president and a professor of international law at the University of Western Australia, said the resolution was “a definitive statement from experts in the field of genocide studies that what is going on on the ground in Gaza is genocide”.

Founded in 1994, the IAGS has a broad membership that includes academics, historians, political scientists and human rights activists. It has adopted previous resolutions identifying genocide, including historical cases such as the Armenian genocide.

The 1948 UN convention, drafted in the aftermath of the Holocaust, defines genocide as acts committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. It obliges signatory states to act to prevent and stop such crimes, which may include killing members of a group, inflicting serious harm, imposing destructive living conditions, preventing births or transferring children by force.

There was no immediate response from the Israeli foreign ministry.

Israel is fighting allegations at the world's top court, the international court of justice, of committing genocide in Gaza. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, but withdrew it after he was killed.

Emotional toll of constant negative news and unlimited access to ‘doomscrolling' has led to record-high news avoidance

News has never been more accessible – but for some, that's exactly the problem. Flooded with information and relentless updates, more and more people around the world are tuning out.

The reasons vary: for some it's the sheer volume of news, for others the emotional toll of negative headlines or a distrust of the media itself. In online forums devoted to mindfulness and mental health, people discuss how to step back, from setting limits to cutting the news out entirely.

“Now that I don't watch the news, I just don't have that anxiety. I don't have dread,” said Mardette Burr, an Arizona retiree who says she stopped watching the news about eight years ago. “There were times that I'd be up at two or three o'clock in the morning upset about something that was going on in the world that I just didn't have a lot of control over.”

She's not alone. Globally, news avoidance is at a record high, according to an annual survey by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism published in June. This year, 40% of respondents, surveyed across nearly 50 countries, said they sometimes or often avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017 and the joint highest figure recorded.

The number was even higher in the US, at 42%, and in the UK, at 46%. Across markets, the top reason people gave for actively trying to avoid the news was that it negatively impacted their mood. Respondents also said they were worn out by the amount of news, that there is too much coverage of war and conflict, and that there's nothing they can do with the information.

Julian Burrett, a British marketing professional, said he's intentionally unplugged from the news since the pandemic, after feeling almost addicted to constant negative updates. He's deleted most media apps from his phone and avoids TV bulletins. Last year, he even started a small Reddit community, r/newsavoidance, to “consider the pros and cons, tips and tricks, and tools of avoiding news”.

Others who spoke to the Guardian described varied approaches. One said he checks in on the news once a week to stay informed without being overwhelmed. Another said he has shunned the news for years, citing its effect on his mood and a broader distrust in the press. A Maryland man described feeling “enraged” by recent political developments, and tries to set boundaries by scanning headlines only.

Studies suggest that increased exposure to news – particularly via television and social media, and especially coverage of tragic or distressing events – can take a toll on mental health.

For decades, Roxane Cohen Silver has examined the consequences of consuming media about crises, from 9/11 and the Covid-19 pandemic to climate-related disasters and mass shootings.

“With greater exposure, we see greater distress in people's reports of their mental health. Greater anxiety, greater depression, greater post traumatic stress symptoms, acute stress symptoms,” said Silver, professor of psychology, medicine and public health at the University of California, Irvine.

In recent years, her research has found political polarization to be a major stressor for people in the US. Similarly, political concerns topped the list last year in the American Psychological Association's Stress in America poll, with the economy and spread of false news also ranking prominently.

With the rise of smartphones and social media, opportunities for contact with distressing content have exploded, Silver noted.

“There's just ample opportunity to be exposed to news all the time, through either push notifications on people's phones, or people can be consuming news across many different modes simultaneously,” she said.

Viewing graphic imagery, in particular, is associated with psychological distress – a concern in an era when disturbing images of tragedies circulate freely beyond newsrooms' control.

A growing body of advice online promotes healthier ways to consume news. Much of it focuses on creating guardrails so people can be deliberate about finding information when they're ready for it, instead of letting it reach them in a constant stream. This might include signing up for newsletters or summaries from trusted sources, turning off news alerts and limiting social media.

“People can stay informed without doomscrolling,” Silver said. Applying learnings from her research to her own life, she reads news online, but skips videos, television and social media.

“I don't see any psychological or physical benefit from consumption of those kinds of images,” she said. “So if I'm reading a story and there is a video, I don't click on it.”

She suggests setting specific windows of time to read the news rather than staying immersed in that environment constantly, noting that it helps if people feel a sense of control over how much they're being exposed.

Benjamin Toff, director of the Minnesota Journalism Center at the University of Minnesota, studied the trend in his book Avoiding the News. He draws a key distinction between those who consistently avoid the news and those who simply limit their consumption – the latter, he says, is “perfectly healthy”.

“We live in a world in which you can access news 24/7 and be inundated with information at all times. But that doesn't mean you should,” he said.

What worries him and his co-authors is when withdrawal turns into a cycle that deepens social divides, leaving some groups less likely to participate in political life.

“The more you disengage, disconnect from the news, the harder it becomes to try to make sense of what's happening on any given story,” he explained.

The authors observed that consistent news avoidance tends to be more common among young people, women, and lower socioeconomic classes.

“If you believe as we do, that normatively, we want people to be able to have the same opportunities to engage politically, to vote, to be vocal about the political issues that matter, then we think it's a problem that people are disengaging from news,” Toff said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

17:25 JST, September 1, 2025

In Tokyo's Bunkyo Ward, it's common to see foreign tourists drawn to a building near Yushima Seido in the ward's Yushima district, stopping to admire the origami creations in the window. Once inside the Ochanomizu Origami Kaikan, they discover a vibrant world in which paper transforms into art, and artists keep alive a centuries-old tradition with beautiful, hand-dyed papers.

“You can even do origami with a paper napkin. Just fold it in half twice. Tie it, and look — you've made a ballerina,” said director Kazuo Kobayashi, 83.

Speaking in broken English, Kobayashi showed how to fold a swan and a rising sun for seven visitors from the U.K. and Canada in the shop on the third floor. He noted that foreigners make up a sizable part of the clientele, accounting for about 70%-80% of all visitors.

Kobayashi is the fourth-generation owner of a paper dyeing shop founded in 1858. He said that the first-generation owner mastered general washi Japanese paper processing techniques and started the paper dyeing shop.

During the Meiji era (1868–1912), the government introduced origami into early childhood education. At the education ministry's request, the shop created the world's first square-shaped origami paper. The Ochanomizu Origami Kaikan hall opened in 1972 as a center for sharing origami, and the company later changed its name to match the hall's name.

On the fourth floor, visitors can see craftsmen hand-dyeing washi Japanese paper in a workshop. The origami paper, made by dyeing kozo paper in a dye solution, is thin and durable. Kozo paper is a kind of washi made of kozo plant, and makes it possible to create intricate folds.

A mid-floor gallery displays three-dimensional animals and other creations made from this special paper.

After World War II, origami became known around the world as a traditional Japanese art form. In his 30s, Kobayashi began pursuing origami more seriously, traveling nationwide to hold classes and give lectures abroad to share the message that anyone, regardless of age or gender, can enjoy origami if they have a piece of paper. After finishing his demonstration, he smiled broadly and said, “They [the foreign tourists] have come all this way, so I want them to leave happy.”

Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military exercises began in Belarus on Aug. 31, with participants set to practice nuclear weapons planning, Russian state-run media outlet Ria Novosti reported.

Belarusian General Staff chief Pavel Muraveiko said the drills were moved deeper into Belarus ""to avoid being accused of various kinds of insinuations and possible provocations"" near NATO borders. 

More than 2,000 troops from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan are taking part, with 450 units of equipment, nine aircraft, and over 70 drones involved.

Moscow has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies throughout the full-scale war. Muraveiko said the drills would focus solely on planning scenarios for potential nuclear use, without involving actual deployment.

""You can't use something that poses a threat to the whole world, to universal security,"" he said.

Belarus, a key ally of Moscow, signed an agreement with Russia in May 2023 allowing the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons on its territory. 

Ukrainian intelligence has claimed Belarus fields only delivery systems, not nuclear warheads, and dismissed Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko's assertions that Minsk would acquire Russia's new Oreshnik intermediate-range missile system.

The CSTO, formed in 2002 as Moscow's answer to NATO, brings together several post-Soviet states but has faced criticism for its reliance on Russia and limited effectiveness. 

The drills come ahead of large-scale Zapad-2025 Russian-Belarusian exercises expected in September, which Belarusian officials have said will also include nuclear deployment planning.

Siversk, Russia's new potential target, lies about 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Russian-occupied territory and just south of the contested Serebrianskyi Forest.

The pace of Russia's advance in Ukraine dropped by 18% in August, with Russian forces occupying 464 square kilometers of territory.





""We are accelerating the supply of additional air defense systems to enhance protection against missiles,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

""We can confirm there was GPS jamming, but the plane landed safe,"" European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podesta confirmed for the Kyiv Independent.

While Moscow has publicly insisted on full control of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the map indicated possible plans extending to Odesa and Kharkiv, neither of which had been included in earlier demands. 

The victim, identified as Liana, was struck by a train traveling about 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) after a 31-year-old Iraqi citizen allegedly shoved her onto the tracks.

""The suspect has given an initial testimony. Urgent investigative actions are currently underway to establish all the circumstances of this murder,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in the early hours of Sept. 1.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pledged to broker a swift peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, is not expected to attend the Paris meeting at the moment, a source told AFP.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The article contains graphic footage.

Andrii Parubii, a Ukrainian politician who previously served as the parliament speaker and played a prominent role in the EuroMaidan Revolution, was shot dead in Lviv on Aug. 30.

Earlier in the day, the National Police said that a political figure was murdered after a shooting in the western Ukrainian city. Iryna Herashchenko, a lawmaker from the European Solidarity party, subsequently confirmed for the Kyiv Independent that Parubii was the victim.

A suspect in the fatal shooting was detained, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in the early hours of Sept. 1. ""The suspect has given an initial testimony. Urgent investigative actions are currently underway to establish all the circumstances of this murder,"" Zelensky said.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that the suspect was apprehended in the western Khmelnytskyi Oblast.

On Aug. 30, authorities received an emergency call at around noon after the shooting in Lviv's southern Frankivskyi city district, the police said. The victim died on the spot. Citing sources, Suspilne broadcaster reported that the suspected assailant was dressed as a delivery courier and rode an electric bicycle.

During a press briefing in Lviv, police officials said that Parubii was shot at eight times with a short-barreled firearm. Seven shell casings were found at the crime scene, law enforcement sources told Suspilne.

The search for the shooter is underway in Lviv Oblast, Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said, while the Prosecutor General's Office has launched a murder investigation. Officials did not provide information about the suspect's identity or motive.

Law enforcement authorities said they are investigating whether Parubii received threats before his death. A probe was also launched into the unauthorized release of a street camera recording showing moments before and after the shooting.

The video shared online appears to show the shooter waiting for the victim near a car before approaching him from behind. The crime itself is not visible.

Parubii, born in 1971 in a town near Lviv, was a long-time activist, lawmaker, and government official. During Soviet times, he organized anti-government demonstrations and was twice arrested.

After Ukraine gained its independence, Parubii entered politics, being elected into the parliament for the first time in 2007. He participated in the Orange Revolution in 2004 and led self-defense volunteer groups during the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2013-2014.

After the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych during EuroMaidan, Parubii was appointed secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. He held the position between February and August 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea and initiated the war in Donbas.

His role as the National Security and Defense Council secretary at the onset of Moscow's aggression made him a common target of Russian propaganda and disinformation.

The politician then served as the first deputy parliament speaker between 2014 and 2016 and as the parliament speaker from 2016 until 2019. Since 2019, Parubii has served as a lawmaker for ex-President Petro Poroshenko's European Solidarity party.

Ruslan Stefanchuk, the current parliament speaker, called Parubii a ""consistent defender of Ukrainian statehood.""

""On behalf of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, I express my condolences to Andrii's family and friends,"" Stefanchuk said in a public statement. Parubii is survived by his wife and daughter.

""Our team is shocked. This is terror,"" Heraschenko said in a statement published on European Solidarity's Facebook page.

""Andrii was one of the founders of the modern Ukraine... principled and decent, patriotic, intelligent.""

The news of Parubii's death also garnered reactions from abroad.

""The news of his murder in Lviv is shocking. My sincere condolences to his loved ones and to the entire Ukrainian people, who today lost one of their best sons,"" Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on social media.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys described Parubii as a ""fighter for Ukraine's European future,"" and expressed his ""sincere condolences to his family and loved ones.""

EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Mathernova similarly characterized Parubii as a ""fighter for Ukraine's democracy"" and relayed her ""condolences to his family and friends.""

Separately, the statement shared by the European Solidarity party suggested that Russia or its ""fifth column"" may have been responsible for Parubii's death, pointing to the ex-speaker's firmly pro-Ukrainian stances.

According to the police, a Russian involvement is one of the possible versions under investigation. At the same time, the law enforcement agency said there is no evidence linking the killing to the murder of Iryna Farion, an ex-lawmaker and professor murdered in Lviv in July 2024.

Volodymyr Ariev, a European Solidarity lawmaker, took a more cautious view than some of his party colleagues.

""It is not yet known who did this. I do not rule anything out and do not want to speculate until we have information about the person who ordered it,"" Ariev told the Kyiv Independent.

Zelensky said he had instructed Vasyl Maliuk, the chief of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), to join the investigation and present verified information to the public as soon as possible.

Kateryna Denisova contributed reporting.

Chinese President Xi Jinping gives a speech on Monday during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Tianjin, China.Suo Takekuma/The Associated Press

As U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war continues to disrupt international relations, Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday called for the creation of a “more just and equitable global governance system.” 

Mr. Xi was speaking at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, in Tianjin. Founded in 2001, the China-led SCO was initially confined to Russia and four countries in Central Asia, but under Mr. Xi has expanded to include India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus, as well as more than a dozen observer states and “dialogue partners.” 

Along with his signature Belt and Road Initiative and the expansion of BRICS, the SCO has been a key plank in Mr. Xi's ongoing efforts to upend the post-World War II, Western-led global order, a plan that has been supercharged by Mr. Trump's alienation of many of Washington's traditional partners, even as the U.S. has sought to isolate China with the threat of crippling tariffs. 

No country exemplifies this shift more than India. The U.S. has aggressively courted New Delhi under successive administrations, while Sino-Indian relations were bruised by multiple border clashes and trade disputes. 

Opinion: Trump is putting the screws to India over Russian oil imports, creating an opportunity for Canadian energy

India benefitted from a “friendshoring” drive which began during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Western brands sought a backup to manufacturing in China, and was bolstered by the threat of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. 

While some Western countries – notably Canada – have been wary of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aggressive right-wing Hindu nationalism, he was initially embraced by Mr. Trump, who hosted his “great friend” at a raucous “Howdy Modi” celebration in Texas during his first term. 

That friendship has unravelled since Mr. Trump's return to office however, as the two men reportedly soured on each other due to Mr. Trump's claims to have “solved” the longstanding India-Pakistan conflict, and Mr. Modi's refusal to stop buying cheap Russian oil. Last month, the U.S. slapped some of its most stringent tariffs on Indian goods, though enforcement of these measures has been thrown into doubt by a recent court verdict. 

Beijing has not wasted the opening, sending top diplomat Wang Yi to India to smooth over the border issue and create an opening for a meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Modi in Tianjin, the Indian leader's first visit to China in seven years. 

“The world today is swept by once-in-a-century transformations,” Mr. Xi said Sunday as he welcomed Mr. Modi. “The international situation is both fluid and chaotic.” 

Mr. Modi – who also attended the SCO summit on Monday – said that “given the uncertainties in the world economy, it is vital for India and China to strengthen cooperation.” 

Mr. Modi says New Delhi is committed to improving ties with China in a key meeting with Mr. Xi on Sunday.

At Monday's meeting, Mr. Xi called on SCO members to leverage their “mega-scale market” to boost trade and investment, and promised to boost Chinese aid and lending. As the “world's largest regional organization,” the SCO's “international influence and appeal are increasing,” Mr. Xi added. 

“We must uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core,” he said, urging members to avoid “Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation, and bullying.” 

As well as Mr. Modi, Mr. Xi held bilateral meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who said he briefed his Chinese counterpart on the outcome of his recent summit with Mr. Trump in Alaska. 

“We highly appreciate the efforts and proposals from China and India aimed at facilitating the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis,” Mr. Putin said Monday. “The understandings reached at the recent Russia–U.S. meeting in Alaska, I hope, also contribute toward this goal.”

He praised the SCO as having revived “genuine multilateralism” and laying the “political and socio-economic groundwork for the formation of a new system of stability and security in Eurasia.” 

“This security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure its own security at the expense of others,” Mr. Putin said. 

The Russian leader is staying in China until Wednesday, when he will attend a large military parade in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. He and Mr. Xi will be joined at that event by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and 24 other foreign leaders in another show of Chinese diplomatic clout.

Kamil Majchrzak returns a shot against Karen Khachanov at the U.S. Open in New York on Aug. 28.Sarah Stier/Getty Images

A man who took tennis player Kamil Majchrzak's hat from a young fan at the U.S. Open apologized on social media and said he has returned it.

Piotr Szczerek posted an apology on social media Monday after video of the incident went viral over the weekend. The broadcast showed Szczerek grabbing Majchrzak's hat from a boy after the player's singles match against Karen Khachanov.

Szczerek, who is from Poland, wrote on Facebook that he made a mistake thinking Majchrzak was giving him the hat for his sons, who had asked earlier for an autograph. In the post, he said he had apologized personally.

Majchrzak said on social media that he reached out to the boy's family and met with him to give him a new hat and take photos with him. The 29-year-old, who is also from Poland, retired from his match Saturday because of an undisclosed injury.

South Korea has stopped the broadcast of a propaganda radio program into North Korea as it steps up efforts to seek dialogue with Pyongyang.  

South Korea has suspended a military-run propaganda radio broadcast into North Korea, the defense ministry announced on Monday.

The move is the latest in a series of steps undertaken by the administration of South Korea's new President Lee Jae Myung, in its quest to ease tensions with the nuclear-armed North.

 South Korea's Defense Ministry said it wanted to reduce tensions with Pyongyang.

""The defense ministry suspended the Voice of Freedom broadcast as part of measures to ease military tensions with the North,"" ministry spokesperson Lee Kyung-ho said at a media briefing  on Monday.

The ""Voice of Freedom,” a psychological warfare broadcast, first aired in 1962 and has been on and off the airwaves with the tumultuous trajectory of inter-Korean relations.

The program was said to broadcast outside information and K-pop music into North Korea, which strictly regulates the access its civilians have to external information.

In recent weeks, the Lee government has stopped a number of other radio broadcasts into the North containing news from South Korea and the rest of the world.

Seoul has also halted the broadcast of propaganda from loudspeakers along the heavily-armed frontier between the two Koreas and has even dismantled some of the physical loudspeakers.

Lee has sought a thaw in ties with Pyongyang since taking office in June but North Korea has shown no interest in improving relations.

Last week, North Korea called Lee a ""hypocrite"" over his remarks calling for a ""path to denuclearization"".

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","En route to Germany, Afghans face deportation in Pakistan","https://www.dw.com/en/en-route-to-germany-afghans-face-deportation-in-pakistan/a-73802114","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 09:00:38 GMT","

After waiting in some cases  for years, hundreds of Afghan families will finally eventually be allowed into Germany. How quickly they are allowed to travel is a matter of life or death for many.

Germany has said it is ending a monthslong freeze on admitting vulnerable Afghans who had previously been promised entry to the country. Many of the people affected escaped the Taliban by fleeing to Pakistan, where they have been waiting for years for their German visas. DW met one such family, whose names have been changed and identities concealed for their safety.

Sharif and his family live in Islamabad in constant fear of being arrested and deported to Afghanistan. Police raids on guesthouses where Afghan refugees are staying forced the family to keep moving from place to place.

Before the Taliban takeover in 2021, Sharif worked in Afghanistan. When the group took Kabul, he and his family fled to Pakistan.

Having previously worked for international governments, Sharif is being sought by the Taliban. Years ago, the German government had assured Afghans who had worked for the Bundeswehr, German press outlets, and human rights NGOs, that they would be admitted to the country. Sharif's application was approved, but the process has dragged on for an agonizingly long time.

""We are facing many problems here. The biggest is the risk of deportation,"" Sharif said. ""The police come to the refugee houses every day, and whoever they catch they take away. If we are found during a search and sent back to Afghanistan, I'm 100% sure I will be killed.""

More than 2,000 Afghans in Pakistan are currently waiting to travel to Germany. Pakistani police have nonetheless arrested hundreds of them and sent them back to Afghanistan.

A one-month pause on deportations to allow Afghans to formalize their status in Pakistan or leave voluntarily expires Sunday. Pakistan's government has announced that it intends to resume deportations in September. More than a million people could be affected.

The constant threat puts Sharif's family under tremendous strain. His children can't go to school, for fear they will be discovered, and there's no possibility for his wife to work, although she, too, has a good education.

""When we arrived, our only hope was that our children could study and build a future,"" Sharif's wife said, asking that her name not be used. ""But one year of our lives has already been wasted.""

She said she was trying to teach her children at home. ""My biggest request is that we be transferred to Germany as soon as possible,"" she said. Only there will her children be able to continue their education. ""I never want to return to Afghanistan,"" she said. ""Because there we would be killed, and the future of our children would be destroyed.""

The new German government, which took office in May, determined that each individual application would be subject to a security check, even for Afghans whose permission to travel to Germany had already been guaranteed. This meant that the admission of vulnerable Afghan women and men to Germany effectively stopped.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has rejected the accusation that the government has been playing for time. Last weekend, he commented that people couldn't expect it to redress the failures of recent years in the space of just a few weeks. He said he had instructed colleagues to continue with the processing of applications, including security checks.

""Afghans for whom the Federal Republic of Germany has been obliged by legally binding court decisions to issue visas and to grant entry will be able to enter Germany,"" Dobrindt told DW.

According to media reports, the first families are expected to arrive in Germany on scheduled flights in the coming days. This follows decisions by German administrative courts obliging the Foreign Ministry to issue visas that have been promised. If officials fail to do so, the government will have to pay a penalty. The judges made it clear that the commitments made by Germany were legally binding.

""There are people in Pakistan at various stages of the emigration procedure. Screening procedures are currently restarting,"" the German Foreign Ministry announced on August 26. ""Staff from the relevant authorities are on the ground to resume the admissions process.""

Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Caritas and Reporters Without Borders had recently been putting tremendous pressure on the German government, urging it to take action.

For many of the people affected, it's a question of survival: If they are sent back to Afghanistan, they face persecution, imprisonment or even death.

Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius dismissed EU chief von der Leyen's reported remarks as premature. Meanwhile, Kyiv has condemned the SCO for omitting the war from its closing statement. DW has more.

Below is a roundup of the key events in Russia's war in Ukraine on Monday, September 1:

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was sharply critical of comments reportedly made by EU Chief Ursula von der Leyen regarding military security guarantees for Ukraine. 

In statements carried by British newspaper the Financial Times, von der Leyen said that ""precise plans"" are being drawn up for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine.

On Monday, Pistorius said he believed that publicly discussing such topics before Kyiv and Moscow sat at the negotiating table was ""completely wrong.""

""Apart from the fact that the European Union has no jurisdiction or competence whatsoever when it comes to the deployment of troops - regardless of for whom or for what — I would be very cautious about confirming or commenting on such considerations in any way,"" he told reporters during a visit to an arms manufacturer in Troisdorf, a small town near Cologne.

Pistorius nevertheless alluded to ongoing deliberations about ""what might be possible, what might not be possible, and under what conditions and reservations something could even be conceivable.""

Kyiv has lambasted the closing statement of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit hosted by China for failing to mention Russia's war in Ukraine.

In a statement on Monday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said this omission in the 20-page declaration was ""telling.""

""It is surprising that the largest war of aggression in Europe since the Second World War is not reflected in such an important, fundamental document, while it mentions a number of other wars, terrorist attacks and events in the world,"" the statement read.

Kyiv stressed that sustainable global development, international peace and security, adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, or the stable and equal development of trade relations between regions of the world, all issues touched upon in the SCO declaration, could not be addressed properly without ""a just end to Russia's aggression.""

It also described the omission as Moscow's failed attempt to ""portray the world as divided in its assessment of Russia's aggression against Ukraine,"" by showing that sympathy for Ukraine did not extend beyond the West.

""Given China's significant geopolitical role, we welcome Beijing's more active role in bringing peace to Ukraine based on respect for the UN Charter,"" Kyiv said.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for an end to the war in Ukraine during a meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in China. 

According to the Indian Foreign Ministry, Modi ""reiterated his support for the recent initiatives that have been taken to address the conflict in Ukraine."" 

Modi also highlighted the ""need to expedite"" an end to the conflict and ""find a durable peace settlement,"" the ministry said.

India has maintained a neutral stance in the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

New Delhi has supported peace initiatives, but it has refused to join Western sanctions targeting Russia's energy exports.

It has even become the second-largest buyer of Russian crude, after European nations severed ties with Moscow over its war in Ukraine.

Donald Trump has imposed hefty tariffs on India, ostensibly over its continuing trade relationship with Russia, as part of the US president's bid to bring the conflict to an end.

But rather than causing a rift, India and Russia's leaders ""discussed ways to deepen bilateral cooperation in all sectors, including trade, fertilisers, space, security and culture,"" Modi said in a post on Facebook.

An EU spokesperson condemned the suspected Russian GPS jamming of a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen en route to Bulgaria. 

""We have received information from Bulgarian authorities that they suspect this blatant interference was carried out by Russia,"" the spokesperson said. 

""We are well aware that threats and intimidation are a regular component of Russia's hostile actions,"" she added. 

""This will further reinforce our unshakable commitment to ramp up our defense capabilities and support for Ukraine.""

Von der Leyen was travelling to Bulgaria on Sunday on a charter flight as part of a four-day tour of EU countries bordering Russia and Belarus.

EU diplomats described weekend talks in Denmark as a ""brainstorming"" session on what comes next in the bloc's support for Ukraine.

Some of the ideas that were floated in Copenhagen? Secondary sanctions, frozen Russian assets, Ukrainian arms made on EU soil and EU military trainers inside Ukraine.

Read DW's analysis on how the talks went on. 

Vladimir Putin has praised Turkey's attempts to mediate in the war in Ukraine, during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Putin met with Erdogan on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China.

""I'm confident that Turkey's special role in these matters will continue to be in demand,"" the Russian president said. 

Erdogan, for his part, told Putin that Turkey wants a ""fair and lasting peace"" in Ukraine, according to the Turkish presidency.

He also said that he believes ceasefire talks held in Istanbul ""are contributing to peace.""

Turkey has hosted three rounds of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

While none of those meetings have resulted in a peace agreement or ceasefire, both sides did agree to prisoner of war (POW) swaps and the return of the bodies of fallen soldiers.

Putin also praised Turkey as a ""strategic"" partner in bilateral cooperation, particularly in energy. 

""Our focus is also on topics of common interest, such as the Middle East, North Africa, and Transcaucasia. Russian-Turkish cooperation in all these areas is well-established, concrete, useful, and, I would say, trusting,"" Putin said, according to Russian state media.

Ukrainian police suspect Russia was involved in the recent assassination of former parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy.

Parubiy, who was a vocal proponent of Ukraine's independence and sovereignty, was murdered in broad daylight in the western city of Lviv on Saturday.

""We know that this crime was not accidental. There is a Russian involvement. Everyone will be held accountable before the law,"" police chief Ivan Vyhivskyi said Monday.

Earlier on Monday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a suspect in the deadly shooting had been detained. 

Zelenskyy said Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko and the head of the country's Security Service Vasyl Maliuk had informed him of the apprehension of the suspect.

""All the circumstances of this horrendous murder must be clarified,"" Zelenskyy said on X. 

Unverified video circulating in Ukrainian media appears to show the alleged assailant, who was on a bicycle dressed as a food delivery courier, shooting Parubiy before fleeing the scene. 

No information has been released on the suspect's identity or motive.

Parubiy, 54, was a prominent figure in Ukraine's pro-democracy protests in 2004 and the Maidan protests in 2013.

The parliamentary leaders of the two parties in Germany's ruling coalition were in Kyiv on Monday.

Jens Spahn of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc and Matthias Miersch of the Social Democrats  (SPD) were in the Ukrainian capital to display cross-party solidarity.

Spahn and Miersch will hold talks with Ukrainian authorities on Germany's continued support for the country, as well as the state of diplomatic efforts to end the war.

On the train from Poland to Kyiv, Spahn told reporters that their visit is proof that the German government, parliament and coalition parties all stand firmly with Ukraine. Miersch called the visit a ""clear signal of support.""

Spahn added that the trip was a clear message to the Kremlin that Germany is willing and prepared to continue backing Ukraine with military support.

The CDU/CSU leader also accused Vladimir Putin of wanting to continue the war and of refusing peace attempts.

Ukraine's airspace has been closed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, so foreign visitors must travel by rail or road via Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania or Moldova.

On their way, the parliamentarians stopped in the southeastern Polish city of Rzeszow to meet German troops who operate Patriot air defense systems protecting the airport, which is a key hub for deliveries of Western weapons to Ukraine.

Poland borders both Ukraine and Russia and is the most populous state on NATO's eastern flank, which the military alliance has aimed to bolster since the start of the war.

Vladimir Putin also discussed last month's summit in Alaska with US President Donald Trump.

Held under the slogan ""Pursuing Peace,"" the highly anticipated meeting, which came after Trump escalated pressure on his Russian counterpart, did not result in a ceasefire agreement as Washington had hoped.

While the fighting has continued in the weeks since that meeting, Putin told the SCO on Monday that ""understandings"" that could pave the way to peace had been reached in Alaska.

""In this regard, we highly appreciate the efforts and proposals from China and India aimed at facilitating the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis,"" Putin said in Tianjin. 

The Russian leader added that he hopes the ""understandings reached"" at the meeting in Alaska ""also contribute toward this goal.""

Although the Alaska summit was held amid significant fanfare, it failed to produce any meaningful agreements or progress towards a ceasefire.
 

Vladimir Putin, who is attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, has defended his invasion of Ukraine.

Although the West has largely shunned Putin and Moscow since it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, Russia still counts on support from allies in Asia, many of whom are also taking part in the SCO meeting in Tianjin.

Addressing the summit, the Russian president repeated his unfounded claim that the war in Ukraine was triggered by a ""coup d'etat"" in Kyiv that was ""supported and provoked by the West.""

Putin was referring to the pro-Europe and anti-Moscow protests that swept Ukraine in 2013 which culminated in the removal of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovich.

Shortly after his ouster, Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula and occupied parts of eastern Ukraine.

""The second reason for the crisis is the West's constant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO,"" Putin added.

Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy wants to join the Western alliance to protect against Russian aggression.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz believes that the war in Ukraine could still last for some time.

In an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF, Merz stressed that seeking to bring a quick end to war at Ukraine's expense was not an option.

""We are trying to end it as quickly as possible but certainly not at the price of Ukraine's capitulation,"" he said. ""You could end the war tomorrow if Ukraine surrendered and lost its independence.""

""Then the next country would be at risk the day after tomorrow and the day after that, it would be us. That is not an option.""

Although he said he had not lost hope on a ceasefire being agreed, Merz explained he ""harbors no illusions"" as to that prospect.

Since May, there have been several attempts to halt the fighting through a ceasefire — including a historic summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin — but none have managed to yield an agreement.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has told British newspaper the Financial Times that ""precise plans"" are being drawn up for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine.

The force would be part of security guarantees for the country following the end of the war with Russia, which would be backed by the United States, she said.

Potentially tens of thousands of troops would receive assistance, including intelligence and surveillance assets from Washington, according to the report.

""President Trump reassured us that there will be (an) American presence as part of the backstop,"" von der Leyen told the FT.

She added the US assurances of support ""was very clear and repeatedly affirmed""

The arrangements, she said, were agreed upon during a meeting between US President Donald Trump,  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and senior European leaders in August.

Organizers confront ICE wherever they can be found, from the hotels where agents sleep to the streets they patrol.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Just before midnight on June 13, 2025, a small group of activists gathered quietly outside the Residence Inn by Marriott in Long Beach, California. A few blocks away, the scene was louder and more charged: demonstrators with megaphones chanted outside the Holiday Inn near the Long Beach airport, while police officers stood guard near the front of the establishment.

Word had spread through social media that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had reportedly checked into both hotels. Within the hour, a small contingent of local residents had arrived at both establishments. They were there to make sure ICE agents didn't sleep.

This was one of several “No Sleep for ICE” events that popped up during the month of June. In a time when large-scale protests often dominate headlines, a different kind of resistance is taking root across Southern California. Small, decentralized networks of community members are using stealthy tactics and real-time coordination to monitor, disrupt, and expose the movements of federal immigration officers.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Across L.A. County, the strategy of monitoring ICE movements and responding in real time has become one of the most effective tools in rapid-response activism.

“They shouldn't be kidnapping people off the street,” said Michael Gearin, a local Long Beach resident, who spoke to Truthout during the anti-ICE mobilization efforts in June. 

​​“If [ICE] wants to come back after a day of kidnapping landscapers and want to kick back and have a beer at the Residence Inn, I say no,” Gearin said, emphasizing his commitment to protecting his neighbors from immigration enforcement. “Why should they have an easy night when everybody else is scared?”

No Sleep For ICE is just one of several pop-up actions that have proliferated over the last several months throughout Southern California. As the immigration raids intensified from the start of June, leading into the late summer months, locals sought out increasingly creative ways to protect vulnerable community members. Many of these micro-movements rarely make the evening news, but they have become the core of mobilization efforts.

In the months leading up to President Donald Trump's inauguration, grassroots organizers quietly prepared for an expected surge in immigration raids. Guadalupe Carrasco Cardona, an educator and member of Unión del Barrio, partook in community patrols that monitor and track the movements of immigration enforcement agents, alerting local residents in real time.

“[ICE] uses the element of surprise to their benefit,” Cardona told Truthout, noting that many ICE-spotting patrols go early in the morning and search neighborhoods looking for staging of potential agents. “We patrol to spot them, and then let them know we see them — go live on socials, announce to the whole community that they're there.”

The efforts of local activists patrolling their neighborhoods have uncovered useful information. In June, local groups of organizers monitoring ICE activity discovered that Terminal Island in San Pedro is being used by ICE for early-morning staging and dispatching throughout LA County. This piece of critical information made it easier to monitor ICE activity and warn communities before a raid even begins.

Cardona also noted that community defense patrols have uncovered tactics used by immigration enforcement agents to evade detection. “We've uncovered that ICE is switching license plates, using incorrect ones, and sometimes coming out with no plates at all.”

Community patrol work has deep roots in Southern California, stemming back to the early 90s, mostly along the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. Many activists there were inspired by the Black Panther Party's model of community patrols, and Unión del Barrio adapted the concept to monitor and protect immigrant communities from immigration enforcement.

The recent iterations of patrol efforts in Los Angeles were revived in 2020 as a response to raids occurring under the Biden administration. By the time the second Trump administration took office, Unión del Barrio had already built critical experience. Recognizing the magnitude of the task at hand, the group launched the Community Self-Defense Coalition in 2025. The coalition now includes over 60 organizations spanning Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and even parts of Northern California.

Ron Gochez, another seasoned organizer with Unión del Barrio, said that in addition to conducting patrols, the coalition has developed a training program specifically for schools. The curriculum is designed to help educators protect their students, their students' families, and themselves during potential encounters with immigration enforcement agents.

“We've really been focusing on educators, because we know schools are about to start again,” said Gochez. “Educators are on the frontlines of defending their students and families.”

Most recently, the coalition conducted a training with over 250 LAUSD educators at the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) building in collaboration with the teachers' union. “We did a training for 250 people … because we know what's coming, and we're preparing together,” Gochez stated.

Gochez says the effectiveness of localized organizing has forced immigration authorities to adapt. “The entire ICE apparatus had to change their tactics because of our work.”

Despite a wave of local support for grassroots mobilization, activists say federal authorities have responded with intimidation and threats aimed at curbing their ongoing efforts.

In June, Unión del Barrio received a letter addressed to Gochez from Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who identified himself as chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism. In the letter, Hawley accused the organization of providing “logistical support and financial resources to individuals engaged in these disruptive actions” during protests taking place in Los Angeles at the time. He further alleged that Unión del Barrio had bankrolled civil unrest and abetted criminal behavior, and demanded that the group cease all organized activity.

The letter also included a sweeping request for internal records, including communications, emails, chat logs, donor lists, travel and lodging documents, and any evidence of coordination with members of the media.

“We're not going to let a neocolonial government like the United States intimidate us,” Gochez said in response to the letter. Both he and fellow member Cardona described the correspondence as a “veiled threat” and an effort to intimidate the collective. Still, they said the group remains undeterred, and that the letter has generated more interest and support for their work.

Other grassroots organizations have faced similar threats at the federal level, as was the case with Alejandro Orellana, a 29-year-old immigrant rights advocate with Centro CSO. Orellana was arrested by the FBI in June and charged with “conspiracy to commit civil disorder” after allegedly distributing face shields to protesters during a June 9 demonstration in downtown Los Angeles.

Although the Department of Justice later dismissed all charges, advocates view the arrest as part of a broader campaign to intimidate and suppress grassroots organizing, like the work being carried out by Centro CSO and Unión del Barrio.

Similarly, a member of Unión del Barrio was arrested recently at Terminal Island while monitoring the movement of federal vehicles alongside members of the Harbor Area Peace Patrol. Amanda Trebach, a U.S. citizen, was seized by several masked individuals who did not identify themselves as federal agents while on a morning peace patrol.

Video of the incident was shared widely online — Trebach was pinned face-down, with a knee on the back of her neck, before she was taken away in an unmarked van. She was held overnight in federal custody and released the following day without any charges filed.

While large protests still play a vital role in public awareness, these smaller, quieter efforts continue to shape what organizers see as a new front line. Whether it is the “disruptive work” of No Sleep for ICE, Know-Your-Rights Workshops, or patrolling neighborhoods, organizers are now two steps ahead. Rather than waiting to respond, locals are taking a proactive approach to defending their community.

“We don't have the luxury to stop, because our people depend on our resistance,” said Gochez.

The shift reflects a broader recalibration in immigrant defense work, one that sends a clear message: we will not be intimidated.

Gochez describes the work of local organizing in Southern California as a sophisticated and efficient network of community members united by a deep commitment to defending one another.

“We're not just a protest group … we're not just a group that goes out and does marches,” he says. Rather, the group also engages in “organized resistance, coalitions, training people, tactics, and strategies that are proven to work.”

Baltimore County teachers have secured a new raise agreement but say it is still less than they'd bargained for.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

“Nobody goes into education to become rich, but we deserve what was guaranteed to us,” Cindy Sexton, president of the Teacher's Association of Baltimore County (TABCO), told Truthout. After months of renegotiations regarding a pay-raise deal for teachers for the 2025-2026 school year, in mid-July, both TABCO and the school district reached an agreement that grants teachers less than they'd bargained for.

The initial pay raise deal was part of a three-year negotiated agreement with the Baltimore County school system last year, which would have increased teachers' compensation by 14 percent by the 2026-2027 school year. Educators called it a monumental move that not only saved teachers unions from the bargaining table but also ensured incremental pay increases that would be accounted for in each year's budget. “Negotiations are hugely time-consuming, and we wanted a new system where we could all count on our pay and they could focus on the budget it was going to cost them — it was widely touted and celebrated,” Sexton said.

And while year one of this deal proved successful, by November 2024, both federal and state funding cuts prompted the Baltimore County school district to ask unions back to the negotiating table, despite their raises already having been approved just the year before. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“The initial agreement was halted despite the district already negotiating with the county executive according to our contract,” Sexton said. “While we still met with the district about non-monetary things that they could do to help our workload, there was no movement. In February of this year, Baltimore County Executive [Kathy] Klausmeier finally told the district how much money they could count on, and it was far less than what they needed to fund this agreement.”

In fact, despite Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) requesting a 10.4 percent increase to their overall budget for the 2025-2026 school year, Klausmeier's finalized budget in April only accounted for a 3.5 percent increase, leaving a gap of $61 million for the teacher's raises. Now, the 5 percent teacher's pay raise anticipated in the last year was being renegotiated to as low as 1.5 percent. “This is the first time that any of us can remember [that] the school system has not gotten the funding it needed from the county executive,” Sexton told Truthout. 

And despite TABCO and other teachers' unions recognizing the three-year agreement as a fixed contract, Sexton says she believes the school district relied on flexible language in the agreement which outlined that renegotiations would happen in the case of underfunding to re-budget the pay raise deal whenever they saw fit. “It just does not appear that [the agreement] was bargained in good faith,” she said. “It appears like [BCPS] knew from the beginning that they were going to go back to the language that said, ‘If the funding doesn't happen you renegotiate.' They put forward a budget that they knew was not going to be funded.” 

Since then, TABCO has expanded its fight, organizing demonstrations and campaigns that garnered historic teacher turnout. “We started with letter-writing campaigns to the board of ed, the county council, the county executive — we picketed in the rain,” Sexton told Truthout. “We even canvassed in Kathy Klausmeier's home district — to her voters — [as a reminder] of her promise.”

Schools across the county even engaged in their own protests, and some organized a “work-to” rule where teachers would walk out of their classroom outside of work hours — an act that led to an all-member vote through TABCO and encouraged hundreds of other educators to participate. “Teachers give so many extra hours of time,” Sexton clarified, “so this was about just respecting that time.” 

On June 10, teachers rallied at the school board in historic numbers, weeks after Superintendent Myriam Rogers revised the initial 1.5 percent pay raise to 2.5 percent and refused to budge. “The organizing started around anger, really, because our promise wasn't honored,” Sexton told Truthout. In June, she told local media, “We [maintained] that in a $2 billion budget, there is money for the educators.”

Teachers' organizing, as well as the work of TABCO's renegotiation team, culminated in a tentative agreement reached between the union and the district on July 16, and finalized on July 23. According to Sexton, the new raise agreement consists of a cost-of-living adjustment of 1 percent effective on September 20, and then an official pay raise starting on January 6. “So instead of seeing 5 percent for the whole entire fiscal year, we'll see 3.05 percent because we're missing out on several months of that increase,” Sexton told Truthout. According to a TABCO press release, the finalized agreement represents a cash value of $26 million, compared to the $9 million package offered to TABCO in May. Despite this finalized renegotiation representing nearly double the 1.5 percent offered in May, Sexton stresses that it's far from an achievement for them. “It's still not a win because we didn't get what we had signed and agreed to,” Sexton told Truthout. “It's certainly better than we would have done, but I don't want anybody to think that we're content.” 

With next year's pay raise threatened by underfunding, Sexton's first worry is teacher retention throughout the Baltimore County Public School system. “Baltimore County loses approximately 10 percent of its educators every year,” according to Sexton, with most new teachers resigning after short periods of teaching. But this trend is representative of a greater issue in education throughout the country. “There's a national educator shortage. We know that. It's not just Maryland — it's not just Baltimore County.”

Neglected pay raise deals like that in Baltimore County are one of the reasons teachers fail to stay in their positions. According to a study conducted by the National Education Association, low pay and poor working conditions keep quality educators from being attracted to — and retained in — the profession. In fact, despite a 4.4 percent increase in teacher's starting salary — representing the most significant increase over the last 15 years — teachers' real salary growth adjusted for inflation is only 1.5 percent. This means that teachers are actually making 5 percent less than they did 10 years ago.

“When labor is scarce, compensation must increase,” writes former teacher and education advocate Michael Andoscia. Instead, teachers make less than other college graduates on average, forcing most educators to search for more profitable careers in other fields. “It's humiliating begging for money and for fair wages, especially when other professions requiring similar skills are more lucrative,” said Carol Frigo, an elementary school teacher with Baltimore County Public Schools. “Young teachers, especially, are realizing they have skills they can take out into the workforce and make a lot more money than doing this job.”

“If we can constantly curriculum and use money for so many other things, then we can support our teachers,” said BCPS teacher Gina McDonald. “I'm sure there's money to be found.” 

According to Sexton, however, even when there is enough money from the school system, educators are typically the last to be prioritized. “The Board of Education approves millions of dollars in contracts — for the curriculum, for new HVAC systems, and other operating costs,” she told Truthout. “Every other contract the school system had was treated as a fixed cost — but not the contract for the employees?” 

Most of the time, teachers also find themselves scrounging together their own finances to provide for their own students. “There are a lot of extra supplies that students need that aren't covered by the basics that Title I covers,” one BCPS special ed teacher, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation, told Truthout. “Things to make the classroom feel inviting for students, from fidgets and toys, to snacks, stickers … I bought sensory fabric for students. Some teachers have even had to purchase new supplies when the district can't afford to fix different things. And that's money coming out of our own pockets.” 

As a special educator, she said she finds that her students' needs are often neglected when it comes to the school budget. “There are far too many stories of administrators prioritizing things like technology for the general-ed students, and that's where the money goes — it's not spent on us,” she said.

Moreover, with teachers making less than they did just 10 years ago, they simply aren't making enough to cover the heightened cost of living and inflation. A study conducted by the Learning Policy Institute found that during the school year, 17.1 percent of U.S. teachers will take on a second job, while 49 percent will take up jobs during the summer break. Meanwhile, a poll organized by the Maryland State Education Association (TABCO's parent organization) found that 44 percent of Maryland educators alone hold at least one additional job — and for Black and Brown Maryland educators, these figures  jump to 50 percent. 

The second jobs that these educators undertake don't include the various roles educators take up for their students alone. On average, U.S. teachers work 53 hours a week, assuming multiple responsibilities like helping students outside of the classroom, performing non-teaching tasks like lunch duty or supervising extra-curricular activities, and covering other teachers' classrooms. “It is not a job you walk away from at 5 p.m.,” one elementary school teacher told Pew Research. 

The BCPS special education teacher who spoke with Truthout echoed this view. “Teachers are doing so much labor with students,” she said. “We're doing the emotional labor and regulation with them, we're counseling them, we're practically parenting them and are still expected to organize rigorous instruction with them.”

And since the pandemic, teachers have fewer resources to manage the physical and mental health concerns of themselves and students, learning challenges in the classroom, and an ever-growing workload. “The number of students who come in with trauma has skyrocketed, but the resources haven't matched the need,” one high school teacher told Pew Research. And just as teachers struggle to make ends meet in a country that withholds resources from them, poverty remains a major problem affecting students when those resources are withheld, with academic underperformance and behavioral issues being most pervasive in high-poverty schools. 

Cyclically, a factor that further impairs student learning is high teacher turnover — a figure that shows no signs of slowing considering how overworked, underpaid, and undervalued educators feel. “Educators will never make what they should for the job they do,” Sexton told Truthout. “And teaching is a craft you develop over years, so we need [teachers] to come and stay — our students need it and deserve it,” she adds. 

As Sexton completes her term as TABCO president, she hopes that the Baltimore County School System, the county government, and TABCO can continue to collaborate authentically, and with the intention of prioritizing educators and thus the students they teach, especially as the district and TABCO work through the 2026-2027 school year budget in accordance with their initial pay-raise deal. “That's the next fight that we have coming — is to hold them to that as well,” she told Truthout.

There is no origin story of the police without the story of the reorganization of human society by the birth, expansion, and dominance of the system of capitalism. While capitalism did not create inequality, it structured society such that new methods and tools were required to impose its uniquely unequal order — with threat of, and acts of, violence — in new ways. The police became one of the most important tools, specially adapted to fit the contours of this new social order.

During the early decades of capitalist development — first in England, then the United States — uprisings, rebellions, and strikes became commonplace. The participants were what elites would come to describe as “the dangerous class,” which included white workers, immigrants, and enslaved and free Black people. At this point, the existing precursors to the police were attempts by the ruling class to organize and manage the urban environment. The emergence of the mob and the restive crowd posed a massive challenge to the urban order and thus required new solutions.

The hope and rebelliousness of the “dangerous class” grew with the promise of the American, French, and especially Haitian revolutions, which reverberated through the networks of the revolutionary Atlantic. Ruling classes found the spread of uprisings increasingly worrisome and unmanageable. Since the working class was largely employed in port cities, they were concentrated at nodal points of Atlantic trade, connected by news and word of mouth to these revolutionary developments even if they weren't personally able to participate. The revolutionary waves created a profound problem for the capitalist class: How could they maintain control over the working masses in this context of revolt and compel them to dutifully submit to exploitation?

For about a week in June 1780, London was shaken by what some consider the most significant urban rebellion England has ever faced. Nominally instigated by progressive legislation to ease discrimination against Catholics, it detonated deep resentment against the wealthy and their fledgling carceral system. What became known as the Gordon Riots — in which two Afro-American radicals, John Glover and Benjamin Bowsey, and a Black woman, Charlotte Gardiner, played leadership roles — saw, day after day, workers, armed with everything from rifles to frying pans, roaming the streets, openly plundering of the homes of aristocrats, looting and destroying the homes of judges and magistrates, and attacking the properties of industrialists. Newgate Prison — London's largest — and several other jails were burned to the ground, while workers freed hundreds of prisoners on a single night. The offices of the Bow Street Runners, a police precursor, were raided and their records torched. In what could be described as a near revolution, Parliament and the Bank of England almost fell to the uprising. Graffiti on the walls of the ruins of Newgate Prison proclaimed that the inmates had been released on the “authority of His Majesty King Mob.” A nascent abolitionist sentiment of the participants can be heard in the later courtroom testimony of one of the liberators, who was asked by the judge about the “cause” of the riots. His reply: “There should not be a prison standing on the morrow in London.” Military encampments were built in parks, and, ultimately, it would take the army reoccupying the city to wrest control from King Mob, leaving four hundred to five hundred dead.

The existing system of magistrates and constables completely failed to stem or slow the Gordon Riots. Subsequently, Parliament was unanimous that a new system of public order was needed to prevent any future insurrectionary occurrence that marked “every property” as target for appropriation by the unruly crowd. While it is too simple to see the creation of the municipal police in London and elsewhere as a direct response to a single riotous act, events like the liberation of Newgate Prison instilled the ruling-class experiments to manage unruly workers with a new urgency and seriousness. In England and elsewhere, the new class of the free, enslaved, and dispossessed peoples not only resisted the new order but actively attacked it. It was directly because of the Gordon Riots that the first bill was introduced in Parliament for a “system of police” in 1785; although it failed to pass. Prime Minister William Pitt argued that a solution was needed that was more efficient, cheaper, and would provoke less alarm than resorting to the army.

Within the workplace — and the workhouse — employers devised all manner of disciplinary regimes to keep workers “in their place.” Outside the factory gates, however, workers were beyond the immediate command and control of the bosses. Here, they could commiserate, air grievances, and — worst of all from the bosses' point of view — discuss ways to collectively fight back. This presented a volatile situation. At the time, the only real recourse that constables had for managing crowds was the reading of the Riot Act, a proclamation ordering dispersal that was read aloud to crowds deemed unruly or threatening to public order. Failure to comply exempted vigilantes and mobs from legal recourse when the crowd was then violently suppressed. However, this strategy proved less and less useful as the size of crowds increased with the dramatic growth of the urban proletariat. The size of the crowd could simply overwhelm the constable, as happened in 1792 in Edinburgh, during protests in solidarity with the French Revolution, where a sheriff sauntered up to the angry crowd, read the Riot Act, and was promptly run off by a hail of stones.

Though the ruling class did its best to keep Black and white laborers divided, there were also instances where these two oppressed milieus converged and linked arms in struggle. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, multiracial rebellions — in 1676 in Virginia or in 1683 in Barbados, for example — were met with legal strictures that forbade trade, running away with, and many other interactions. As Ben Brucato has written, the goal of such restrictions was “to encourage the growing division between white and Black worker.” In New York City, in 1712 and in 1741, attempts at insurrection and revolutionary arson were organized together by enslaved Africans, Irish immigrant dock workers, and poor whites, which almost burned the city to the ground. Especially in the port cities, such cooperation made it “hard to police” these “dangerously insurrectionary connections,” according to historian Ira Berlin.

Overall, 70 percent of America's cities with a population over twenty thousand saw major disorder in the first half of the nineteenth century, and the threat of slave rebellion haunted the slavocracy in the South. London experienced major riots almost every year of the second decade of the nineteenth century, and revolt was openly feared by those in power. Between 1825 and 1830, New York City saw riots once a month. In Paris, food riots were commonplace in the latter half of the eighteenth century, but the commissaires were notably absent when they happened. One commissaire reported that, if he left his home, he would be “assailed and plundered by the crazed populace.” In 1775, the Flour Wars, riots of Gordon-level explosiveness, rocked Paris. Only one brave — or stupid — commissaire attempted to quell them, but he quickly found himself impotent to stop them and ended up being forced by the crowd to help disperse bread at the “price” set by the rioters. Historian Eric Hobsbawm writes that these unruly expressions of crowds, looting, and machine-breaking were “a traditional and established part of the industrial conflict … in the early stages of the factory and mine” in what he calls “collective bargaining by riot.” This political situation was described by a conventional police historian, who bemoaned the fact that

It was not difficult for political extremists to secure the following of a mob, incite them to rise, and lead them in a march upon Parliament. Mobs which marched on Parliament usually carried some grievances, real or imagined, which they hoped Parliament would redress. It was not unusual that mobs were unruly, destructive, and bore little regard for the well being of local residents and their property.

This relative ease of resistance — even if it was not able to culminate in victory for the underclasses — stoked the fear and contempt of the ruling classes.

If we jump back to the American South, we can see how urbanization produced similar changes to the institution of the slave patrol. Urbanization moved and consolidated the free Black and enslaved populations into cities, a process described by historian Julius Scott as one of the “key demographic trends of the early national period.” In Charleston, for example, the number of free Black inhabitants more than tripled from 1790 to 1820. This process was driven by rapid industrialization in the South that also had a tremendous impact upon the enslaved population. Although field work was still predominant, enslavers began leasing out individuals for work, meaning enslaved Blacks worked more and more in the textile mills, iron works, mines, tobacco factories, hemp factories, and tanneries of the cities. Free and enslaved Black artisans and “hired out” workers all took part in a sort of quasi-proletarianization. The process would be a factor in the doubling of the industrial output of the South by the mid-nineteenth century. But the urbanization of the South also brought increasing fears of revolt and required changes in the apparatus of repression.

Revolts of the enslaved — from the Stono rebellion to the German Coast uprising to Gabriel Prosser's rebellion to Nat Turner's revolt — struck fear into the hearts of the slave-owning ruling class, and, as resistance from below became ever more difficult to manage, the slavocracy opted for more professionalized and reliable ways of containing it. There was great anxiety about the events in Jamaica, where, in 1739, fugitive maroon communities in the mountains united and fought a guerilla war with the British to a standstill, winning the maroons limited autonomy. But few things haunted the enslavers more than the example set by the Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791 and culminated in the liberation of the island's Black population, giving enslaved people in the United States more confidence in rebellions. In 1796, a number of Black citizens of Charleston were executed for a large-scale plot to burn the city to the ground; they were described as having “intended to make a St. Domingo business of it” (St. Domingo was the name used for Haiti at the time). Fears sparked by the success of the Haitian Revolution provoked ports from Charleston to Boston to ban, and in some places deport, Black people originating from the Caribbean. Social controls like curfews and restrictions on movement targeted Black folks — free as well as enslaved. But these were difficult to enforce with ad hoc bands of vigilantes.

While the enslaver class relied upon the cities, they also strove to keep the social space of the labor camp and the city separate, fearing that field workers would be “ruined” by exposure to the cosmopolitan interconnections and propensity to revolt of the free Black and proletarianized enslaved workers of the city. The hiring-out system expanded the already existing networks of communication and connection between the rural and the urban. Moreover, the various legal restrictions proved unable to completely regulate city workers, to the point where “neither owners nor municipal officials could effectively monitor the enslaved bricklayers, carpenters, painters, and other craft workers who traveled freely around the city and surrounding countryside.” It was from these craft workers that many of the ranks and leaders of major attempted revolts emerged, such as Gabriel Prosser (a blacksmith) or Denmark Vesey (a carpenter).

The white ruling class in Charleston, a city that was 60 percent Black in 1820, acted on its anxieties with a more intensive and professionalized watch system than other contemporary cities in the form of the City Watch and Guard. This was especially the case on Sundays, market days when movement and interaction were freer among both the enslaved and free Black majority population. It was on these days that — similar to Barbados — day patrols of musket-armed and blue-uniformed squads would “observe and suppress indecent or riotous behavior” at the markets. In the time before the invention of the modern police, it is no coincidence that Charleston, as David Whitehouse points out, was the most heavily policed major city in the US and also “the only one where a majority of the people were enslaved.”

Then, in 1822, a planned insurrection in Charleston was uncovered that confirmed the worst fears of the white slave-owning class. The conspiracy consisted of an extensive network in both the city and labor camps, with a plan to assassinate key officials, loot weapons depots, kill as many whites as possible, set fire to the city, and either escape on boats to Haiti (where revolt leader Denmark Vesey reportedly had contacts) or establish an armed outpost of freedom. Although the plan was aborted before attempted, and thirty-five people were hanged in response, the planned insurrection reflected the explosive potential of Black rebellion and the challenges of the city.

In 1822, in direct response to the thwarting of the planned slave insurrection of Denmark Vesey and his comrades, a daytime patrol was created. By 1856, this patrol had become fully incorporated into a modern uniformed police force. The escalation in repression required the creation of a new organization with more permanent and centralized authority than the slave patrols. A Charlestonian enslaver in 1845 described the change in a perversely matter-of-fact way:

[In the rural setting] the mere occasional riding about and general supervision of a patrol may be sufficient. But, some more energetic and scrutinizing system is absolutely necessary in cities, where from the very denseness of population and closely contiguous settlements there must be need of closer and more careful circumspection.

While it is somewhat simplistic to see the slave patrol as simply turning into the modern police via linear progression, there is an unbroken blue line in the history of the U.S. South from the experiments of the slave patrol to the formation of the modern police, as the private violence of the labor camp was moved into the public city.

Two years before the Denmark Vesey conspiracy, on August 16, 1819, in Manchester, England's industrial center, one hundred thousand workers marched in organized columns onto St. Peter's Field as part of a demonstration for suffrage and for the lowering of food prices. This was the culmination of a years-long process of organizing and politicization in which the working class progressed from hunger marches to strikes, to a General Union expressly forbidden by law, to political organizations fighting for radical democracy. The same year witnessed illegal unions parading in the streets, while state attempts to arrest the reformers proved inadequate when juries refused to find them guilty. Here, arrayed on St. Peter's Field, “King Mob” now appeared as a disciplined army. The volunteer yeomanry militia was sent in first to disperse the protests and arrest one of the leaders, Henry Hunt. The yeomanry was comprised of volunteers drawn from bosses and shop owners — the equivalent of the “cities business mafia”— and thus its members were recognizably from the same class responsible for abuses, hoarding of grain, and driving up of prices: the very target of the workers' anger. Workers fought to stop the raid and the arrest of Hunt, carrying out a “de-arrest,” to use contemporary parlance. In response, the waiting English military charged the crowd and committed what came to be known as the Peterloo Massacre, in which eleven were killed and four hundred injured. This act of brutal repression had the opposite effect to quelling the protests. Several nights of rioting and unrest in Manchester and surrounding towns followed. A military occupation was required to quell the resistance.

This bloody event created scores of working-class martyrs and provoked an uproar and radicalization. Some sections of the movement began amassing arms in defense, training for military action, and spreading calls for “revenge for Peterloo.” The radical wing of the workers' movement began agitating for an insurrection against the government to occur in November 1819. “Reform cannot be achieved without bloodshed,” one radical publication proclaimed. Although the more conservative leadership called off the armed rising, the political mood can be seen in the report of a police informant who attended a delegate meeting representing 12,500 workers. The spy stated that workers had begun arming themselves to prepare and that there was “much regret on the part of many” that the insurrection had been called off. One speaker railed, “If we had met all over England on that day the business would have been done before now.” An 1820 editorial in the London Times lamented, “Radicalism is every day most alarmingly and portentously increasing; and will, we predict more and more, till, without change, … end is certain.” A relatively new urban ruling class was frightened and still determining how to control the emergence of the powerful new working class.

For the ruling classes, this problem was ultimately solved via the modern police force. Of course, organized repression and violence have been used by the ruling class for as long as there have been class divisions, but modern policing is a very specific kind of repressive institution with a number of historically unique features. Some histories simplify the process of emergence and present it as proceeding from either London or the slave patrols directly to the modern police. A closer reading of history reveals that modern cops came about as the preferred tool through a process of ruling-class experimentation, rooted in different repressive precursors and different institutional inertias, but nonetheless a conscientious process of mutual borrowing and sharing experiences.

 How Controlling the Dalai Lama's Succession Could Backfire

 Tenzin Dorjee and Gyal Lo

In early July, thousands of Tibetans, Buddhists, and other well-wishers gathered in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile, to mark the 90th birthday of Tenzin Gyatso—better known as the 14th Dalai Lama. The de facto pope of Tibetan Buddhism announced that, when he passes away, Tibetan Buddhists will start the traditional process of finding and anointing a reincarnated successor, ensuring that the centuries-old institution of the Dalai Lama will continue. Just months earlier, in a new memoir, the Dalai Lama made clear that any search for a successor must take place in the “free world”—that is, outside China.

These landmark statements made Beijing bristle. The Chinese Communist Party opposes Tibetans choosing their own Dalai Lama and considers the matter an affront to the sovereignty of Beijing, which has ruled Tibet since 1950. Since 2011, the last time the Dalai Lama issued a major statement on the question of succession and reaffirmed his authority to determine whether he will be reincarnated, Beijing has repeatedly publicized its intentions to install a rival Dalai Lama when the current one dies. Before his July birthday announcement, Beijing's interference had even prompted speculation that the Dalai Lama might consider terminating his lineage to prevent China from hijacking the institution and making it bow to the CCP's will.

Devotees of the current Dalai Lama celebrated his recent decision. Chinese leaders, as expected, rejected the announcement and insisted that Beijing holds the power to choose and approve who will be Tibet's next spiritual leader. The CCP assumes that the Dalai Lama's passing will end the Tibetan resistance—or that “the Tibet issue,” as Chinese leaders often phrase it, will be forever resolved in Beijing's favor. The government's logic is simple. For more than six decades, the Dalai Lama—a charismatic and widely revered Nobel laureate—has unified the Tibetan exile community and boosted the Tibetan cause around the world. It is unlikely that future Tibetan leaders will be able to bring the same level of global credibility and internal cohesiveness.

But Beijing's strategy ignores a crucial fact about the Dalai Lama's role in the Tibetan freedom struggle. He has been the single most powerful force restraining violence and radicalization within Tibet for the past 50 years. He has advocated for Sino-Tibetan reconciliation, not greater hostility. Once he leaves the scene, the chances of conflict in and around Tibet are likely to rise. Beijing's attempt to control the Dalai Lama's succession may backfire, destabilizing China's western frontier and provoking the very instability that Chinese leaders hope to avoid.

Historically, the interregnum between two Dalai Lamas has been a period of vulnerability for Tibet. When a Dalai Lama dies, a designated group of senior monks begins searching for a reincarnated successor by consulting oracles, interpreting visions, and testing candidates on their intelligence and spiritual connection to the prior Dalai Lama. Once the true reincarnation is identified––usually a boy no older than six or seven––it can take more than a decade to groom him for leadership. The power vacuum that ensues during this transition process has made the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, susceptible to foreign invasions and internal turmoil. For instance, a sustained power struggle between monks and reformers after the 13th Dalai Lama's death in 1933 weakened the Tibetan state, leaving it ill prepared to resist the arrival of the People's Liberation Army in 1950.

Tibet's vulnerability will be especially pronounced during the next transition period because of the immense global popularity of the current Dalai Lama. Tibetan refugee communities in the Indian subcontinent, in particular, rely on financial assistance from India, the United States, and Europe to sustain their educational institutions, medical services, and cultural establishments. Much of this foreign aid rests on goodwill that the Dalai Lama has personally cultivated in capitals around the world. Beijing is betting that future Tibetan leaders will struggle to replicate the political access and diplomatic successes the current Dalai Lama has achieved.

The Dalai Lama's unique moral authority and charismatic leadership have helped him foster and sustain a pan-Tibetan national identity that supersedes regional and sectarian attachments. The Tibetan diaspora encompasses people from three historical regions and five major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, each of which has its own subcultures, dialects, and histories. The Dalai Lama's nonsectarian vision and unifying presence has helped Tibetans in exile avoid the fate of many diaspora communities that fall apart from internal strife, tribal loyalties, and turf wars.

Because of his outsize presence, China's approach to the Sino-Tibetan conflict has been to wait until the Dalai Lama passes away rather than engage in serious negotiations while he is still alive. Beijing rejected the Dalai Lama's “Five Point Peace Plan” in 1987, which called for turning Tibet into a demilitarized “peace zone,” an end to policies encouraging the mass migration of Chinese citizens of the majority Han ethnicity to Tibet, and stronger protections for Tibetan culture, language, and religious practice. Communist Party leaders dismissed the Tibetan leader's Strasbourg proposal in 1988, in which the Dalai Lama relinquished the demand for full independence and instead proposed genuine autonomy for Tibet under Chinese sovereignty. The CCP also ignored the Dalai Lama's Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy in 2008, which outlined specific constitutional mechanisms to ensure that Tibetans could manage their own internal affairs without challenging China's territorial integrity. Beijing has refused to work with the Dalai Lama because it assumes his death will obviate the need for compromise and permanently resolve the Tibet problem in Beijing's favor.

The insistence on waiting for the Dalai Lama's death, however, may turn out to be a monumental miscalculation by Beijing. Chinese leaders' animus toward the Tibetan leader, whom they have persistently demonized as “a wolf in monk's clothing,” blinds them to the stabilizing role he plays in Sino-Tibetan relations. Although the Dalai Lama has used his influence to mobilize support for Tibetan freedom around the globe, he has often deployed his power to de-escalate conflicts in Tibet at critical moments. While Beijing blames the exiled leader for all unrest in Tibet, the historical evidence shows that the Dalai Lama's personal commitment to nonviolence and dialogue has contained tactical escalation and political radicalization among Tibetans.

The Dalai Lama has been the key figure quelling violence when grassroots dissatisfaction has escalated into episodic uprisings in Tibet. In 1987–88, after protests in Lhasa spiraled into street violence, the Dalai Lama issued a stern warning to his fellow Tibetans to remain peaceful. Then, in 2008, when protests in Lhasa spread nationwide and escalated into vandalism targeting Chinese establishments, the Dalai Lama again intervened. He publicly threatened to resign his position as the leader of the Tibetan government in exile if the violence worsened. In both cases, Tibetans immediately backed off.

The Dalai Lama has also restrained the scope of the Sino-Tibetan conflict by opting to pursue regional autonomy within the People's Republic of China instead of full independence for Tibet. He transformed what was once a maximalist struggle for national liberation into a diplomatic campaign for cultural accommodation. This conciliatory stance, motivated by the search for a middle ground between secession and surrender, came to be known as “the middle way.”



But the middle way is not the only potential approach that Tibetans have considered in their long struggle for self-determination. Pro-independence activists have frequently accused Dharamsala of muzzling their voices to reassure Beijing that the Dalai Lama's calls for autonomy are genuine and not a stepping stone to independence. Critics argue that the Dalai Lama's middle way, which prioritizes dialogue and reconciliation while de-emphasizing mass mobilization, has kept the movement from reaching its full potential and leveraging its explosive strength in the struggle against Beijing. They call for a return to the goal of rangzen—full independence—backed by more aggressive movements built on civil disobedience and boycott campaigns to undermine the Chinese regime domestically and isolate it internationally.

Without the Dalai Lama's stabilizing presence, there is a possibility of more radical protest and violence in Tibet. Since 2009, more than 160 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in public places to protest Chinese rule. One notable example was Gudrup, a 43-year-old Tibetan writer who set himself on fire in 2012 after posting a message online calling for Tibetan independence. The willingness to self-immolate, often in isolation, under heavy surveillance, and with no expectation of immediate results, foreshadows how far Tibetans may be prepared to go to challenge Chinese rule. And without the pacifying force of the Dalai Lama, there will be fewer guardrails to prevent Sino-Tibetan disputes from sliding into intractable ethnic conflict.

Beijing's waiting game also overlooks the sources of resilience within the Tibetan exile community. The Dalai Lama, aware of his people's overreliance on his personal leadership, began democratizing his government in the 1960s. Tibetans, initially resistant to the transfer of the community's political mandate from pontiff to public, slowly but steadily embraced this experiment in democratic self-governance.

Today, the Tibetan government in exile is a vibrant democracy that will outlive this Dalai Lama. Every five years Tibetans around the world go to the polls to elect a new president and parliament in exile. These elections draw high participation rates—77 percent of voters turned out for the 2021 elections—and they are deemed free and fair by independent monitoring networks. The elections are also a source of excitement for Tibetans in Tibet, who covertly follow them via broadcasts on the U.S.-sponsored Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. Unfortunately, and in a boost to Beijing, both stations have been gutted in the first six months of U.S. President Donald Trump's second term.

To be sure, the Tibetan diaspora democracy has its flaws. The parliament is sometimes ensnarled in legislative deadlock, and political candidates sling mud at their opponents during campaigns. But this transnational polity of 150,000 members across five continents has remained stable even as democracy has retreated elsewhere around the globe. The spirit and structure of democracy has laid the basis for cohesion that extends beyond the Dalai Lama's personal presence.

Ultimately, the greatest source of unity and cohesion among Tibetans is the freedom struggle to liberate their homeland from CCP rule. Tibetans see Beijing's refusal to allow a freely chosen successor to the Dalai Lama as an assault on Tibetan Buddhism and a denial of the right to self-determination. No policy wounds Tibetan dignity more profoundly than attempts to co-opt its spiritual and institutional heart. The more that the Chinese government insists on installing a quisling Dalai Lama in Beijing, the more that Tibetans are likely to unite in opposition.

In his memoir released in March, the Dalai Lama reaffirmed the power of the Tibetan exile community that exists beyond Beijing's reach. Tibetan Buddhists outside China can continue to push for the Tibetan cause even as Beijing increases pressure on Tibet. The Dalai Lama wrote: “Given my age, understandably many Tibetans are concerned about what will happen when I am no more. On the political front of our campaign for the freedom of the Tibetan people, we now have a substantial population of Tibetans outside in the free world, so our struggle will go on, no matter what.”

Any blatant move by Beijing to try to control the process of selecting the next Dalai Lama may backfire by driving Tibetan resentment into rage. Whereas China views the Dalai Lama's succession question through the cold lens of realpolitik and statecraft, Tibetans see it through the cosmic prism of devotion and spiritual meaning. For the Chinese, the issue is strategic; for Tibetans, it is existential.

Beijing's belief that force always trumps faith is a blind spot underpinning its failed strategies to win Tibetan hearts and minds. Without a civilizational understanding of Tibetans' relation to the Dalai Lama and his central place in Tibetan Buddhism, Beijing's only tool is coercion. So Beijing has relied on a sophisticated cocktail of repressive policies to suppress potential dissent in Tibet, including placing three out of every four Tibetan students in colonial-style boarding schools and installing mass surveillance systems in schools and places of worship.



Beijing's approach to Tibet parallels its efforts to control minority populations in other restive regions of China. In the northwestern province of Xinjiang, for instance, Beijing has refused to engage moderate voices and has relied on direct repression, including sending a large swath of the population to internment camps, to erase local culture and silence dissent among Uyghurs. In both Tibet and Xinjiang, China's heavy hand has quelled mass protests in the short term—but the overwhelming use of force is just as likely to radicalize the population as it is to promote deference to the CCP.

Unlike other minorities, however, Tibetans have advantages that can offset the power of Beijing's coercive apparatus. Tibetans have a leadership structure and spiritual center that lies beyond China's borders. Both Tibetans living under Chinese rule and those in the global diaspora view the government in exile as their true representatives. Even if Beijing attempts to install its own Dalai Lama, the global diaspora of Tibetans—and the millions of others who see the Dalai Lama as inspiration and spiritual guide—will continue to look to Dharamsala as the legitimate seat of Tibetan Buddhism and the 15th Dalai Lama.

It is no surprise that Beijing fears Tibetans led by the Dalai Lama: there are few groups more threatening to an authoritarian regime than national movements for self-determination that the regime cannot control and that are supported by a diaspora it cannot silence. If Beijing continues to insist on a hard-line approach to the Dalai Lama's succession, global leaders can support Tibetan resistance efforts by amplifying the international consequences to China through economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and public support for pushing back against further cultural and religious erasure. Such actions may not change Beijing's attitude in the near term, but they will keep alive the legacy of the Dalai Lama and bolster Tibetans' ongoing struggle for self-determination.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

MIREYA SOLÍS is Director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies and Senior Fellow and Philip Knight Chair in Japan Studies at the Brookings Institution. She is the author of Japan's Quiet Leadership: Reshaping the Indo-Pacific.

 What a Divided Japan Means for Asia and the World

 Mireya Solís

Over the past decade, as much of the world has become more chaotic and succumbed to nationalism, protectionism, and illiberalism, Japan has been a force for maintaining the stability of the international order. Tokyo has shored up its rules-based economic partnerships; intensified security cooperation with like-minded countries, such as Australia, India, and the Philippines; and “de-risked” from China while maintaining its commitment to global trade. Japan has been able to play this stabilizing role because it has enjoyed internal social and political cohesion and benefited from strong leadership, most notably during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's second term, which lasted from 2012 to 2020.

Japan's political center, however, seems to be weakening. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan for nearly seven uninterrupted decades, suffered bruising losses in the most recent elections for both chambers of the national legislature—the Lower House last fall and the Upper House this summer—as did its coalition partner, Komeito. For the first time, Japan's ruling coalition is clinging to minority positions in both chambers. And a populist far-right party, Sanseito, won 14 seats in the Upper House elections—up from one in 2022—on an anti-foreigner platform.

The retreat of the political establishment and surging support for an antiglobalist party are symptoms of an even more pressing domestic problem in Japan: the failure of mainstream parties to generate strong leaders. Power is fragmented because the LDP is internally divided, its coalition partner is losing ground, and the opposition is too disjointed to mount an effective challenge. This lack of leadership is making it harder for Japan to respond to the tectonic geopolitical realignments it faces, none more pressing than the United States' extractive approach to the global economy and its alliances.

Japan's ruling parties are in a crisis because they've failed to adapt to long-term structural changes in the country. The LDP has struggled with declining populations in its key constituencies and the proliferation of independent voters. The party has also had a hard time eliminating corruption. The LDP, for example, suffered a major setback in 2023, when it was revealed that some of its factions—informal groups of parliamentarians under the wing of a senior party figure—failed to report revenue from fundraisers, instead kicking back the money to largely unmonitored slush funds. The LDP adopted some internal transparency and accountability measures to address public outrage, but these did not restore faith in the party. Crucially, the slush fund scandal led the LDP to dismantle its factional system, long considered the root of undue influence of money on politics but which for decades had structured intraparty competition over funds and appointments. Ultimately, the party failed to cleanse its image and gave up its primary means of sorting internal conflicts and maintaining party cohesion. Thus, the party lost public trust and found itself more divided.

Komeito, the LDP's coalition partner and the political arm of Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist religious organization, has also declined. Komeito hasn't been able to win as many votes as it used to because Soka Gakkai's membership has stagnated, its charismatic leader died, and as the scholar Levi McLaughlin points out, its younger cohorts have become less interested in political campaigning. In this summer's Upper House election, Komeito won 5.2 million votes, almost one million fewer than it did in 2022.

The confluence of new political pressures in post-pandemic Japan, namely inflation, a surge in immigration, and the rise of new forms of media, has shaken politics. After decades of deflation, the cost of living has steeply increased, becoming the number one issue for most voters, whose real wages are being eaten away by a depreciating yen and a 3.7 percent inflation rate. Inflation has also brought out zero-sum thinking. Consumers and producers now view their interests as more directly in conflict. The government's initiative to lower rice prices to court support from urban voters on the eve of the 2025 Upper House election, for example, caused farmers to feel betrayed. As a result, the LDP lost heavily in rice-producing regions.

The party especially suffered because of its stance on the consumption tax. Whereas opposition parties favored cutting or abolishing it, the ruling coalition of the LDP and Komeito—concerned that such a move would spook financial markets—instead offered one-time cash payments of roughly $140 per person to defray the cost of living. To many Japanese people, such a meager handout in the face of higher prices for most everyday goods suggested that the LDP was out of touch.

Moreover, established parties are struggling to compete with upstart ones that can take advantage of social media. According to an exit poll by Jiji Press, a news agency, 47 percent of respondents used social media to guide their vote in the 2025 election. Internet-savvy parties, such as the Democratic Party for the People and Sanseito, outperformed the rest online.

Sanseito was born on YouTube in 2020 with a message trafficking in vaccine conspiracies. The party has gone on to develop an alternative information ecosystem that can yield committed volunteers and a crop of potential candidates, according to the political scientists Robert Fahey and Romeo Marcantuoni. Sanseito's leader, Sohei Kamiya, sees U.S. President Donald Trump as a role model and advocates putting “Japanese first.” Sanseito, and the smaller Conservative Party, blame foreigners for what ails the nation: wage suppression (from an influx of foreign workers), rampant tourism, rising land prices (as rich foreigners snatch properties), crime, and loss of a national identity.

Sanseito has capitalized on the growing pains stemming from a surge in Japan's foreign population. Of the 3.7 million foreign residents in Japan today, roughly one million moved to the country in the past three years. In 2021, when the country imposed strict border controls during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan received just 250,000 visitors, compared with nearly 37 million in 2024. Sanseito has also taken advantage of the political vacuum left by the tragic assassination of Abe in 2022 to attract young conservative voters. And its message has resonated with the so-called ice-age generation, a cohort of people in their 40s and 50s who joined the workforce after the burst of the bubble economy in the early 1990s and feel left behind economically.



But as the party has risen to national prominence, it has also made costly mistakes. On the eve of the Upper House election, a Sanseito candidate gave an interview to Russian state media, putting the spotlight on Kamiya's sympathy for Moscow. Kamiya doubled down by saying the United States drove Russia to invade Ukraine, causing a media firestorm that prompted some Japanese politicians to urge an investigation into potential election interference by Russia.

The trends epitomized by this summer's Upper House election—disaffected voters rallying around antiglobalism, far-right parties clawing their way up the political system, and social media changing campaign dynamics and raising the specter of misinformation—could become normal in Japan, as they have in many Western countries. But it is just as likely that the current moment represents the peak of Sanseito's influence. After all, over the decades many upstart parties have challenged LDP rule only to peter out soon after. And the sudden surge in Sanseito's popularity suggests that its support came more from protest votes than permanent realignment among voters. Moreover, much of what the party advocates for, including rejecting gender equality, paring down individual freedoms in the constitution, reverting to the prewar educational system, and adhering to outright historical revisionism, has not gone mainstream.

The biggest challenge to governance in Japan is not far-right populism but power dispersion and the gridlock that comes with it. The LDP, still the largest party in both the Upper and Lower Houses of the legislature, is deeply divided. The chances are low that the party can find a strong, unifying leader who can rescue the LDP brand. Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru, of the LDP, has defied calls to step down after his coalition received a shellacking in three consecutive elections under his watch. The rift over whether Ishiba should stay or go has prevented the party from agreeing on a strategy to rebuild itself.

Because the ruling coalition now lacks a majority in both chambers, it is vulnerable to a vote of no confidence and has to rely on other parties to pass legislation. Meanwhile, opposition parties remain too fragmented to form an alternative coalition and, therefore, cannot name a new prime minister. Without a clear power center in the Japanese legislature, it will be harder to reform taxes and social security, overhaul political funding rules, and relieve the pain of inflation and U.S. tariffs. In the near future, no party or coalition seems able to produce a strong leader.

Without strong leadership, Japan is ill equipped to meet the singular domestic and international challenges of the current moment. Key among these is Tokyo's need to redefine its relationship with the United States as Trump upends the global trading system, urges allies to take on a greater role in their own defense, and contemplates changes to the footprint of U.S. troops in Asia.

In July, for example, the United States and Japan signed a trade deal that placed 15 percent tariffs on Japanese goods, which is lower than the rate Japan was already paying on car exports and lower than the rate Trump had threatened to use. It also expanded market access for U.S. rice and committed Japan to purchasing liquefied natural gas and agricultural products from the United States.

The proposed trade deal includes numerous areas in which the two sides seem to differ in interpretation, which will likely lead to more political friction and shows that Japan's government must still scramble to tariff-proof its economy. As part of the deal, Japan agreed to invest $550 billion into the United States for projects related to economic security. According to the White House, Japan will transfer the money into investment funds that will be allocated by Trump, with the United States retaining 90 percent of the profits. Tokyo, however, has said that the vast majority of the money would come from loans and loan guarantees, and that the nine-to-one profit ratio holds for only a sliver of the total amount. Neither does the promised relief on auto tariffs appear guaranteed: the White House fact sheet on the deal makes no mention of a lower 15 percent tariff for cars. With weak leadership, Japan will struggle to navigate the uncertainty emanating from Washington.

Tokyo's leadership crisis is of great consequence not only to Japan but also to the world. Macroeconomic management might become less sound as the LDP is forced to compromise with a greater number of parties on taxes and budgets. An inward-looking Japan would fail to attract global talent and fix labor shortages, dimming economic prospects. And without a strong political center, Japan will be less able to resist Chinese domination of Asia or sustain international cooperation on free economic exchange.

Japan's contributions to a stable international order are more valuable than ever as the United States becomes increasingly protectionist and mercurial. To fix Japan's leadership vacuum, mainstream parties must restore voters' trust through meaningful political reform, articulate a compelling strategy to address the shift from a deflationary to an inflationary economy, bridge generational divides in the electorate, and avoid pandering to the far-right as it peddles the dubious benefits of a closed Japan. Only by getting its own house in order can Japan sustain its essential role as a global force for stability.

            America's unions have had much to celebrate on recent Labor Days. Not this year.
    


            President Donald Trump is trying to strip collective bargaining rights from approximately one million unionized federal workers. Just last week, he signed an executive order affecting union workers at federal agencies, including the National Weather Service and NASA, citing national security concerns. Earlier this year a similar order targeted unions at, among others, the departments of state, defense, justice and health and human services.
    


            And because of the importance of public sector unions to the broader US labor movement, Trump's moves could deal a massive blow to the union momentum that had been growing under President Joe Biden.
    


            “This is the single largest attack on the labor movement in our history,” Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, told CNN in an interview Friday. She said the labor federation fears what is going on with federal workers will expand to corporate America.
    


            “An attack on one sector ripples over to another sector,” she said. “We know the playbook. And, you know, corporations are watching.”
    


            Nearly half of union members nationwide work for different levels of government, not businesses. And the public sector is more unionized than the private sector – about 19% of civilian federal workers outside of the Postal Service belong to a union, compared to only 6% of workers in the private sector.
    


            Labor leaders are concerned the Trump administration's attack on federal workers and their unions will not only threaten labor's political influence, but also their ability organize and win contract gains across all types of American employers.
    


            “I think that what he's doing, he is using the federal sector as a test (case), right?” Everett Kelley, president of American Federation of Government Employees, told CNN. “(It's a) nod to the private sector, saying, ‘Okay, you go ahead and do the same thing. You know, we got your back.' I think whether it's private sector or public sector, you're going to see more and more of it.”
    


            For years, unions struggled as their economic and political clout waned. Only 10% of US workers now belong to unions, down from 20% in 1983.
    


            But concerns over working conditions during the pandemic increased grassroots support for unions. And a strong job market in the years that followed, with more job openings than job seekers at times, helped embolden workers who might have been nervous otherwise about organizing efforts.
    


            That led to a number of high-profile unionizations at large employers such as Amazon, Starbucks, Apple and Volkswagen's US factory, breathing new life into the union movement.
    


            While many of these new unions are still fighting for their first contracts, workers did win their first agreement at an Apple store in 2024. 



            More importantly, some established unions won large contract gains following major strikes over the past few years at Boeing, the East Coast ports, the Big Three Detroit automakers and the nation's movie and television studios. Even just the threat of a strike scored big contracts at UPS, Costco and many airlines.
    


            Biden was arguably the most pro-union president ever, becoming the first to join a picket line during the auto strike in 2023. His appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees labor relations at most US businesses, issued a number of pro-union decisions while he was in office.
    


            But in 2024, 45% of union households voted for Trump, according to CNN exit polls. Trump has said he supports union members, framing tariffs as a way to force companies to return union jobs back to America from overseas.
    


            However, his policies have been anything but pro-union.
    


            Shortly after taking office in January, the president fired an NLRB member in an unprecedented move, saying she was not doing enough to support employers.
    


            Then in March, Trump signed an executive order stating that the federal government would no longer recognizing the right of wide swaths of federal employees to collective bargaining.
    


            The order not only stripped workers of union protections but also stopped them from automatically deducting union dues from their paychecks. The AFGE has already been forced to cut about a third of its staff due to the financial hit.
    


            Trump has made it clear he's taking this action in part to weaken federal unions, who have “declared war on President Trump's agenda” and “block Trump policies,” according to a White House fact sheet issued at that time.
    


            “President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests,” it said.
    


            Trump is the not the first president elected with blue collar union support to take action against a federal union.
    


            In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fired the nation's air traffic controllers when their union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), went on strike. He replaced them with new hires.
    


            Until that time, the hiring of replacement workers during strikes, while legal, was rare. But after PATCO, the practice became common practice by American businesses and was a major factor in the weakening of unions overall.
    


            The concern now is that, like the PATCO firings by Reagan, businesses that were already battling unions will pattern themselves after the federal government and take more aggressive steps. But Shuler said the consequences of this latest attack could be far worse for the movement.
    


            “People like to point back to PATCO, and that was a seminal moment. But this dwarfs PATCO,” she said. “If you think about canceling collective bargaining rights for nearly a million people with the stroke of a pen, you know this a problem for the whole movement.”
    


            Federal unions have filed numerous lawsuits contesting Trump's actions. So far, the rulings have been mixed, and no case has yet reached a final conclusion. The union officials say they continue to fight and predict they'll prevail.
    


            And union officials say they're ready to take the fight to the private sector, too, if needed.
    


            If public and private employers “think, ‘It's open season on unions,' they should think again,” said Matt Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which represents a large number of civilian workers in the Defense Department. “Workers in this country are angry. The unions are not going anywhere. We're becoming stronger.”

            The US State Department has instructed its diplomats to refuse most visas for Palestinian passport holders, whether they live in the West Bank, Gaza, or overseas, according to a cable seen by CNN.
    


            The internal message, dated August 18 and signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, told all embassies and consulates to refuse nonimmigrant visas to “all otherwise eligible Palestinian Authority passport holders” who are using that passport to apply for a visa. The posts were instructed to do so “effective immediately.”
    


            Nonimmigrant visas include a wide variety of visas, including those for students, professors, tourists, businesspeople and those seeking medical treatment.
    


            The sweeping refusal policy, first reported by the New York Times, is among a slew of actions taken by the Trump administration to block Palestinians from coming to the United States.
    


            On August 16, the State Department said that “all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza” were suspended pending a review. On Friday, the agency announced it was revoking and denying visas for members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian Authority (PA), including PA President Mahmoud Abbas, ahead of the United Nations General Assembly.
    


            The restrictions come as a number of countries prepare to recognize a Palestinian state and the war in Gaza continues to rage.
    


            In the diplomatic cable, the State Department said it was taking the action “to ensure that such applications have undergone necessary vetting and screening protocols to ensure the applicant's identity and eligibility for a visa under U.S. law.”
    


            “The Trump administration is taking concrete steps in compliance with U.S. law and our national security in regards to announced visa restrictions and revocations for PA passport holders,” a State Department spokesperson said. “Every visa decision is a national security decision, and the State Department is vetting and adjudicating visa decisions for PA passport holders accordingly.”
    


            According to the cable, the refusal policy does not apply to Palestinians applying for immigrant visas or those applying for nonimmigrant visas using a different passport.
    


            “This guidance does include visa applicants for diplomatic or official type visas and for individuals engaging in diplomatic and official travel purposes applying with Palestinian Authority passports,” it said. “While the Department has determined that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a competent authority for passport issuing purposes … the United States does NOT recognize the PA as a ‘foreign government.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","More than a dozen universities have been targeted by false active shooter reports. It may take a while to find these swatters","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/01/us/swatter-investigation-active-shooter-hoaxes-universities","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            Over the past 10 days, more than a dozen college campuses have been the target of the dangerous criminal hoax known as swatting, with law enforcement lured to a location in response to a false report of a horrific crime.
    


            Active shooter alerts at Villanova University in Pennsylvania and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga sent panicked students preparing for the new school year scrambling for cover as first responders swarmed campuses on August 21. In both cases, dispatchers heard what sounded like gunshots in the background of the calls — lending a disturbing realism.
    


            Since then, campuses across the country have received similar hoax calls, including Texas Tech University, Iowa State University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Northern Arizona University.
    


            Law enforcement faces the challenge of sorting fact from fiction in real time as swatters employ tools like AI to bolster their hoax in a hypersensitive climate surrounding mass shootings. These hoaxes tax the resources of police departments and put an unquantifiable mental strain on the victims, ratcheting up the importance of putting a stop to them.
    


A wave of active shooter hoaxes at universities brings panic and turmoil to the start of the school year



            But catching those responsible for making these calls can sometimes take months, or longer, as many of them originate from overseas, using Voice over Internet Protocol services, which further complicate investigations and prolong suspect identification efforts.
    


            In response, the FBI has prioritized providing resources and education, creating a nationwide task force to help local law enforcement agencies across the country coordinate efforts as they aim to catch the swatters.
    


            “These aren't just somebody down the street who makes a call because they don't want to go to gym class or take a test in English,” Katherine Schweit, a retired FBI executive, told CNN on Wednesday. “In many cases, we have just as likely a person who is making a phone call who might be across the world, on the other side of the world, or in another country, who is being paid to do harassing phone calls to places.”
    


            “So the calls can come from anywhere, and the motivation can be from anywhere,” said Schweit, who once led the FBI's active shooter response program. “So how do we actually collect that and prevent it? It's a challenge.”
    


            In 2023, the FBI, at the request of their law enforcement partners, created the National Common Operational Picture – Virtual Command Center (NCOP-VCC) to gather details on swatting incidents across the country. The Virtual Command Center operates as a web-based information sharing system that provides real-time situational awareness “for critical and non-critical incident management” in partnership with state and local authorities, according to the agency.
    


            The initiative allows police and intelligence fusion centers to share details of swatting incidents taking place within their jurisdictions, providing authorities nationwide with a “common operating picture” regarding the nature of the threat, and can assist in identifying whether the same perpetrator is responsible for multiple incidents.
    


            “If a law enforcement agency or federal, state, local, tribal agency gets information from school or from a business, from a university, they can share that information immediately into databases so that we can see commonalities, and that helps us,” Schweit said.
    


            Hundreds of law enforcement agencies have submitted thousands of incidents to the NCOP-VCC, according to the FBI.
    


            “Having nationwide data in a centralized location helps law enforcement track possible trends, better understand various tactics, and offers increased collaboration between agencies to mitigate criminal activities associated with swatting,” the FBI said.
    


            “Knowingly providing false information to emergency service agencies about a possible threat to life drains law enforcement resources, costs thousands of dollars, and, most importantly, puts innocent people at risk. We work closely with our law enforcement partners to determine their credibility, share information, and take appropriate investigative action,” the agency added.
    


Several relevant federal criminal statutes enable the prosecution of swatting incidents, including laws outlawing injuring or kidnapping threats and bomb threats.
    


            The advance of technology, such as Voice over Internet Protocol services, makes it much more difficult to trace phone calls and has made these hoaxes more elaborate and harder to track, John DeCarlo, former police chief of Branford, Connecticut, and a professor of criminology at the University of New Haven, told CNN.
    


            Swatters often use online call “spoofing” services that in turn use several VoIP accounts, which let the swatter make phone calls using the internet. The VoIP accounts are also often created and accessed using a variety of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxy services, which allow users to “conceal their IP address by redirecting internet traffic through intermediary machines,” according to a criminal complaint in one 2017 case.
    


            Additionally, AI has made it easier than ever to fake someone's voice for a hoax phone call, DeCarlo said.
    


            “It's now easy and quick to clone someone's voice using AI tools, which now require less than 15 seconds of someone's voice to create a believable voice clone,” Rachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security, a firm that trains companies' employees to defend against such attacks, told CNN.
    


            “What's most concerning is that with AI-powered clones, seeing – or hearing – is no longer believing, and even trained professionals can be fooled, especially when a familiar voice makes an urgent request,” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at cybersecurity firm McAfee, told CNN. “It's also why we need smarter tools to help people tell what's real and what's not. We can't rely on our own instincts anymore.”
    


            Schweit, the retired FBI executive, said trade-offs often have to be made when balancing the amount of investigative effort put into locating hoax callers. “It takes investigative work and that's a trade-off on how much work do we need to put in… . What is this costing versus the other higher priority matters that we have?” she explained.
    


            Although difficult to investigate, law enforcement has found some success catching those responsible, with US officials often working with international partners to arrest overseas suspects.
    


            Some high-profile swatters have faced legal consequences, including two men from Serbia and Romania who prosecutors say made hundreds of fake calls to US officials, and three men involved in the swatting of an unrelated man in Wichita, Kansas, whom police fatally shot when they arrived.
    


            A California teen who pleaded guilty to making hundreds of swatting calls last year – including to a Florida mosque – was sentenced this year to four years in prison, federal prosecutors said. The teen had become a “serial swatter for both profit and recreation,” according to the FBI, placing posts on social media advertising his services and swatting-for-a-fee structure.
    


            In a case dating back to 2017, a dual American-Israeli citizen used accounts created at a company that provided online call “spoofing” services to make more than 200 threats to Jewish institutions – while physically in Israel, according to the criminal complaint in the case. He was arrested in Israel and reportedly was convicted under Israeli law and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
    


            Schweit said the likelihood of catching those responsible for the latest swatting incidents depends on the sophistication of the effort and the distance of the individual.
    


            “If somebody is calling from overseas and they're calling from a phone bank of people who are paid, you know, a few pennies to harass people in the United States as part of a more complicated political operative operation in their country - we're not going to catch those people,” she said. “But if it's somebody who's local and they're making phone calls, this is where technology does help us.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — John Hutton starts every White House portrait with an egg-shaped frame.

He adds a nose, mouth, eyes and eyebrows, then outlines the face, guided by a series of horizontal and vertical lines through the oval. Hair comes next, followed by the neck and shoulders to add definition and make his paper renderings look like President George Washington or first lady Jacqueline Kennedy — or any of the other presidents and first ladies, including Donald Trump and Melania Trump.

Hutton, a North Carolina art history professor who draws in his spare time, outlined his four-step technique in a new book, “How to Draw the Presidents & First Ladies,” published in July by the White House Historical Association. He demonstrated it for The Associated Press.

Anyone can learn to draw by following patterns, said Hutton, who created patterns of every president and first lady. One teaching method is based on an egg-shaped frame divided into thirds. Hutton took it a step further. 

“My version of it is that we have four steps,” he said. “We draw the facial features first. We draw the outline of the face second. We draw the hair, or sometimes a bonnet for some of the first ladies in the old days, in step three, and then we draw the neck and shoulders a little bit to give the face some place to go.”

“A lot of people think they can't draw because they don't know where to get started,” Hutton said. “So what I've done is I created a series of line patterns for each portrait, and then I have you copy the line pattern I create for each facial feature, for the shape of the face and so forth, and if you copy the shapes right, you're halfway there.”




If the shapes are right and correctly placed, “you've got a really good portrait,” he said.

An AP reporter used Hutton's patterns and four steps to draw portraits of Washington and Jacqueline Kennedy that looked reasonably like them after the first try. 

The easiest presidents and first ladies to draw are the most recognizable ones and those with strong features “because people recognize that they've done a good job more quickly than they would if we were doing Franklin Pierce,” Hutton said. “Nobody knows who he is.” 

Those with small features are the hardest to draw, he said.

Hutton, 64, has taught art history for more than 30 years at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he lives with his wife, Kathleen, also an artist. 

He studied at Princeton, Harvard and the prestigious Courtauld Institute of Art at the University of London, and is the illustrator of a series of award-winning children's books published by the White House Historical Association. Hutton also gives lessons to children during the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. 

He has been drawing since he was 3 and now spends his free time drawing people and landscapes. Hutton started drawing presidents and first ladies when he illustrated an alphabet book for the historical association. His latest book is an update of an earlier one about drawing presidents.

Helicopters brought aid to Afghanistan's Kunar province on Monday after a strong earthquake devastated the area, killing 800 and injuring thousands more. Nearby, doctors treated people who were injured in the quake.

A strong earthquake in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border killed at least 610 people and injured 1,300, officials said. The 6.0 magnitude quake late Sunday hit towns in the province of Kunar, near the city of Jalalabad in neighboring Nangarhar province, destroying numerous villages and causing extensive damage.

Wounded people were being evacuated from Afghanistan's Kunar province after a 6.0 magnitude quake late Sunday hit a series of towns in the area. The quake in the country's east has killed at least 610 people and injured 1,300, a spokesman for the Taliban government said Monday.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Desperate Afghans clawed through rubble in search of missing loved ones after a strong earthquake killed some 800 people and injured more than 2,500 in eastern Afghanistan, according to figures provided Monday by the Taliban government.




The 6.0 magnitude quake late Sunday hit towns in the province of Kunar, near the city of Jalalabad in neighboring Nangarhar province, causing extensive damage. 

One resident in Nurgal district, one of the worst-affected areas in Kunar, said nearly the entire village was destroyed.

“Children are under the rubble. The elderly are under the rubble. Young people are under the rubble,” said the villager, who did not give his name.

“We need help here,” he pleaded. “We need people to come here and join us. Let us pull out the people who are buried. There is no one who can come and remove dead bodies from under the rubble.”

The quake hit just before midnight and was centered 27 kilometers (17 miles) east-northeast of Jalalabad at a depth of 8 kilometers (5 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said. Shallower quakes tend to cause more damage. Several aftershocks followed.

Footage showed rescuers taking injured people on stretchers from collapsed buildings and into helicopters as people frantically dug through rubble with their hands.

The Taliban government's chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, told a press conference on Monday that the death toll had risen to at least 800 with more than 2,500 injured. He said most of the casualties were in Kunar.

The quake was felt in parts of Pakistan, including the capital Islamabad. There were no reports of casualties or damage.

Eastern Afghanistan is mountainous, with remote areas and the quake has worsened communications. Blocked roads are forcing aid workers to walk four or five hours to reach survivors. Dozens of flights have operated in and out of Nangarhar Airport, transporting the injured to hospitals.

Buildings in Afghanistan tend to be low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and outlying areas made from mud bricks and wood. Many are poorly built.

Sadiqullah, who lives in the Maza Dara area of Nurgal, said he was woken by a deep boom that sounded like a storm approaching. Like many Afghans, he uses only one name.

He ran to where his children were sleeping and rescued three of them. He was about to return to grab the rest of his family when the room fell on top of him.

“I was half-buried and unable to get out,” he told The Associated Press by phone from Nangarhar Hospital. “My wife and two sons are dead, and my father is injured and in hospital with me. We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.”

It felt like the whole mountain was shaking, he said.

Rescue operations were underway and medical teams from Kunar, Nangarhar and the capital, Kabul, have arrived in the area, said Sharafat Zaman, a health ministry spokesman.

Zaman said many areas had not been able to report casualty figures and that “the numbers were expected to change” as deaths and injuries are reported. 

The chief spokesman, Mujahid, said helicopters had reached some areas but road travel was difficult. “There are some villages where the injured and dead haven't been recovered from the rubble, so that's why the numbers may increase,” he told journalists.

Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said the earthquake intensified existing humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan and urged international donors to support relief efforts.

“This adds death and destruction to other challenges including drought and the forced return of millions of Afghans from neighbouring countries,” Grandi wrote on X. “Hopefully the donor community will not hesitate to support relief efforts.”

Entire roads and communities have been cut off from accessing nearby towns or hospitals and 2,000 casualties were reported within the first 12 hours, said Sherine Ibrahim, the country director for the aid agency.

“Although we have been able to act fast, we are profoundly fearful for the additional strain this will have on the overall humanitarian response in Afghanistan,” said Ibrahim. "" Global funding cuts have dramatically hampered our ability to respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis.”

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement that immediate needs include search and rescue support, emergency healthcare and medical supplies, food, clean water, and restoring road access to reach isolated communities.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by events in Afghanistan. “Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. We are ready to extend all possible support in this regard,” he said on X.

Pakistan has expelled tens of thousands of Afghans in the past year, many of them living in the country for decades as refugees. At least 1.2 million Afghans have been forced to return from Iran and Pakistan so far this year, according to a June report by UNHCR.

A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated at least 4,000 people perished in that quake. 

The U.N. gave a lower death toll of about 1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory.

Sunday's latest earthquake was likely to “dwarf the scale of the humanitarian needs” caused by the disaster of 2023, according to the International Rescue Committee.

Deep in the Swedish forest, where reindeer roam and scientists ski in winter, lies one of Europe's hopes for a spaceport that can ultimately compete with the United States, China and Russia. For decades, Europe has relied upon the U.S. for its security among the stars. But the Trump administration's “America First” policies, plus a commercial market that's growing exponentially, has prompted Europeans to rethink their approach.

KIRUNA, Sweden (AP) — Deep in the Swedish forest, where reindeer roam and scientists ski in winter, lies one of Europe's hopes for a spaceport that can ultimately compete with the United States, China and Russia.

For decades, Europe has relied upon the U.S. for its security among the stars. But the Trump administration's “America First” policies, plus a commercial market that's growing exponentially, has prompted Europeans to rethink their approach.

The state-owned Esrange Space Center in Kiruna, Sweden, is among the sites building out orbital rocket programs to allow Europe to advance in the global space race and launch satellites from the continent's mainland.

“The gap is significant,” said Hermann Ludwig Moeller, director of the European Space Policy Institute. “I would argue that Europe, to be anywhere relevant in the next five to 10 years, needs to at least double its investment in space. And saying that it would double doesn't mean that it would catch up by the same factor, because you can expect that other regions will also continue to step up.”




Currently, Europe's only space base capable of launching rockets and satellites into orbit is in sparsely populated French Guiana, an overseas department of France in South America that's roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of the equator. Otherwise, Europe borrows NASA's Cape Canaveral in Florida.

In March, Isar Aerospace launched the first test flight of its orbital launch vehicle from the Andøya Spaceport, another site that's part of Europe's efforts to expand its presence in space, on an island in northern Norway. 

While the rocket crashed into the sea 30 seconds after liftoff, the private German aerospace company had largely ruled out the possibility of the rocket reaching orbit on its first complete flight and deemed the short journey a success.

Moeller believes a successful orbital launch from continental Europe could occur within the next year, though he won't guess where. 

Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom also are among the countries seeking to be part of Europe's spaceport portfolio.

Elsewhere on Earth, India — active in space research since the 1960s — has launched satellites for itself and other countries and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014. After a failed attempt to land on the moon in 2019, India became the first country to land a spacecraft near the moon's south pole in 2023 in a historic voyage to uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold reserves of frozen water. The mission was dubbed a technological triumph for the world's most populous nation.

New Zealand also has a growing and active launch industry, and Australia is working to develop its commercial space industry.

Esrange and Andøya date back to the 1960s and much of their space-bound appeal stems from their far-north geography on Earth. 

Esrange, for example, is owned and operated by the Swedish Space Corporation and based more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. The space center's 30-plus antennas can more easily communicate with satellites orbiting the North Pole compared to infrastructure that's near the equator.

Most important, perhaps, is its size. The base itself encompasses 6 square kilometers (2.3 square miles), where experts conduct Martian lander parachute tests, suborbital rocket launches and stratospheric balloon experiments.

But its key selling point is Esrange's rocket landing zone: 5,200 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) of birch, pine and spruce trees spread north across the Swedish tundra, nearly to the Norwegian and Finnish borders.

The territory is uninhabited besides the Sami Indigenous reindeer herders who sometimes pass through, and the space center alerts them before any tests occur. The emptiness of the landscape allows scientists to launch and easily recover material for further study.

“The rocket motor will just fall freely into the ground, which means that you need to see to it that no people are in the area,” Mattias Abrahamsson, business development director for the science division at Esrange, said during a recent tour. “We have to see to it that it's not more dangerous to be in that area, if you want to pick berries or hunt or fish or anything like that, than if you're in a street in New York or in Stockholm or anywhere.”

Andøya's remote location on a Norwegian island, meanwhile, means rockets can safely crash down into the sea without risking harm to humans. 

During his first week in office earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his $175 billion “Golden Dome” missile defense system to protect America from long-range missiles.

If successful, it would mark the first time the U.S. would place weapons in space that are meant to destroy ground-based missiles within seconds of launch. It follows China's 2021 groundbreaking launch of a warhead system that went into orbit before reentering Earth's atmosphere.

Europe currently, however, does not have the same capacities and has for decades banked on the U.S. for its security and defense. But U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during a speech in February at the Munich Security Conference, warned Europe against continuing to rely upon America and urged officials to “step up in a big way” to provide for the defense of the continent.

Vance's remarks, as well as concerns over former Trump ally and tech billionaire Elon Musk's politics potentially impacting Ukraine's dependence on his Starlink satellite system in its war with Russia, alarmed European leaders. 

It became increasingly clear to them that the continent must have its own space ecosystem, with its “own capabilities to really be able to react with (its) own means and under (its) own control,” Moeller said.

Beyond the space race between global superpowers, commercial companies are taking to the skies. Musk's SpaceX and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin, among others, have proven that space isn't limited to governmental agencies like NASA, and that there's a lot of money to be made in the solar system.

The number of satellites in space is expected to skyrocket in the next five years. And the Swedish Space Corporation, with its burgeoning orbital launch and rocket test division at Esrange, is among those seeking to capitalize on those dollars. 

Ulrika Unell, the division's president, said satellites in space are crucial to life on Earth. She wants everyone, beyond astronauts and scientists, to consider how they are impacted by what's orbiting hundreds of kilometers (miles) above the globe. 

“I would ask them to think about, when they go around with their mobiles and they use all this data every day: Where does it come from? How is it gathered?” she said. “So space is more and more an asset for the whole society.”

A spokesperson for Rudy Giuliani says the former New York City mayor is recovering from a fractured vertebrae and other injuries following a car crash in New Hampshire. Giuliani's head of security Michael Ragusa said Sunday that Giuliani's rental car was struck from behind on a highway the night before.

Rudy Giuliani is recovering from a fractured vertebra and other injuries following a car crash in New Hampshire in which he was a passenger, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor said Sunday.

Giuliani was being driven in a rented Ford Bronco by his spokesperson Ted Goodman when their vehicle was struck from behind by a Honda HR-V driven by a 19-year-old woman late Saturday evening, New Hampshire State Police said in a statement. 

Troopers witnessed the crash, which caused both vehicles to hit the highway median and left them “heavily damaged,” state police said. Goodman and the 19-year-old suffered “non-life-threatening injuries” and were taken to hospitals for treatment, the agency added.

State police said they are investigating the crash and no charges have been filed. 

Giuliani, 81, was taken to a nearby trauma center and was being treated for a fractured thoracic vertebra, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg, according to a statement posted on X by Michael Ragusa, Giuliani's head of security.

Giuliani “sustained injuries but is in good spirits and recovering tremendously,” Ragusa said, adding: “This was not a targeted attack.”

Prior to the accident, Giuliani had been “flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident” and contacted police assistance on her behalf, Ragusa said. After police arrived, Giuliani continued on his way and his vehicle was hit shortly after pulling onto the highway in a crash that was “entirely unrelated” to the domestic violence incident, Ragusa told The Associated Press in an emailed statement.

State police said troopers were investigating a domestic violence report on the southbound Interstate 93 highway shortly before 10 p.m. and observed the crash, which occurred on the northbound lanes. Troopers and fire personnel quickly crossed to provide help.




New Hampshire State Police declined to comment on whether Giuliani had contacted the agency regarding the account of a domestic violence incident.

Goodman did not respond to requests for comment and Giuliani's team did not provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding the crash.

“Thank you to all the people that have reached out since learning the news about my Father,” Andrew Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani's son, wrote in a post on X. “Your prayers mean the world.”

The crash follows some rocky years for the onetime Republican presidential candidate, who was dubbed “America's mayor” in light of his leadership in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. 

Giuliani later became President Donald Trump's personal attorney for a time and a vocal proponent of Trump's allegations of fraud in the 2020 election, won by Democrat Joe Biden. Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits claiming fraud, and numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error.

Two former Georgia elections workers later won a $148 million defamation judgment against Giuliani. As they sought to collect the judgment, the former federal prosecutor was found in contempt of court and faced a trial this winter over the ownership of some of his assets. He ultimately struck a deal that let him keep his homes and various belongings, including prized World Series rings, in exchange for unspecified compensation and a promise to stop speaking ill of the ex-election workers. ____

HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) — With migrant children waiting on tarmacs to be sent to their native Guatemala, a federal judge Sunday temporarily blocked the flights, siding with attorneys for the children who said the government was breaking laws and sending their clients to potential peril.

The extraordinary drama played out overnight on a holiday weekend and vaulted from tarmacs in Texas to a courtroom in Washington. It was the latest showdown over the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration — and the latest clash between the administration's enforcement efforts and legal safeguards that Congress created for vulnerable migrants.

Guatemalan children who arrived at the border without their parents or guardians will stay for at least two weeks while the legal fight unfolds, according to the ruling.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” said U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan. 

Minutes after her hastily scheduled hearing, five charter buses pulled up to a plane at Valley International Airport in Harlingen, Texas, a hub for deportation flights. Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers — perhaps 50 — toward the plane in an area restricted to government planes. Passengers wore colored clothing typically used in government-run shelters for migrant children.

All 76 children on the planes were expected to have been returned to shelters overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by the end of Sunday, the Justice Department said in a court filing.




“This idea that on a long weekend in the dead of night they would wake up these vulnerable children and put them on a plane irrespective of the constitutional protections that they had is something that should shock the conscience of all Americans,” said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, which represents the children, following Sunday's hearing.

The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.

The chaotic, rapid-fire developments resembled a March weekend showdown over the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Advocates implored a federal judge to halt deportations they believed were imminent, while the Trump administration was silent about its plans.

In that case, the judge appeared in civilian clothes for a Saturday night hearing and tried to block the flights, but they went ahead, with the government saying the court order came too late. 

The administration insisted it was reuniting the Guatemalan children — at the Central American nation's request — with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the children say that's untrue and argue that in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.

One girl said her parents, in Guatemala, got a strange phone call a few weeks ago saying the U.S. was deporting her, said one of the plaintiff attorneys, Efrén C. Olivares. 

The 16-year-old, who's been living in a New York shelter, said in a court filing that she's an honors student about to start 11th grade, loves living in the U.S. and is “deeply afraid of being deported.”

Other children — identified only by their initials — said in court documents that they had been neglected, abandoned, physically threatened or abused in their home country. 

“I do not have any family in Guatemala that can take good care of me,” a 10-year-old said in a court filing. A 16-year-old recalled experiencing “threats against my life” in Guatemala.

“If I am sent back, I believe I will be in danger,” the teen added.

Sunday's court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in Washington, but similar legal actions also were filed elsewhere. 

In a lawsuit in Arizona, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project said one of its clients is a 12-year-old asylum-seeker who has chronic kidney disease, needs dialysis to stay alive and will need a kidney transplant. Two other plaintiffs, a 10-year-old boy and his 3-year-old sister, don't have family in Guatemala and don't want to return, according to the group.

As the developments played out in the U.S., families gathered at an air base in Guatemala's capital, Guatemala City, in anticipation of the flights. Gilberto López said he drove through the night from his remote town after his 17-year-old nephew called at midnight to say he was being deported from Texas.

The boy left Guatemala two years ago, at age 15, to work in the U.S. and was detained about a month ago, López said.

Migrant children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents or guardians are routinely handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. They often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a relative — in the U.S.

Many of those from Guatemala request asylum or pursue other legal avenues to get permission to stay.

An attorney with the National Center for Youth Law said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children — particularly Guatemalans — in facilities of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. 

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin. 

Then, on Friday, advocates began getting word that their young clients' immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said. 

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that officials had drafted a list of children to return to Guatemala. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

The government had two planes on the ground in Harlingen and one in El Paso, Texas, Olivares said, based on witness accounts. Government lawyer Drew Ensign told the judge that one plane might have taken off but returned. 

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said on X that the Guatemalan government formally requested the children's return and that the judge was “refusing to let them reunify with their parents.” 

The judge said she was awakened at 2:30 a.m. to address the emergency filing from the children's lawyers, who wrote in bold type that flights might be leaving within the ensuing two to four hours. Sooknanan spent hours trying to reach federal attorneys and get answers, she said. 

“I have the government attempting to remove unaccompanied minors from the country in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend, which is surprising,” Sooknanan said at the midday hearing, later adding: “Absent action by the courts, all of those children would have been returned to Guatemala, potentially to very dangerous situations.”

The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.

Late Sunday, Guatemala's government said in a statement that it had originally proposed the transfer of the minors to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during her visit to the country in July. Guatemala's concern was that hundreds of minors would soon age out of the juvenile facilities where they were held and be sent to adult detention centers. It stressed that it was ready to receive the minors when due process was completed in the U.S. following established protocols.

Fox News' Alexandria Hoff provides details on Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip to China ahead of President Donald Trump's deadline for bilateral talks with Ukraine.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held warm meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday, sending Washington a clear message after President Donald Trump's heavy tariffs against India went into effect last week.

Xi hosted Modi, Putin and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at the port city of Tianjin. China has long sought to build up the group in a challenge to U.S. and NATO dominance. Modi was pictured having friendly exchanges and holding hands with both leaders, and he emphasized that India sees itself as a ""partner"" of China's rather than a ""rival.""

Modi's trip was his first time visiting China in seven years. He also took a ride in Putin's presidential limo, echoing Putin's own visit with Trump in Alaska last month. The two leaders held a separate bilateral meeting after the summit.

""Conversations with him are always insightful,"" Modi wrote on X, posting a picture of himself with Putin.

TRUMP'S DEADLINE ON SECONDARY TARIFFS ARRIVES; US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS HANG IN THE BALANCE

Putin in turn called Modi his ""dear friend"" and expressed gratitude that India and Russia share ""friendly and trusting"" relations.

While Modi never criticized Trump or the U.S. outright, his warming up to U.S. adversaries is a clear rebuke amid India's tariff strife with Trump. The U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods beginning last week. Xi also stopped short of naming Washington, but condemned ""bullying behavior"" by countries during his summit address.

Trump appeared to receive the message on Monday, reacting to the trio's meeting in a post on social media. He argued India had much more to lose in an economic standoff with the U.S.

""What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us,"" Trump wrote, adding that the U.S. is India's ""biggest client.""

""They have offered to cut their tariffs to nothing, but it's getting late. They should have done so years ago. Just some simple facts for people to ponder!"" he continued.

Modi's visits with Putin and Xi are only the latest sign of cooling relations between Washington and New Delhi, however. India's national security advisor traveled to Moscow last month, its foreign minister visited last week and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded talks in Delhi in mid-August. Putin is also expected to host Modi in Moscow before the end of the year.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to affirm that city police will not collaborate with the National Guard or federal troops. (via Reuters)

At least seven people have been killed and 37 others injured in shootings in Chicago this Labor Day weekend, even as the city's mayor vows to block President Donald Trump's efforts to combat crime.

This weekend's shootings took place in a series of unrelated incidents across Chicago, with the majority of instances resulting in no one being taken into custody, police say. Trump has suggested he may deploy the National Guard and other federal law enforcement to combat crime in the city.

The victims of fatal shootings so far this weekend include at least two women and three men, as well as two others police have not specified. Authorities have not released the names of the deceased.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order on Saturday prohibiting local police from working with their federal counterparts.

""This executive order makes it emphatically clear that this president is not going to come in and deputize our police department,"" Johnson said at a news conference with other city leaders.

The mayor's order affirms that Chicago police officers will continue to enforce state and local laws, but will not work with the National Guard or federal agents on patrols, arrests, immigration enforcement or other law enforcement actions.

CHICAGO MAYOR CALLS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD PLAN 'MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF OUR CONSTITUTION'

""We will protect our Constitution, we will protect our city, and we will protect our people,"" he said. ""We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents.""

The White House dismissed Johnson's order on Saturday, claiming that Democrats were attempting to make efforts to reduce crime a partisan issue.

""If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Reuters.

Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., spoke with Fox News Digital about becoming chair of the National Governors Association (NGA) and his legacy as Oklahoma governor. 

As America approaches its 250th anniversary, the bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA) is focused on reigniting the American Dream, NGA Chair Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. 

""I've lived the American Dream,"" the Oklahoma governor said, explaining that Democratic and Republican governors ""can all agree that we want to teach the next generation that America is exceptional, and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.""

During the NGA's summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Stitt announced his marquee initiative as the incoming chair, focusing on the economy, education and investing in artificial intelligence. 

""There's no such thing as equal outcomes, but we want equal opportunities to go chase your dreams through hard work, through entrepreneurship and free markets,"" Stitt explained.

The NGA hosted Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this summer in Colorado Springs.

Stitt said he hopes to feature more speakers at NGA events who embody the American Dream, mentioning Vice President JD Vance, former President Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger as potential guests. 

NGA Vice Chair Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., shared his own American Dream story during the NGA's summer meeting, telling the crowd that the ""American Dream is never a singular dream.""

""It's a continuation,"" Moore said. ""It's a dream that was born generations ago. It's a dream that was borne by people who, even if they did not know us, they fought for the hope of us. The United States is the most unique experiment in the history of the world. Period. Full stop.""

Stitt said his own story reflects the American Dream, telling Fox News Digital that he grew his nationwide company from just ""$1,000 and a computer"" before being elected governor in 2018. 

The Oklahoma governor is term-limited this year. When asked about his legacy, Stitt said he is proud to have accomplished ""education freedom"" and becoming a top-10 state where people are moving. 

""We were having teacher walkouts, we were having billion-dollar budget deficits, we had no money in savings, and we had this kind of second-class feel as a state,"" Stitt said of his home state before he took office. ""I'm a fourth-generation Oklahoman, and we weren't doing as well as we could have, and I wanted to bring this bravado.""

Looking ahead to next year, Stitt said he is monitoring the gubernatorial race closely as several candidates have already declared their candidacies.

""Behind the scenes, I'm certainly going to let Oklahomans know who I think is the best one to replace me, but if we can get a couple of good businessman governors and people that are focused on the next generation, not the next election, we can absolutely keep this momentum in Oklahoma going, and we can continue to be a top-10 state,"" Stitt said. 

As for his own political future, Stitt said he plans to return to his company as ""our Founding Fathers envisioned,"" adding that ""politics shouldn't necessarily be a profession where to climb the ladder.""

""When I told Oklahomans, I came from the business world and I said, I'm always going to focus on the next generation, not the next election,"" Stitt concluded. ""That's why Oklahomans are starting to thrive, because we're not making political decisions, we're making the right decisions for the citizens of Oklahoma.""

Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses how weight training could reduce the risk of dementia on ‘America Reports.'

Addressing hearing loss early on may significantly reduce the risk of dementia, a recent study found. 

Adults with hearing loss who reported wearing hearing aids before they were 70 years old cut their risk of dementia by more than half, compared to those with hearing loss who did not wear hearing devices, according to research recently published in JAMA Neurology.

Participants with hearing loss  who wore hearing aids had a 61% lower risk for ""incident all-cause dementia,"" the researchers wrote.

'SELECTIVE HEARING' ISN'T A CHOICE, SCIENTISTS REVEAL — IT'S A REAL NEUROLOGICAL PROCESS

Individuals under 70 years old who did not have hearing loss had a 29% lower risk for dementia in comparison to those with untreated hearing loss, according to the study authors.

However, the same benefit was not seen in those 70 years or older at the time of the hearing tests.

Researchers from the University of Texas, University of Pittsburgh, Boston University and several others looked at data from 2,953 participants in the Framingham Heart study, a long-term project that tracked the health of participants and their children.

For two decades, they followed participants aged 60 or older who did not have a diagnosis of dementia when they underwent hearing tests.

6 SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS

The researchers found that 20% of the participants ultimately developed dementia, and of this group 42% were under the age of 70 when they completed the hearing assessment.

""This finding highlights the importance of early intervention for [hearing loss] for possible prevention of dementia,"" the researchers stated.

The researchers noted that only 17% of individuals with moderate to severe hearing loss use hearing devices.

Dr. Gayatri Devi, M.D., a neurologist at Northwell's Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told Fox News Digital that ""40% of dementia cases are preventable with modifiable risk factors, such as correcting hearing loss, which promotes socializing, another separate variable associated with dementia prevention.""

The doctor, who was not affiliated with the study, noted that treating hearing loss is ""an excellent and simple way"" not only to prevent dementia, but also to enable people to engage more fully in conversations and improve their quality of life.

Age-related hearing loss is a known risk factor for developing dementia, according to Devi and other health experts.

""This finding highlights the importance of early intervention for possible prevention of dementia.""

""Maintaining good brain health as we age requires stimulation,"" Carolyn Bossinas, director of speech and audiology at Northwell Health Phelps Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, New York, told Fox News Digital. 

When someone is not able to hear properly, the brain does not receive adequate information, according to Bossinas, who was also not part of the research.

Compared to those with typical hearing, individuals with hearing loss are 1.9 times more likely to develop dementia and 2.78 times more likely to have a co-occurring cognitive impairment, the expert said.

These co-occurring impairments may include memory loss, reduced problem-solving, reduced awareness of mistakes and slower rate of processing.

There are signs that a person may be experiencing hearing loss and should see a healthcare professional.

""Generally, when we have trouble hearing in restaurants or in places with loud ambient noise, [it is a] good time to have our hearing checked,"" Devi said.

When someone is not able to hear properly, the brain does not receive adequate information, an expert said. (iStock)

Another sign is when someone frequently asks individuals to repeat themselves during conversations.

Early intervention is important, according to Bossinas. People typically adjust more quickly to wearing hearing aids when they have mild hearing loss, she noted, as the change is not as dramatic but can still be very helpful.

Several adjustments may be required, so she recommends working with an audiologist.

When wearing hearing devices, it's important to keep them dry, change the batteries (or the device) regularly, clean the device according to the audiologist's instructions, and perform regular listening checks, the expert added.

 ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan and DC Police Union Chairman Greggory Pemberton discuss President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the D.C. police force and more on ‘Fox News Live.'

As we say goodbye to the summer season by celebrating Labor Day, most Americans are eager to recognize the ingenuity and determination of rank-and-file workers.

But not union bosses, who hijack the holiday every year to argue for more government-granted coercive powers. Instead of focusing on the workers they claim to represent, union officials wield political clout to protect and expand their privileged positions.

This is because today's unions are built on the government-authorized ability to compel workers into their ranks. In the 24 states without right-to-work laws, union chiefs can legally extort private sector workers to ""pay up or be fired."" Even when union membership is voluntary, workers must accept the union bargaining collectively for their wages and working conditions.

NATION'S 2 LARGEST TEACHERS UNIONS FUNNELED NEARLY $50M TO LEFT-WING GROUPS, WATCHDOG REPORT SAYS

It doesn't matter that you, as an individual employee, may not want the union's so-called representation or a one-size-fits-all contract; union bureaucrats can forcibly take your dues money, then use it to buy political influence or advocate causes you oppose.

Workers do still have some limited rights guaranteed under federal law, such as the right to have union dues not pay for political activities (CWA v. Beck, 1988) or the right of public employees not to be forced to pay any money to a government union (Janus v. AFSCME, 2018). But, union political operatives are using their influence — bought with workers' dues money collected under duress — to try to push through a legislative agenda that upends these rights.

For example, the Protecting the Right to Work Act (PRO Act), Big Labor's top legislative priority in Congress, would repeal all current 26 state Right to Work laws by federal fiat. Even though Right to Work laws don't stop a single worker from joining a union or paying dues voluntarily, they've made it their signature move to end this protection for good.

Why? Because union bosses want to strip rank-and-file workers of their choice. This becomes all the more obvious as you examine the PRO Act's other provisions, which codify several suspect or downright illegal tactics union enforcers already use to get around workers' rights.

One such tactic is the controversial ""card check"" method of organizing a union, which avoids the traditional secret ballot that lets workers have the final say. Instead, this process lets organizers submit union cards collected in person from workers, often using pressure or intimidation tactics. The AFL-CIO even admitted in its own organizing handbook that such cards don't reflect workers' actual wishes.

To protect existing unions from decertification (secret-ballot votes to remove an incumbent union), the PRO Act codifies another common Big Labor tactic. Through union-filed blocking charges — unproven allegations against the company of unfair practices — union officials can unilaterally block decertification votes for months or more.

In multiple cases, such tactics were used to block decertification votes from occurring even though 100% of workers signed the decertification petition. Workers can literally be unanimously opposed to the union, yet union officials can manipulate their special legal powers to trap workers against their will.

It's the latest sign that today's union officials have fully rejected the warnings of some early union officials who wanted to build their organizations without coercing workers into their ranks.

Take Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American Federation of Labor (now the AFL-CIO). In a 1924 speech to union delegates he forcefully rejected the coercion today's union bosses rely on: ""I want to urge devotion to the fundamentals of human liberty — the principles of voluntarism. No lasting gain has ever come from compulsion."" 

Gompers understood, as do the 8 in 10 Americans who oppose forced union dues and affiliation, that when union affiliation and financial support are voluntary, union officials must prove their worth to individual workers. But today, union bosses increasingly reject this ideal, and undermine the liberty of those they claim to ""represent.""

So this Labor Day, remember that truly being ""pro-worker"" means rejecting the propaganda from union bosses and respecting a worker's right to choose whether they want to join a union.

After all, it's Labor Day, not Union Day.

Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams reports on the latest efforts to clean up the capital on 'Special Report.'

President Donald Trump has declared Washington, D.C., to be crime-free.

Posting on Truth Social on Sunday, the president wrote: ""DC IS NOW A CRIME FREE ZONE, IN JUST 12 DAYS!!! President DJT""

In a second post, Trump added a list of updates and data.

""This is a list I get every single day!"" he said.

In an update for Aug. 30, Trump's post said there had been 76 arrests and five firearms seized.

Trump also said an El Salvadorian national and MS-13 gang member was among those arrested, two ""drivers of violence"" were arrested for felon in possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of a firearm. 

He also said a person was arrested for assault on a federal officer and threats against the president, as well as another person arrested for threatening National Guard personnel. Lastly, he said an arrest was made for a sexual assault.

The president's posts came over two weeks after he declared a public safety emergency in the city and invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control.

President Donald Trump shared a post on Truth Social that D.C. is crime-free. 

He went on to deploy around 800 National Guard troops to D.C. with 100–200 on duty at any time.

Trump also reassigned federal agents from agencies like ICE to patrol the city.

Within the first 13 days, federal authorities reported around 550 arrests and preliminary MPD data showed a 40% drop in robberies and auto break-ins.

By Aug. 24, aggregated data indicated over 700 arrests and 91 illegal firearms had been seized, showing a substantial uptick in enforcement activity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The ‘Big Lebowski' Friendship Test","https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/09/friends-movies-big-lebowski/683932/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The stress of introducing something you love to someone you care about

“So, should we Lebowski, or should we not Lebowski?” I asked my friend Alex as we finished our pizza and wine on a recent evening.

I felt like I was asking her if she wanted to make out. The Big Lebowski—the 1998 Coen-brothers movie about bowling, pot, and mistaken identity—is one of my favorites, and I was nervous about introducing it to her. I like to use Lebowski quotes as a way to assert myself while, like Jeff Bridges's character, “the Dude,” not taking things too seriously. There's a Lebowski-ism for virtually every tricky situation: Asked to work on a Saturday? “I don't roll on Shabbas.” Someone does something outrageous? “This is not 'Nam … There are rules!” Disagree about something? “That's just, like, your opinion, man.” Whenever life has been especially difficult, I've returned to the movie and found solace in its “whatever, man” ethos. When I was addled by postpartum depression and my baby would cry nonstop, I would watch Lebowski clips on YouTube and savor a rare laugh.

But it's a strange movie, and I have known Alex for only a couple of years. I was worried that she would dislike it so much that she would kind of dislike me too, through osmosis. Or that I would realize that we have completely different senses of humor, and that perhaps we aren't very close after all. In Lebowski terms, would our friendship abide? Or would we be out of our element?

Jitters such as these are rather common. “If something really matters to you,” Beverley Fehr, a University of Winnipeg psychologist, told me, “there's a vulnerability in sharing it with someone else.” When we declare a favorite book, movie, or album and introduce it to others, Jeffrey Hall, a communications-studies professor at the University of Kansas, told me, “what we're doing is saying, ‘This is an aspect of my identity that I'm willingly putting out there in order for other people to know me. And if you reject this thing, you reject me.'” Tom Vanderbilt, the author of You May Also Like, said that recommending something to someone can be like giving a gift, in that “it says something about you, but you're also trying to anticipate what they might like.”

Often, our friends will like what we like: Several researchers told me that most people's friends are extremely similar to them in terms of age, education level, political attitudes, and leisure pursuits. These similarities tend to include cultural tastes. Researchers who have shown groups of people clips of, say, Food, Inc. and America's Funniest Home Videos have found that people whose brains responded similarly were more likely to become and stay friends. We tend to like people who like the same things as us because they validate our view of the world: “I must be right because there's this other person who sees it exactly the same way” is how Fehr explained this (largely subconscious) line of thinking to me. And then, once people become friends, they tend to conform to each other's tastes and preferences. If they like it, we must like it, too—after all, we're so similar! 

The trouble is, Fehr told me, we usually want our friends to be even more similar to us than they actually are. “When we're presenting something to a friend and we don't know if the friend will see it the same way we do,” she said, “one of the fears is that we're going to realize that we aren't as similar as we thought we were.” Fehr once had a group of friends over to watch Nebraska, a movie she loved, and remembers “not getting too much of a reaction to it.” This kind of letdown can be a threat to your perception of the friendship: Do you not know them as well as you thought you did? Fehr remembers feeling a little hurt, before eventually letting it go. But she hasn't planned another movie night with that friend group since.

If a friend doesn't love our favorite cultural artifact, we might try to resolve the resulting discomfort in a few ways. We might change our own minds about it, telling ourselves Nebraska's not that great after all; we might try changing their minds about it; or, potentially, we might change the way we think about the friendship, Angela Bahns, a psychologist at Wellesley College, told me.

Whether a disagreement over a beloved book or movie sparks friction in the friendship, Bahns said, depends on how well you know the friend; what else you have in common; and how important that particular book, movie, or show is to you. Sometimes, this kind of difference can cause an unexpected level of tension: When Lidia Wiens, a 39-year-old in Seattle, invited her friend Julia over to watch her favorite movie, Sleepless in Seattle, she thought Julia, an agreeable woman with whom she shared similar taste, would love it. But to her dismay, she noticed that Julia was looking at her phone a lot, and occasionally, Julia would make negative comments about the characters. Wiens felt awkward, and the two had a bit of a fight about it. They both ultimately apologized, but Wiens thinks that in the future, she won't put so much emotional stock in sharing her favorite books and movies with other people. “I don't know why it became so personal,” Wiens told me. She felt like she wanted her friend's genuine response to the movie, but she also wanted the genuine response to be a positive one.

As for me, good news: Alex agreed to Lebowski! But I didn't get any less nervous as the movie staggered through its plot, such as it is. At the time of Lebowski's release, The Guardian called the film “a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random,” and I was finding it hard to refute that assessment. In the movie, a burnout named Jeffrey “the Dude” Lebowski is hired by a millionaire with the same name to rescue his kidnapped wife. Hijinks ensue when the Dude's best friend hatches a plan to keep the wealthier Lebowski's ransom money for the Dude and himself. It also features a group of nihilists, a porn kingpin, a bowling competition, and a storyline about the millionaire's adult daughter's quest to get pregnant. Actually, I wondered as Alex and I shared a bag of popcorn, why are there so many characters? Is this even a good movie? I grew irritated by its gratuitousness, as exemplified by a scene in which a topless woman bounces on a trampoline outside the porn kingpin's house. I wasn't sure how to wordlessly impart to Alex that this isn't the kind of thing that I, a nice suburban mom, would condone.

Alex didn't seem to laugh much, and I paused the movie several times to reassure her that we didn't have to finish it if she didn't want to. When it ended, I quickly noted how tired I was, and that she must be, too, giving her a chance to make a quick exit without a lot of commentary. Which she did. Lebowski's not for everyone, and that's okay, I tried to reassure myself as I padded upstairs to bed.

But my worries about whether she at least mildly appreciated my weird little comfort watch were resolved a few days later. I brought in the mail to find that she had sent me a onesie for my son, emblazoned with the words little Lebowski urban achievers. We did abide, after all.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A novelist traveled to the former Soviet republic in search of food and a story. She found a new understanding of how to stand up for democracy.

The first time I ate a khinkali was in 2003, and after one bite of that soupy, oversize dumpling, I became obsessed with the food of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. I started making pilgrimages to Georgian restaurants wherever I could find them, snarfing down cheese-stuffed breads and garlic chicken, pickled walnuts and those delicious khinkali. I often imagined what the food would taste like in its motherland, but for 20 years I was too busy and broke to trek to the small, mountainous nation. Then in March 2023, thanks to a research grant and a week off work, I finally got the chance to go.

It turned out to be a charged moment in Tbilisi, Georgia's mazelike, cobblestoned capital. The country's government had been rolling back democratic reforms, and its latest move was to advance a law against so-called foreign agents, just as Vladimir Putin had in Russia, that targeted organizations with international support. A year after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, this law seemed designed to appeal to Georgia's former colonizers, not Georgians themselves. In the days before I arrived, protesters rocked Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi's main drag, holding up furious and often profane signs. Graffiti on the street declared, in English, liberty is the only wealth and Revolution is the only solution. The door on the coffee shop near my hotel read, you are more than welcome here if you agree that Putin is a war criminal and accept the sovereignty of peaceful nations.

That March, I felt awe at the bravery of the Tbilisi protesters, some of whom actually danced—danced!—in the face of police. I also felt a profound sense of gratitude for the way my own country had managed to recover from the insurrection of January 6, 2021. By the spring of 2023, two years into Joe Biden's presidency, I was certain that the threats posed by Donald Trump's election lies and machinations were behind us. In retrospect, I should have been learning from the Georgians I talked with: The fight for democracy is not the work of a month or two, but of years—of, perhaps, a lifetime.

What did I do in Tbilisi besides meet protesters and read graffiti? I ate, of course, way too much. I walked up and down hills, admiring the ancient churches and monasteries. I rode a funicular to a hilltop amusement park. I talked with young Georgians—many Georgians' English is shockingly good—about their lives. I bought socks at a street market. And I petted dozens of Tbilisi's 30,000 stray dogs, the luckiest of whom are cared for by the community, neutered, inoculated against rabies, and fed the rich leftovers of a million Tbilisi office lunches.

Read: Democracy in Eastern Europe faces another crisis.

After a week, I went home and began writing a novel about the experience. I imagined the story of an American woman who heads to Tbilisi to rescue one of those stray dogs, only to find herself caught in the headwinds of the Georgian protest movement. I wrote the novel in a rush, inspired by the people I'd met and the resolve I'd witnessed. Then in October 2024, I returned to Tbilisi to fact-check my work.

Although only a year and a half had passed, circumstances were much more dire for the nation's democracy movement. Later that month, a parliamentary election was to be held in Georgia; its contenders were several pro-European parties and a Russia-aligned party called Georgian Dream. Many locals I talked with expected the election to be rigged in favor of Georgian Dream, which would then derail plans to join the European Union—a goal that was explicitly written into the 1995 Georgian constitution. This is exactly what happened.

In my own country, another presidential election was only a month away. I was trying to remain optimistic, but I had a terrible feeling that Trump was going to win, and that he, too, would begin dismantling democratic institutions. Although this is also what happened, I am still surprised at how efficiently he has done it and how little resistance he has met. I am surprised, most of all, at how little I myself have resisted.

The resistance of Georgians, meanwhile, is all the more remarkable because of the dangers they have faced for many decades. For them, self-determination is not a centuries-old tradition but an objective that has been repeatedly thwarted. They have been throttled by Russia, in one way or another, since the early 19th century: annexation in 1801, massacre in 1924, Stalinist purges in 1937 and 1938, military subjugation in 1989. In 2008, Russian troops invaded the country and got within striking distance of the capital; to this day, Russia occupies 20 percent of Georgia's land. One Tbilisi resident explained to me that if she wanted to visit a family member in, say, South Ossetia, she'd have to leave Georgia, go to Russia, get a visa, and return to the part of her country Russia controls. This is a humiliation, although it's arguably not as bad as the fact of her own federal government embracing the autocrat in Moscow who wants to end her dream of living in a fully functioning democracy.

So she, along with many of her friends, protests—even though she knows she could very well be beaten up and thrown into the back of a police van, strip-searched, and threatened with sexual violence. Moreover, she is fairly certain her protests won't change a thing. The Georgians I met have chosen protest as a way of life because they have never lived with the illusion that rights, once granted, are permanent. In Georgia, I got the sense that you protest to remind yourself who you are and what you believe in. Even something as ephemeral as graffiti takes on the power of a civic declaration. You don't just tag a building with your name: You tag it with an image of the Georgian flag next to an EU flag, as if marking the building with a prayer.

It's hard not to feel a shiver of shame when I compare the bravery I witnessed in Georgia with my own response to the past seven months of American history. My life as a citizen of a democracy more than two centuries old has left me embarrassingly soft. Instead of marching down streets or tagging buildings or even engaging in tough conversations with my Trump-loving neighbors, I find myself bobbing and weaving, pretending that if I don't rock the boat too much, the people in charge will let me imagine that the country I once knew still exists. In my work as a writer, I now find myself actively accommodating the priorities of the government. On a federal-grant application, I revamped a project to seem unimpeachably patriotic. On another, I wiped out words including diversity and Nigerian-American. On a flight home from Europe, I scrubbed my Instagram page of political memes and images of detainees, lest some rogue airport agent pull me in for questioning. And I almost reconsidered writing this essay, for fear of putting naturalized family members at risk of vengeful denaturalization.

But recently, a mother in our community without any criminal record was yanked by ICE, and I had to ask myself: When do I, too, put myself on the line? When law-abiding citizens are threatened with exile, when grants and government data disappear without a trace, when media companies and law firms and universities rush to settle frivolous cases brought by the president—when will I decide that I have to do something? When federal agents start patrolling my own streets? When more of my neighbors disappear? I know that it's long past time to become the person who decides, in the face of water cannons, to dance.

The novel I wrote about Georgia was just released, and I celebrated at a restaurant in Philadelphia called Megobari Cafe, whose name means friend in Georgian, and which serves the best khinkali I've ever had outside of Georgia itself. I raised a glass to the book, and another to the Georgians who helped me write it. They have shown how to face  an unknowable future with courage. But even more importantly, they have demonstrated that the consequences of staying silent are far worse than whatever a nation of people might suffer for raising their collective voice.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

America isn't retreating from the world under Trump. It's doing something stranger.

The defining photo of the recent White House Ukraine summit will likely turn out to be one depicting five European leaders plus the leaders of the European Commission and NATO smooshed in around the Resolute Desk, seemingly listening to a soliloquy by the unseen President Donald Trump.

The photo was impossible for observers not to compare to an iconic one from Trump's first term, showing a group of G7 leaders led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel hovering over Trump. (France's Emmanuel Macron is the only one that appears in both.)

If in the earlier image Trump looks like a petulant child being lectured by exasperated adults, in the latter, he's clearly where he wants to be: at the center of attention, surrounded by people, powerful in their own right, who are there to listen to him. Trump clearly relished the moment, posting, “A big day at the White House. We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time. A great honor for America!!!”

He later told reporters, “They jokingly call me the president of Europe.”

The moment encapsulated something that is often missed in attempts to diagnose and define Trump's foreign policy. For all his America First rhetoric and vilification of “globalists,” Trump clearly sees himself as a global leader who plays an indispensable role on the world stage and is responsible for solving other countries' problems — not only America's. The fact that he carries out this role in a very different way from any of his predecessors shouldn't distract from the fact that he's leaned into this tendency even farther in his second term in office.

As Trump recently told The Atlantic, during the first term he was just running the country. In his second, as he sees it, “I run the country and the world.”

Trump has never really been an “isolationist,” though he has frequently been described as one, and some of his rhetoric makes it easy to understand why. He has charged previous presidents with overextending America's resources, “rebuilding other countries while weakening our own.” He frequently attacks “nation builders” and “interventionists,” including in a May speech in Saudi Arabia, where he argued that “far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins.”

He's frequently unimpressed by international organizations and institutions, and he often views US allies as free-riders taking advantage of American largesse. He is plainly uninterested in upholding any “rules-based international order.”

In his second term, Trump has eviscerated America's foreign aid system and drastically downsized the State Department and National Security Council, doing potentially permanent damage to the traditional tools of American foreign policy.

Trump's critics, both Democrats and disaffected Republicans, frequently charge Trump with abandoning America's global leadership role. The late former Secretary of State Madeline Albright, who coined the term “indispensable nation” to describe the United States in the 1990s, charged Trump during his first term with promoting a “doctrine of “every nation for itself,” and staking out “isolated positions on trade, climate change and Middle East peace.” The neoconservative scholar Robert Kagan has called Trump's America First doctrine an “invitation to global anarchy, a struggle of all against all.” After President Joe Biden took office in 2021, he used his first speech to an international audience to declare, “America is back,” implying that it had left the world stage for four years during Trump's first term.

Trump is absolutely not a liberal internationalist or a neoconservative, but he probably wouldn't disagree with Kagan that American leadership is vital for preventing the world from falling into violent anarchy. He just thinks it's his leadership that's needed.

Trump has repeatedly asserted that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022 and that Hamas would not have attacked Israel in 2023 had he been president, though he has not yet followed through on his campaign pledge to quickly end the still-raging wars that resulted from those events.

Lately, Trump has taken to boasting that he has ended “6 Wars in 6 months,” sometimes raising the number to seven, citing the conflicts between India and Pakistan, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Thailand and Cambodia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.

This is misleading at best: the Twelve-Day War between Israel and Iran was one the US backed and participated in, and it's unlikely Israel would have launched its own strikes without US backing; fighting is still going on in Congo; Armenia and Azerbaijan, a long-running conflict, haven't actually been actively fighting since 2023. It's also not as if Trump is the first president to play this sort of role: The US has been the default crisis-broker in past India-Pakistan flare-ups, as it was for the most recent one in May. But it's still telling that Trump appears to see putting out these fires as part of his job description, in contrast to some within his administration, such as Vice President JD Vance, who tends to see them as “none of our business.”

Whether it's because of his frequently mentioned desire for a Nobel Peace Prize or, as he unexpectedly suggested on Fox News recently, because he's concerned about the fate of his eternal soul, Trump clearly relishes the role of peacemaker. This is one reason why — despite the zigs and zags of his approach to Russia — he seems unlikely, for the time being at least, to entirely abandon Ukraine.

Back in 2016, Trump distinguished himself from his Republican rivals — and from his eventual Democratic rival Hillary Clinton — with his willingness to criticize the war in Iraq and the Bush administration's foreign policy, earning a reputation as a critic of foreign intervention. But as president, he has frequently proved eager to get involved — to a point.

A number of MAGA-aligned foreign policy figures, including a number that serve in the Trump administration, are identified as “restrainers,” meaning they favor more limited use of military force abroad. This backlash is not surprising after the two decades of “forever wars” following 9/11, and it's probably not a coincidence that more dovish advisers like Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard served in those wars. Even Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, though not exactly a “dove,” has described himself as a “recovering neocon” due to his experience in the military.

At this point, Trump has a track record of launching a limited military strike and then moving on, or — as in the case of Yemen — cutting his losses when a military operation starts to look like a quagmire.

Trump shares their aversion to long drawn-out military engagements, but the president who wants to rename the Department of Defense the “Department of War” is hardly against a high-profile, demonstrative use of military force, as his Pentagon's recent air campaigns against Iran's nuclear program and Yemen's Houthi rebels demonstrated.

In a recent article, Jeremy Shapiro, director of the US program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, analyzed Trump's use of military force in his first term — examples included the drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and the airstrikes responding to Syria's use of chemical weapons — and found that he tends to favor “limited engagements with achievable goals, often leveraging overwhelming US capabilities against enemies who could not strike back to send a message of strength without risking prolonged involvement.”

When he launches one of these interventions, analysts tend to warn of the risk of mission creep and quagmire. (I include myself here.) But at this point, Trump has a track record of launching a limited military strike and then moving on, or — as in the case of Yemen — cutting his losses when a military operation starts to look like a quagmire. The still ongoing US military campaigns under Trump, such as those targeting al-Shabaab in Somalia and ISIS in Syria, tend to be lower intensity operations that get much less media attention.

As Washington Post columnist and former George W. Bush adviser Marc Thiessen argues, Trump has effectively overturned former Secretary of State Colin Powell's famous “Pottery Barn rule,” that when it comes to using military force, “if you break it, you own it.” Sometimes, Thiessen writes, “You can just break it.”

The avoidance of “long, drawn-out” operations is, Vance argues, what distinguishes Trump from the “dumb presidents” whose military operations he has criticized in the past. But while they haven't turned into quagmires, it's less clear what these operations have accomplished. Despite their agreement with the Trump administration not to attack American shipping, the Houthis have continued their attacks on global shipping (even sinking two ships) and their missile strikes against Israel. Iran's nuclear program was clearly set back by American and Israeli strikes, but the best evidence we have suggests it was not “obliterated” as Trump claimed, and the country now has more incentive than ever to develop a nuclear weapon. Any hope that the political momentum from the successful US-Israeli strikes would help bring an end to the fighting in Gaza has clearly been dashed.

Trump has avoided George W. Bush's nation-building hubris, but not his penchant for declaring victory before all the facts are in.

Trump has long held that it's not America's responsibility to “spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants,” and he certainly has no squeamishness when it comes to lavishing praise on foreign autocrats, be they Russian, Saudi, or North Korean. In this term, his State Department has instructed diplomats to avoid criticizing the conduct of other countries' elections and slashed its standard-setting yearly human rights report.

But this doesn't mean Trump and his administration are entirely unconcerned about the domestic politics of other countries. He has threatened to use tariffs or aid cutoffs to punish countries for prosecuting his political allies, including Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

Vance stunned European officials with a speech in April at the Munich Security Conference, suggesting that the biggest threat to Europe comes not from Russian aggression but from uncontrolled migration and restrictions on right-wing political parties. Trump's ambassador to France and machatunim Charles Kushner recently released an open letter accusing France of failing to combat antisemitism that enraged French officials who accused him of violating “international law, particularly the duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of states.”

The Trump administration may have cut protections for refugees from countries like Haiti and Afghanistan, but he has opened the door to white South Africans facing a nonexistent “genocide” and attempted to ambush that country's president with allegations during an Oval Office meeting.

It's very true that Trump does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of “universal values,” but he's repeatedly shown a willingness to interfere in the name of his own values and interests.

Then there's the most overt form of interference in other countries' affairs: Trump's openly stated desire to acquire their territory. Just this past week, Denmark's government summoned the top US diplomat in the country over reports of an ongoing covert influence campaign linked to Trump's ongoing quest to acquire Greenland. Trump has not ruled out using military force to accomplish this, and has also baffled an enraged allies with talking of turning Canada into the 51st state, taking over Gaza, and reacquiring the Panama Canal. It's hard to call yourself a non-interventionist when you're proposing literal colonialism.

Trump is not the first businessman-turned-politician to suggest that the US should be run like a corporation, but he has a very different conception of what that means than his immediate predecessors.

The term “globalist” as it's been used in recent political discourse tends to connote a faith in globalization and free markets. (That's when it's not functioning as a thinly disguised antisemitic slur.) This hardly describes the self-described “tariff man” in the Oval Office. That said, he's hardly averse to negotiating trade deals.

An archetypal Trumpian trade policy may be the deal that required US-based microchip giants Nvidia and AMD to pay the US government 15 percent of the revenues from their sales of artificial intelligence chips to China.

Trump is pursuing a form of globalism stripped of any semblance of liberalism — political or economic.

Allowing China to buy these chips casts aside an approach dating back to Trump's first term that continued under the Biden administration: limiting China's access to the tools needed to build advanced AI applications — which could have serious military ramifications.

Trump has had hard-line national security China hawks in his administration, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in his first term and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby in this one, but his own concerns have always focused less on Taiwan or the South China Sea than his perception that China is ripping the US off on trade. Trump's almost entirely trade-focused view of Beijing — in contrast to the civilizational struggle that consumes many in Washington — has stayed consistent as the bipartisan consensus on China has shifted. He looked like a China hawk in his first term, and looks like a dove now.

The chip deal also highlights the degree to which Trump is willing to meddle in the affairs of private companies to a degree that would have been totally anathema to previous Republican presidents — a tendency that has continued with the stake the US government has taken in Intel (and perhaps soon, in Lockheed Martin).

It's not as if business interests haven't driven American foreign policy — including military campaigns and covert actions — in the past. But the retinue of CEOs that Trump brought along on his first Mideast trip (he reportedly wants a similar traveling party when he eventually visits China) and the minerals deal that Ukraine signed as a condition for future US military support both showcased an openly dispayed symbiosis of public and private that is something new on the world stage.

And that's to say nothing of his own business interests: Trump's vision for the future of Gaza naturally involves a beachfront (presumably Trump-branded) resort, and foreign leaders have learned to dangle the prospect of future Trump towers in meetings with him.

The fact is, Trump appears to be just as concerned with America's place in the world as any jet-setting, Economist-reading, “Davos man.” He seems to agree that America plays an indispensable role in shaping the world — both in setting the economic rules of the road and in matters of war and peace. He also appears to believe that global events and trends matter to America. He just has a radically different set of priorities and plans for how to pursue them than the internationalists who have come before him.

Trump is pursuing a form of globalism stripped of any semblance of liberalism — political or economic. And he wants the United States to throw its weight around on the world stage and influence global events while seriously curtailing the tools — diplomacy, intelligence, foreign aid, troop deployments, participation in international organizations and alliances — that have traditionally allowed it to do that.

America is not leaving the world stage under Trump — it's just playing a very different part.

Executives are preparing to slash their workforces. Workers are just trying to cope.

Colton Masi checked off every box in his quest to land a good job in the computer science industry after college.

The 23-year-old attended Drexel University, a Philadelphia school distinguished by its focus on real-life job experience. And he majored in software engineering, a discipline he had been hearing his whole life was synonymous with stable, high-paying work. It was all part of his plan to avoid the fate that befell so many millennials after the Great Recession.

“When I was 13, I was online all the time.” Colton told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “I was on Tumblr, and I was seeing a lot of these currently graduating young adults kind of talk about their struggles with the job market and getting themselves established…I was always like, ‘Oh no, I need to do something that's going to get me a job.'”

So Masi took the advice offered by everyone from Joe Biden to Chris Bosh to Ashton Kutcher in that era: he learned to code.

But Masi graduated from Drexel this past June into a historically bad job market for entry-level computer science positions. Since then he's applied to about 100 jobs — none have even offered an interview.

“It's like, you do everything right. You follow the instructions, but the field changes,” Colton said. “There's nothing you can do about it. It's just: keep it pushing until you find something.”

Masi's situation is increasingly common for recent college graduates and others seeking to break into white-collar industries like computer science and marketing.

“I hear about a lot of rejection from job seekers,” Lindsay Ellis, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal who has been crunching the numbers on the entry-level job decline, told Noel King. “[The] market feels kind of stuck to a lot of people.”

Ellis talked to King about why big companies are planning on a future with far fewer entry-level employees, the wild lengths people are going to to find a job, and what career advice executives are giving their own kids.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

If I were to guess at what's going on, I would say this must have something to do with AI. Is that it?

That's a factor, and I think is layered on top of a bunch of other factors that have caused the white-collar market to slow considerably over the last few years.

You know, starting in maybe late 2022, early 2023, companies and hiring managers were really pumping the brakes in a lot of sectors. There were the tons of tech layoffs that started in '23, but from inflation [and] geopolitical conflict, then the looming election and a lot of uncertainty — in terms of policy — [about] which way things were going to go. If a hiring manager is saying, “Hey, can we hold off on making this hire and maybe have a little bit more buffer in terms of headcount, in terms of payroll costs,” they might see how long they can last without making that hire.

And then you add in AI as a layer on top of all of this, and the calculation is totally different. I talked to James Hornick, who's the chief growth officer at the Chicago-based recruiting firm Hirewell. And he told me that clients have all but stopped requesting entry-level staff. Those young grads were once in high demand, but their work is now a home run for AI.

We're always trying to figure out what is data and what is anecdata. You can hear one story about someone who applied for three or four jobs a day for a month and got nothing, and that will be the thing that sticks in your brain forever. 

But the unemployment rate in the US right now is around 4.2 percent, which is super low, right? Is there a tension between the one extreme story and the actual trend?

Behind that number, I think you'll see a couple of other trends that suggest that the picture is a little bit more complicated.

Number one is sort of labor data on the time it takes to find a job. And there are two things that my colleagues and I have been looking at. One is for unemployed Americans, it now takes them on average 24 weeks to find a job after losing one, and that's nearly a month longer than a year prior.

And the number of long-term unemployed Americans — that's people who are unemployed for at least 27 weeks — that figure is now 1.8 million people a year. Prior, it was like 1.5 [million]. So that's an uptick too.

The other factor here is you think about which sectors are hiring at the moment, [and] much of the jobs growth is coming from state and local government, or sectors like health care, social assistance, leisure and hospitality, construction. A white-collar project manager probably wouldn't be qualified for a role in health care or might not be looking for a local government job in a different state. So I think it's also a question of matching opportunity to skillset and how that goes.

The job application process for a long time has been: There's maybe a portal and you submit your resume, or you send an email to a hiring manager. Is AI changing the way we apply for jobs?

Oh my god, you have no idea.

Ooh!

This has been a total fascination of mine. The job application process now in many ways can in my mind be described as a robot-versus-robot arms race, basically.

What you hear from applicants is that they are super frustrated with corporate hiring software, which for many years will scan an applicant's resume and cover letter and basic details and sort of rank them based on their qualifications. And they feel like that artificial intelligence basically forces good people to slip through the cracks.

So in response, [applicants are] using AI of their own to craft cover letters and resumes, using the job description and their own stuff to basically incorporate all of the keywords, [to] show how they're responding to specific job responsibilities. There are even tools, though, that scan the entire internet for potential jobs and then just spray out a candidate's application in seconds.

The whole thing has left applicants and employers super irritated, because employers are totally — all of their portals are getting clogged up, and it's really hard to tell who is actually interested versus who is using really good prompts or keywords. Applicants are really frustrated because they will look at a job posting on LinkedIn, and it'll say how many people have applied, and it's like, Shoot, I have no chance here. Should I even still do this? Then if they do put time into their application, they might get a rejection hours later or at 2 in the morning on a Sunday. It just feels super impersonal, and both sides of the table are really frustrated.

What are young people being told to do now? What are the options?

I've been asking executives the same question. I mean both from a [perspective of], what are you talking to universities about — because there's a lot of correspondence between business and higher ed — but also, what are you telling your own kids?

I talked to the chief executive of a consulting firm in Ohio, and he basically said, I'm telling my kids to really focus on jobs that really require in-person or client-facing communication. One of his children is becoming a police officer, and he said, while AI will affect the way he does his job, nothing replaces those relationships that are forged face-to-face in a community.

And now, chief executives are talking openly about AI's immense capabilities, and how those might lead to job cuts, even more so than [just] at the entry levels. I mean, you had executives at Amazon, JPMorgan in recent weeks saying that they expect their workforces to shrink considerably. The CEO of Ford said he expects AI will replace half of the white-collar workforce in the US. Those are figures that suggest that people in various roles, various experience levels, should expect significant disruption.

You have spent a lot of time, all over the country, talking to people who are really struggling. What do you think about how these folks — many of them young people — are going to deal with all this?

Many people feel quite low. It's a really hard stretch, and it's a hard time to be on the market, and I don't want to sugarcoat that.

I talked to some people who say, what's really helped me is to get outside, do some gardening, go for a run, go swimming. Swimming is great. You can't really have your phone in your hand. I will say, though: A lot of them are spending a lot of money to be able to hopefully speed up this process and stand out to employers and potential employers.

I talked to one guy who said he spent $10,000 on basically a marketing firm that's treating him as the product, to basically get his resume out there, make him a website, try and introduce him to hiring managers and people who might know of jobs that aren't posted publicly.So I think for some people, it helps when they can funnel their frustration into, I'm going to do this; I'm going to really push myself hard. Other people have been telling me, look, this is a marathon, not a sprint. I need to make sure I'm taking time outside of this hunt to really keep my mental health steady.

BYD's ""gravy train"" might be grinding to a halt.

The Chinese EV giant's share price slumped as much as 8% on Monday, as investors digested disappointing earnings released last week.

On Friday, BYD reported that net profits in the second quarter had fallen 30% from a year earlier, as the Tesla rival grappled with fierce competition in China's congested EV market.

BYD has also found itself in the crosshairs of China's regulators, which have cracked down on practices of heavy discounting and delayed supplier payments that have become standard in China's electric vehicle industry.

In the company's earnings report, BYD said that ""short-term profitability"" had been affected by ""industry malpractices"" such as discounting and ""excessive marketing.""

BYD has itself cut prices multiple times over the past few years, and analysts at Jefferies said regulatory campaigns have hurt the company's ""historic playbook"" of leveraging its supply chain advantages to aggressively cut prices.

""In short, BYD's 'gravy train' — fueled by scale, cost cuts, and tech leadership — has lost speed. Until it regains momentum, underperformance looks likely,"" they wrote in a Sunday note.

BYD's disappointing results for the first half of the year were buoyed by a rise in overseas revenues, which soared 50% from the same period last year.

The Shenzhen-based automaker has targeted aggressive global expansion as China's EV market heats up.

BYD has built a fleet of car-carrying cargo ships to meet growing demand in markets like Europe, Brazil, and Mexico, and is pushing ahead with plans to build factories in Brazil, Hungary, and Turkey.

The Chinese automaker outsold Tesla in Europe last month, the second time it has done so this year.

Business Insider Edition 

A growing number of Nigerian citizens are finding themselves locked out of the United States, despite holding valid visas that were issued months or even years ago, as visa denials quietly mount.


        A new report has revealed that the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria has quietly begun revoking visas without warning, disrupting the lives of Nigerian professionals, entrepreneurs, frequent travelers, and families who suddenly find their mobility stripped away.
    


        The revelation, made by Olufemi Soneye, former Chief Corporate Communications Officer of Nigeria's national oil company, the NNPC Ltd, in an article published in The Cable, points to an unsettling pattern of unexplained cancellations.
    


        According to Soneye, many Nigerians who had long traveled to and from the U.S. without incident are now receiving terse notices of revocation.
    


“Each had to abruptly cancel engagements, refund tickets, and explain to partners abroad why they could no longer show up. In some cases, the humiliation has been unbearable: travelers discovering at the airport, sometimes even at boarding gates, that their visas had been quietly invalidated.""



""A few were briefly detained by immigration authorities before being sent home in shame,” Soneye disclosed, describing the embarrassment some affected visa holders faced at airports as they attempted to leave the country.
    


        The cancellation letters, citing Title 22, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 41.122, claim only that “new information became available after the visa was issued.”
    


        But beyond that line, no details are shared. No evidence is presented. No avenue for appeal is offered.
    


        Recipients are told only that they may reapply, a costly and uncertain process that offers little reassurance to those who had already built business plans, family reunions, or educational opportunities around U.S. travel.



        What makes the development more troubling is its timing.
    


        The Trump administration has recently rolled out a series of visa restrictions targeting countries in Africa, citing security and immigration risks.
    


        Nigeria, one of Africa's top economy and a longstanding U.S. partner, has increasingly found itself caught in the dragnet. While Washington has not publicly linked the Nigerian cancellations to the broader policy shift, observers say the pattern fits within a tightening of U.S. entry controls for African nationals.
    


        Yet the opacity of the process is raising alarms. Neither the U.S. Embassy in Abuja nor Nigerian authorities have issued a public statement explaining the sudden wave of cancellations.
    


        For those affected, the silence is devastating. Many insist they have never overstayed their visas, violated immigration rules, or raised any security red flags. For them, the revocations feel less like routine enforcement and more like a targeted policy shift operating in the shadows.
    


        “For many, this is not just about stamps on a passport. These visas are lifelines for education, family reunions, medical treatment, and critical business. To have them snatched away without explanation is to leave lives suspended in confusion and despair.” Soneye argued
    


        The implications are wide-reaching. Each revoked visa represents not only an individual setback but also a blow to Nigeria's international business and professional networks. Entrepreneurs lose access to global markets, students face uncertainty over study plans, and families are left grappling with missed reunions.
    


        Shipping, oil and gas, and tech executives, sectors heavily reliant on U.S. ties, are particularly exposed.
    


        In the absence of transparency, speculation is filling the void. Some see the cancellations as fallout from shifting U.S.–Africa relations under Trump.
    


        Others suggest bureaucratic overreach or unannounced security screening measures.
    


        But until officials in Washington or Abuja break their silence, thousands of Nigerians remain stranded in uncertainty and holding visas that no longer open doors.

In this article

President Donald Trump on Monday called on pharmaceutical companies to ""justify the success"" of their Covid drugs days after the Food and Drug Administration set new limits on who can receive vaccines for the virus.

""It is very important that the Drug Companies justify the success of their various Covid Drugs. Many people think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives. Others disagree!"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

The FDA on Wednesday approved the latest round of Covid vaccines, but only for people at higher risk of severe illness.

The president's comments also come days after he fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez after she refused to resign. Four other top health officials at the CDC also announced they were quitting the agency last week, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

""With CDC being ripped apart over this question, I want the answer, and I want it NOW,"" Trump said in the post. 

""I have been shown information from Pfizer, and others, that is extraordinary, but they never seem to show those results to the public. Why not???"" the president wrote.

The leadership upheaval at the CDC follows a series of measures by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to overhaul federal health agencies and change U.S. immunization policies. He has instituted mass firings, gutted a key government vaccine panel and canceled studies on mRNA shot technology.

Trump urged drug companies to be more transparent about their results to ""clear up this MESS,"" writing that drugmakers ""let everyone rip themselves apart, including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC, trying to figure out the success or failure of the Drug Companies Covid work.""

Trump in the post also continued to tout Operation Warp Speed, his first administration's pandemic vaccine effort launched in May 2020 to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of Covid vaccines and therapeutics.

Yet Kennedy — a prominent vaccine skeptic — has downplayed the efficacy of vaccinations. 

In a guest essay published in the New York Times on Monday, a group of nine former directors and acting directors of the CDC said Kennedy is ""endangering"" Americans' health.

""What [Kennedy] has done to the C.D.C. and to our nation's public health system over the past several months — culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as C.D.C. director days ago — is unlike anything we have ever seen at the agency, and unlike anything our country has ever experienced,"" the group wrote. 

""We are worried about the wide-ranging impact that all these decisions will have on America's health security,"" they said.

A document detailing plans for post-war Gaza aims to make President Donald Trump's ""Gaza Riviera"" vision a reality — using mass displacement, artificial intelligence, and at least a decade of U.S. trusteeship over the war-ravaged enclave.

The plan, outlined in a 38-page document initially disclosed by the Washington Post, is reportedly under consideration by Trump's administration. It involves ""voluntary"" relocation of Gaza's population in exchange for digital tokens, six to eight ""AI-powered smart cities,"" and a manufacturing hub named after Elon Musk.

It also calls for the entirety of Gaza's population of two million to be relocated, at least temporarily, through either what it calls voluntary departures to another country, or the moving of residents into temporary housing areas within the Strip during reconstruction.

The plan was developed by some of the same Israelis behind the controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), according to the Washington Post, which first reported on the document. The GHF, whose stated goal is to provide food inside the enclave, has received heavy criticism from U.N. experts for allegedly being ""exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law.""

The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.

Gaza would be under U.S. trusteeship for around ten years ""until a reformed and deradicalized Palestinian Polity is ready to step in its shoes,"" according to the plan, entitled the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust. It promises to transform the long-blockaded territory, on which more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, 2023, into a glittering tourism resort and tech hub.

""Reconstruction will also increase value of Gaza by ~$324B and dramatically improve quality of life,"" the document states. The GREAT Trust would begin under an initial U.S.-Israel bilateral agreement, and Israel would maintain ""overarching rights to meet its security needs,"" according to the document.

The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.

The authors of the plan claim that no federal funding or donations would be required; it would instead be financed by private and public sector investment in what it describes as ""mega-projects,"" from data centers and electric vehicle factories to luxury apartments and seaside resorts.

The development plan also envisions using roughly 30% of Gazan land that is public — leased to the Trust for up to 99 years — and any investments as its initial capital and assets, which it claims constitutes a $300 billion asset value with ""self-generating revenue streams.""

Gazans who choose to relocate to another country would be given a $5,000 relocation package, four years of rent subsidies, and one year of food subsidies, according to the document. The plan assumes that 25% of Gazans would choose to leave the country, and of those, 75% would choose not to return.

The plan claimed that this method would save $23,000 on every Palestinian relocating compared to costs of supporting those who stay inside Gaza. At no point does the document address international law, Palestinian opposition to mass relocation, or opposition to this plan by other Arab states, who have long demanded a state and self-determination for Palestinians.

The plan's ""end state"" is Gaza's ""self-governance under the Abraham Accords"" — a framework that establishes diplomatic relations with Israel — though there is no mention of an officially recognized Palestinian state.

Gaza residents who leave land that they own would also receive a ""digital token"" by the GREAT Trust in exchange for the right to develop their property, and can ""redeem their tokens for ownership of rebuilt residences,"" according to the plan.

Trump first announced his vision of a ""Gaza Riviera"" under U.S. ownership in February, drawing swift condemnation and shock from international leaders, and Middle Eastern allies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular. Rights groups have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza, charges that the Israeli government forcefully denies. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised Trump's idea.

The U.N. estimated in April that roughly 92% of all residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war, which began after militant and political group Hamas, which governs the enclave, carried out a cross-border attack on Israel that killed roughly 1,200 people.

Hamas for its part vocally rejected the proposal on Monday, with its political bureau member Bassem Naim saying that ""Gaza is not for sale"" and is ""part of the greater Palestinian homeland.""

In this article

The Duane Arnold nuclear plant northwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa is pressing ahead with plans to restart operations by the end of the decade after shutting down for economic reasons in 2020.

The plant is the third – and likely the last – mothballed reactor in the U.S. that is in shape to come back online to support growing electricity demand in the U.S.

Duane Arnold would follow similar restarts planned for the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which plan to resume operations later this year and in 2027, respectively, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a request last week from NextEra Energy, Duane Arnold's owner, to let the nuclear plant reconnect to the electric grid. NextEra sees Duane Arnold restarting operations by the fourth quarter of 2028 at the earliest, according to FERC filings.

""While a significant amount of work needs to be done before the facility could be restarted, FERC's decision is another positive step in the process,"" Neil Nissan, a NextEra spokesperson, said in a statement to CNBC.

With big technology companies looking to feed more nuclear power on to the grid to fuel the electricity-hungry data centers they are building to train artificial intelligence, Florida-based NextEra is aiming to win a lucrative power purchase agreement to restart Duane Arnold. Three Mile Island, for example, is restarting with financial support from a power agreement with Microsoft.

""The recommissioning of Duane Arnold has received significant commercial interest from premier American companies,"" Garrett Goldfinger, the NextEra executive in charge of the restart project, told FERC in a late July filing.

Duane Arnold would bring more than 600 megawatts of electricity back to the grid, equivalent to the electricity needs of more than 400,000 homes.

""If we're successful in bringing Duane forward, that obviously creates a hot bed of data center activity around that facility,"" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors on the company's July earnings call.

Duane Arnold, Palisades and Three Mile Island are three of the 10 U.S. reactors that closed over the past decade as nuclear power strained to compete against cheap natural gas and renewable energy.

Restarting these plants is the most concrete sign yet that the nuclear industry is coming back after years of financial struggles.

""These are unique opportunities because you don't face the new build costs associated with nuclear,"" Ketchum said on NextEra's earnings call. ""These are really unicorn-type opportunities.""

NextEra, the largest renewable power developer in the U.S., had previously divided up Duane Arnold's grid connection among multiple solar farms that the company was developing in response to the demand in Iowa for lower cost electricity.

But the market last year started to shift back in favor of high-capacity nuclear power as the U.S. saw an unprecedented increase in electricity demand from industry and data centers, NextEra said in its filing to FERC.

NextEra is now consolidating those solar grid connections back into a single one for Duane Arnold after securing FERC approval. This will ""provide commercial and financial certainty to support the recommissioning effort and expedite the resumption of clean, reliable operations at Duane Arnold,"" Goldfinger told FERC.

NextEra said the restart of Duane Arnold will be a ""highly capital-intensive process."" It disclosed in its filing to FERC that it plans on spending as much as $100 million in 2025 alone on the project.

NextEra has placed orders for new transformers to replace the ones that were removed when the plant was shut down, although the transformers face significant supply chain constraints and will take about three years to deliver. The plant's cooling towers, administration building and training center were also dismantled and need to be replaced.

The nuclear industry has a long history of projects delays, Goldfinger cautioned, and the Duane Arnold restart could take longer than expected if the transformers, for example, are delivered late.

While there are risks, Duane Arnold represents a financial opportunity for NextEra, the parent company of Florida Power & Light. The stock has barely moved this year despite growing power demand, a sharp reversal from 2024 when shares jumped 18% Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on renewable energy have shaken investor confidence in solar and wind power. 

Solar and wind projects will no longer be eligible for two key tax credits after 2027, which is expected to crimp demand for renewables. Duane Arnold restarting in 2028 could help offset some of the lost earnings from the phase out of the tax credits, Ketchum said on the July earnings call.

""You add Duane Arnold to the mix and that's one of many ways that we have to continue to grow the business in the future,"" Ketchum said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he will punish Russia and President Vladimir Putin if Moscow doesn't come to the table and agree to peace talks or a ceasefire with Ukraine.

Russia has shown no signs of intending to do either, instead continuing and increasing its attacks on Ukraine as it looks to consolidate gains on the battlefield.

And still, Trump is holding off on releasing a big bazooka of extra sanctions and economic punishment that could hurt an already weakened Russia.

The reason for the standstill is strategic and goes beyond Russia, according to analysts, who warn the longer Trump holds off, the more he's undermining his and the U.S.' position.

""The Russian budget is actually under a lot of pressure... so if there were to be any more significant sanctions targeting Russian oil trade from the U.S. — which they've talked about but not done — that would put the budget under greater pressure. It hasn't happened,"" Chris Weafer, the chief executive of Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, told CNBC Monday.

There were two significant factors behind Trump's reticence, Weafer said: the president's desire to be seen as a peace-broker, and concerns over pushing Russia deeper into China's orbit.

""Trump still thinks he can bring both sides to the table, that he could broker a peace deal, and that he can take credit for moving the conflict towards peace. And bearing in mind that the announcement on the Nobel Peace Prize will come in early October, it's a factor, because we know the character of the of the individual,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""The second reason ... is there is a sense that if Russia is defeated, if Russia is completely isolated by the West, and there's no way back in terms of engaging with the U.S. and Europe, then it has no choice but to go even further all-in with China, and that potentially then would strengthen China's position.""

Bringing Russia and Beijing closer together would mean that the latter had ""almost unlimited"" access to energy resources, industrial materials and to the Arctic, the analyst said, noting that this could effectively block the U.S. from Russian-controlled parts of the Arctic.

It would also allow China greater access to Russian military technology, such as stealth submarines, and further opportunities in space exploration.

Officials in Washington were concerned about that, Weafer noted, adding, ""they don't want Russia to be essentially a more formal subsidiary of China. They want it to be more in the middle with engagement in the West. I think that's one reason why they're treading carefully for now.""

CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment on its strategy toward Moscow and is awaiting a response.

Ukraine, meanwhile, has watched as Trump has let self-imposed deadlines to act against Russia pass, with Kyiv left crestfallen at perceived missed opportunities to pressure Putin into a ceasefire.

""Ukrainians had hoped that Trump's August 8 deadline for Putin to accept a cease-fire would provide more constant air defense,"" John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and the head of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said in analysis in August.

Yet, they were disappointed when Trump let Putin cross his August 8 deadline to end the fighting without consequences. ""Instead, Trump focused on summitry with Putin, which has yet to yield Russian flexibility,"" Herbst wrote.

""Now they are gritting their teeth and, with many of their European partners, waiting for White House officials to realize that Russia is playing them — and to take the strong measures that Trump promised if Russia continued its war on Ukraine,"" he added.

Beijing and Moscow's leaders were seen to be putting on a display of bonhomie at the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit on Monday. The SCO is being attended by 20 foreign leaders, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Against a backdrop of war in Ukraine, Trump's tariffs and continuing oil trade, the major economies of China, Russia and India have deepened their economic and political ties while their respective relations with the West have frayed.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday urged his fellow leaders attending the summit to strengthen their cooperation, and called on them to reject what he called a ""Cold War mentality.""

Meanwhile, Putin told the SCO that his meeting with Trump in August had opened a path to finding a way to resolving the Ukrainian ""crisis,"" as he described the more than three-year war. Yet he thanked Russia's Asian allies for their support throughout the war.

""We value the efforts and propositions to solve the Ukrainian crisis of China, India and other strategic partners of ours. The mutual understanding that was reached at a recent Russia-U.S. summit in Alaska heads the same direction, I hope. It paves the way to peace in Ukraine, I hope.""

Summits like the SCO were creating a new political and socio-economic ecosystem that could replace the ""outdated"" Euro-Atlantic-centered power model, Putin said.

This new system ""would take into account the interests of a maximum number of countries and would be truly balanced,"" meaning ""a system in which one group of countries would not ensure its security at the expense of the others.""

Norwegian oil giant Equinor on Monday pledged to support Denmark's Orsted with almost $1 billion of fresh capital, backing the beleaguered company amid sustained attacks on offshore wind projects from the Trump administration.

In an apparent show of confidence in the world's largest offshore wind developer, Equinor signaled its intention to participate in Orsted's planned 60 billion Danish krone ($9.4 billion) rights issue and said it intended to hold on to its 10% ownership in the company.

Equinor said its strategic support of the rights issue reflects its confidence in Orsted's underlying business and the competitiveness of offshore wind in the future energy mix. The state-backed Norwegian energy group is the second largest shareholder in Orsted, behind the Danish government.

As part of the move, Equinor said it would nominate a candidate to Orsted's board of directors.

Shares of Orsted rose 3.6% on the news, before paring gains. The stock price, which is down nearly 90% from a 2021, peak notched a fresh record low last month after the Trump administration ordered the company to halt work on a near complete windfarm.

Equinor shares were last seen 0.2% higher on Monday morning.

Both companies have been navigating challenges around the offshore wind industry, with Equinor saying it is closely monitoring developments in the U.S., and that it intends to remain in dialogue with Orsted.

The wind industry has been a target for U.S. President Donald Trump since his first day in office. The latest blow came on Friday when the U.S. Department of Transportation canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen infrastructure projects that would support offshore wind power nationwide.

""Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Equinor's move to support Orsted could be seen as a first step for the company considering the possibility of a potential merger between the two offshore wind portfolios.

""The challenge with participating fully is that the company will effectively increase its net exposure to two 100%-owned US offshore wind projects, neither of which look likely to be farmed down in the near term, and where political support remains uncertain,"" analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a research note.

""The incremental positive is that alongside its maintained shareholding, Equinor will now be having board representation, making the most of a challenging situation,"" they added.

Spokespeople for Equinor and Orsted did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Indonesia is facing a tough political climate, as it grapples with protests over rising living costs, lawmakers' pay and police violence, hurting investor sentiment in Southeast Asia's largest economy.

The Jakarta Composite Index fell as much as 3.6% on Monday, while the Indonesian rupiah depreciated to 16,500 against the U.S. dollar — its weakest intra-day level since Aug. 1 — according to LSEG data.

While the violence and protests have rattled investors confidence, they are unlikely to challenge the underlying growth story for Indonesia, several market watchers said.

The latest selloff was primarily ""sentiment driven,"" as investors reacted to developments over the weekend, said Howe Chung Wan, managing director and head of Asian fixed income at Principal Fixed Income.

Indonesia still ranks among the more stable emerging markets, Howe said, shrugging off impact from the demonstrations as a near-term setback. ""I don't think it completely changes the story at this point.""

The near-term potential softness for rupiah is expected to be temporary and will likely reverse when domestic uncertainties fade, according to Christopher Wong, FX analyst at OCBC Bank. He refrained from giving more precise forecasts, citing heightened uncertainty.

It was unclear if demonstrations in Jakarta or other cities will continue on Monday, with some Indonesian students and civil society groups having called off protests to avoid any violent escalation by authorities.

Investors will watch the government's next steps to address the public's demands and improve market confidence, said Ari Jahja, head of Indonesia research, Macquarie Capital. ""On slight positive side, Indonesia could emerge stronger if structural reforms are executed.""

Radhika Rao, economist at DBS, agreed that the long-term growth drivers remain intact for Indonesia. Investors will watch for any signs of the government's priority to boost growth and jobs, she said, expecting part of Jakarta's spending cuts could be redirected to alleviate unemployment.

Bank Indonesia still has ample room to keep policy accommodative, she said, expecting the central bank to act swiftly to calm markets and step in to support the rupiah when it's due.

Yields on Indonesia's 10-year government bonds ticked higher to 6.335 on Monday while yields on the 30-year debts were little changed at 6.850, according to LSEG data.

Thousands of protestors in several major cities in the Southeast Asian nation have rallied for for about a week, demonstrating against increasing cost of living, high unemployment rate and what many see as excessive pay for lawmakers.

Lawmakers' housing allowances which are said to be 10 times the country's monthly minimum wage at a time when tax hikes, layoffs and inflation have hit lower-income Indonesians, have been key to stoking public anger. 

That discontent over economic hardship has morphed into a broader outrage after a motorcycle taxi driver was reportedly killed during police action at a protest site last Thursday. That incident set off a wave of violent protests across several Indonesian cities, calling for a police reform.

Protests intensified over the weekend, with rioters targeting the homes of lawmakers, ransacking and looting properties, and burning government buildings, according to media reports. Hundreds of people reportedly stormed finance minister Sri Mulyani's residence in South Tangerang, forcing their way in and taking away valuables.

In an attempt to quell the public anger, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto said on Sunday the country's parliament would listen and act on people's concerns, pledging to curb hefty allowances for lawmakers.

Indonesia, the world's fourth-largest economy with a population of 284 million, had been seen as one of Southeast Asia's most stable economies. The latest protests, which killed at least five and injured hundreds, created the worst crisis for the country since Subianto took office about a year ago.

""This moment represents a key test for Prabowo's approach to dissent,"" said Bob Herrera-Lim, managing director at political consultancy Teneo. ""The president may worry that continuing to yield ground on the streets for more than a few days may generate the impression that he is encouraging a popular opposition to emerge to challenge his government""

The president has warned that firm action will be taken against violent demonstrators. ""We cannot deny that signs of extrajudicial, even unlawful, actions are beginning to emerge, some even leading to treason and terrorism,"" he reportedly said, while ordering the military and police to take stern action against rioters and looters.

As if the ever-changing trade mandates from U.S. President Donald Trump weren't hard enough for companies, here comes a new complication: the federal appeals court.

On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Trump's imposition of ""reciprocal"" tariffs on countries, as well as those on China, Canada and Mexico ostensibly in relation to fentanyl trafficking, was an overreach of his authority.

That said, those tariffs will be allowed to persist until Oct. 14 so that the Trump administration has time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

At first blush, this development might seem to benefit stocks, which have already had a rip-roaring August. For the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced over 3% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6%.

However, tariffs flickering on and off might be more anxiety-inducing than the certainty of planning strategies around tackling those duties.

And that means potential volatility in markets. August's gains could be tested in September — the worst month for the S&P 500, historically speaking. Investors might hope to score consecutive months of gains but, at this moment, the added uncertainty around trade policies might diminish those chances.

— CNBC's Erin Doherty contributed to this report

Most Trump tariffs are illegal, U.S. appeals court rules on Friday. Nevertheless, the court allowed the tariffs to run until Oct. 14 to give the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Here are the tariffs affected by the ruling.

Reject 'Cold War mentality,' Xi Jinping says. The Chinese president made that remark at a security conference on Sunday, which comes as Beijing seeks to portray itself as a peacemaker amid persistent global trade tensions with the White House.

China's factory activity unexpectedly expands in August. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 50.5, sharply beating the 49.7 estimate in a Reuters poll. The reading's the highest since March and beats July's 49.5.

U.S. stocks had a winning August. Major U.S. indexes notched solid gains for the month. On Monday, Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba jumped on better-than-expected quarterly income, but BYD shares in Hong Kong fell amid a sharp drop in profit in the June quarter.

[PRO] August jobs number in focus. After July's dismal report made Trump fire the U.S. commissioner of labor statistics, investors will keep a close eye on August's report, out Friday, not just for the data but also the president's reaction.

Here's what it really means for Trump to get control of the Federal Reserve board

President Donald Trump's effort to sack Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is about more than firing someone: It's a maneuver that, if successful, would mark a seismic shift for an institution that for ages has been considered above politics.

Should Trump get a majority of members on the board of governors to vote the way he wants — and the evidence right now, to be sure, is scant that he can ever achieve such a goal — it would give him access to key levers that control the economy as well as the nation's financial infrastructure.

More political and economic uncertainty, and even a coup, may be on the horizon for Thailand after the removal of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Friday, analysts told CNBC.

She was dismissed on Friday for an ethics violation, following her suspension in July after a leaked phone call between her and former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen emerged.

The phone call revealed she criticized a Thai military commander overseeing a border dispute with Cambodia while appearing to appease the Cambodian strongman.

Fighting erupted between Thailand and Cambodia in late July, although a ceasefire was reached five days into the conflict.

Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNBC that there will be ""chaos in the short term.""

One possibility, he said, is that ""Pheu Thai keeps it together and has a tiny majority in Parliament that could collapse at any time, with some kind of weak placeholder PM like Chaikasem Nitisiri,"" he added, referring to Paetongtarn's ruling Pheu Thai Party.

Nitisiri, who is also part of the Pheu Thai party, had run for the prime minister post in 2019 and 2023, having been Thailand's justice minister in 2013.

Another possibility, Kurlantzick said, is an ""unwieldly coalition"" formed by another party, such as the Bhumjaithai Party, counting on the support of the People's Party — formerly the Move Forward Party.

But he added that this ""almost never works in any country, and probably wouldn't work in Thailand.""

Early Monday, Reuters reported that the People's Party was due to meet to decide whom it will back to form the next government.

The Bhumjaithai Party had quit Paetongtarn's governing coalition on June 18, after the call with Hun Sen was revealed. Bhumjaithai's leader Anutin Charnvirakul was reported by Reuters to have shuttled between parties, offering pledges such as calling an election within four months.

However, analysts from Nomura said Charnvirakul has a lower chance of taking the prime minister spot than Nitisiri, pointing out that the Bhumjaithai Party has about 70 fewer seats in Parliament than Pheu Thai.

The analysts said if Nitisiri is elected, the status quo of the PT-led government will remain in place, but they also highlighted the risk of early elections being called in early 2026, because the ruling coalition commands a relatively small majority amid rising political uncertainty.

""Nonetheless, the elections, in our view, are unlikely to provide a permanent solution and may instead prolong political uncertainty further,"" Nomura added.

But that political weakness could raise the possibility of another military coup, Kurlantzick warned. The country experienced coups in 2006 and 2014.

The 2006 takeover ousted Paetongtarn's father Thaksin Shinawatra, and the 2014 coup followed the Constitutional Court's removal of Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister.

Kurlantzick told CNBC that if Parliament collapses, a snap election will be called. The military does not want that, and neither does the king, in his view.

""In a free snap election, Move Forward, the progressive party devoted to military reform and reform of the monarchy, would have a very good chance of winning an absolute majority in Parliament and picking the PM. That would be a disaster for the military and palace,"" he said.The Move Forward Party, under leader Pita Limjaroenrat, had won the most seats in the House of Representatives election in the 2023 general election, but was unable to form a government.

The party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court in August 2024, on grounds that it had violated the Constitution by proposing to amend Thailand's lèse-majesté law.

Kurlantzick said that ""if Parliament falls, the military may feel that there is no other option than a coup,"" highlighting that Thailand has seen two coups since 2006. ""It's a very real possibility.""His view is supported by a December 2024 paper by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, which said that Thailand's military, monarchy, and traditional elites view electoral democracy as a threat to their control.

""They see themselves as guardians of national stability, often viewing the largely rural, populist electorate as unprepared for informed political participation.""

That, the paper added, ""has fueled repeated military coups to dismantle democratic governments whenever they challenge the status quo, enabling elites to safeguard their power and shape politics to their advantage.""

On the economic front, political instability may be a drag on Thailand's efforts to revive its economy, which is grappling with tariffs from the Trump administration and one of the worst-performing markets in Asia. The SET index has fallen 11.7% in the year to date.

DBS Bank senior economist Radhika Rao said that growth for Thailand has been on the ""softer side,"" but that the central bank is still expected to cut rates to support growth.

Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday, Rao said that Thailand could experience a slowdown in the second half of the year.

Nomura analysts forecast a gross domestic product growth of 1.8%, saying that the tariff impact in the second half will worsen the negative feedback loop between tight financial conditions and weak economic activity.

The 1.8% figure is in line with the World Bank's downgraded expectation in July. The World Bank had sharply cut Thailand's full-year growth forecast for 2025 to 1.8%, down from 2.9%, and also cut its 2026 projection to 1.7% from 2.7%. Thailand's economy grew 2.5% in 2024.

The political uncertainty and growth weakness have led Nomura's analysts to expect a sovereign credit rating downgrade in the coming quarters by Moody's.

In April, Moody's revised the rating outlook for Thailand to negative from stable, flagging rising political uncertainty and sustained growth weakness. Moody's sovereign credit rating for Thailand currently stands at Baa1.

In this article

Alibaba's Hong Kong listed shares surged more than 19% on Monday as the Chinese tech giant's cloud computing unit drove strong quarterly results, while details emerged over its new AI chip development.

It's the highest level for the stock since March. Investors have backed the company's improving performance in its key cloud unit and are content with the the tech giant's investment into new areas — particularly in the so-called ""instant commerce,"" which has become incredibly competitive in China.

The Hong Kong rally builds on the momentum of Alibaba's earnings report of Friday, when the company's New York-listed shares closed nearly 13% higher.

Alibaba last week week posted revenue for the June quarter of 247.65 billion Chinese yuan ($34.73 billion), marking a 2% year-on-year rise that nevertheless missed analyst expectations. On the upside, a 78% annual surge in net income came in ahead of forecasts.

The Chinese company's cloud computing unit was a bright spot with revenue picking up by an annual 26%, which was a faster growth rate than seen in the previous quarter. Alibaba's cloud growth has been accelerating over the last few quarter.

Like some of its Chinese and U.S. tech rivals, Alibaba has been investing in AI infrastructure and developing its own models, as well as selling AI services for its cloud computing unit. Investors see the division as key to the company's efforts to monetize artificial intelligence, much like Microsoft or Google.

AI-related product revenue ""maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter,"" the company said Friday.

That same day, CNBC reported that Alibaba is developing a new AI chip, which also supported the share price rally on Monday.

Alibaba's core e-commerce business has meanwhile been showing signs of revival, while the company has jumped into China's cut-throat instant commerce space in China. This is a feature introduced this year on Taobao, one of Alibaba's main Chinese e-commerce apps, which provides deliveries of certain products in China within an hour.

Investments in quick commerce weighed on Alibaba's adjusted earnings for its e-commerce business. Investors have given the company some leeway to invest for now.

One of Afghanistan's worst earthquakes killed more than 800 people and injured at least 2,800, authorities said on Monday, as rescuers struggled to reach remote areas due to rough mountainous terrain and inclement weather.

The disaster will further stretch the resources of the war-torn nation's Taliban administration, already grappling with crises ranging from a sharp drop in foreign aid to deportations of hundreds of thousands of Afghans by neighboring countries.

Sharafat Zaman, spokesperson for the health ministry in Kabul, called for international aid to tackle the devastation wrought by the quake of magnitude 6 that struck around midnight local time, at a depth of 10 km (6 miles).

""We need it because here lots of people lost their lives and houses,"" he told Reuters.

The quake killed 812 people in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar, administration spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.

Ziaul Haq Mohammadi, a student at Al-Falah University in the eastern city of Jalalabad, was studying in his room at home when the quake struck. He said he tried to stand up but was knocked over by the power of the tremor.

""We spent the whole night in fear and anxiety because at any moment another earthquake could happen,"" Mohammadi said.

Rescuers were battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the Pakistani border, where mudbrick homes dotting the slopes collapsed in the quake.

""The area of the earthquake was affected by heavy rain in the last 24-48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides and rock slides is also quite significant - that is why many of the roads are impassable,"" Kate Carey, an officer at the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Reuters.

Rescue teams and authorities are trying to dispose of animal carcasses quickly so as to minimize the risk of contamination to water resources, Carey said.

Casualties could rise as rescue teams access more isolated locations, authorities said.

""All our ... teams have been mobilized to accelerate assistance, so that comprehensive and full support can be provided,"" said health ministry spokesperson Abdul Maten Qanee, citing efforts in areas from security to food and health.

Reuters Television images showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped security forces and medics carry the wounded to ambulances in an area with a long history of earthquakes and floods.

Military rescue teams fanned out across the region, the defense ministry said in a statement, with 40 flights carrying away 420 wounded and dead.

The quake razed three villages in Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, authorities said. At least 610 people were killed in Kunar with 12 dead in Nangarhar, they added.

It was Afghanistan's third major deadly quake since the Taliban took over in 2021 as foreign forces withdrew, triggering a cut to the international funding that formed the bulk of government finances.

Diplomats and aid officials say crises elsewhere in the world, along with donor frustration over the Taliban's policies towards women, including curbs on those who are aid workers, have spurred the cuts in funding.

Even humanitarian aid, aimed at bypassing political institutions to serve urgent needs, has shrunk to $767 million this year, down from $3.8 billion in 2022.

Humanitarian agencies say they are fighting a forgotten crisis in Afghanistan, where the United Nations estimates more than half the population is in urgent need of humanitarian aid.

""So far, no foreign governments have reached out to provide support for rescue or relief work,"" a spokesperson of Afghanistan's foreign office said on Monday.

Later, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said it was ready to provide disaster relief assistance ""according to Afghanistan's needs and within its capacity"".

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India said it had delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tons of food material to Kunar, with more relief material to be sent from India starting Tuesday.

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said its mission in Afghanistan was preparing to help those in areas devastated by the quake. Pope Leo also sent condolences for the dead.

A 6.1-magnitude earthquake that killed 1,000 people in the eastern region in 2022 was the first major natural disaster faced by the Taliban government.

Humanitarian officials and locals say almost two years after a powerful tremor hit the western city of Herat, many villages are still recovering and living in temporary structures.

Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.

Quakes in Afghanistan tend to be so deadly because of building construction that is often vulnerable to shaking, and the number of people living in the Hindu Kush, said Richard Walker, professor of tectonics at the University of Oxford.

Sometimes one photograph tells the story better than any communique or summit declaration.

A widely shared clip of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin laughing together in Tianjin has already gone viral.

On the surface, it appears to be an easy exchange between three leaders. But analysts say it reflects a delicate mix of competing rivalries and shifting power dynamics.

Gautam Bambawale, India's former ambassador to China, told CNBC's Inside India: ""The dragon and the elephant are not dancing as yet. They are just looking at each other from opposite sides of a room and trying to assess what are the implications of the relationship between the two? It's going to take time to bring the relationship back on track.""

The obstacles are clear. The border dispute between India and China remains unresolved since the 2020 clashes. Beijing's close partnership with Pakistan — extending beyond economic corridors into military equipment and intelligence cooperation — further constrains how far ties can develop.

This week's Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit gave the photograph its backdrop. The SCO is expanding in size and ambition, but as Jeremy Chan at Eurasia Group pointed out, more prominence does not necessarily mean more relevance.

""The SCO, while it's generally described as a security organization, really doesn't focus on military matters per se, and on all of the global conflicts that have taken place recently, whether that's Ukraine or in Gaza, the SCO has essentially been absent,"" Chan told CNBC.

The timing of the meeting is also notable. With U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and unsettling global markets, Beijing is using the SCO to emphasize its outreach to the Global South. Chan said Trump is ""breathing new life"" into the summit, giving China a chance to frame its diplomacy as more dependable than Washington's.

On Monday, Trump posted on Truth Social, saying that India had offered to reduce it's tariffs to U.S. goods to zero. Describing the relationship with India as one-sided, Trump said the U.S. is India's biggest client.

""The reason is that India has charged us, until now, such high Tariffs, the most of any country, that our businesses are unable to sell into India. It has been a totally one sided disaster! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the U.S. They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it's getting late. They should have done so years ago,"" Trump posted.

Meanwhile, the photo-op has also drawn scrutiny in U.S. media. The New York Times described the interaction as a ""smiling manifestation of a troika that Moscow had recently said it hoped to revive,"" noting the optics of closeness between Modi and Putin, who even shared a ride to a meeting on the sidelines. The report argued that India's traditionally cautious bureaucracy might once have avoided such overt displays with China and Russia, but Trump's sweeping tariffs leave New Delhi with ""little incentive"" to hold back.

For investors, the stakes are significant. The SCO brings together economies representing nearly half the world's population, central to energy and trade flows. With tariffs threatening supply chains and markets watching for signs of fragmentation, summits like these are closely watched for signals of new alignments, even if substantive outcomes are limited.

For India, the optics carry weight. Modi's talks with Xi were interpreted as a reminder to Washington that India is willing to maintain dialogue with Beijing and Moscow while deepening ties with the U.S. and its allies. But New Delhi's decision to skip the SCO military parade underscored the limits of any thaw.

""India is using this to opportunistically send a signal indirectly to Washington, that it has strategic options, not only in Beijing, but also in Moscow,"" Chan said. Modi's quick exit from the summit, immediately after arriving from Tokyo, also underlined India's continued engagement with U.S. partners in Asia.

At the heart of the summit was a debate over ""multipolarity,"" Chan said, adding that the definition of multipolarity is different for India and China.

Beijing defines it as a system where U.S. dominance is reduced, allowing China greater scope to assert itself as Asia's leading power. India, by contrast, sees multipolarity as influence spread more evenly across many countries, with no single state in control, Chan told CNBC's Inside India.

Meanwhile, for Russia, the SCO remains one of the few international platforms where Putin is not on the defensive, underscoring Moscow's enduring ties with influential Asian partners despite Western sanctions.

The photograph captures all of this in a single frame. The smiles suggest harmony, but the reality is far more complex.

As if the ever-changing trade mandates from U.S. President Donald Trump weren't hard enough for companies, here comes a new complication: the federal appeals court.

On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Trump's imposition of ""reciprocal"" tariffs on countries, as well as those on China, Canada and Mexico ostensibly in relation to fentanyl trafficking, was an overreach of his authority.

That said, those tariffs will be allowed to persist until Oct. 14 so that the Trump administration has time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

On first blush, this development might seem to benefit stocks, which have already had a rip-roaring August. For the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced over 3% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6%.

However, tariffs flicking on and off might be more anxiety-inducing than the certainty of planning strategies around tackling those duties.

And that means potential volatility in markets. August's gains could be tested in September — the worst month for the S&P 500, historically speaking. Investors might hope to score consecutive months of gains but, at this moment, the added uncertainty around trade policies might diminish those chances.

— CNBC's Erin Doherty contributed to this report

Most Trump tariffs are illegal, U.S. appeals court rules on Friday. Nevertheless, the court allowed the tariffs to run until Oct. 14 to give the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Here are the tariffs affected by the ruling.

Core inflation in the U.S. ticked up in July. The personal consumption expenditures price index, released Friday, showed a 2.9% rise in prices on the year. While in line with expectations, the reading is the highest since February.

U.S. stocks had a winning August. Even though the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite fell on Friday, all notched solid gains for the month. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 0.64%, with most regional bourses in the red.

China and India could be partners instead of rivals, Xi Jinping says. The Chinese president made that remark at a security conference on Sunday, according to Xinhua. The sentiment was echoed by his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, Reuters reported.

[PRO] August jobs number in focus. After July's dismal report made Trump fire the U.S. commissioner of labor statistics, investors will keep a close eye on August's report, out Friday, not just for the data but also the president's reaction.

Here's what it really means for Trump to get control of the Federal Reserve board

President Donald Trump's effort to sack Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is about more than firing someone: It's a maneuver that, if successful, would mark a seismic shift for an institution that for ages has been considered above politics.

Should Trump get a majority of members on the board of governors to vote the way he wants — and the evidence right now, to be sure, is scant that he can ever achieve such a goal — it would give him access to key levers that control the economy as well as the nation's financial infrastructure.

TIANJIN, China — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday urged members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to strengthen artificial intelligence cooperation, while rejecting what he called a ""Cold War mentality.""

Xi was speaking at the largest-ever summit of the SCO to date, with more than 20 foreign leaders gathered in Tianjin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The meeting comes as China seeks to cast itself as a global peacemaker, against a backdrop of persistent trade tensions with the United States, Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Xi said China has invested $84 billion in other SCO countries and pledged support for 10,000 students to join Beijing's ""Luban"" vocational education program. He added that the SCO gathering presents an opportunity to chart a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation.

Ahead of his remarks, Xi briefly gathered with Modi and Putin during a photo session with all SCO members.

Xi is expected to meet with Putin this week, with the Russian leader scheduled to stay in China for a military parade in Beijing to commemorate 80 years since the end of World War II.

Over the weekend, Xi met with at least 10 visiting leaders, including Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet. On Saturday, he met Modi, with both sides affirming the importance of being partners, not rivals, according to official readouts.

""A stable relationship and cooperation between India and China and their 2.8 billion peoples on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity are necessary for the growth and development of the two countries,"" India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement following the meeting.

While it remains unclear if the SCO summit will pave the way for any breakthroughs in easing tensions, analysts said that China's détente with India could help strengthen Beijing's influence.

""The improvement of relations with India is a big deal. It allows India to access highly critical intellectual property that it needs if it is to industrialize and boost manufacturing,"" Marko Papic, chief strategist, GeoMacro Strategy BCA Access, said in an email.

""But, over the long term, the U.S. is losing the propaganda battle to paint China as the trouble-maker-in-chief. And that only further ossifies multipolarity,"" he said.

China has taken some ""initiative"" for economic collaboration as well as peace, said Henry Huiyao Wang, founder and president of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. He also pointed to efforts by China and India to rebuild ties and said he hoped India and Pakistan would do the same.

""[U.S.] President Trump is trying to make a lot of peace, but I think with the help of China, we could do the same too,"" Wang said Monday on CNBC's ""The China Connection.""

""China could take advantage of its good relations with Russia to help [broker] the deal for the Russian war in Ukraine,"" Wang said, adding that the SCO, or members like China and India, could act as a guarantor for security.

The SCO summit could lead to China building better relations with a slew of countries, Papic said.

SCO leaders signed a ""Tianjin Declaration"" and approved a development plan for the organization for the next decade through 2035, according to Chinese state media. Details of the text were not immediately available, although the report said members adopted 24 documents on strengthening cooperation on security, the economy and ""humanity.""

China will also establish cooperation platforms on new energy, green industry and digital economy, as well as centers for tech innovation, higher education and vocational education, Xi announced during a Monday afternoon session.

Later in the day, China's top diplomat Wang Yi said that the leaders agreed to launch the SCO Development Bank. He cast the financial institution as yet another multilateral bank. China has led the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is headquartered in Beijing.

""Global governance must be achieved by coordination and cooperation, not by unilateral bullying,"" Wang said in Mandarin, according to an official English translation, as he took a question about the Global Governance Initiative.

Xi's opening remarks during the Monday afternoon session included a proposal for a ""Global Governance Initiative"" without disclosing further details.

It follows similar programs that Xi has announced in the last few years, such as the ""Global Development Initiative"" and ""Global Security Initiative."" In late July, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced that the country has put forward an AI cooperation organization.

""The Cold War mentality, hegemonism and protectionism remain,“ despite 80 years of peace and cooperation since the end of World War II, Xi said in Mandarin, according to an official English translation. ""New threats and challenges are only increasing.""

""Global governance has come to a new crossroads,"" he said, urging ""commitment to peaceful coexistence"" without targeting third parties.

In the context of calling for uniform application of the international rule of law, the Chinese president said: that ""the house rules of a few countries should not be imposed upon others.""

The European Union (EU) on Monday said Russia was suspected of jamming the GPS system of a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Bulgaria on Sunday.

""We can indeed confirm that there was GPS jamming, but the plane landed safely in Bulgaria. We have received information from the Bulgarian authorities that they suspect that this was due to blatant interference by Russia,"" a European Commission spokesperson said at a press briefing Monday.

""We are of course aware and used to the threats and intimidations that are a regular component of Russia's hostile behavior, and of course this will only reinforce further our unshakeable commitment to ramp up defense capabilities and support for Ukraine,"" the spokesperson added.

The incident underlined the need to urgently invest in European defense and security, the spokesperson said.

Von der Leyen was on a plane chartered by the European Commission, the EU said. Asked by a reporter if the plane had been the intended target of the alleged GPS jamming — which prevents access to the satellite-based navigation system — the spokesperson said, ""I think the question is best asked to the Russians if indeed it is them that have carried it out.""

CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to the allegation. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Financial Times earlier that the information was ""incorrect,"" however.

CNBC has contacted the Bulgarian Air Traffic Services Authority for further information on the incident. However, an earlier statement to the FT read: ""Since February 2022, there has been a notable increase in [GPS] jamming and recently spoofing occurrences,"" it said. ""These interferences disrupt the accurate reception of [GPS] signals, leading to various operational challenges for aircraft and ground systems.""

Bulgaria's government on Monday issued a statement, reported by Sky News, saying that ""the satellite signal used for the aircraft's GPS navigation was disrupted."" 

""As the aircraft approached Plovdiv Airport, the GPS signal was lost,"" the statement added.

Something went wrong

Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) range of wild price swings has come down this year. The key reason? It may have to do with companies rapidly stockpiling the asset, according to JPMorgan strategists.

The largest cryptocurrency's three- and six-month rolling volatility, meaning the speed and extent of its price changes over those time periods, has fallen to a historically low level. This trend has continued even as bitcoin's price set new record highs in May, July, and August.

Bitcoin fell to $108,000 as of Friday afternoon, but jumped to over $109,000 on Monday. It's up over over 17% year to date.

""Corporate treasuries now hold over 6% of bitcoin's total supply and act as a form of private sector quantitative easing for crypto markets,"" JPMorgan global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a client note on Thursday.

""We believe a factor behind the collapse in bitcoin volatility has been the acceleration of bitcoin purchases by corporate treasuries,"" Panigirtzoglou added.

Over the roughly 16 years that bitcoin has been around, its market price has seen wild swings, often at magnitudes far greater than more widely held assets like bonds, gold, and many stocks and its still widely perceived as more volatile than those assets.

However, the range of its swings has been narrowing and a key factor has been the launch of new bitcoin-related financial products like futures contracts and exchange-traded funds that have brought in more investor groups.

This year, the biggest new wave has been public and private corporations seeking to put the crypto asset on their balance sheet in a play pioneered years ago by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) (formerly MicroStrategy).

Since the Tysons Corner, Va.-based enterprise software company started purchasing the digital asset in 2020, it has become a bitcoin juggernaut. And founder Saylor has made a name for himself as the evangelist of bitcoin adoption for corporates.

For example, from the president's own namesake, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), to video game retailer GameStop (GME), a Japanese hotel operator called Metaplanet (MTPLF), and others, these companies have picked up tens of billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin since the beginning of January, according to data aggregator Bitcoin Treasuries.

In July alone, public companies snapped up ""nearly two-thirds” of total bitcoin purchases among the biggest buyers: exchange-traded products, governments, and public and private companies, according to a recent Bitcoin Treasuries report.

Such a development may have wide implications for how much bitcoin other kinds of investors could own, according to JPMorgan's Panigirtzoglou.

By lowering bitcoin's volatility, these new buyers could make bitcoin ""more attractive from a valuation point of view,"" Panigirtzoglou said, adding that as its volatility drops, bitcoin could become a more competitive alternative to gold. While volatility doesn't equal outright investment risk, it represents a key component.

Between Washington, D.C., and Wall Street, the crypto world has already seen some major wins this year.

Earlier in August, crypto rallied after Trump signed an executive order that directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers blocking access to alternative assets and crypto from being offered in 401(K) other defined-contribution retirement plans.

Weeks before, Trump signed a bill that will allow US banks to issue their own dollar-pegged stablecoin. A week before big bank executives, including Citigroup's Jane Fraser and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, have said they are exploring that business.

And in late May, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to come up with a way for the government-sponsored mortgage companies to count crypto holdings as assets on mortgage applications.

While Michael Saylor's Strategy pioneered the gambit of rapidly acquiring crypto assets by issuing a mix of debt and equity years ago, more companies have joined the party this year.

That's due in part to a combination of less burdensome accounting rules and more favorable treatment of crypto by the Trump administration and the simple fact that Saylor's Strategy play has proven successful. Strategy's stock trades at a significant premium to the underlying bitcoin it holds.

Though the length of time that such a phenomenon can last remains a hotly debated topic, approximately 180 other companies have imitated the play.

Of that group, roughly a quarter had stocks trading below the value of the bitcoin they held as of August 22, according to Capriole Investments.

And it's not just bitcoin either.

Corporate treasuries have been loading up on cryptocurrencies such as ether and others in addition to bitcoin. And for those smaller tokens, the reaction so far hasn't been boring.

Trump's namesake media group announced plans to roll out another crypto treasury company just this past week through a partnership with crypto exchange Crypto.com.

Called Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, this company will hold Crypto.com's lesser-known trading platform and blockchain token Cronos (CRO-USD). The token's market capitalization has almost doubled to $9 billion since the Tuesday announcement.

Also known by critics as ""money printing,"" quantitative easing is a less conventional monetary policy tool that the US Federal Reserve used to support the economy during two of the country's most recent financial emergencies, the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis.

The measure is known to have significant repercussions, such as fueling riskier behavior that can lead to asset bubbles and even future inflation.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

A bitcoin whale made another sizable sale on Monday in a broader fund rotation from bitcoin to Ethereum.

Lookonchain, the on-chain analytics firm that has been tracking this specific large holder, reported that the wallet sold 2,000 BTC ($215 million) to acquire 48,942 ETH over the course of four hours earlier today.

On Sunday, Lookonchain reported that a whale trader sold 4,000 BTC to purchase 96,859 ETH over 12 hours. In total, the Bitcoin OG has purchased 886,317 ETH, which is equivalent to nearly $4 billion at the current market price.

The two transactions over the weekend are the latest in a series of similar transactions the wallet holder has made in August, following their emergence from a seven-year slumber. The whale initially held over $5 billion in bitcoin and bought $2.5 billion worth of Ethereum in a single week, according to Arkham Intelligence's previous report.



The whale rotation from BTC to ETH coincided with a similar rotation spotted among spot crypto exchange-traded funds. In August, spot bitcoin ETFs saw a total net outflow of $751 million, while Ethereum ETFs recorded $3.87 billion in monthly net inflows, according to SoSoValue data.

The cryptocurrency market has seen other notable whale activities in recent weeks, contributing to broader price movements, as analysts say that other traders often follow suit. In July, a whale moved and likely sold 80,000 BTC after a 15-year dormancy.

According to The Block's crypto price page, bitcoin rose 0.45% to trade at $109,551 as of 4:45 a.m. on Monday, while ether edged down 0.04% to $4,471.5.

BRC-20, the first token standard built directly on Bitcoin's base layer and indexers, has officially launched “BRC2.0” at Bitcoin block height 912690, which took place Monday morning.

The upgrade embeds EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) functionality directly into the BRC-20 core indexer, allowing developers to deploy Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin, without relying on bridges, oracles, or trusted intermediaries.

The move enables programmability to Bitcoin-native tokens, effectively turning BRC-20 assets into composable and interoperable instruments that can interact with EVM-compatible chains and scaling layers.

The BRC2.0 upgrade was developed by Best In Slot, a key infrastructure player in the Ordinals ecosystem, in collaboration with BRC20's pseudonymous creator Domo and the Layer 1 Foundation, the governance body overseeing the protocol.

“Bitcoin meta-protocols like Ordinals, Runes, and BRC20 run on indexers, which function like simple calculators,” Eril Binari Ezerel, CEO of Best In Slot, shared in a press release to Decrypt. “We upgraded this ‘calculator-style' indexer with EVM—making BRC20 Turing complete.”

Since its launch in early 2023, BRC-20 has seen over $3 billion in asset value traded. The milestone has been achieved without raising venture capital or receiving institutional support.

Even as activity cooled in 2025, BRC-20 volumes remained dominant, registering 5,636 BTC (US$633 million) in on-chain volume over the last six months, more than double Runes and nearly five times more than traditional Ordinals inscriptions.

The new smart contract functionality expands what's possible for Bitcoin-native assets.

Until now, these tokens have been primarily used for meme coins and speculative trading, with few real-world applications due to Bitcoin's limited programmability.

“Adoption of Bitcoin native assets has been stifled because there are no dApps on Bitcoin; it's just memes,” Ezerel added.  “One of the main goals of BRC2.0 is to bring Ethereum's more diverse application ecosystem onto Bitcoin.”

BRC2.0 enters a growing landscape of programmable Bitcoin layers, including the WASM-based Alkanes standard, which recently surged to represent nearly one-third of all meta-protocol related transactions in Q3.

So what does this mean for the current state of the Bitcoin fungible tokens market?

“The Bitcoin token market struggles because it is almost entirely meme coins, Asher Corson, CIO of Unbroken Chain, the first institution-backed liquid trading fund in the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem, told Decrypt.

“Programmability and DeFi will spark renewed interest, with profits likely rotating into inscriptions, potentially driving another bull run for Bitcoin assets,” he said.

Corson also explained how the move compares to Runes and how this places BRC-20 in a separate category.

“The BRC-20 2.0 upgrade introduces programmability. Runes is not programmable and is unlikely to ever be. This essentially limits Runes to meme coins. BRC-20 2.0, on the other hand, will be capable of supporting a DeFi ecosystem.”

The integration of EVM into BRC20's core layer means developers can now build dApps directly secured by Bitcoin, while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum tooling. No bridges, no wrapped assets—just native composability.

“The holy grail is combining the two gold standards: Bitcoin as the most decentralized and secure network, and the EVM as the most proven virtual machine,” Domo, the creator of BRC20, said. “The aim is to give users the Ethereum experience of composability and programmability, but secured by Bitcoin.”

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin regained $109,000 Monday morning following a weekend dip to $107,500, according to CoinGecko data.

Bitcoin's price action came after a CoinShares report noted that Ethereum inflows “dominate” institutional crypto inflows, which topped $4.37 billion in August.

Ethereum has dropped 1.5% on the day to $4,406, amid a broader 4.3% weekly downturn for the cryptocurrency. Despite this, according to CoinShares, ETH dominated inflows via digital asset investment products such as ETFs and ETPs.

The entire cryptocurrency market attracted weekly inflows of $2.48 billion, CoinShares said, with Ethereum accounting for $1.42 billion or 57.26% of all crypto inflows. By comparison, Bitcoin saw just $748 million worth of inflows, almost half that of Ethereum's. 

Zooming out to the month, this pattern is even more apparent. Ethereum has seen a monthly inflow of $3.96 billion, while Bitcoin has seen an outflow of $301 million. 

“$4.37 billion [crypto] inflows for August, Ethereum continues to dominate Bitcoin,” CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill wrote. He added that, “Inflows were strong throughout the week but turned negative on Friday after the release of Core PCE data, which failed to support expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, disappointing digital asset investors.”

Regardless of Ethereum's institutional inflow supremacy, the token has sagged more than Bitcoin over the week—down 4.3% compared to Bitcoin's 2% weekly drop. As a result, according to TradingView, Bitcoin dominance has traded sideways at around 58% over the past seven days as altcoins like Filecoin, Polygon, and Mantle posted weekly gains. 

Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin's market cap compared to the rest of the crypto market. It is often used as a measure of how strong altcoins like Ethereum are.

Predictors on Myriad Markets believe that it is almost a coin flip on whether Bitcoin dominance will pump to 63% or dump to 53% next. Just last week, predictors saw a 60% likelihood of it dropping, but it has since flipped to a 52% chance that Bitcoin dominance will hit the higher level next.

 

 

CoinShares noted that the U.S. dominated crypto inflows last week, drawing in $2.29 billion. “Positive sentiment was evident across most other regions as well, with Switzerland, Germany, and Canada seeing inflows of $109.4 million, $69.9 million, and $41.1 million respectively,” Butterfill said.

On Friday, crypto liquidations topped $500 million, as Bitcoin dropped 4%, Ethereum 6%, and XRP 6%. Butterfill noted that the broad regional spread of inflows indicates that outflows late last week were “more likely driven by profit-taking rather than signalling a more concerning trend for the asset class.”","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy After Sudden Whale Shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-after-whales-shift-from-bitcoin-to-ethereum/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 12:24:30 GMT","

Bitcoin has long been the darling of big-money crypto investors. But it looks like the winds are now shifting in favor of Ethereum.

For instance, a $BTC whale ‘Bitcoin OG' has been rotating funds from Bitcoin into Ethereum over the past month.

Similarly, on August 21, another whale sold 670 $BTC from a massive seven-year-old stash of 14,837 $BTC (worth $1.6B) to build long $ETH positions, buying 68,130 tokens.

This kind of large-scale institutional rotation underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum – the backbone of DeFi and Web3 – and highlights investors' eagerness to diversify.

Even better? Traditionally, a rise in $ETH allocations is followed by increased investment in altcoins, which is why many experts believe a new altcoin season could be just around the corner.

Read on as we explore Ethereum's path ahead and highlight the best altcoins to buy to make the most of this opportunity.

Ethereum exchange reserves are dwindling rapidly. Data from CryptoQuant shows that $ETH available on exchanges is now at an all-time low, suggesting aggressive accumulation on all fronts.

Another macro factor driving $ETH is the latest $WLFI (World Liberty Financial) token listing.

WLFI is a Trump-backed crypto investment firm, and a massive 66% ($328.20M) of its total holdings are in Ethereum. So, a strong listing for WLFI could trigger further bullish momentum in $ETH.

And things are looking pretty good on the technical side, too.

$ETH is currently trading around $4,300 and is just one big fat green candle away from breaking out of a long-drawn consolidation zone, as highlighted by the descending triangle pattern in the image below.



With all the stars aligning perfectly for Ethereum, the broader altcoin market stands to benefit the most.

Since $ETH is the base layer for a majority of altcoins, stabilization at higher levels could lead to institutional liquidity rotating into smaller tokens as investors adopt a more risk-on approach and chase high-growth opportunities.

Looking for the best cryptos to invest in right now? Here are three awesome suggestions.

Despite some big-money players preferring Ethereum over Bitcoin, there's no shortage of bullish sentiment for the ‘digital gold.'

Just a couple of days ago, a new Bitcoin whale was born after a hefty 1,506 $BTC deposit worth $163.5M.

That's why Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now.

By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER will unlock full compatibility with smart contracts and dApps directly on Bitcoin.



And thanks to a fast, decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge, you'll be able to seamlessly convert your Layer 1 $BTC into ‘wrapped' $BTC tokens, fully compatible with Hyper's Layer 2.

Why is this conversion important? Because it allows you to use native $BTC tokens across high-speed DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, lending and staking protocols, DAOs, and gaming dApps.

Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $13.2M from early investors. Here's how to buy $HYPER.

Each token is priced at just $0.012835, with our $HYPER price prediction suggesting the token could climb 2,400% by year-end – potentially hitting $0.32.

With trading volumes at record highs, the need for a reliable and easy-to-use crypto wallet has never been greater. Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST).

This new crypto powers Best Wallet, a free crypto wallet that delivers a never-before-seen blend of usability and rock-solid security.

Impressive, right? But the real kicker is its Presale Aggregator, which is a feature you won't find in any other wallet.

Simply put, it lets you buy the best crypto presales directly within the app. No need to jump across external websites, as everything happens securely inside Best Wallet.



And buying $BEST doesn't just give you front-row seats to the wallet's growth, but it also unlocks a bunch of exclusive perks.

These include reduced trading fees, voting rights, staking rewards (currently 87%), and early-bird access to new meme coins in presale.

1 $BEST is currently available at just $0.025575, with the project having already gathered over $15.3M.

Check out $BEST's official website for more information.

The best thing about meme coins? They're probably some of the most self-aware projects you'll ever see – across industries, countries, and even planets.

Unstable Coin ($USDUC) is a picture-perfect example. The token knows it's a pure meme coin, and it doesn't try to be anything else. In fact, it prides itself on having no intrinsic value, utility, or roadmap.

On paper, it's a satirical take on the USDC stablecoin and the entire ethos of stablecoins: bringing stability to the crypto market.

But according to the developers of Unstable Coin, crypto is inherently volatile, and that shouldn't change. The result? $USDUC, a meme coin that exists to revolt against stablecoins.



And as we've come to expect from meme coin degens, the more absurd a coin's premise, the more ridiculous its gains.

Available on both Solana and Ethereum, $USDUC has already surged more than 518% since launching in June this year.

It's currently trading at record highs of $0.06947, and with momentum on its side, there may be no stopping it from rocketing further into uncharted territory.

With institutional players snagging up Ethereum at an unprecedented pace, the stage is set for a full-blown altcoin season.

However, kindly keep in mind that none of the above is financial advice. Crypto investments are highly risky, and you must only invest after doing your own research.

Oops, something went wrong

Altcoin season continues to drive selective flows into tokens with liquidity and audience engagement. Instead of broad rallies, the market is rewarding projects tied to platforms, communities, or public figures. MemeCore, Pump.fun, and Monero have all attracted attention in recent sessions, each drawing buyers for very different reasons.

The strength of these tokens underlines how altseason functions in stages. Traders look for tokens with turnover, narrative hooks, or repeat participation. That framework explains why MemeCore has rebounded after community activity and why Pump.fun benefits from the constant use of its launch system.

MemeCore is trading near $0.77, with a price surge of 70% over the past seven days and a market capitalization of around $820 million. Daily turnover is close to $200 million, and the circulating supply is roughly 1.6 billion tokens.

The project set an all-time high of about $1.06 earlier in August before retreating. The token has since recovered nearly 60% in the past week, supported by renewed community campaigns and social media engagement.

The project positions itself as a meme ecosystem token that can sustain liquidity through repeat activity. Trading platforms continue to list M, which helps maintain visibility. Its current movement shows how community energy can restore interest even after a sharp pullback.

Pump.fun is trading at around $0.0035, with a market capitalization of $1.2 billion. Circulating supply is estimated at 354 billion tokens out of a 1-trillion maximum. Daily volume is close to $290 million, and the price has increased more than 20% over the past week.

PUMP Price (Source: CoinMarketCap)

The token underpins a platform on Solana that allows rapid creation and listing of meme assets. Thousands of tokens have been launched through Pump.fun, and fees from those launches provide recurring activity.

Even if many of the tokens created do not persist, the process itself keeps PUMP liquid and supports trading. This continuous stream of new projects explains why the token maintains turnover through altcoin season cycles.

Monero is currently trading near $265, with approximately $80.3 million in 24-hour trading volume and a market cap of around $4.89 billion. Circulating supply stands at roughly 18.446 million XMR, and the token has no fixed maximum supply.

Price movement over the past day shows modest growth of about 2%, and the token remains far below its all-time high of about $517.60 from mid‑2021. This stability suggests continued interest from its core user base, even when broader crypto trends fluctuate.

Monero is designed to preserve transaction privacy by default. The protocol uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions to obscure the sender, the recipient, and the amount. These features have made Monero a primary choice within privacy-conscious circles.

The movement of these tokens shows how altcoin season unfolds unevenly across categories. MemeCore draws strength from social engagement. Pump.fun remains liquid through constant token creation.

This variation shows that altcoin season is not defined by every token moving together. Instead, specific drivers create a concentration of flows, whether through community campaigns, platform use, or public figure associations. For now, MemeCore, Pump.fun, and Monero represent three distinct examples of how this selective rotation is unfolding.

Gumi, A Tokyo-listed game maker, wants ¥2.5 billion worth of XRP, and
it is not just chasing a pump. It is buying into a remittance-first future that
Japan's rules increasingly allow.

    Read this Term firm, just put a
number on its conviction. The company plans
to acquire up to 2.5 billion yen of XRP, roughly 17 million dollars, for
its corporate treasury. This is not meme-coin roulette. It is a statement that an
altcoin with real payment rails is more useful to a Japanese balance sheet (and
to CFOs trying to convince a board) than one more speculative bet.

Japan's corporate treasury experiment started with Bitcoin buys that
grabbed headlines. Now the sequel is here, and it looks more like a portfolio
than a stunt. The buy is part of a broader altcoin buying spree, with Gumi
poised as the latest mover. That reads as cause, not coincidence. As local
compliance hardens and accounting treatment gets clearer, Japanese firms can
finally hold digital assets without feeling like they are smuggling contraband
through finance. Here's an overview from
earlier in the year.

XRP
is pitched to institutions as a utility asset aligned with cross-border
payments, not only a trading chip. In short, being able to dramatically
reduce transfer costs is something a CFO can defend in a meeting. The firm
highlights Japan's increasingly supportive stance toward real-world usage of
blockchain for remittances and liquidity. 

If you want to understand why XRP, follow the transaction plumbing. Key
to all this is the payments angle, pointing to cost and finality
characteristics that make XRP attractive for moving value across borders. None
of this is flashy. It is also exactly why corporate treasuries care. You can
hold it, you can use it, and it maps to business lines like remittance or
treasury operations, not just trading desks.

Gumi appears to be buying with that in mind. While the company is best
known for games, the strategic language around this purchase is about joining a
financial network and tapping liquidity for services that look more like
fintech than fandom. The plan is not forever-priced promises. It is the boring,
revenue-adjacent stuff that keeps CFOs employed.

The country's rulebook has moved from maybe to mostly. That matters. This
is lowering operational risk for listed firms that want crypto exposure for
reasons other than vibes. Japan's environment is increasingly one where utility
tokens tied to real payment activity have a clearer glide path into corporate
treasuries. If you think that sounds tailor-made for XRP, you are not wrong.

Another not-so-subtle nudge is shareholder pressure and ecosystem
gravity. Gumi's largest shareholder is SBI Holdings, long
aligned with Ripple. That relationship does not decide strategy on its own,
but it does make XRP the shortest route to real integrations and
counterparties.

Corporate purchases are not YOLO market orders. They are windows,
approvals, and paperwork. Reporting around the move indicates Gumi's XRP
acquisition window spans from early
September 2025 into February 2026. That cadence is corporate, not crypto-Twitter.
It is also a hint that the firm wants price risk averaged, operational hooks
tested, and treasury processes drilled before it scales. Use this lens and the
buy looks less like a bet and more like onboarding.

corporate crypto. If you can plug an asset into payments, liquidity, or

a business model, not just a narrative.

“Major move: Japanese gaming giant Gumi is committing ¥2.5 billion (~$17 million) in XRP between Sep 2025 and Feb 2026. This isn't just investment—it's a strategic push into cross-border payments, liquidity, and the Ripple ecosystem. BTC for yield, XRP for utility. Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/NbiOR2SPUu

Gumi's move is therefore simple. It is paying for access to rails that
exist today. If XRP helps the company extend into remittances or other
financial services, the purchase can return value even if price action is
messy. That is a very corporate way to think about crypto, and it is exactly
why Japan is suddenly interesting again.

Time for the alternative take, though it doesn't seem to hold weight.
Is this just marketing? Maybe a little. It is also the kind of marketing that
comes with board approvals and execution windows. If the goal were only
headlines, Gumi could have joined the usual Bitcoin choir. Instead, it chose
the network that banks and remittance players actually use. In a market still
addicted to fortune-telling, that looks surprisingly practical.

Gumi, A Tokyo-listed game maker, wants ¥2.5 billion worth of XRP, and
it is not just chasing a pump. It is buying into a remittance-first future that
Japan's rules increasingly allow.

    Read this Term firm, just put a
number on its conviction. The company plans
to acquire up to 2.5 billion yen of XRP, roughly 17 million dollars, for
its corporate treasury. This is not meme-coin roulette. It is a statement that an
altcoin with real payment rails is more useful to a Japanese balance sheet (and
to CFOs trying to convince a board) than one more speculative bet.

Japan's corporate treasury experiment started with Bitcoin buys that
grabbed headlines. Now the sequel is here, and it looks more like a portfolio
than a stunt. The buy is part of a broader altcoin buying spree, with Gumi
poised as the latest mover. That reads as cause, not coincidence. As local
compliance hardens and accounting treatment gets clearer, Japanese firms can
finally hold digital assets without feeling like they are smuggling contraband
through finance. Here's an overview from
earlier in the year.

XRP
is pitched to institutions as a utility asset aligned with cross-border
payments, not only a trading chip. In short, being able to dramatically
reduce transfer costs is something a CFO can defend in a meeting. The firm
highlights Japan's increasingly supportive stance toward real-world usage of
blockchain for remittances and liquidity. 

If you want to understand why XRP, follow the transaction plumbing. Key
to all this is the payments angle, pointing to cost and finality
characteristics that make XRP attractive for moving value across borders. None
of this is flashy. It is also exactly why corporate treasuries care. You can
hold it, you can use it, and it maps to business lines like remittance or
treasury operations, not just trading desks.

Gumi appears to be buying with that in mind. While the company is best
known for games, the strategic language around this purchase is about joining a
financial network and tapping liquidity for services that look more like
fintech than fandom. The plan is not forever-priced promises. It is the boring,
revenue-adjacent stuff that keeps CFOs employed.

The country's rulebook has moved from maybe to mostly. That matters. This
is lowering operational risk for listed firms that want crypto exposure for
reasons other than vibes. Japan's environment is increasingly one where utility
tokens tied to real payment activity have a clearer glide path into corporate
treasuries. If you think that sounds tailor-made for XRP, you are not wrong.

Another not-so-subtle nudge is shareholder pressure and ecosystem
gravity. Gumi's largest shareholder is SBI Holdings, long
aligned with Ripple. That relationship does not decide strategy on its own,
but it does make XRP the shortest route to real integrations and
counterparties.

Corporate purchases are not YOLO market orders. They are windows,
approvals, and paperwork. Reporting around the move indicates Gumi's XRP
acquisition window spans from early
September 2025 into February 2026. That cadence is corporate, not crypto-Twitter.
It is also a hint that the firm wants price risk averaged, operational hooks
tested, and treasury processes drilled before it scales. Use this lens and the
buy looks less like a bet and more like onboarding.

Cryptocurrency is a fast-moving and unpredictable world. Many people dream of spotting the next altcoin pump, when the price of a smaller crypto suddenly rises by a large percentage, before it happens. 

While there's no guaranteed way to predict pumps perfectly, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool to help you do smarter research, spot patterns and filter noise from real signals.

This article breaks down how to use ChatGPT to analyze altcoins, track trends and identify early indicators of a potential pump. 

What is an altcoin pump?

An altcoin pump is a sudden and sharp increase in the price of an alternative cryptocurrency — i.e., any crypto that's not Bitcoin BTCUSD. This usually happens when:

A group of traders starts buying quickly (sometimes coordinated in pump groups).

Big news or social media hype pushes the price up.

A new exchange listing or partnership is announced.

Influencers or YouTubers start talking about the coin.

Sometimes pumps are organic and driven by real growth. Other times, they're manipulated and short-lived (also known as pump-and-dump schemes). Your goal is to spot potential real growth before the crowd does.

Can ChatGPT predict pumps?

Not exactly. ChatGPT doesn't have a crystal ball. It can't tell the future or access real-time prices unless connected to external tools. But what it can do is:

Analyze altcoin fundamentals (utility, team, tokenomics)

Summarize community sentiment from forums, Reddit, X, etc.

Detect historical patterns from past pumps

Generate watchlists based on criteria you choose

Create strategies for monitoring altcoins.

Basically, ChatGPT acts like your crypto research assistant, helping you make educated guesses instead of blindly chasing hype.

Step-by-step: How to use ChatGPT for altcoin pump research

You can use the “Search” feature of ChatGPT to quickly find up-to-date crypto trends, news and market analysis across the web.

1. Identify what you want to track

Before using ChatGPT, decide on your angle. For example:

Are you tracking low-market-cap coins under $50 million?

Do you want coins that are trending on social media?

Are you looking for coins with upcoming events (like token burns or listings)?

The more specific you are, the better the results.

2. Use smart prompts

Let's look at two example prompts you can use with ChatGPT to research altcoins:

Prompt example 1: Altcoin watchlist based on fundamentals

“Act as a crypto research assistant. Give me a list of 5 altcoins under a $100 million market cap with strong utility, active development teams, and upcoming catalysts (like exchange listings, partnerships, or events). Summarize in 120 words.”

ChatGPT's response provides a clear and concise list of five low-cap altcoins, summarizing their utility, development status and upcoming catalysts in about 120 words as requested. It effectively highlights key points for quick analysis but lacks citation details for credibility and deeper verification. Do verify onchain data and up-to-date project information before making any investment decisions.

Prompt example 2: Analyze pump potential from social buzz

“Assume the role of a crypto market analyst. Analyze which altcoins are gaining the most attention on X, Reddit, and YouTube in the past 7 days. Look for sudden spikes in mentions, positive sentiment, or trending hashtags. Which ones might be getting ready to pump? Summarize in 100 words.”

ChatGPT highlighted trending altcoins by analyzing social traction across X, Reddit and YouTube over the past seven days. It clearly identifies Remittix, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Little Pepe as tokens with rising mentions and positive sentiment, suggesting potential price movement. However, it should also caution readers to verify onchain data and use up-to-date market info before acting on social trends.

3. Combine ChatGPT insights with other tools

ChatGPT works best when paired with data tools, such as:

CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap: For tracking market caps and price changes

LunarCrush: For social sentiment

DEXTools or TokenSniffer: For new coin launches and on-chain data

X and Reddit: To catch buzz early.

4. Be careful: Red flags to watch out for

Not all pumps are good. Be on alert for coins that:

Have anonymous teams

Promise massive returns quickly

Have very low liquidity or trading volume

Are trending in known pump-and-dump Telegram groups.

You can ask ChatGPT to check for red flags:

“Name 5 low-cap altcoins that might be a scam or pump-and-dump project.”

ChatGPT's response lists five examples of tokens linked to scam-like or pump‑and‑dump behavior, including real-world cases like Save the Kids and SafeMoon. It also explains common patterns with unnamed micro‑cap memecoins and organized hype groups. However, you should verify this information before drawing conclusions.

Caution: Don't chase every pump

While it can be exciting to hunt for the next big altcoin pump, it's important to stay grounded. Many pumps are short-lived and driven by hype or manipulation, especially in low-market-cap coins. Prices can skyrocket in minutes and crash just as fast, leaving late buyers with major losses.

Always be cautious of:

Too-good-to-be-true returns: Projects promising 10x overnight gains are often scams.

Anonymous teams or no white paper: Lack of transparency is a major red flag.

Low liquidity: If few people are trading the coin, you might not be able to sell when you need to.

Pump-and-dump groups: Telegram or Discord groups that coordinate artificial price movements are common and risky.

Use ChatGPT to identify potential, but combine it with critical thinking and outside verification. The crypto market moves fast, but slow and informed decisions usually win in the long run.

Always remember that even the best tools can't guarantee success in crypto. Use ChatGPT for research and insight, but always do your own research (DYOR).

Crypto is volatile, and even promising coins can fall in price. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Home - Crypto Presales - Pepeto Raises $6.3M, Blockchain FX Hits 20K Users, and BlockDAG Drops 2049% Bonus! Which Presale Delivers The Best 2025 Gains?

Presales have become the proving ground where early-stage projects show if they're built for more than just buzz. Pepeto has already pulled in over $6.3 million by launching features like PepetoSwap and staking with appealing yields, giving the project practical traction. Meanwhile, Blockchain FX is drawing attention with a multi-market trading app that already has more than 20,000 users testing its beta version and sharing positive feedback.

Both are making progress, but BlockDAG is running at a completely different pace. With $388 million raised, 25 billion BDAG coins sold, and a 2049% bonus aligned with Token2049, it's taking the spotlight and using it to scale further. 

Now in Batch 30 at $0.03, those who joined from Batch 1 are already sitting on 2,900% returns. This mix of scale, timing, and momentum makes BlockDAG stand out as the presale built to dominate headlines while delivering visible results.

Token2049 is not just another crypto expo; it's the gathering where the entire industry sets its focus. From major funds and whales to builders and global media, this event carries influence over the next market cycle. 

BlockDAG's timing is deliberate, with its 2049% bonus designed to land precisely when that spotlight is brightest. Rather than being a simple promotion, it's a high-gear strategy built to convert exposure into concrete traction.

While other projects go to Token2049 hoping to be noticed, BlockDAG is there to execute. With $388 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and Batch 30 priced at $0.03, the numbers highlight its traction. Early backers from Batch 1 are already enjoying 2,900% growth, and the 2049% bonus is crafted as the final push to amplify this surge even further.











This approach reveals how BlockDAG plays aggressively on offense. Instead of just chasing hype, it's connecting its presale to the industry's loudest megaphone. By making Token2049 the core of its closing strategy, BlockDAG transforms visibility into velocity, ensuring the presale's last stretch makes maximum impact in front of the most influential audience in crypto.

Blockchain FX is shaping up as one of 2025's standout presales, not just for its numbers but also for its product-driven narrative. Having already raised $6.1 million and attracted more than 6,000 holders, the presale is running at $0.021 with a launch target of $0.05, almost a 150% increase. Beyond that, its value lies in the product itself: a full trading suite that integrates crypto, forex, commodities, and futures into one unified and simple interface.

This isn't a speculative idea; it has already been tested by more than 20,000 beta users who praised its speed and smooth functionality. Added to this are its tokenomics: structured buybacks, staking rewards, and automatic burns, which give both regular engagement and long-term holding meaningful rewards.











For those seeking a presale tied to a real-world tool, Blockchain FX offers proof it's more than just early buzz. With its practical traction and growing user base, the presale is catching eyes fast and gaining stronger momentum with each stage.

Pepeto is quickly proving it can go beyond trend status by combining momentum with real utility. With $6.3 million raised so far, the presale is drawing consistent attention. Built on Ethereum, the project is rolling out key features like PepetoSwap, a decentralized exchange with zero fees, alongside a cross-chain bridge that simplifies asset transfers across networks.

These aren't distant promises; development is well underway, with a staking program that delivers up to 245% APY for those holding longer. This model positions Pepeto as more than a short-term play, instead encouraging stability within its community.











Backing this up is a focus on transparency and safety, with audits completed by SolidProof and Coinsult. Add to that a growing base of more than 100,000 followers, and Pepeto is proving it doesn't need hype alone. Its presale traction reflects delivery of value from the ground up, making it one of the utility-driven presales currently on the radar.

As presales shift from speculation toward structured delivery, timing and positioning are everything. Pepeto and Blockchain FX bring useful products and strong activity, but BlockDAG sets itself apart with strategy.

By releasing a 2049% bonus right before Token2049, BlockDAG has turned attention into energy. The results are undeniable: $388 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and Batch 30 priced at $0.03 with early holders up 2,900%.

It's not just finishing a presale, it's finishing with precision. In a market full of noise, BlockDAG shows how to convert visibility into velocity, ensuring that every spotlight moment drives momentum exactly where it matters most.

JAPAN POST BANK is considering launching tokenized deposits in the 2026 fiscal year, which runs to March 2027. The bank is working with DeCurret DCP, the developer of the DCJPY tokenized deposit platform.

The plan is to use blockchain-based money for the instant settlement of blockchain transactions, starting with security tokens and NFTs. Unlike other regions, the Japanese maintain a strong interest in NFTs, reflecting their cultural affinity for anime and art.

JAPAN POST BANK is the country's fourth largest bank. However, given its association with the country's post office service, it serves 120 million retail clients – nearly the entire population of 124 million. Hence, there is the potential to dramatically expand the reach of blockchain payments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Making Blockchain Games Welcoming for Everyone","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/cryptocurrency-in-gaming-inclusivity-strategies","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 08:03:57 GMT","

We're diving into the world of blockchain gaming and, let me tell you, making it inclusive for non-crypto players is an absolute must. As crypto and blockchain tech becomes more ingrained in gaming, developers need to think about how to welcome everyone in, no matter their experience with digital currencies. Let's break down some ideas to make this gaming environment more inclusive, merging the worlds of traditional gamers and blockchain enthusiasts.

One of the best ways to get non-crypto players on board is to make blockchain features optional. Seriously. If players can enjoy the game without being forced into any crypto interactions, it lowers the barriers to entry significantly. This way, non-crypto players aren't overwhelmed or left out in the cold.

Next up is the onboarding process, which should be as smooth as possible. Developers should aim to simplify the user experience by allowing for abstract accounts or even wallet-less access. This way, players can interact with blockchain features without needing to be crypto-savvy or having complicated setups. A streamlined onboarding process can make the game feel more accessible to everyone.

Let's talk about user interfaces. They need to be user-friendly and work on all sorts of devices. Developers should focus on making their games accessible, playable on low-end hardware and slow internet connections. Plus, avoiding mandatory NFT purchases or complicated bridging processes can make things easier for non-crypto players.

Now, for those new players who might be lost in the blockchain gaming world, comprehensive support and education are a must. Developers should provide onboarding guides, mentorship programs, and dedicated channels for player questions. Offering resources to help players understand blockchain features at their own pace can make for a more inclusive community.

Creating a welcoming community is vital for any blockchain game. Developers should embrace diversity in their marketing, game content, and community interactions. Actively moderating to prevent harassment and encouraging open communication can create a safe space for everyone. By cultivating a positive community atmosphere, developers can enhance player engagement and retention.

Also, let's not forget about the environmental impact. If players are concerned about the environment, developers should consider using eco-friendly blockchains and transparent monetization models. Prioritizing sustainability can attract players who care about the environmental implications of their gaming choices.

At the end of the day, the heart of every successful game is its gameplay. Developers should focus on creating fun and engaging experiences, using blockchain tech as a bonus rather than the main draw. By keeping gameplay at the forefront, developers can ensure that the game remains enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their knowledge of cryptocurrency.

In wrapping up, making blockchain gaming inclusive for non-crypto players is crucial for the industry to grow and succeed. By implementing strategies that prioritize optional blockchain features, streamline onboarding, design accessible interfaces, offer education, foster inclusive communities, utilize eco-friendly technologies, and focus on gameplay, developers can create a welcoming environment for all players. As gaming continues to change and grow, embracing inclusivity will be key to merging traditional gamers and the new world of blockchain gaming.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Nike and StockX Resolve NFT Trademark Fight with Settlement","https://coincentral.com/nike-and-stockx-resolve-nft-trademark-fight-with-settlement/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 15:57:55 GMT","

Nike and StockX have ended their three-year legal battle over trademark use in sneaker-linked NFTs. The agreement stops a jury trial previously scheduled for October and dismisses all claims with prejudice. This NFT trademark fight marks a major turning point in how intellectual property intersects with blockchain assets.

Nike filed the lawsuit in February 2022, accusing StockX of infringing on its trademarks through Vault NFTs. The tokens featured images of Nike sneakers, allegedly misleading customers about Nike's involvement. StockX denied wrongdoing, stating the NFTs only served as proof of ownership for real sneakers.

Nike escalated its complaint in May 2022 by alleging that StockX sold counterfeit sneakers on its platform. The allegations gained strength in March 2025 when the court ruled in Nike's favor on part of the case. StockX was found liable for selling several fake Nike sneakers to undercover buyers.

The court scheduled the unresolved claims for trial, but both parties agreed to settle in late August 2025. Thus, the NFT trademark fight avoided a public courtroom showdown, protecting both companies from reputational and legal risks.

The key issue was whether NFTs qualify as “goods” under the Lanham Act. In 2025, the US Ninth Circuit confirmed that NFTs linked to physical items fall under trademark protection. This ruling aligned with Nike's claims and shaped the broader outcome of this NFT trademark fight.

StockX had argued that its Vault NFTs only tracked ownership, not brand affiliation. However, Nike maintained that unauthorized use of sneaker images diluted its brand. The settlement ended this standoff without a ruling on the full scope of NFT liability.

This case adds to the growing legal clarity around NFTs and trademark rights. Platforms now face stricter guidelines when tying tokens to branded physical goods. The NFT trademark fight made companies reconsider how they handle digital and IP assets together.

The lawsuit's outcome echoes across the NFT and sneaker sectors. In December 2024, Nike shut down its digital studio RTFKT, citing a shift in strategy. The closure followed legal concerns and marked a retreat from experimental NFT ventures.

RTFKT had gained attention for combining NFTs with real sneakers, including partnerships with artists and Ethereum-based drops. However, operational and legal challenges led Nike to fold the studio's services. That decision signaled declining tolerance for loosely regulated digital platforms.

The NFT trademark fight also impacted marketplaces' handling of counterfeit risks. StockX's 2025 Brand Protection Report said it blocked $10 million in fake shoes using RFID and CT scans. These changes suggest platforms will use tech to avoid future legal disputes.

The fight also affected funding trends. In 2025, firms raised $4.2 billion for environmentally friendly NFTs with verified supply chains. The NFT trademark fight forced investors and companies to align digital assets with strong compliance standards.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- NFT market trading volumes fell 60% from 2023 peaks, but Pudgy Penguins defied the downturn with 13% Q1 2025 sales growth amid 63% industry decline.

- The project's hybrid digital-physical strategy includes 10,000 global toy retail stores, blockchain gaming on zkSync, and PENGU token utility for governance and merchandise.

- Pudgy Penguins' 1.9M+ Instagram community and partnerships with NASCAR/Lufthansa drive real-world relevance, while PENGU token surged 170% since June 2025.

- Analysts project 70% PENGU price rally to $0.12, citing sustainable tokenomics and regulatory clarity as factors supporting its long-term resilience in a maturing NFT market.

 

The NFT market has endured a prolonged downturn since 2023, with trading volumes collapsing by over 60% from their peak and a projected 11% decline in 2025 trading activity [1]. Yet, amid this broader slump, Pudgy Penguins has emerged as a striking outlier. While the market grapples with speculative fatigue and regulatory uncertainty, this project has defied trends through a combination of utility-driven innovation, community-first governance, and strategic real-world integration. For contrarian investors, Pudgy Penguins represents a rare opportunity to capitalize on a high-growth NFT collection positioned to thrive in a maturing market.  

The NFT sector's 2023-2025 correction has been marked by a shift from speculative digital art to utility-focused assets. Trading volumes plummeted to $608.6 million in 2025 from $683.9 million in 2024 [1], while Ethereum NFT sales dropped 80% in early 2025 before rebounding 56% in July [2]. Polygon saw a 102% surge in July 2025, but these gains were driven by gaming NFTs, which now account for 38% of transaction volume [3]. The market's focus on tangible value—such as in-game assets, event access, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization—has created a new paradigm. Pudgy Penguins, with its hybrid digital-physical ecosystem, aligns perfectly with this evolution.  

Pudgy Penguins' performance starkly contrasts with the broader market. In Q1 2025, the collection generated $72 million in sales—a 13% increase from Q1 2024—despite a 63% industry-wide decline [4]. Its floor price surged from below $10 to $16.88 in under two weeks [5], while the PENGU token rallied 170% since June 2025 [6]. Analysts project a 70% price rally for PENGU, targeting $0.12 as a resistance level [7].  

This resilience stems from Pudgy Penguins' strategic pivot to utility. The project has expanded into physical toys sold in 10,000 global stores, including Walmart and Target, generating $13 million in retail revenue by late 2024 [8]. These toys integrate with Pudgy World, a blockchain-based gaming platform on zkSync Era, creating a bridge between Web2 and Web3 audiences. The PENGU token further enhances utility, serving as a governance and staking asset within Pudgy World and enabling purchases of physical merchandise [9].  

Pudgy Penguins' success is underpinned by a hyper-engaged community. The project's Instagram following exceeds 1.9 million [10], while its viral #KindPengu campaign generated 500 million TikTok views and 40 billion GIPHY impressions [11]. Gaming initiatives like Pengu Clash (60,000 players in one week) and Pudgy Party (50,000 app downloads) have driven active user growth [12]. Partnerships with NASCAR, Lufthansa, and Don Quijote have amplified its real-world relevance, while a $PENGU ETF filing signals institutional interest [13].  

 

While the NFT market remains volatile, Pudgy Penguins' multi-layered strategy positions it as a long-term winner. Its focus on utility—physical products, gaming, and RWA tokenization—addresses the sector's post-bubble challenges. The project's tokenomics, with 25.9% of PENGU supply allocated to NFT holders and a vesting schedule for team tokens, prioritize sustainability [14]. Regulatory clarity, such as the SEC's closure of its OpenSea investigation, also bodes well for projects like Pudgy Penguins that emphasize compliance [15].  

Critics may cite Pudgy Penguins' 47% seven-day sales drop [16], but this aligns with broader market trends rather than project-specific issues. The 367% 30-day sales increase [17] and robust community engagement suggest a strong foundation for recovery. For investors, the key is to focus on Pudgy Penguins' ecosystem expansion and its ability to retain value amid market cycles.  

The NFT market's downturn has exposed speculative weaknesses but also created opportunities for projects with durable utility. Pudgy Penguins' hybrid model—combining digital collectibles, physical products, and blockchain-based gaming—demonstrates how NFTs can evolve beyond hype. With a 170% surge in PENGU token value, strategic partnerships, and a community-driven ethos, this project is not just surviving the downturn—it's redefining the future of NFTs. For contrarian investors, Pudgy Penguins offers a compelling case to bet on innovation, not just speculation.

Early participants are showing strong interest, especially as BlockDAG's large community engages with this new crypto token presale. With token presales gaining momentum in 2025, investors are adding BlockSack to their watchlists alongside established crypto presale projects. 

This growing demand highlights how presale crypto tokens remain an important part of the ecosystem, shaping the presale cryptocurrency landscape for the coming year.

BlockSack positions itself as the raw origin of meme culture within crypto. Marketed as the “Daddy of All Memes,” its theme is both bold and symbolic. According to the project's narrative, $BSACK is the alpha coin, the true essence from which blockchain energy was born. Every chain, every network, and every transaction traces back to this mythical origin.

Created under the story of Sacktoshi, BlockSack represents a generational DNA coded into every hash, block, and contract within decentralized systems. While meme projects often rely on humor and hype, BlockSack weaves mythology and identity into its foundation.

At its Stage 1 crypto ICO presale, the token price is set at $0.00697, with the next price increase marked at $0.00869. Currently, over 10.68% of Block 1 has been completed, raising more than $13,493.30 USD against its target of $126,347.97 USD. 

This early progress places BlockSack on crypto presale lists as a notable entry among 2025's new crypto token presale opportunities.



BlockDAG has already proven the strength of its presale crypto campaign, attracting large-scale backing and community support. The project has raised more than $386 million during its token presales, with over 25.5 billion coins sold.

Currently, in Batch 30, each presale coin is priced at $0.03, showing continued traction as buyers seek entry before higher rounds. The path toward its $600 million goal demonstrates how active communities can drive cryptocurrency presales to new levels of adoption. This kind of demand highlights the importance of large-scale crypto presale projects in setting benchmarks for new entrants like BlockSack.

BlockSack introduces a staking model that combines humor with utility. Token holders can lock their presale crypto tokens to earn liquid $BSACK rewards, adding value beyond trading.

The staking system offers flexible timeframes and sack-themed incentives, encouraging long-term participation. APYs are meme-enhanced, designed to keep the ecosystem both secure and engaging for the community. 

The longer tokens are staked, the greater the potential return, ensuring that $BSACK holders remain tied to the network's growth. This staking feature puts BlockSack in line with other top presale crypto projects offering rewards-based ecosystems.



The ongoing BlockSack crypto ICO presale reflects how token presales continue to shape the digital asset market. With projects like BlockDAG already proving massive demand, communities are exploring new crypto presales such as BlockSack to diversify their positions.

By blending meme-driven identity with staking utility, BlockSack finds itself among the best crypto presales to buy right now for those following the 2025 cycle. Its inclusion in crypto presale lists highlights how presale cryptocurrency projects remain vital to market growth.

As cryptocurrency presales expand, BlockSack represents how new token presales can merge narrative, culture, and staking rewards into one evolving ecosystem.

In 2025, crypto investors are exploring beyond traditional tokens, seeking opportunities in presale crypto projects that combine community, utility, and meme culture. BlockSack, a new crypto token presale, has emerged as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now, attracting attention from investors looking for early exposure.

Its presale cryptocurrency stage is gaining momentum, with presale crypto tokens showing real engagement and adoption. Even SOL investors are diversifying, exploring meme-driven projects like BlockSack for fresh upside. With strategic storytelling, early utility, and an active community, this new crypto token presale is quickly entering discussions on the top crypto presales lists for 2025.

BlockSack's journey begins with the mythic reintroduction of Sacktoshi, the forgotten creator behind the blockchain origin story. The official smart contract is deployed, and KYC verification is in progress, establishing a foundation for a credible presale crypto ICO. 

Early collaborations with key influencers and active Telegram and X channels have strengthened the community base, driving engagement in this new token presale.

The BSACK presale merges meme culture with blockchain functionality, creating a narrative that resonates with early adopters. This approach has increased visibility in the crypto presale list and positioned BlockSack as a top contender among crypto presale projects.

Community-led campaigns amplify participation, ensuring presale crypto tokens are not just acquired, but actively used in staking, NFTs, and gaming experiments on Base. With each milestone, the presale gains traction, highlighting why many consider it one of the best crypto presales to buy right now.

At the current presale crypto stage, BlockSack's token is priced at $0.00697, with the next price set at $0.00869. The project is in Stage 1, Block 1, with 10.68% of the stage already completed. So far, $13,493.30 has been raised toward the target block raise of $126,347.97.

These figures highlight early investor participation and demonstrate the growing traction of this new crypto token presale among those tracking token presales and crypto coins on presale.

For those tracking token presales and crypto coins on presale, these figures illustrate how storytelling and active community engagement are driving traction in early-stage fundraising.



SOL price currently targets around $187, with technical models predicting a potential rally to $220–$250 if the market maintains strength above $185. However, bearish pressure remains, and analysts note that SOL could decline toward $150 if downward momentum increases.

Optimistic forecasts highlight buy-the-dip opportunities near $176 or breakout potential at $207, with long-term targets aiming for $300. While SOL continues to dominate traditional altcoin discussions, investors exploring crypto presales and presale crypto tokens like BlockSack are diversifying their portfolios to include early-stage projects that offer token presales with strong community engagement and web3 innovation.

BlockSack introduces an intelligent, on-chain AI agent to help investors navigate the Base and BlockSack ecosystem. The agent simplifies interactions with presale crypto tokens, staking, and gaming features, making the crypto presale process more accessible to new participants.

Users can receive real-time updates on crypto presale projects, discover new token presales, and follow announcements in the crypto presale list. By combining guidance with active utility, the AI agent strengthens adoption of presale cryptocurrency offerings, ensuring that BlockSack remains a practical and interactive entry point among the top crypto presales in 2025.



BlockSack illustrates how early presale crypto tokens can combine community engagement, web3 utility, and storytelling to gain traction during the crypto ICO presale phase. Investors, including those previously focused on SOL, are exploring this new token presale as part of a diversified approach.

As the presale progresses, BlockSack highlights the potential for top crypto presales to create strong early networks and functional ecosystems. Its combination of staking, NFTs, AI guidance, and meme-driven narrative shows why it is considered one of the best crypto presale to buy right now.

For participants watching the crypto presale list and crypto pre sales, BlockSack demonstrates how innovation and community can intersect in early-stage token presales for meaningful adoption.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Stablecoins' growing role in U.S. finance raises regulatory concerns over potential systemic risks and government bailouts.

- Debate intensifies between CBDC advocates (enhancing dollar's global role) and critics warning of surveillance risks versus stablecoin-driven market innovation.

- Projected $2 trillion stablecoin market by 2028 could displace $2 trillion in bank deposits, forcing banks toward narrow banking models.

- GENIUS Act establishes regulatory framework for stablecoins, but balanced oversight remains critical to prevent systemic shocks.

- DeFi and tokenization emerge as complementary tools to address yield gaps as stablecoins reshape traditional financial paradigms.

The rising prominence of stablecoins in the U.S. financial ecosystem has drawn warnings from Nobel laureates and regulators, highlighting the risks of inadequate oversight. A recent analysis underscores that without sufficient regulatory guardrails, stablecoins could lead to scenarios requiring government bailouts. This concern comes as stablecoins, which currently facilitate billions in daily transactions, are projected to grow significantly, with some forecasts suggesting a market value of up to $2 trillion by 2028.

The debate over digital currency in the U.S. remains centered on whether the Federal Reserve should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or if private innovation should lead the way. Advocates for a CBDC argue it could enhance the dollar's global standing and facilitate more efficient monetary policy. However, critics caution that a CBDC could enable excessive surveillance and centralized control, which would contradict the principles of privacy and choice underpinning traditional cash systems. As former Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted, the potential for real-time tracking of all transactions raises concerns about government overreach and the erosion of financial privacy.

Conversely, stablecoins are seen as a market-driven alternative that supports innovation and economic resilience without requiring government monopoly over digital currency. Issuers of stablecoins hold reserves in safe, highly liquid assets—most notably U.S. Treasury securities—which not only supports the stability of the dollar but also bolsters the broader financial system. With 80% of stablecoin reserves currently held in U.S. government-backed instruments, the expansion of stablecoin adoption could enhance the dollar's international utility and competitiveness.

However, this growth also poses challenges to traditional banking systems. As stablecoins gain traction, they may begin to displace transactional bank deposits, potentially reducing banks' ability to fund loans through customer balances. The U.S. Treasury has noted that as much as $6.6 trillion in deposit liabilities could shift to stablecoins over time, with $2 trillion expected to make the transition by 2028. This shift is expected to drive a return to ""narrow banking,"" a model where banks fund their lending activities through wholesale capital markets rather than deposit inflows.

The regulatory landscape is evolving to accommodate this transition. The GENIUS Act, a landmark piece of legislation, has established a comprehensive framework for stablecoin issuance and use, removing key legal uncertainties and promoting consumer protections. This development has opened the door for broader adoption and integration into the financial system. However, as stablecoins continue to grow, the need for balanced, forward-looking regulation remains critical. Without it, the risks of instability and systemic shocks could increase, potentially leading to scenarios where government intervention becomes necessary.

As the stablecoin ecosystem matures, DeFi platforms and tokenization technologies are emerging as complementary tools to address the yield gap created by the shift away from traditional deposits. These innovations offer real-time settlement, transparency, and new financing opportunities for both lenders and borrowers. For banks, adapting to this new paradigm while maintaining core principles will be essential to remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","US ‘Crypto Week': A turning point for mining rules","https://coingeek.com/us-crypto-week-a-turning-point-for-mining-rules/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 15:02:42 GMT","

In July 2025, the U.S. House held what some call Crypto Week, a key time for cryptocurrency. On the table were the GENIUS Act, Clarity Act, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, all meant to form the rules for digital assets. Although the Act is primarily focused on stablecoins, it also helps the mining industry. The industry has been running without clear rules. Mining is up as BTC's price stays above $100,000, and what happens with these bills could shift the industry's future in the U.S., touching costs and investments.

As more people get into cryptocurrency, it's more important than ever to grasp why mining is so important to the crypto world and why there is a push for growth. The U.S. has some major mining groups, like Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), all facing issues, like high energy costs, concerns over the environment, and unclear guidelines. The bills during Crypto Week try to fix these issues, building a structure that could help the industry grow.

The GENIUS Act was signed into law on July 18, 2025. It aimed to boost new life into digital assets by giving tax breaks and easier permits for mining. The bill lowered red tape by calling mining sites important infrastructure and grew domestic mining investment. This helped because the industry relies on high-energy data centers. For example, miners such as Iris Energy (NASDAQ: IREN), which uses renewable energy, received tax help to cut costs and make U.S. mining more competitive.

The Clarity Act looks to make simple rules for stablecoins and crypto custody, which would help mining by making the market steadier. Stablecoins, which link fiat with cryptocurrencies, help miners turn earnings into cash. Clear custody rules would also protect miners' digital assets, lowering risks tied to custodians. This could get big investors interested and push more money into mining.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act is maybe the most argued. It aims to stop the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). People who support it say a CBDC could hurt the decentralized setup and lower the demand for mined coins. The bill shows worry about government reach. Some leaders bring up privacy risks with a CBDC. For miners, this helps keep Bitcoin valuable as a decentralized choice to regular currencies and ensures people still need their services.










Crypto Week took place at an interesting time. BTC's price hit $123,000 in July 2025, meaning more money for miners and interest from investors. Stock prices for mining groups like Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) and Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) have increased. Also, CoreWeave purchased Core Scientific for $9 billion, showing how attractive this business is. All this growth has put energy use and how it affects the environment in focus, and people want guidelines. The proposed laws try to find a balance between new ideas and being responsible, which could lead to rules for Bitcoin mining.

Though the House is mostly in agreement, the bills may not pass easily in the Senate. Some Senators are unsure, noting worries about the impact of figures like President Trump, who is all in on crypto. His clear support for BTC and mining has made talks hard. Critics say that political ties could stop true lawmaking. If passed, these bills could make the U.S. a center for BTC mining, standing against places like Russia, where rules are coming out, and South Africa, where state utilities are considering BTC mining support.

There's much riding on this for miners. Clear rules could lower compliance costs, now a large part of budgets, mostly for smaller players. It could also open up access to renewable energy, matching the industry's step to sustainability. For example, TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF) is focused on green energy and could benefit from policies that reward eco-friendly actions.

The effects go beyond mining. A helpful structure could raise investor trust and start new ideas in cloud mining, where platforms like Cryptosolo and AIXA Miner are making mining more open. By lowering barriers, these platforms could gain from policies that stabilize the market and let in everyday people. Miners and investors should still be careful, as rule outcomes are not certain and the market is still jumpy.

Crypto Week was a key point for the mining industry. The GENIUS Act, Clarity Act, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act could give the clarity and help needed to secure the U.S. as a leader in the crypto economy. As talks continue, the industry is watching, knowing that the choices made in July 2025 could form its path for years. For now, miners keep using BTC's price increase, but the chance of a regulated future is slowly getting some much-needed direction.

Articles Details

Delivering real-time insights and analysis on emerging financial trends and market movements.

- U.S. policy under Trump prioritizes crypto dominance via the GENIUS Act and Executive Order 14178, banning CBDCs while regulating stablecoins to reinforce dollar hegemony.

- Binance's global regulatory collaborations, including anti-fraud partnerships with Taiwan, highlight crypto firms aligning with governments to legitimize digital assets.

- EU's MiCA regulations (100% reserve-backed stablecoins) contrast with U.S. policies, driving market shifts toward U.S.-backed stablecoins like USDC and fragmenting global financial governance.

- Blockchain infrastructure (e.g., USD1 stablecoin) and China's digital yuan pilots signal a technological rivalry reshaping financial power dynamics between decentralized crypto and state-backed CBDCs.

- Investors face opportunities in blockchain firms (ConsenSys, Chainlink), CBDC-related equities (Ant Group, SWIFT), and tokenized assets, amid regulatory arbitrage and geopolitical-driven market volatility.

The global financial landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and cryptocurrencies converge with geopolitical strategies and technological innovation. From the U.S. Treasury's GENIUS Act to Binance's partnerships with governments, the integration of digital assets into traditional monetary systems is no longer speculative—it's a strategic imperative. This article examines how recent high-profile engagements between world leaders and crypto entities signal a pivotal transition in financial systems and identifies investment opportunities in fintech, blockchain infrastructure, and CBDC-related equities.  

The U.S. has emerged as a leader in shaping the future of digital money. President Trump's Executive Order 14178, signed in January 2025, explicitly banned federal agencies from promoting CBDCs while establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader vision of making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world,” as emphasized by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The GENIUS Act, enacted in July 2025, further solidified this stance by creating a regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, reinforcing the dollar's dominance in the digital age.  

Meanwhile, Binance's engagement with global regulators highlights the growing interplay between crypto firms and governments. In July 2025, Binance CEO Richard Teng met with Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau to strengthen cooperation in combating virtual asset crimes. This collaboration reflects a broader trend: crypto entities are no longer operating in isolation but are actively aligning with regulatory bodies to address risks like money laundering and fraud. Such partnerships are critical for legitimizing digital assets and integrating them into national financial systems.  

Europe's approach, however, contrasts sharply. The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, fully implemented in December 2024, mandates 100% reserve-backed stablecoins and stringent compliance protocols. This has led to a market shift toward U.S.-backed stablecoins like USDC, as seen in the delisting of Tether's USDT from European exchanges. The divergence between U.S. and EU frameworks underscores a fragmented global landscape, where regulatory leadership is increasingly tied to financial hegemony.  

The technological underpinnings of this transformation are equally compelling. Blockchain infrastructure is evolving from a niche innovation to a foundational layer for global finance. For instance, the Trump family's World Liberty Financial (WLF) has leveraged blockchain to launch USD1, a stablecoin backed by U.S. dollars and government money market funds. Binance's role in developing USD1's smart contract code and promoting it to 275 million users illustrates how blockchain is enabling scalable, decentralized financial systems.  

CBDCs, on the other hand, represent a centralized counterpoint. While the U.S. has opted to suppress CBDC development, countries like China and India are aggressively advancing their digital yuan and rupee initiatives. China's CBDC, already in pilot stages, is designed to enhance cross-border trade and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. This technological rivalry between decentralized crypto and state-backed CBDCs is reshaping global financial power dynamics.  

 

The convergence of geopolitics and technology presents both risks and opportunities for investors. Here's how to position your portfolio:  

Blockchain Infrastructure Firms: Companies providing the tools for decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin ecosystems are poised for growth. Firms like ConsenSys and Chainlink, which offer smart contract platforms and oracle services, are critical to the expansion of crypto networks. Additionally, custodial solutions for institutional investors, such as Coinbase and BitGo, will benefit from increased institutional adoption.  

CBDC-Related Equities: While the U.S. has distanced itself from CBDCs, other regions are investing heavily. Firms involved in China's digital yuan rollout, such as Ant Group and Alibaba Cloud, remain relevant in the Asia-Pacific market. In Europe, companies like SWIFT and R3 (developers of Corda) are adapting their platforms to comply with MiCA regulations. Investors should also monitor fintech firms in emerging markets, where CBDCs are being used to expand financial inclusion.  

Regulatory Arbitrage Opportunities: The regulatory fragmentation between the U.S., EU, and other regions creates arbitrage opportunities. For example, stablecoin issuers compliant with MiCA may gain a competitive edge in Europe, while U.S.-based firms like Circle (issuer of USDC) could dominate in markets with looser regulations.  

Crypto-Backed Tokens: The rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) is another frontier. Platforms like Securitize and Polymath are enabling the issuance of tokenized securities, which could bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain. These tokens may become a key asset class as CBDCs and crypto integration accelerates.  

While the outlook is optimistic, investors must remain cautious. Regulatory shifts, such as the U.S. banning CBDCs, can create sudden market volatility. Additionally, the ethical concerns surrounding crypto ventures—such as the Trump family's entanglements with Binance—highlight the need for due diligence. Cybersecurity risks and the potential for market manipulation in decentralized systems also warrant attention.  

The integration of CBDCs and cryptocurrencies is not just a technological revolution—it's a geopolitical and economic realignment. As governments and crypto entities forge new alliances, the financial systems of tomorrow will be defined by those who can navigate both regulatory complexity and technological innovation. For investors, the key lies in diversifying across blockchain infrastructure, CBDC-related equities, and tokenized assets while staying attuned to the evolving regulatory landscape.  

The era of digital money is here. The question is no longer if it will reshape global finance, but how quickly investors can adapt to its new rules.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Raoul Pal sees crypto users hitting a whopping 4B by 2030","https://cointelegraph.com/news/raoul-pal-s-bullish-forecast-sees-crypto-user-numbers-hit-4b-by-2030","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 06:46:05 GMT","

 Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal also predicted that total crypto market capitalization could reach $100 trillion within the next decade. 

The total number of crypto users could hit the 4 billion mark by 2030, according to former hedge fund manager and crypto bull Raoul Pal.

In an X post on Sunday, Pal shared data comparing the adoption rate of crypto users to internet users after each innovation hit 5 million users.

Pal did this by looking at the number of crypto wallets compared to the number of IP addresses. 

According to Pal, the total crypto user base has grown by 137% annually in nine years and has reached 659 million users by the end of 2024. In comparison, the total number of internet users hit 187 million by the end of 2000, at an annual growth rate of 76%.

Pal predicts the number of crypto users will grow by a moderate 43% next year, reaching 1 billion crypto users by 2030, or one-eighth of the global population. 

Pal's bullish forecast further predicts that crypto's market capitalization could cross the $100 trillion mark within the next decade and be achieved as early as 2032.

Debasement and adoption would likely be the primary catalysts for this growth, according to Pal.

“Debasement explains 90% of price action (adoption explains 100% of outperformance vs debasement),” said Pal, who is the founder and CEO of the financial knowledge and education platforms Real Vision and Global Macro Investor.

Some comments on Pal's X post, however, suggest Pal could be overestimating things. 

One X user said that wallets are not a reliable source of growth, with another suggesting that a founder of a crypto project could simply open “10000 wallets and spreading coins to make it look like he has a community.”

Another user pointed out that they create a new wallet every six months and have been doing so for the past four years.

However, Pal responded, arguing that everyone has multiple IP addresses, too. 

According to the B2B digital currency platform Triple-A, there were more than 560 million crypto users by the end of 2024.

Meanwhile, an October 2024 report by Andreessen Horowitz's crypto division indicates roughly 30 million to 60 million real crypto users monthly.

Bybit has implemented Nasdaq's market surveillance technology across its European operations to meet regulatory requirements under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation.

The cryptocurrency exchange, which ranks second globally by trading volume, will use the surveillance platform through its Bybit EU entity to detect and prevent market abuse. 

The technology addresses MiCAR compliance obligations that require digital asset exchanges to implement surveillance and reporting systems.

The modular architecture of Nasdaq's platform will accommodate Bybit EU's expansion plans while enabling compliance with local regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions.

Mazurka Zeng, Managing Director and CEO of Bybit EU, says the agreement demonstrates the company's commitment to providing compliant digital asset trading. 

“We welcome the opportunity to partner with Nasdaq, whose technology and surveillance expertise help safeguard the resilience and integrity of our marketplace,” Mazurka says.

Ed Probst, Head of Regulatory Technology at Nasdaq, says MiCAR is driving change in investor protection across digital asset markets. 

“Many compliance programmes are still failing to match the level of investor protection offered by traditional markets,” Ed says.

He says Bybit EU recognises the benefits of incorporating market data into its surveillance framework to protect against threat scenarios. 

“We look forward to building on this relationship and remain committed to advancing trust and resilience across the digital asset ecosystem,” Ed adds.

The surveillance platform serves over 50 exchanges and 20 international regulators globally. 

Nasdaq has developed the technology over 30 years, incorporating algorithms and features tailored for crypto markets alongside traditional financial instruments.

The system provides access to order book data for real-time decision-making, which Nasdaq identifies as a requirement for preventing and detecting market abuse in cryptocurrency markets. 

The platform combines pattern-recognition algorithms with market data and alerts configured for specific market mechanics.

The technology monitors over 60 billion cryptocurrency transactions daily through real-time, 24-hour surveillance systems. 

It includes integrated control frameworks with data quality reporting, audit functions, and case management tools.

The platform can monitor currency pairs trading and fractional volumes trading. 

Historical market data remains available through the system, including full-depth order book visual replay and reconstruction capabilities.

Nasdaq deploys the technology through software-as-a-service (SaaS) architecture to enable regular product upgrades and enhancements. 

The system helps reduce false positives while detecting cross-market manipulation, timing-based violations, layering and spoofing, liquidity exploitation and currency and commodity manipulation.

“We welcome the opportunity to partner with Bybit EU, who recognise the benefits of incorporating comprehensive market data into its surveillance framework to protect against critical threat scenarios”

Nasdaq's technology serves 97% of global systemically important banks and half of the world's top 25 stock exchanges. The company collaborates with 35 central banks and regulatory authorities, and maintains relationships with 3,800 clients across various financial services.

The platform provider leverages its cloud-managed service experience to help financial services companies address operational challenges while supporting industry modernization efforts.

MiCAR regulations compel digital asset exchanges operating in the EU to implement surveillance and reporting requirements. 

The regulatory framework aims to establish consistent standards for cryptocurrency market oversight across EU member states.

Bybit EU operates as the company's European entity, handling trading operations within the regulatory jurisdiction. 

The exchange maintains its global operations while adapting to regional compliance requirements through local subsidiaries.

“We welcome the opportunity to partner with Bybit EU, who recognise the benefits of incorporating comprehensive market data into its surveillance framework to protect against critical threat scenarios,” Ed concludes.

Home - Crypto Presales - Best Cryptos To Buy: HBAR, Litecoin, Sui All Set To Be Surpassed By Layer Brett Enroute To Crypto Top 10 Stardom

For any investor trying to pinpoint the best crypto to buy now, the conversation always boils down to a choice: do you stick with the old guard, or do you bet on the new blood? While established players like Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), and Sui (SUI) are solid parts of the crypto landscape, their days of explosive, portfolio-making growth are likely behind them.



This is precisely why a new contender, Layer Brett (LBRETT), is forcing its way into the spotlight. With its crypto presale now live, it's presenting a radically different value proposition. LBRETT combines the wild, viral energy of a memecoin with the powerful and efficient technology of an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain.

Litecoin (LTC) keeps its position in crypto, often called the “silver to Bitcoin's gold.” A long presence and its reliability have it as a staple for many investors. However, this very stability is what limits its future growth. With a massive market capitalization, the days of massive gains for Litecoin are likely in the past.

Investors are looking beyond the predictable performance of Litecoin. The market's appetite for high-growth assets means that while Litecoin provides security, it lacks the explosive potential of newer, more innovative projects. The kind of returns that early Litecoin adopters saw are now being found in low-cap gems like LBRETT, which operates on a more efficient framework than older proof-of-work coins like Litecoin.











Hedera (HBAR) has carved out a niche with its enterprise-grade hashgraph technology, attracting major corporate partners. This focus on business applications gives HBAR a strong foundation of utility. However, this business model also means slower growth, which isn't so great for retail investors chasing massive returns. HBAR is steady but lacks the viral X-factor.

While the business backing of HBAR is impressive, projects like Layer Brett are designed to capture the energy of the masses, combining meme culture with real-world utility. This approach creates a powerful narrative that can propel a token's value far faster than the gradual adoption seen with enterprise-focused coins like HBAR. Many investors would rather bet on a community movement than on the slower pace of HBAR.

Sui (SUI) represents the newer generation of Layer 1 blockchains, designed from the ground up for high performance and scalability. It has shown impressive growth and has a burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized applications. However, SUI operates in an intensely competitive Layer 1 arena.

While SUI offers advanced technology, it doesn't possess the unique cultural appeal of a memecoin. The viral, community-driven energy that can create a 100x event is not its primary focus. For investors, the question is whether the technological advantages of SUI can outperform the potential of a project like Layer Brett. As a Layer 1, SUI also faces a more arduous path to widespread adoption.

Layer Brett (LBRETT) is engineered to overcome the limitations of coins like HBAR, LTC, and SUI. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, it directly solves the high gas fees and slow transaction speeds that plague the main network. This makes the ecosystem accessible and affordable for everyone. It's not just another meme token; it's a high-utility project that fuses meme energy with tangible benefits.

While HBAR, LTC, and SUI are solid projects, their massive market caps mean the window for life-changing gains has likely closed. Layer Brett offers a rare ground-floor opportunity. Its smaller size gives it far greater potential for 100x growth, and its unique combination of Layer 2 tech and meme appeal makes it the best crypto to buy now. 

Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards, and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

Eric Trump made a notable appearance in Tokyo to back Metaplanet, a Japanese bitcoin treasury firm, as the company seeks to expand its international crypto ventures. As an adviser since March, Trump's presence at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting highlights the Trump's family's increasing involvement in the cryptocurrency world.

Metaplanet convened the meeting to secure shareholder approval for selling 550 million new shares overseas, aiming to raise 130.3 billion yen ($884.41 million) primarily to purchase additional bitcoin. Despite no formal comment from the company or Trump on the meeting, the capital-raising plan was successfully approved, according to attendees.

The financial landscape shift, influenced by individuals like Donald Trump, underscores the growing importance of crypto assets. Meanwhile, Metaplanet's transition from a hotel business to a prominent crypto player pays homage to the firm's success and expanding bitcoin holdings, even as its stock faces volatilities.

Binance is the first crypto exchange to list World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the Trump-family-linked decentralized finance (DeFI) project, with trading set to begin Monday afternoon UTC time, according to a recent announcement.

Deposits are already live, while withdrawals are scheduled to begin Tuesday. Binance will apply its “seed tag” designation, a label reserved for innovative but high-risk tokens.

Until now, WLFI tokens were non-transferable by design, a compliance-driven restriction meant to keep the presale tokens from being freely traded, and Binance's listing marks the shift to allowing transfers and opening markets on a centralized exchange for the first time.

Following the Binance announcement, South Korean exchange Upbit also said it will list WLFI.

On Binance, to access WLFI trading, users must complete quizzes acknowledging heightened volatility and risk disclosures. The token will launch on three blockchains simultaneously: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana.

WLFI futures launched last week on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, where traders rushed to short the token, driving its implied valuation down to $24 billion from $44 billion within hours.

The debut on Binance provides the first spot market for WLFI itself, marking a turning point from its non-transferable token phase to full tradability.

Eric Trump and Binance founder Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao both recently spoke at BTC Asia in Hong Kong.

This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin BTC$108,652.81 has breached key support levels in a sign of increasing bearish momentum that suggests a risk of a slide to $100,000.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 6.5% in August, ending the four-month winning streak as the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bled $751 million, according to data source SoSoValue.

The recent price drop saw bitcoin break below several key support levels, including the Ichimoku cloud, and the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs). It also pierced crucial horizontal support zones formed by the May high of $111,965 and the December high of $109,364, according to the daily chart sourced from TradingView.

These breakdowns underscore growing market weakness, confirming a bearish shift in key momentum indicators such as the Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) and the MACD histogram.

The short-term exponential moving average (EMA) band of the GMMA (green) has crossed below the longer-term band (red), signaling a clear bearish momentum shift. Meanwhile, the weekly MACD histogram has dropped below zero, indicating a transition from a bullish to a bearish trend.

Together, these signals indicate a likelihood of a sustained sell-off, potentially driving the price down to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $101,366, and possibly to the $100,000 mark.

The negative technical outlook aligns with seasonal trends, which show September historically as a bearish month for bitcoin. Since 2013, BTC has delivered an average return of negative 3.49%, closing lower in eight of the past 12 September months, according to data from Coinglass.

As for bulls, overcoming the lower high of $113,510 set on Aug. 28 is crucial to negating the bearish outlook.

Bitcoin BTC$108,652.81 enters September trading near $107,000, but history isn't on its side.

The month has been the weakest for BTC on average, with a median decline of approximately 5% and an average loss of around 6% over the past 12 years of market data.

Some point out MicroStrategy's premium over Bitcoin is slipping at the same time September's seasonal weakness looms. Nick Ruck of LVRG Research warns this reflects deeper doubts about the company's treasury-heavy strategy.

“MicroStrategy's recent struggle to maintain its Bitcoin premium reflects a broader market shift where investors are questioning the sustainability of corporate treasury models focused solely on crypto accumulation, a dynamic that could be exacerbated by September's historically bearish trend for crypto assets,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research.

“This cooling appetite underscores a maturation in crypto markets, where structural vulnerabilities and competition are forcing a reevaluation of what truly drives long-term value beyond mere Bitcoin proxies,” Ruck added.

With Fed rate-cut bets building into September, a dovish turn could soften the seasonal drag. Conversely, fresh ETF outflows or another equity selloff could reinforce the historical pattern and push BTC toward $100,000 support.

Meanwhile, ether (ETH) fell 1.7% to $4,390, while Solana's SOL (SOL) dropped 3.4% to $197.6. XRP XRP$2.7240 slid 4.3% to $2.72 and dogecoin DOGE$0.2103 retreated 4.2% to 21 cents, extending last week's gains into reversals.

Since 2013, bitcoin has closed red in September eight out of twelve times, with brutal drawdowns like 2019's 13% slide and 2014's 19% slump. Even during bull cycles, rallies have tended to stall. The lone bright spots were 2015, 2016, and 2023, with gains ranging from 2% to 7%.

That consistency has led traders to treat September almost as a seasonality trade. Seasonality refers to the tendency of assets to exhibit regular and predictable fluctuations that recur throughout the calendar year.

While it may appear random, possible reasons range from profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which can cause drawdowns, to the generally bullish “Santa Claus” rally in December, a sign of increased demand.

The pattern isn't unique to crypto, as equities also show weakness around this time of year; however, BTC's sharper volatility makes it stand out.

 The World Liberty Financial token, WLFI, began trading on several crypto exchanges on Monday. Here's how traders can avoid scams. 

After months of speculation, the Donald Trump–backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) token began trading Monday morning. However, confusion remains around the token's unlock schedule, supported exchanges and distinguishing the legitimate WLFI from a wave of imitations.

WLFI is the native token of World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform founded in 2024. While its utility has been kept deliberately vague, the project promotes itself as a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. WLFI functions as the platform's governance token, giving holders voting power over protocols and strategic decisions.

On Monday, the project confirmed WLFI is officially live with a total supply of 24.66 billion tokens, allocated as follows:

10 billion to World Liberty Financial Inc.

7.78 billion to enterprise blockchain company Alt5 Sigma Corporation

2.88 billion to liquidity and marketing

Just over 4 billion to the public

Binance became the first major exchange to list WLFI, offering trading pairs with USDC and USDT. Trading has also gone live on Bybit, Bitget and KuCoin.

Separately, Coinbase announced it will support WLFI on the Ethereum network, with trading to begin once “liquidity conditions are met.”

Alongside the hype, numerous WLFI scams have appeared. Analytics firm Bubblemaps identified “bundled clones” — look-alike smart contracts that imitate established crypto projects. Using the wrong contract address could result in a permanent loss of funds.

The following are the correct WLFI smart contract addresses across relevant networks:

Ethereum: 0xdA5e1988097297dCdc1f90D4dFE7909e847CBeF6

BNB Smart Chain: 0x47474747477b199288bF72a1D702f7Fe0Fb1DEeA

Solana: WLFinEv6ypjkczcS83FZqFpgFZYwQXutRbxGe7oC16g

Many crypto scams originate on social media, with X being a primary target. Official updates on WLFI tokens should only be trusted if they come from the verified “worldlibertyfi” account on X.

With a circulating supply of about 24.66 billion tokens, WLFI debuted at a market capitalization of $6.4 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Trading volumes surged, and the token climbed 14% to $0.26.

As with many crypto launches, WLFI's price action reflects a mix of speculative demand, limited liquidity and uncertainty around long-term adoption — factors that can drive sharp volatility in the early days.

 Metaplanet, Japan's largest Bitcoin treasury firm, bought 1,009 BTC to reach 20,000 BTC in holdings while issuing millions of new shares. 

Japan's top Bitcoin treasury firm, Metaplanet, just acquired 1,009 BTC, reaching 20,000 BTC of holdings just as the firm issues millions of new shares.

According to a Monday Metaplanet announcement, the firm acquired 1,009 BTC and reached 20,000 BTC for 16.479 billion yen (nearly $112 million). On the same day, the firm announced the issuance of 11.5 million new shares last week, following an investor's exercise of warrants to acquire stock.

According to BitcoinTreasuries.net data, Metaplanet is currently the sixth biggest and top Japanese Bitcoin treasury. The firm paid an average price of $102,607 per Bitcoin, which results in a 6.75% profit compared to Bitcoin's price at the time of writing.

The investor in question, Evo Fund, has acquired 10 million shares at $5.67 and 1.5 million at just under $6 for a total of about $65.73 million. Metaplanet spends those proceeds to finance the early redemption of approximately $20.4 million worth of previously issued bonds. Evo Fund still has rights to an additional 34.5 million shares.

The announcement also comes as Metaplanet faces mounting pressure, with its share price tumbling, threatening the fundraising model it has used to build its Bitcoin treasury. The firm's stock has dropped 54% since mid-June, despite Bitcoin gaining about 2% during the same period.

Analysts highlighted that falling stock prices make exercising warrants for Evo Fund less attractive, squeezing Metaplanet's liquidity and reducing its capability to acquire more Bitcoin. Still, the firm's strategy appears to be evolving and adapting to this new situation.

Last week, Metaplanet announced plans to raise approximately 130.3 billion yen ($880 million) through a public share offering in overseas markets. Today, the firm's shareholders will vote on whether to approve the issuance of up to 555 million preferred shares that could raise as much as 555 billion yen ($3.7 billion).

After Strategy — once known as MicroStrategy — devised the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy and adopted it with great success, many companies decided to follow in its footsteps. Still, this strategy is not guaranteed to work in the long term.

In fact, several Bitcoin treasuries appear to be already in deep trouble. In fact, Bitcoin treasuries can fail when Bitcoin's price drops and their stock net asset value premiums disappear, shutting down funding opportunities. Loans or margin calls may then turn those companies into forced Bitcoin sellers.

 A mysterious mega-whale is rotating billions from Bitcoin into Ether, signaling a broader shift as corporate and institutional investors boost ETH holdings. 

A Bitcoin whale has been accumulating billions of dollars' worth of Ether, surpassing the second-largest corporate treasury firm, signaling a growing rotation among large investors seeking cryptocurrencies with more upside potential.

A Bitcoin whale worth over $11 billion sold another $215 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to buy $216 million worth of spot Ether (ETH) on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid.

Following the latest buy, the whale now holds 886,371 Ether worth more than $4 billion, Lookonchain reported on Monday in an X post.

The growing whale demand for Ether is signaling the market's “natural rotation” into Ether and other altcoins with more upside potential, while Ether's price is also benefiting from growing corporate accumulation, Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph.

The $11 billion Bitcoin whale started rotating his funds into Ether on Aug. 21, when he sold $2.59 billion worth of BTC for a $2.2 billion spot Ether and a $577 million Ether perpetual long position, Cointelegraph reported.

Last Monday, the whale closed $450 million worth of his perpetual long position at an average Ether price of $4,735, to lock in $33 million worth of profit, before acquiring another $108 million worth of spot Ether.

The multibillion-dollar rotation inspired other large investors, including nine “massive” whale addresses that acquired a cumulative $456 million worth of ETH on Wednesday, Cointelegraph reported.

Some cryptocurrency whales are starting to eclipse the holdings of corporate cryptocurrency treasury firms.

With the latest investment, the mysterious whale's $4 billion Ether holdings are now worth more than the portfolio of SharpLink Gaming, the world's second-largest corporate Ether holder, which currently holds over 797,000 ETH worth $3.5 billion.

However, the whale's holdings are still just about 50% compared to the leading corporate Ether holder, Bitmine Immersion's 1.8 million Ether tokens worth over $8 billion, according to data from strategicethereserve.xyz.

Adding to the growing demand, spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also acquired over $1.8 billion worth of Ether over the past five trading days, data from Farside Investors shows.

“Institutions are clearly broadening their scope beyond Bitcoin,” according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset platform Nexo.

“For crypto, the pattern is clear: short-term moves will continue to hinge on macro releases, but the structural drivers of adoption, institutional inflows, and tokenized finance remain intact,” the analyst told Cointelegraph.

 World Liberty Financial published a blog post saying that the initial circulating supply for WLFI is 24.6 billion tokens. 

Update Sept. 1, 12:40 pm UTC: This article has been updated to add information from a WLFI blog post on Medium. 

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform backed by the Trump family, will unlock 24.6 billion WLFI tokens at launch, according to data confirmed by CoinMarketCap. 

On Monday, WLFI clarified that the initial circulating supply for its token will be 24.6 billion tokens. 

WLFI said 10 billion tokens will be for World Liberty Financial, Inc., 7.7 billion for Alt5 Sigma Corporation, 2.8 billion for liquidity and marketing, and 4 billion for public sale participants, representing their initial 20% unlock at launch. 

The clarification contradicts earlier estimates from CoinMarketCap that the project's supply will be around 27 billion tokens and a report from Tokenomist that the circulating supply will be around 3.69 billion tokens. 

WLFI said CoinMarketCap's initial estimates were correct at the time. “The 27B figure published on CoinMarketCap earlier on Sept. 1, 2025, was accurate at the time,” WLFI wrote. However, the project said it has since revised the figure to the more accurate amount of 24.6 billion tokens. 

Cointelegraph approached WLFI representatives for comments, but did not get a response before publication. 

Last Tuesday, the WLFI team started allowing users to move their WLFI tokens into a vesting lockbox to begin the unlock process. 

WLFI's token unlock agreement shows that 20% of tokens purchased in the $0.015 and $0.05 sales rounds will be released immediately, providing an upfront reward for the project's initial backers. 

The remaining 80% will be subject to WLFI's governance process, with future unlocking terms to be collectively decided by its community through a vote. 

The agreement also said the unlocking conditions are not fixed and may be altered through subsequent governance decisions or other applicable requirements. 

As a result, tokenholders could see the implementation of new unlocking models or adjustments made to existing schedules. This highlights the project's governance-first approach and the role of community members in shaping WLFI's tokenomics. 

On July 5, World Liberty Financial initiated a community proposal to make the WLFI token transferable and tradable across the crypto ecosystem. However, the proposal stated that founders, team and adviser tokens would not be immediately unlocked. 

On July 10, the proposal gained massive support, with 99% of the votes being in favor of the unlock.

Ahead of the partial unlock, open interest in derivative contracts for the WLFI token neared $950 million before cooling to $887 million on Monday. 

Open interest is the number of active, outstanding contracts that have not yet been settled. This shows that WLFI is seeing strong interest before it becomes tradable across crypto markets.

The Primal Pull of People Watching

Our social voyeurism may have deep evolutionary roots

The human fascination with watching others—whether through reality TV, Instagram stories or overheard drama—is often dismissed as nosiness. But new research suggests this impulse may be a social survival tool dating back millions of years.

To explore the origins of social curiosity, Laura Lewis, a comparative and developmental psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and her colleagues studied how human children between four and six years old from San Francisco's Bay Area and adult chimpanzees responded to certain videos showing members of their respective species. The results, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, show that both groups preferred watching social interactions over scenes involving solitary individuals—even forgoing small rewards to see the former.

“These findings demonstrate that social information is important, rewarding and valuable for humans and other primate species,” Lewis says. “It suggests that social information was also important for our shared primate ancestors who lived around 25 million years ago and that for millions of years it has been adaptive for primates to gain social information about those around them.”

Among the children (but not the chimps), the researchers noticed another pattern: as they grew older, boys became increasingly interested in watching scenes of social conflict, such as a tug-of-war over toys or one child crying while another yelled, whereas girls developed a stronger preference for positive interactions, such as play or hair grooming. The researchers hypothesize this result could reflect differing socialization patterns and evolutionary pressures particular to humans.

Another recent study, published in Animal Cognition, explored peer-watching behavior in long-tailed macaques. Both female and male macaques showed more interest in aggressive interactions than in peaceful grooming, and both paid more attention to videos of familiar individuals. The study's lead author, Liesbeth Sterck, a primatologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, says the latter behavior mirrors the way humans are drawn to the social lives of people they recognize—whether family, friends or movie stars. Interest in aggressive interactions, which are likely to reveal shifts in dominance or signal potential threats, echoes findings that humans are especially attuned to watching conflict in media. “Keeping track of the power balance in your own group likely has prime value for primates, including humans,” Sterck says.

Gillian Forrester, who studies comparative cognition at the University of Sussex in England and was not involved in either study, says social attention is key to maintaining a good reputation. In ancient humans and other primates, reputational damage can bar access to food and mates, incite physical confrontations and, in extreme cases, lead to potentially fatal ostracism. With so much at stake, primates evolved to keep a close eye on group members. “Modern humans retain this keen attention to other people's social interactions as an evolutionary adaptation,” Forrester says—so people watching might just pay off.

An international team of astronomers, led by The University of Texas at Austin's Cosmic Frontier Center, has identified the most distant black hole ever confirmed. It and the galaxy it calls home, CAPERS-LRD-z9, are present 500 million years after the Big Bang. That places it 13.3 billion years into the past, when our universe was just 3% of its current age. As such, it provides a unique opportunity to study the structure and evolution of this enigmatic period.

""When looking for black holes, this is about as far back as you can practically go. We're really pushing the boundaries of what current technology can detect,"" said Anthony Taylor, a postdoctoral researcher at the Cosmic Frontier Center and lead on the team that made the discovery. Their research was published Aug. 6 in the Astrophysical Journal.

""While astronomers have found a few, more distant candidates,"" added Steven Finkelstein, a co-author on the paper and director of the Cosmic Frontier Center, ""they have yet to find the distinct spectroscopic signature associated with a black hole.""

With spectroscopy, astronomers split light into its many wavelengths to study an object's characteristics. To identify black holes, they search for evidence of fast-moving gas. As it circles and falls into a black hole, the light from gas moving away from us is stretched into much redder wavelengths, and light from gas moving toward us is compressed into much bluer wavelengths. ""There aren't many other things that create this signature,"" explained Taylor. ""And this galaxy has it!""

The team used data from the James Webb Space Telescope's CAPERS (CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey) program for its search. Launched in 2021, JWST provides the most far-reaching views into space available, and CAPERS provides observations of the outermost edge.

""The first goal of CAPERS is to confirm and study the most distant galaxies,"" said Mark Dickinson, a co-author on the paper and the CAPERS team lead. ""JWST spectroscopy is the key to confirming their distances and understanding their physical properties.""

Initially seen as an interesting speck in the program's imagery, CAPERS-LRD-z9 turned out to be part of a new class of galaxies known as ""Little Red Dots."" Present only in the first 1.5 billion years of the universe, these galaxies are very compact, red, and unexpectedly bright.

""The discovery of Little Red Dots was a major surprise from early JWST data, as they looked nothing like galaxies seen with the Hubble Space Telescope,"" explained Finkelstein. ""Now, we're in the process of figuring out what they're like and how they came to be.""

CAPERS-LRD-z9 may help astronomers do just that.

For one, this galaxy adds to mounting evidence that supermassive black holes are the source of the unexpected brightness in Little Red Dots. Usually, that brightness would indicate an abundance of stars in a galaxy. However, Little Red Dots exist at a time when such a large mass of stars is unlikely.

On the other hand, black holes also shine brightly. That's because they compress and heat the materials they're consuming, creating tremendous light and energy. By confirming the existence of one in CAPERS-LRD-z9, astronomers have found a striking example of this connection in Little Red Dots.

The newfound galaxy may also help answer what causes the distinct red color in Little Red Dots. That may be thanks to a thick cloud of gas surrounding the black hole, skewing its light into redder wavelengths as it passes through. ""We've seen these clouds in other galaxies,"" explained Taylor. ""When we compared this object to those other sources, it was a dead ringer.""

This galaxy is also notable for how colossal its black hole is. Estimated as up to 300 million times that of our sun, its mass measures up to half that of all the stars in its galaxy. Even among supermassive black holes, this is particularly big.

Finding such a massive black hole so early on provides astronomers a valuable opportunity to study how these objects developed. A black hole present in the later universe will have had diverse opportunities to bulk up during its lifetime. But one present in the first few hundred million years wouldn't. ""This adds to growing evidence that early black holes grew much faster than we thought possible,"" said Finkelstein. ""Or they started out far more massive than our models predict.""

To continue their research on CAPERS-LRD-z9, the team hopes to gather more, higher-resolution observations using JWST. This could provide greater insight into it and the role black holes played in the development of Little Red Dots. ""This is a good test object for us,"" said Taylor. ""We haven't been able to study early black hole evolution until recently, and we are excited to see what we can learn from this unique object.""

Additional data for research came from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at Kitt Peak National Observatory, a program of NSF NOIRLab.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","NASA finds Titan's alien lakes may be creating primitive cells","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831112449.htm","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 08:50:39 GMT","

NASA research has shown that cell-like compartments called vesicles could form naturally in the lakes of Saturn's moon Titan.

Titan is the only world apart from Earth that is known to have liquid on its surface. However, Titan's lakes and seas are not filled with water. Instead, they contain liquid hydrocarbons like ethane and methane.

On Earth, liquid water is thought to have been essential for the origin of life as we know it. Many astrobiologists have wondered whether Titan's liquids could also provide an environment for the formation of the molecules required for life - either as we know it or perhaps as we don't know it - to take hold there.

New NASA research, published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, outlines a process by which stable vesicles might form on Titan, based on our current knowledge of the moon's atmosphere and chemistry. The formation of such compartments is an important step in making the precursors of living cells (or protocells).

The process involves molecules called amphiphiles, which can self-organize into vesicles under the right conditions. On Earth, these polar molecules have two parts, a hydrophobic (water-fearing) end and a hydrophilic (water-loving) end. When they are in water, groups of these molecules can bunch together and form ball-like spheres, like soap bubbles, where the hydrophilic part of the molecule faces outward to interact with the water, thereby 'protecting' the hydrophobic part on the inside of the sphere. Under the right conditions, two layers can form creating a cell-like ball with a bilayer membrane that encapsulates a pocket of water on the inside.

When considering vesicle formation on Titan, however, the researchers had to take into account an environment vastly different from the early Earth.

Uncovering Conditions on Titan 

Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in our solar system. Titan is also the only moon in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere.

The hazy, golden atmosphere of Titan kept the moon shrouded in mystery for much of human history. However, when NASA's Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, our views of Titan changed forever.

Thanks to Cassini, we now know Titan has a complex meteorological cycle that actively influences the surface today. Most of Titan's atmosphere is nitrogen, but there is also a significant amount of methane (CH4). This methane forms clouds and rain, which falls to the surface to cause erosion and river channels, filling up the lakes and seas. This liquid then evaporates in sunlight to form clouds once again.

This atmospheric activity also allows for complex chemistry to happen. Energy from the Sun breaks apart molecules like methane, and the pieces then reform into complex organic molecules. Many astrobiologists believe that this chemistry could teach us how the molecules necessary for the origin of life formed and evolved on the early Earth.

Building Vesicles on Titan 

The new study considered how vesicles might form in the freezing conditions of Titan's hydrocarbon lakes and seas by focusing on sea-spray droplets, thrown upwards by splashing raindrops. On Titan, both spray droplets and the sea surface could be coated in layers of amphiphiles. If a droplet then lands on the surface of a pond, the two layers of amphiphiles meet to form a double-layered (or bilayer) vesicle, enclosing the original droplet. Over time, many of these vesicles would be dispersed throughout the pond and would interact and compete in an evolutionary process that could lead to primitive protocells.

If the proposed pathway is happening, it would increase our understanding of the conditions in which life might be able to form.

""The existence of any vesicles on Titan would demonstrate an increase in order and complexity, which are conditions necessary for the origin of life,"" explains Conor Nixon of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""We're excited about these new ideas because they can open up new directions in Titan research and may change how we search for life on Titan in the future.""

NASA's first mission to Titan is the upcoming Dragonfly rotorcraft, which will explore the surface of the Saturnian moon. While Titan's lakes and seas are not a destination for Dragonfly (and the mission won't carry the light-scattering instrument required to detect such vesicles), the mission will fly from location to location to study the moon's surface composition, make atmospheric and geophysical measurements, and characterize the habitability of Titan's environment.

Driven by access to large volumes of movement data, the study of human mobility has grown rapidly over the past few decades. The field has shown that human mobility is scale-free, proposed models to generate scale-free moving distance distributions and explained how the scale-free distribution arises. It has not, however, explicitly addressed how mobility is structured by geographical constraints, such as how mobility relates to the outlines of landmasses, lakes and rivers and the placement of buildings, roadways and cities. On the basis of millions of moves, we show how separating the effect of geography from mobility choices reveals a power law spanning five orders of magnitude. To do so, we incorporate geography via the pair distribution function, which encapsulates the structure of locations on which mobility occurs. By showing how the spatial distribution of human settlements shapes human mobility, our approach bridges the gap between distance- and opportunity-based models of human mobility.

Pair distribution of buildings and addresses in France shows three scales: (I) Immediate neighborhood-scale with linear onset and oscillating modulation, (II) city-scale with power-law growth (α = 0.67, for addresses), and (III) country-scale with slower growth and rapid decay (see Supplementary Section 1.6).

The gender imbalance is the first panel due to the 1.07 male/female ratio rate at birth55. Indeed, we study the total population, not the currently alive population, that is balanced for gender due higher death rate for men. Therefore, although there is an imbalance in gender, the dataset is not biased. The second panel shows the birth year of every individual in the dataset, it closely follows the birth rate of Denmark, and the differences are due to migrations56.

Comparison between our framework, the gravity model and the radiation model for cities.

A continuous gravity law.

(a) This framework can be represented as a continuous gravity law, if we take a toy model of two distant cities, (b) the pair distribution at the distance d between the two cities collapses into a Dirac distribution, with the height equal to the product of cities population, N1N2. (c) The toy intrinsic distance cost of the simulation model. For a comparison with a continuous radiation model, see Supplementary Section 3.1.2.

Ctrl+Alt+Chaos



Joe Tidy Elliott & Thompson (2025)

The BBC's first cyber correspondent, Joe Tidy, travels the world interviewing high-profile cybercriminals and cybersecurity experts — part of a growing industry worth US$200 billion. What most intrigues him after a decade is how often hackers are solitary teenage boys, teaming up from their bedrooms, often thousands of kilometres apart, to “cause mayhem”. Why? Some want to hurt people, but a “decent chunk” have no idea of the harm and chaos they cause.

Vanished



Sadiah Qureshi Allen Lane (2025)

Before the nineteenth century, science did not know of extinct species. Then, fossil evidence introduced the concept of natural extinction, which was fully accepted in the theory of evolution. This period coincided with major colonial empires. Many white European naturalists and colonizers “argued that colonized peoples were on the verge of extinction”, writes historian of science, race and empire Sadiah Qureshi in her groundbreaking book. Some even thought this justified persecution of colonized peoples, and perhaps genocide.

Why Nobody Understands Quantum Physics



Frank Verstraete & Céline Broeckaert Macmillan (2025)

Quantum physics has long been mysterious, even for specialists, yet husband–wife duo physicist Frank Verstraete and linguist Céline Broeckaert succeed, often with brilliance, in making its history and mind-blowing ways accessible to lay readers. “Like listening to music,” they advise, “you don't have to understand the mathematical underpinning to enjoy it.” A pity, however, that they don't discuss Thomas Young's 1801 double-slit experiment — which is “the heart of quantum mechanics”, according to physicist Richard Feynman.

Flashes of Brilliance: The Genius of Early Photography and How It Transformed Art, Science, and History Anika Burgess W. W. Norton (2025)

As someone who has spent a career visualizing science, Flashes of Brilliance felt like reading a love letter to the power of the photographic image. This beautifully written book, by writer and photo editor Anika Burgess, is a thoughtful, personal and witty meditation on how imagery does much more than just document a scene.

Will AI jeopardize science photography? There's still time to create an ethical code of conduct

Will AI jeopardize science photography? There's still time to create an ethical code of conduct

Along with fascinating examples of early efforts to capture images of society, the book captures well the dual role of the scientific image — as both a tool for discovery and a medium of communication. A reader begins to understand that photography in general, and especially in science, is not just illustrative, it is investigative. And sometimes, as Burgess clearly describes, it is revelatory.

Through a series of compelling stories and visual examples, the author reminds us that an image can crystallize a complex idea in a way that no string of words ever can. It's a celebration of ‘aha' moments made visible. Those photographs wake us up to social issues and phenomena we never even knew existed.

Jacob Riis' images of the squalid conditions of people living in tenements in New York City's Lower East Side around 1889 say so much more than any text describing the situation. By using flash powder to add light to the exposure, he could reveal details of these ordinarily gloomy spaces and those inhabiting them.

Burgess doesn't shy away from the challenges, either — acknowledging how easily images can mislead or manipulate. Even from the beginning, some photographers used a technique to combine negatives in the printing process to create unreal scenarios. In the early 1870s, Édouard Buguet used this method to insert a translucent ‘spirit' above the people in his portraits to advance the idea that the dead could communicate from beyond the grave. Many viewers thought that the spirit was real; only in 1875 did Buguet admit that the images were fake.

The balance between clarity and accuracy is something I've grappled with throughout my career, and it's refreshing to see this issue addressed so directly. These days, at least in science, any manipulation must be considered carefully and reported.

Another example came as a surprise. I never tire of studying Eadweard Muybridge's beautiful sequences of still images showing horses in motion. His photographs from the late 1870s clearly show that at various moments in a trot, all four horse hooves leave the ground at the same time — a fact that wasn't known until then. What was new for me was to read how “he substituted, or missed out and renumbered, certain sets of images, which naturally calls into question their scientific utility”. As historian Marta Braun argues in her 1992 book Picturing Time: “under the guise of offering us scientific truth”, Muybridge has “like any artist made a selection and arranged his selection into his own personal truth”.

For those of us in science communication, this warning is essential. Just because an image is beautiful doesn't mean it tells the whole story. However, I don't want to completely discount his contribution to this ‘aha' moment in science. Informing us of his process (just as NASA scientists do when they colour astronomical images) and why he did what he did would have helped us to consider the study as an authentic scientific investigation.

Although Burgess emphasizes the early years of picture making, I was compelled to compare some of her thinking with writer Susan Sontag's discussion in On Photography (1977). Sontag famously argued that “to photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed” — these images have allowed our minds to consider whatever we are seeing as reality. And this idea resonates with many of the moments in Flashes of Brilliance in which early image makers were not only documenting the world but transforming it into something permanent, collectible and possible.

Whether it is Cecil Shadbolt's aerial photographs of London from a balloon or Louis Boutan's captures of life beneath the sea, such images aren't neutral — they shape what we think is true about the world and what we consider worth looking at.

A huge analysis of DNA methylation in human tissue has revealed new anti-ageing targets.Credit: Lawrence Lawry/SPL

The visible effects of ageing on our body are in part linked to invisible changes in gene activity. The epigenetic process of DNA methylation — the addition or removal of tags called methyl groups — becomes less precise as we age. The result is changes to gene expression that are linked to reduced organ function and increased susceptibility to disease as people age.

Now, a meta-analysis of epigenetic changes in 17 types of human tissue throughout the entire adult lifespan provides the most comprehensive picture to date of how ageing modifies our genes.

The study assessed DNA methylation patterns in human tissue samples and revealed that some tissues seem to age faster than others. The retina and stomach, for example, accumulate more ageing-related DNA methylation changes than do the cervix or skin. The analysis also found universal epigenetic markers of ageing across different organs. This ‘epigenetic atlas' might help researchers to study the link between DNA methylation and ageing and could aid the identification of molecular targets for anti-ageing treatments.

“I think this is a great resource” to understand ageing, says Joao Pedro Magalhaes, a molecular biologist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “This meta-analysis of methylation data across organs is, to my knowledge, the largest such resource assembled to date. I am sure that it will be valuable to researchers.”

The work is reported on the preprint server Research Square1 and has not yet been peer reviewed.

Researchers can already analyse DNA methylation patterns in people's genomes to create ageing clocks — tools that measure biological age. However, there are unresolved fundamental questions about whether these signatures of ageing are shared across tissue types.

To elucidate how methylation relates to ageing, Nir Eynon at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of more than 15,000 samples from 17 human tissues taken from adults of different ages. They mapped out methylation changes across 900,000 potential sites in the DNA, then created an open-access atlas. “We had examples from people from 18 years old till 100 or so,” says Eynon, so we can look at the epigenetic markers and how they change across the human lifespan.

What is ageing? Even the field's researchers can't agree

What is ageing? Even the field's researchers can't agree

Overall, the researchers found that the mean amount of methylation varies greatly between tissues, ranging from 35% in the cervix, through to 48% in skin, 51% in muscle, 53% in the heart, 57% in the stomach and up to 63% in the retina.

Study co-author Macsue Jacques, also at Monash University, says almost all tissues have increased DNA methylation as they age. The exceptions are skeletal muscle and lung, “which has more of a loss of methylation with age”. Their analysis also found that different organs have distinct ageing patterns of DNA methylation. “Each tissue has a different shift that happens,” Jacques says. 

As well as examining differences between tissues, the researchers screened individual gene sites throughout each tissue genome. “We wanted to find a common ageing mechanism that goes across all the tissue types,” says Jacques.

They found several genes that had methylation changes were strong biological markers of ageing across several tissues. These included the developmental regulators HDAC4 and HOX, which are related to senescence and age-related decline, and MEST, which has been associated with diabetes and obesity, two known accelerators of ageing2.

Arenes bearing silyl and boryl, or germyl and boryl groups, represent a significant class of bifunctional molecules that have garnered considerable attention in organic synthesis due to their unique reactivity and versatility in undergoing diverse chemical transformations. Despite their importance, the synthesis of these mixed-metalloid compounds, particularly those with ortho-substituted aromatic frameworks, often involves complex, multi-step procedures. Herein, we present a highly efficient, single-step method for synthesizing ortho-boronated arylhydrosilanes and arylgermanes via catalytic C−H borylation reaction. The use of Si- and Ge-containing directing groups has been demonstrated to effectively suppress undesirable metathesis reactions, a side effect typically associated with their metallic nature. Our approach employs an iridium catalyst in combination with a ligand and an acetate base, which facilitates the formation of benzo-fused four-membered metallacycles within the catalytic cycle. The method's broad applicability and practicality are further underscored by its ability to generate a wide array of valuable intermediates that can be easily transformed into various functionalized molecules. Both experimental and computational studies provide profound insights into the reaction dynamics and the factors influencing the formation of these strained metallacycles.

Catalytic C−H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for modifying carbon centers in organic molecules, offering atom-efficient and streamlined synthetic pathways1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. In complex molecules where multiple C–H bonds often reside in similar environments, the incorporation of a directing group has proven to be the most effective method for achieving selective transformation (Fig. 1a)11,12,13,14,15,16. These directing groups, whether inherently present or artificially introduced, serve to precisely position the metal catalyst at the desired C–H bond. Such process is thermodynamically favored due to the formation of stable five-, six-, and seven-membered metallacyclic intermediates, which ensure regioselectivity through conformational rigidity. Non-metallic elements, particularly those from the chalcogen (O, S) and pnictogen (N, P) groups, are widely utilized as coordinating atoms in directing groups. In contrast, the integration of directing groups containing metalloid elements has seen limited progress, primarily due to their propensity to induce undesirable metathesis reactions in the presence of transition metals, a consequence of their metallic character17. Although some success has been achieved with silicon atoms, current methods are only confined to specific substrate classes that form five-membered metallacyclic intermediates, significantly limiting their broader applicability18,19,20. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop more versatile C−H activation strategies that can accommodate a wider range of metalloid elements while moving beyond the conventional constraints of rigid metallacycle formation.

Arenes ortho-bisfunctionalized with silyl and boryl, or germyl and boryl groups, have been extensively utilized in photoelectronics, semiconductors, catalysis, and organic synthesis due to the unique properties of these distinct metalloids21,22,23,24,25,26,27. However, current synthetic methods for these compounds often require intricate, multi-step processes, particularly when forming two C−metalloid bonds individually28,29,30,31. Seminal studies by Milstein32,33, Tilley, and Bergman34 have demonstrated that iridium complexes derived from triphenylsilane can produce benzo-fused four-membered silametallacycles through oxidative addition of ortho C−H bonds (Fig. 1b). Building on these pioneering works, we are inspired to explore three key questions: whether such strained metallacycles can be generated in a catalytic fashion, whether they can further couple with boron species, and whether the metalloid elements can be extended to germanium atoms. Notably, Gaunt and coworkers have reported palladium-catalyzed β-selective C−H activation of aliphatic amines, predominantly achieved via the formation of four-membered metallacycles (Fig. 1c)35,36. In contrast, catalytic C−H borylation leading to the formation of benzo-fused metallacycles introduces even greater ring strain and a metalloid motif that is more susceptible to uncharted side reactions37,38,39,40,41.

Here, we introduce an ortho-selective C−H borylation directed by silicon and germanium atoms (Fig. 1d). Our system, which utilizes arylhydrosilanes or arylgermanes as substrates, combines an iridium catalyst with a bipyridine-type ligand, an acetate base, and HBpin to efficiently facilitate the formation of a benzo-fused four-membered metallacycle within the catalytic cycle. Importantly, this methodology effectively overcomes the common issue of byproduct formations from C−metalloid cleavage26,42,43,44,45 and metalloid−H bond cleavage46,47,48,49,50. This approach enables the one-step preparation of a diverse array of ortho-boronated arylhydrosilanes and arylgermanes, offering superior efficiency in terms of atom, step and redox economy. The ability to selectively functionalize these aryl compounds with boron atoms while maintaining the integrity of the metalloid atoms represents a significant advancement in the field of C−H activation.

To establish a platform for this chemical process, we initially opted for the reaction between triphenylsilane (1a) and HBpin (Table 1). The reaction was employed [Ir(cod)OMe]2 as the catalyst along with a tridentate ligand L1 at a temperature of 125 °C in THF. However, merely trace amounts of the desired C–H borylation product 2a were observed via GC-MS analysis (entry 1). To enhance the overall yield of the reaction, we explored the influence of various additives. The incorporation of LiOAc into the reaction system could slightly improve the reactivity (entry 2). Additionally, we examined alternative salts such as NaOAc (19%) and KOAc (26%), which exhibited superior effectiveness in facilitating the formation of 2a (entries 3–4). Conversely, the utilization of K2CO3 resulted in a significant decrease in yield (entry 5). These discoveries underline the significance of both the K+ cation and OAc- anion in influencing the overall outcome of the reaction. Moreover, we investigated the impact of different ligands on the reaction. The inclusion of bipyridine-type ligands L2–L4 proved to be crucial in promoting the reaction (entries 6–8), with the highest achievable yield of 2a (75%) obtained in the presence of L4 (entry 8). Under the optimized reaction conditions, we observed the absence of diborylated products, with Ph-Bpin emerging as the primary byproduct, presumably resulting from C-Si bond cleavage. The structure of product 2a was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In contrast, employing 1,10-phenanthroline (L5) as the ligand led to a significantly lower yield (entry 9). Other solvents such as dioxane, toluene, and DMF resulted in much lower reactivity (entries 10–12). We also explored the potential of alternative boron reagents, such as B2pin2, which yielded inferior results (entries 13). Interestingly, alternative iridium sources such as [Ir(cod)Cl]2 and [Ir(cod)acac]2 resulted in a substantial decrease in yield (entries 14–15), while other transition metals like [Rh(cod)Cl]2 completely failed to promote the reaction (entry 16). Reducing the loading of [Ir(cod)OMe]2 to 1.0 mol% still exhibited an acceptable reactivity (entry 17). Finally, a control experiment confirmed that the reaction did not proceed in the absence of the metal catalyst (entry 18).

Having the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we proceeded to explore the suitability of various arylhydrosilanes for ortho C–H borylation (Fig. 2). A wide range of triarylsilanes bearing substituents such as methyl (1b), isopropyl (1c), tert-butyl (1d), phenyl (1e), methoxy (1f), and methylthio (1g) were subjected to the system producing products 2b–2g with modest to good yields. Notably, the reaction of tri(naphthalen-2-yl)silane (1h), which possesses two potential sites for C–H borylation, demonstrated remarkable selectivity towards borylation at the less hindered C3 position. The structure of product 2h was also confirmed by X-ray crystallography. However, when identical reaction conditions were applied to dialkylarylhydrosilanes, the reaction efficiency decreased markedly, necessitating further optimization. The inclusion of NaOAc in the conditions with a mixture of B2pin2 and HBpin was found to significantly enhance the reaction efficiency. For example, silane 1i, bearing two isopropyl substituents, was successfully converted to product 2i in a 54% yield. In contrast, without NaOAc, the reaction became very chaotic. Substrate 1j, containing a para-methyl group, displayed favorable reactivity and selectivity at the less sterically hindered position. Conversely, substrate 1k, with a meta-methyl group, exhibited significantly reduced reactivity. Furthermore, other dialkylarylhydrosilanes with various substituents at the para position, including iPr (1m), tBu (1n), Ph (1o), OMe (1p), TMS (1q), F (1r), Cl (1s), CF3 (1t), and OCF3 (1u), were successfully utilized under these conditions. Additionally, the reaction of diisopropyl(naphthalen-2-yl)silane (1v) showed exclusive C3 selectivity. Under these optimized conditions, when diarylalkylhydrosilane 1w, containing two aryl and one methyl substituent, was tested, product 2h was only 17% yield, and a byproduct 2a, resulting from σ-bond metathesis, was observed. Interestingly, substrates with isopropyl (1x) and cyclopentyl (1y) groups exhibited compatible reactivity, indicating that the introduction of bulky substituents on the silicon atom can be advantageous in suppressing σ-bond metathesis. Finally, the reaction of silane 1z, containing two aryl and one benzyl substituent, displayed extraordinary selectivity for C–H bond activation within the benzyl motif, resulting in the formation of the dual C–H borylation product 2z with a yield of 68%. This intriguing outcome suggests a preferential formation of five-membered silametallacycles during the C–H activation process.

Reaction conditions: [Ir(cod)OMe]2 (2.5 mol%), L4 (5.0 mol%), 1 (0.50 mmol), HBpin (1.25 mmol), KOAc (1.25 mmol) in 1.5 mL of THF at 125 °C for 6 h under argon; For entries 8–25: [Ir(cod)OMe]2 (5.0 mol%), L4 (10.0 mol%), HBpin (0.15 mmol), B2pin2 (0.75 mmol), NaOAc (1.25 mmol) at 150 °C. aIsolated yield.

Based on the above findings, we extended our investigation to explore the application of hydrogermanes in C–H borylation (Fig. 3). Initially, when triphenylgermane (3a) was substituted with 1a under the standard conditions, a significant presence of byproducts arising from σ-C–Ge bond metathesis was observed. To address this challenge, we performed a comprehensive screening and identified an optimized reaction protocol employing a stoichiometric quantity of the tridentate ligand L1. This ligand effectively inhibited the metathesis pathway, enabling the formation of the desired product 4a with a 72% yield (entry 1). Diminishing the catalyst load significantly reduced the yield of the target product (entry 2). Nonetheless, decreasing the ligand amount to 30 mol% still facilitated the formation of 4a with an acceptable yield (56%). Notably, substituting ligand L1 with L4 resulted in only trace amounts of the desired product (entry 4). Additionally, KOAc was found to be indispensable for the reaction's progression (entry 5). Leveraging these insights, we investigated the feasibility of C–H borylation using a variety of arylhydrogermanes. Triarylhydrogermanes with different substituents on the benzene ring, such as methyl (3b), isopropyl (3c), methoxy (3d), methylthio (3e), fluoro (3f), and trimethylsilyl (3g), were tested in the reaction system, yielding products 4b–4g in moderate yields. Notably, the reaction involving tri-3-methylphenylgermane (3h) and tri-2-naphthylgermane (3i), which have two potential sites for borylation, showed a significant preference for the less sterically hindered position. Furthermore, hydrogermanes 3j and 3k, substituted with two phenyl groups and one alkyl group, were effectively transformed into products 4j and 4k with high efficiency. However, under these updated conditions, the reaction of a hydrogermane, containing one phenyl and two isopropyl substituents, completely failed. Instead, we only observed the byproduct resulting from σ-bond metathesis (not shown in the Figure).

Reaction conditions: [Ir(cod)OMe]2 (5.0 mol%), L1 (1.5 mmol), 3 (0.50 mmol), HBpin (1.25 mmol), KOAc (1.25 mmol) in 3.0 mL of THF at 115 °C for 24 h under argon. aYield was determined by GCMS. bIsolated yield.

The adept synthesis of mixed-metalloid compounds has paved the way for more in-depth investigations into their reactivity (Fig. 4). Our initial studies focused on the reactivity of ortho-boronated arylhydrosilanes (Fig. 4a). For instance, compound 2a can efficiently undergo a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction with iodoarenes 5, leading to the rapid formation of biaryl product 6 in a yield of 54%. Subsequently, in the presence of Wilkinson's catalyst, compound 6 can be further transformed through dehydrogenative cyclization, yielding silole 7 with an impressive 88% yield51. Moreover, the reaction of compound 2a with ClCH2I and nBuLi results in the in situ generation of the CH2BrLi reagent, which ultimately leads to the formation of boronate 8, now featuring an additional methylene unit52. Notably, the methylation of the Si–H bond in 2a, achieved via treatment with CH2I2 and Et2Zn, delivers product 9 with full conversion. This compound can then be effectively oxidized using NaBO3·4H2O, providing phenol 10 in nearly quantitative yield. Further diversification of compound 9 is achieved by subjecting it to NIS in the presence of CuI, resulting in the iodination product 11 with a yield of 73%. Additionally, we developed a Rh-catalyzed cyclization protocol wherein compound 9 reacts with alkyne 12, enabling the synthesis of benzosilole 13 with a 63% yield53. We also explored the reactivity of ortho-boronated arylgermanes, using reagent 3a as the starting material (Fig. 4b). Through a sequential C–H borylation and methylation of the Ge atom, compound 14 can be synthesized in a one-pot process with a yield of 64%. Utilizing the above rhodium-catalyzed cyclization conditions, we successfully obtained benzogermole 15 with a good yield from compound 14 and alkyne 12.

A series of deuterium labeling experiments were initially conducted in the absence of HBpin to elucidate the potential reaction intermediates (Fig. 5). When the reaction utilizing Ph3Si–D (1a–d) was performed without KOAc, 76% deuterium incorporation was observed at the ortho position of 1a, while only 5% D was detected at the silicon atom (Fig. 5a). The observed D incorporation suggests that the oxidative addition of Si–H bond to iridium center is irreversible and that the reaction may proceed through a four-membered silacyclic metal intermediate. The ortho C–D incorporation increased upon the addition of KOAc, indicating that KOAc accelerates the ortho C–H metalation. Furthermore, subsequent addition of D2O to this system resulted in significant deuterium labeling at the Si atom (43% D), suggesting the formation of a potassium silylide within the system, which can undergo hydrolysis with water. Importantly, no deuterium incorporation was observed in 1a with D2O in the absence of the catalyst (Fig. 5b). This discovery further confirms the essential presence of the iridium catalyst for the formation of four-membered silacyclic-iridium intermediate. A series of deuterium labeling experiments were then conducted under standard conditions using HBpin. During the work-up stage, deuterium was introduced into the reaction mixture of 1a and HBpin, resulting in 68% Si–D incorporation in the final product 2a (Fig. 5c). This observation confirms that the final product 2a is derived from a potassium silyl precursor. To further elucidate the mechanistic details of the Ir-catalyzed C–H borylation process, two kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments were performed. In the first experiment, parallel reactions were carried out using Ph3SiH (1a) and Ph3Si–D (1a–d1) with HBpin, yielding a KIE value of 1.29 (Fig. 5d). In the second experiment, parallel reactions were conducted using Ph3SiH (1a) and (C6D5)3Si-H (1a–d15) with HBpin, revealing a KIE value of 1.52 (Fig. 5e). These findings suggest that the cleavage of the Si–H bond and the ortho C–H bond are not the rate-determining steps in the reaction54.

Based on the above results, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to elucidate the reaction pathway of triphenylsilane 1a in the absence of HBpin, aiming to gain a deeper understanding the formation of strained silametallacycles (Fig. 6). The catalytic cycle initiates with the dissociation of the dimeric iridium catalyst into the monomeric iridium intermediate INT1A. Following this, the Si−H bond of 1a undergoes oxidative addition to the iridium center of INT1A through the transition state TS2A, with an activation energy of 13.6 kcal mol−1 relative to the zero-energy point. In the absence of KOAc, the formed intermediate INT2A undergoes a reversible intramolecular oxidative addition of ortho C–H bond, forming a four-membered strained silametallacycles, designated as INT3A. In the presence of KOAc, intermediate INT2A activates the ortho C–H bond via a base-assisted internal electrophilic-type substitution (BIES) mechanism55,56. This process proceeds through the transition state TS3A-OAc, characterized by an activation energy of 18.1 kcal mol−1. Remarkably, this pathway is substantially more energetically favorable compared to the oxidative addition route through TS3A, which exhibits a significantly higher activation energy of 33.7 kcal mol−1. The reduced activation energy associated with the BIES mechanism underscores the efficiency of KOAc in facilitating the C–H activation, thereby promoting the formation of the strained silametallacyclic intermediate. Intermediate INT4A further undergoes reductive elimination via TS5A-Si with an activation energy of 25.3 kcal mol−1, transferring the hydrogen atom from silicon to the ortho-position of silicon center. This finding is consistent with experimental observations of deuterium incorporation.

We further investigated the competition reaction between silane 1a and HBpin with iridium catalyst (Fig. 7). The calculated energy barrier for the oxidative addition of the H–B bond to iridium is 18.8 kcal mol−1 relative to the energy of Ir-cat, significantly higher than that of the transition state TS2A for the oxidative addition of the H–Si bond (18.8 kcal mol−1 for TS2A-B vs 13.6 kcal mol−1 for TS2A). This energy difference suggests that silane 1a preferentially reacts with the iridium catalyst to form the strained silametallacyclic intermediate INT4A. This mechanistic pathway deviates notably from the previously directed aromatic C−H borylation triggered by Ir-Bpin species (see Supporting Information Figs. S1–6 for details)57,58,59.

Based on the above results, we examined the pathway leading to the final products by DFT calculations (Fig. 8). A molecule of HBpin coordinates to the Ir center in INT4A, undergoing oxidative addition via transition state TS6A, with an energy barrier of 1.5 kcal mol−1, to form the Ir-H intermediate INT6A. Subsequently, reductive elimination and H2 release generate the penta-coordinated intermediate INT7A, with an activation energy of 2.3 kcal mol−1. A competitive pathway involving direct reductive elimination from INT6A to form the C–B bond was also considered but ruled out due to its prohibitively high energy barrier. The reductive elimination of INT7A proceeds through transition state TS8A, which has an activation energy of 20.3 kcal mol−1, leading to the formation of the desired C–B bond. In TS8A, the forming C–B bond length is 1.68 Å, indicating a well-defined transition state for this critical step. The generated intermediate INT8A then undergoes a transmetalation process with excess KOAc in the system, forming a silicate-potassium salt, pro-K. The structural information of transition state TS9A reveals the forming K–Si bond length to be 3.19 Å and the breaking Ir–Si bond length to be 3.45 Å. The activation energy barrier for this step is calculated to be 34.0 kcal mol−1 relative to INT6A, making it the highest energy barrier in the calculated free energy profile and thus the rate-determining step. During the work-up with D2O, the formed pro-K can further undergo hydrolysis, resulting in the formation of products 2a–d, as shown in the experimental results in Scheme 4a. Concurrently, the Ir intermediate INT10A, which is also generated, participates in an oxidative addition with another silane 1a, followed by a BIES-type C−H bond activation. This sequence of events culminates in the generation of the strained silametallacyclic intermediate INT4A, thereby completing the catalytic cycle efficiently.

In conclusion, we have successfully developed a highly efficient and practical method for the synthesis of mixed-metalloid products through C−H borylation, enabled by iridium catalysts. This breakthrough addresses several long-standing challenges in the field of C−H activation, particularly the catalytic formation of strained benzo-fused metallacycles and the use of metalloid directing atom. The dual functionality of the formed mixed-metalloid compounds is a significant advantage, as it enables the synthesis of a wide range of valuable molecules with high versatility. The findings represent a significant advancement in organic synthesis, opening new avenues for the creation of complex and functionalized organic molecules with improved efficiency and selectivity.

Smartphone use among teenagers is a hot-button topic for many people. Credit: Matthew Abbot/The New York Times/Redux/eyevine

In December, the Australian government will bring the Online Safety Amendment Act into force. The law will prevent people under 16 years of age from having accounts for a range of social-media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. The legislation, introduced in response to concerns over children's online safety and well-being1, provides a golden opportunity for researchers to investigate how social-media use might affect mental health among adolescents — a complex issue that has been the subject of heated debate.

Social-media bans won't work — there are better ways to keep kids safe

Social-media bans won't work — there are better ways to keep kids safe

There's little time to plan and set up the ideal experiment. Assessing the mental-health status and Internet usage of tens of thousands of teenagers in Australia and comparator countries over time, before and after the legislation comes into force, is no mean feat. It would require substantial organization in schools, the recruitment of research staff, agreement about the research measures used and fast ethical review and parental consent, all of which takes many months. Nevertheless, there are more-feasible approaches that could provide valuable information if researchers act promptly.

An as-yet-unnamed advisory committee and research partner have been established by the government to review the effect of the act, but to our knowledge there have been no official announcements about the responsibilities, leadership or research strategies they will adopt. We urge the committee to consider implementing each of the following three approaches.

Hospital admissions records and coroners' reports can track the incidence of serious self-harm and suicides among adolescents before and after the introduction of legislation. The benefits of this approach are that it is possible to gather data for the whole country, rather than studying a subset of teens, and that many years of retrospective data are available. Data from other nations can also be used to help determine whether any changes to mental health in Australia can be ascribed to the bans or whether they simply reflect broader trends.

On the downside, it takes time for official data to become available. Figures on suicide are linked to time-consuming coroners' investigations, so data sets are often not finalized for years. Routinely collected data do not reveal anything about individual mental-health trajectories and social-media use, making it hard to determine whether social media contributed to peoples' actions. These records also do not allow investigation of the many instances of anxiety and depression that do not lead to self-harm or suicide. This is because these conditions often go untreated or are addressed through primary health-care services or private psychologists, from which data are not easily collated.

The government could commission surveys of the health and well-being of young people aged under 16 before and after the legislation is brought in. Two national surveys have been run in Australia in the past, the latest in 2013–142. Starting one survey in the coming months and another in four years' time would enable comparisons with previous cohorts.

These surveys typically involve a representative sample of the population. To study the social-media ban, they might instead oversample at-risk subgroups — teens from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQIA+) or those with pre-existing mental health conditions, for instance. The surveys could be used to probe risk factors for anxiety and depression, including online bullying, and could ask detailed questions about mental ill-health and social-media use on various platforms, going beyond generic measures such as screen time. They could also include measurements of lifestyle and any activities or hobbies taken up to fill the time previously spent on social media. Analyses would help to answer questions about which individuals are protected by social-media bans, and what online activities are associated with improved well-being.

The drawback of these surveys is that the proposed first cohort (to be evaluated in the coming months) would have a different social-media environment and different stressors from the second group, which would be assessed in four years' time. This would make any comparisons complex and challenging. A gap of four years between surveys would make the data coarse with respect to any trajectories of change — but narrowing that gap to, say, two years is probably both financially and politically unfeasible.

Researchers could take advantage of ongoing longitudinal studies of young people to recruit new cohorts and follow them up over time. These studies have the advantage of individual retrospective data. Australia has several such studies that include mental-health measures. The Future Proofing Study, for instance, began in 2019 and is examining the onset and trajectory of mental-health conditions in 6,000 adolescents from age 13 onwards3. It is scheduled to finish this year, but could be funded to include a new cohort running from now until 2030.

How social media affects teen mental health: a missing link

How social media affects teen mental health: a missing link

Trials evaluating public-health interventions could also be used, if their timespan encompasses the social-media ban (the control groups in such trials are essentially longitudinal observational studies). One example is the Health4Life trial4, which is investigating the effect of six lifestyle interventions on the mental health of 11- to 13-year-olds in three Australian states. It could continue its follow-up assessments for longer than the current limit of 36 months.

An audit of existing trials and longitudinal studies, both in Australia and in potential comparator countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States, should be high on the priority list for the ban's advisory committee and researchers. But comparisons are likely to be complex, owing to probable differences in sample demographics, risk assessments, age in the cohorts and outcome measurements. It might also be tough to achieve safe and ethical access to these cohorts — teenagers and their parents might not have consented to have their data used beyond the original investigation.

Genetic variants (both coding and noncoding) can impact gene function and expression, driving disease mechanisms such as cancer progression. The systematic study of endogenous genetic variants is hindered by inefficient precision editing tools, combined with technical limitations in confidently linking genotypes to gene expression at single-cell resolution. We developed single-cell DNA–RNA sequencing (SDR-seq) to simultaneously profile up to 480 genomic DNA loci and genes in thousands of single cells, enabling accurate determination of coding and noncoding variant zygosity alongside associated gene expression changes. Using SDR-seq, we associate coding and noncoding variants with distinct gene expression in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in primary B cell lymphoma samples, cells with a higher mutational burden exhibit elevated B cell receptor signaling and tumorigenic gene expression. SDR-seq provides a powerful platform to dissect regulatory mechanisms encoded by genetic variants, advancing our understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications for disease.

Genomic variation in both coding and noncoding regions of the genome drives human population differences and disease1,2,3. Over 90% of predicted genome-wide association study variants for common diseases are located in the noncoding genome, while their gene regulatory impact is challenging to assess. Genetic loss-of-function screening of coding genes and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)/CRISPR activation screens in noncoding regions have provided valuable insights into disease mechanisms. However, they neglect precise genomic variation potentially masking more complex cellular disease phenotypes caused by individual variants4,5,6,7. Existing precision genome editing tools to introduce variants have limited efficiency and variable editing outcomes in mammalian cells8,9,10. This makes it difficult to use guide RNAs (gRNAs) as a proxy to annotate the variant perturbation in pooled screens. Although some droplet-based technologies enable assessment of variants within transcripts, they neglect the impact of noncoding variants, which constitute the vast majority of disease-associated variants11. Exogenous introduction of sequence variants, via episomal massively parallel reporter assays for noncoding variants or open reading frame expression for coding sequences, allows for high-throughput screening of variants for functional effects but lacks endogenous genomic position and sequence context12,13,14,15. These limitations hinder systematic studies of endogenous genetic variation and its impact on disease-relevant gene expression.

To confidently link precise genotypes to gene expression in their endogenous context, a combined single-cell genomic DNA (gDNA) and RNA assay is required to directly assess coding and noncoding variants and gene expression in the same cell. Current technologies that enable simultaneous high-sensitivity readout of both gDNA and RNA are well established and laborious with low throughput16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. High-throughput droplet-based or split-pooling approaches can measure thousands of cells simultaneously but lack combined high-sensitivity and tagmentation-independent readout of gDNA and RNA26,27,28,29. This results in sparse data with high allelic dropout (ADO) rates (>96%), making it impossible to correctly determine zygosity of variants on a single-cell level. Here, we developed targeted droplet-based single-cell DNA–RNA sequencing (SDR-seq), a scalable and sensitive method to screen genetic variation in high throughput, linking it to gene expression and distinct cellular states.

We developed SDR-seq to simultaneously measure RNA and gDNA targets in the same cell with high coverage across all cells. The assay combines in situ reverse transcription (RT) of fixed cells with a multiplexed PCR in droplets using Tapestri technology from Mission Bio (Fig. 1a). Cells are dissociated into a single-cell suspension, fixed and permeabilized. In situ RT is performed by using custom poly(dT) primers, adding a unique molecular identifier (UMI), a sample barcode (BC) and a capture sequence (CS) to cDNA molecules. Cells containing cDNA and gDNA are loaded onto the Tapestri machine. After generation of the first droplet, cells are lysed, treated with proteinase K and mixed with reverse primers for each intended gDNA or RNA target. During generation of the second droplet, forward primers with a CS overhang, PCR reagents and a barcoding bead containing distinct cell BC oligonucleotides with matching CS overhangs are introduced. A multiplexed PCR amplifies both gDNA and RNA targets within each droplet. Cell barcoding is achieved through the complementary CS overhangs on PCR amplicons and cell BC oligonucleotides. After multiplexed PCR, emulsions are broken, and sequencing-ready libraries are generated. Distinct overhangs on reverse primers containing either R2N (gDNA, Nextera R2) or R2 (RNA, TruSeq R2) allow for separation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) library generation for gDNA and RNA. This enables optimized sequencing of each library: (1) full-length to entirely cover variant information on gDNA targets along with the cell BC and (2) transcript and BC information (cell BC, sample BC and UMI) for RNA targets.

Source data

To test SDR-seq, we performed a proof-of-principle (POP) experiment amplifying a small number of gDNA (28) and RNA (30) targets in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (Fig. 1b). As fixation is critical for in situ RT, we tested two different fixatives, paraformaldehyde (PFA) and glyoxal. PFA is commonly used in in situ RT reactions but can impair gDNA and RNA quality as it cross-links nucleic acids30. Glyoxal does not cross-link nucleic acids and was expected to provide a more sensitive readout31,32. For simplicity, overhangs on reverse primers for gDNA and RNA were the same (R2N) in this experiment (Extended Data Fig. 1a). After filtering high-quality cells and removing doublets using distinct sets of sample BCs during in situ RT for each fixation condition, we obtained ~9,000 cells from a single SDR-seq run (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1b–f). Cells were evenly distributed over the two fixation conditions, with over 95% of reads per cell mapping to the correct sample BC on average (Fig. 1e,f). For downstream analysis, contaminating reads were removed from each cell.

gDNA target coverage is expected to be uniform across cells as each cell contains the same gDNA input. We detected 23 of 28 gDNA targets (82%) with high coverage and in the vast majority of cells (Fig. 1g–i). Minimal differences in gDNA target detection and coverage were observed between PFA and glyoxal conditions (Extended Data Fig. 1g,i). RNA target coverage is expected to vary as they were chosen based on a range of expression levels. Indeed, individual RNA targets showed varying expression levels, with some only expressed in a subset of cells (Fig. 1j–l). RNA target detection and UMI coverage increased when using glyoxal compared to PFA (Extended Data Fig. 1h,j). Ubiquitously expressed housekeeping and iPS cell maintenance genes were detected in all cells, whereas other genes showed specific expression only in a subset of cells, consistent with published data (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d)33. Comparing bulk RNA-seq data of human stem cells to pseudo-bulked SDR-seq gene expression showed comparable levels of expression for the vast majority of targets with high correlation (Fig. 1m,n). SDR-seq showed reduced gene expression variance and higher correlation between individually measured cells than iPS cell data from 10x Genomics and ParseBio, indicating greater measurement stability (Fig. 1o and Extended Data Fig. 2e).

To test for potential cross-contamination of gDNA and RNA between cells during in situ RT, we performed a species-mixing experiment using human WTC-11 iPS cells and mouse NIH-3T3 cells. Cells were processed either separately or as a mixed population during in situ RT (Extended Data Fig. 2f). This allowed us to distinguish contamination introduced during in situ RT from general ambient nucleic acids by comparing the mixed-species condition to the single-species controls. We obtained a total of 16,000 cells across the different in situ RT conditions with the vast majority of doublets effectively removed using the sample BC information introduced during in situ RT (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h). Cross-contamination of gDNA was minimal (<0.16% on average), with no difference between the mixed-species and single-species conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2i,k,l). RNA cross-contamination was low (0.8–1.6% on average), with increased levels in the mixed-species condition compared to in the single-species controls (Extended Data Fig. 2j,m,n). The majority of cross-contaminating RNA from ambient RNA could be removed using the sample BC information introduced during in situ RT (Extended Data Fig. 2m,n). These data indicate that overall levels of cross-contaminating nucleic acids are low in SDR-seq.

Together, these results demonstrate that SDR-seq enables highly sensitive detection of DNA and RNA targets across thousands of single cells in a single experiment, with the potential to link both modalities in a high-throughput manner.

Next, we tested whether SDR-seq is scalable to detect hundreds of gDNA and RNA targets simultaneously. We designed an experiment using panels of 120, 240 and 480 targets, with equal numbers of gDNA and RNA targets in iPS cells (Fig. 2a). To enable cross-panel comparison, 60 gDNA and 30 RNA targets were shared between panels. To adjust for differences in sequencing depth, reads were subsampled for gDNA and RNA based on panel size to achieve equal average read coverage per cell for shared targets (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). We confirmed that separately prepared NGS libraries for gDNA and RNA mapped with high specificity to their respective references (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Overall, 80% of all gDNA targets were detected with high confidence in more than 80% of cells across all panels, with only a minor decrease in detection for larger panel sizes (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Detection and coverage of shared gDNA targets were highly correlated between panels, indicating that gDNA target detection is largely independent of panel size (Fig. 2b,c). The minor decrease in detection for the larger panel sizes predominantly affected low-coverage targets (Extended Data Figs. 4d,e and 5a). Similarly, RNA target detection showed a minor decrease in larger panels compared to the 120 panel (Extended Data Fig. 4f–h). Detection and gene expression of shared RNA targets were highly correlated between panels (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 4i,j), indicating robust and sensitive detection independent of panel size. Variability was predominantly observed for lowly expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Source data

To assess whether chromosomal context influences gDNA detection using SDR-seq, we included target sites among the shared panels that were either overlapping expressed genes (OEGs) or not OEGs (NOEGs). Additionally, we tested for different chromatin marks and states (H3K3me3, H3K27ac and DNase sensitive), reflecting different genomic regulatory element types depending on their proximity to the transcription start site (TSS; Fig. 2f)34. We did not observe a strong impact on detection and coverage across panels based on OEG or NOEG location (Fig. 2g). Notably, no specific regulatory element type showed a systematic detection bias, and even sites with low DNase signal were confidently recovered.

Genes were selected based on a range of expression levels and grouped into high, medium and low expression (Fig. 2h). High- and medium-expression genes were detected in almost all cells, whereas low-expression genes showed reduced detection rates across panel sizes (Fig. 2i). This aligns with published data suggesting that some genes are not expressed in all iPS cells33. Overall expression levels of shared genes were highly similar across the different panel sizes tested (Fig. 2e,j).

To determine the ADO rate of SDR-seq, we selected gDNA amplicon loci containing heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms based on bulk sequencing data. In amplicons detected in more than 80% of cells, heterozygous variants were correctly called in an average of 87–94% of cells (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). The primary cause of ADO in larger panels was overall low detection rates of a gDNA target (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Noise levels of both miscalled variants and deletions or insertions were low (<0.15%) and showed comparable levels across panels (Extended Data Fig. 5f–h). The frequency of these lowly abundant miscalled variants depends on the reference base, with PCR deamination byproducts likely being the most common. Variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of individual variants could distinguish true heterozygous alleles from variant noise (Extended Data Fig. 5i).

SDR-seq is thus scalable to assay hundreds of gDNA and RNA targets simultaneously with high reproducibility and sensitivity across different panel sizes, independently of chromatin state and expression level. This makes it a versatile tool to analyze variants at hundreds of loci in single cells, while simultaneously measuring cellular gene expression.

Genomic variants can increase or decrease gene expression, but effect sizes are often small. Therefore, a sensitive readout of these gene expression changes is essential. We probed the ability of SDR-seq to detect strong and subtle gene expression changes across different perturbation systems designed to repress gene expression or introduce variants that alter expression levels.

To assess whether SDR-seq can detect strong gene expression changes, we designed a CRISPRi experiment composed of four gRNA categories: (1) nontargeting control gRNAs (NTC), (2) gRNAs targeting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), (3) gRNAs targeting the TSS of genes predicted to be affected by those eQTLs (CRISPRi controls) and (4) gRNAs targeting gene bodies to possibly introduce STOP codons through editing (STOP controls; Fig. 3a). CRISPRi-expressing human iPS cells infected with a lentiviral CROP-seq gRNA library were selected via fluorescence-activated cell sorting, followed by SDR-seq. The SDR-seq primer panel amplified the gDNA sites of the eQTLs together with associated transcripts, the viral CROP-seq transcript to assign cells to gRNAs and multiple housekeeping genes to normalize data. Cells were successfully assigned to gRNAs (75%), with an average of 30 cells per gRNA (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). NTC gRNAs showed no significant effect on any of the genes measured, whereas most (95%) TSS-targeting CRISPRi control gRNAs caused a strong reduction in target gene expression (Fig. 3b). Seven eQTLs (24%) and three STOP control gRNAs (60%) significantly reduced target gene expression. Significantly scoring eQTL and STOP control gRNAs were located within a 2-kb window of the TSS, suggesting a direct inhibitory effect similar to CRISPRi control gRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 6c). This demonstrates that SDR-seq can confidently detect gene expression changes mediated by CRISPRi. Additionally, these data highlight the importance of directly assessing variants in proximity to the TSS to evaluate their impact on gene expression rather than approximating such effects with CRISPRi.

Source data

Next, we aimed to directly install eQTL variants and measure more subtle effects on gene expression (Fig. 3c). We generated two human iPS cell lines expressing a prime editing (PE) transgene, with or without the coexpression of a dominant-negative regulator of the mismatch repair pathway designed to enhance editing efficiency (Pemax or Pemax-MLH1dn)10. To validate the system, we used a fluorescent lentiviral reporter system that measures editing efficiency via reconstitution of a nonfunctional enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP; Extended Data Fig. 6d). Using a PE gRNA (pegRNA) that repairs eGFP, we observed ~50% editing efficiency, demonstrating the system's editing potential in human iPS cells (Extended Data Fig. 6e). We lipofected these PE iPS cells with a pegRNA library designed to introduce the same eQTLs tested in the CRISPRi screen, as well as STOP codons to assess nonsense-mediated decay. Following fluorescence-activated cell sorting enrichment of lipofected cells, we performed SDR-seq (Fig. 3c). Editing efficiency was limited in both PE cell lines, complicating the interpretation of many variants (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Despite this limitation, we performed differential gene expression testing for between called reference (REF), heterozygous (HET) and alternative (ALT) variant alleles (Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). Significant gene expression changes were only observed for the STOP controls (Fig. 3d). Depending on the position of the STOP codon within the transcript, effects of nonsense-mediated decay on transcript levels can vary35. For SOX11, we observed no changes, whereas STOP codons introduced in ATF4 and MYH10 resulted in significant reductions in gene expression (Fig. 3e).

In addition to installing eQTLs with PE, we tested the use of base editing (BE) in human iPS cells. We selected 56 high-likelihood eQTLs with a potential association for gene expression changes based on multiple studies, including noncoding variants that are located in open chromatin and editable with ABE8e or CBE base editors36,37,38 (Fig. 3f). None of these variants have previously been experimentally validated in an endogenous context as causative for transcriptional regulation, to our knowledge. After introducing gRNA libraries into iPS cells, cells were selected, and SDR-seq was performed. We found several eQTL variants with a significant effect on target gene expression (Fig. 3g). Additionally, we measured the effect of non-BE-associated mutations using SDR-seq. Human iPS cells accumulate somatic mutations during cell culture, while they undergo constant competitive selection for variants that are advantageous in culture conditions39. We found a synonymous variant in the 3′ end of POU5F1, a gene encoding a critical pluripotency factor, which significantly altered gene expression in the same direction as observed in prior eQTL studies36 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). However, after assessing variants that may have accumulated during culturing along the entire amplicon, we found that certain combinations of variants showed different effects on POU5F1 expression (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 8b). In particular a set of variants in the 3′ untranslated region was associated with significantly different transcript levels. The presence of these variants was confirmed by bulk amplicon sequencing of this locus (Extended Data Fig. 8c). This highlights the importance of directly assessing variants at the locus of interest to accurately resolve their impact on gene expression.

SDR-seq can confidently detect variants at the single-cell level and associate them with gene expression differences, demonstrating sensitivity even for subtle changes. This is the case even under conditions of limited editing efficiency in our experiments, which confound the interpretation of many tested eQTLs.

Linking genetic variants to gene expression profiles is crucial for understanding cancer pathogenesis yet remains challenging in primary samples. B cell lymphomas are heterogenous cancers of the lymphatic system arising from distinct stages of B cell maturation. In this maturation process, naive B cells are stimulated to migrate through the dark zone (DZ) and light zone (LZ) of the germinal center, where they undergo somatic hypermutation and selection, followed by maturation into memory B cells and plasma cells40,41,42,43. Although the cell of origin is central to the classification of B cell lymphomas, it was recently shown that cancer cells retain their ability to differentiate. Thereby tumors acquire multiple maturation states from the same cell of origin while simultaneously undergoing clonal evolution through the accumulation of heterogenous genetic variants over time44,45.

We used B cell lymphomas to investigate how genetic variation impacts gene expression and differentiation within tumors. We analyzed primary tumor samples from two individuals with follicular lymphoma and one individual with germinal center subtype diffuse large B cell lymphoma using SDR-seq (Fig. 4a). A targeted gDNA panel, based on variants from bulk DNA sequencing, was applied to profile 3,600 to 8,400 cells per sample. Clustering of cells showed distinct separation between B cells and non-B cells in both RNA- and variant-based analysis (Fig. 4b,c). Using a reference mapping approach based on mutual nearest neighbors and canonical correlation analysis, we mapped B cell maturation states from a dataset of nonmalignant reactive lymph nodes to tumor samples (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b)44,46. Immunoglobulin light chain restriction confirmed monoclonality and malignancy of tumor B cells (Extended Data Fig. 9c)47. Somatic HET or ALT variants detected in both malignant B cells and non-B cells suggested limited contributions to disease progression, whereas variants occurring exclusively in malignant B cells may be oncogenic (Fig. 4d). Variants found in bulk gDNA sequencing of the same samples could also be recovered using SDR-seq (Extended Data Fig. 9d). The three samples showed a number of distinct variants, while some predominately somatic variants were shared.

Next, we focused on a comparative analysis between DZ and LZ maturation states as most B cells belonged to these states (>80%). Clustering DZ and LZ cells based on variant information covered with our targeted gDNA panel revealed that two samples (FL2 (follicular lymphoma) and GCB1 (germinal center subtype diffuse large B cell lymphoma)) showed clonal structures (Fig. 4e). Genetic clones showed differences in proportions of the DZ and LZ states annotated by gene expression, indicating that clonal evolution and differentiation are predominantly separate processes. Our data suggest that genetic clones with different variant composition continue differentiating after they arise and can have an impact on differentiation rates.

Differential abundance testing showed that BCL2 variants, a gene encoding an antiapoptotic factor frequently overexpressed in B cell lymphomas and central to B cell maturation, were enriched in the LZ compared to DZ (Fig. 4f)48. Variants were also enriched in many immunoglobulin variable region genes, which are targeted during somatic hypermutation. LZ cells predominantly exhibited an increase in ALT or REF variant alleles compared to DZ cells (Fig. 4f). Next, we tested if frequent variants impact gene expression in cells belonging to either the LZ or DZ state. We subset cells within each state into variant containing or not containing and performed differential gene expression testing. This revealed a number of genes involved in B cell receptor signaling and tumorigenesis, frequently affected in both DZ and LZ states, with increased participant-specific expression levels predominantly in the LZ compared to in the DZ (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 9e). Elevated B cell receptor signaling is associated with repressing apoptosis in B cell lymphomas49,50. Cells with higher mutational burden, characterized by frequent HET and ALT variants, showed elevated levels of B cell receptor signaling compared to cells with lower mutational burden (Fig. 4i). LZ cells in the geminal center can revert to the DZ following unsuccessful binding to antigens from antigen-presenting cells and thereby undergo multiple rounds of somatic hypermutations51. Our data suggest that cells with a high mutational burden may have undergone more rounds of somatic hypermutation and have increased B cell receptor signaling and tumorigenic gene expression patterns to evade apoptosis induced by unsuccessful antigen binding in the LZ. This is in line with the distinct enrichment of variants in the LZ compared to in the DZ that we observe.

Using SDR-seq, we profiled variants and gene expression simultaneously in primary tumor samples, linking cell states to mutational burden. We could distinguish variants present in malignant B cells and non-B cells, perform clustering analysis based on variants identifying clonal structures, test for enrichment of variants in maturation states and assess their impact on gene expression. This revealed elevated tumorigenic and antiapoptotic signaling in cells with higher mutational burden.

Here, we developed SDR-seq to directly measure gene expression combined with coding and noncoding variants in single cells with high throughput and sensitivity. This method uses targeted primer panels for droplet-based multiplexed PCR to assess both gDNA and RNA in the same cells. Importantly, SDR-seq enables variant detection in noncoding regions of the genome, where the vast majority of disease-associated variants are located1,2,3,11. The targeted approach of SDR-seq facilitates high coverage of gDNA and RNA targets, allowing for confident detection of genomic variants and their zygosity, sensitive gene expression readout and reduced sequencing costs. This contrasts with existing split-pooling or droplet-based approaches, which rely on tagmentation of nucleosome-depleted chromatin and require whole-genome sequencing of each cell, resulting in sparse data and difficulties in correctly determining variant zygosity26,27,28,29. For these methods, ADO rates are high (>96%), whereas SDR-seq enables accurate detection of ~90% of alleles at the single-cell level. ADO levels of SDR-seq are comparable to targeted single-cell DNA sequencing using Tapestri (ADO < 10%)52. Lower-throughput single-cell methods that are plate based rely on tagmentation, amplification via multiple displacement or primary template-directed amplification (PTA) for gDNA readouts while enabling a whole-genome sequencing readout16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. Although tagmentation- and multiple displacement amplification-based technologies also have high ADO rates, PTA achieves a high recovery rate for correctly determined alleles (>90%) when sequencing libraries are at saturation20,23,24,53. SDR-seq achieves a drastic ~100-fold increase in cell throughput compared to PTA-based single-cell DNA and RNA-sequencing technologies, while reducing total genome coverage due to its targeted approach24.

Our results demonstrate that SDR-seq can assay hundreds of gDNA loci and genes simultaneously with high reproducibility and sensitivity across different panel sizes, covering up to 42.8 kb of gDNA per cell. Variants could be detected independent of chromatin context across hundreds of gDNA loci in the same cell. Distinct RNA targets can be picked and adjusted according to experimental needs. The scalability and sensitivity of SDR-seq make it a versatile tool for studying a wide range of coding and noncoding genetic variants and their effects on gene expression across diverse cell types. We can detect variants at a frequency of around 0.15% depending on the type and length of the variant. In both human iPS cells and primary human samples, we link variants to distinct gene expression patterns and can sensitively detect subtle gene expression changes. Advances in PE and pegRNA prediction tools might overcome limitations that we observed in this study constraining the interpretation of several infrequently edited eQTLs. In B cell lymphoma samples, SDR-seq enabled the identification of tumor-specific variants and their associated gene expression profiles, highlighting its potential for studying intratumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution. We could associate cells with higher mutational burden to elevated B cell receptor signaling and tumorigenic gene expression in primary B cell lymphoma samples.

In future applications, SDR-seq could be combined with other readouts, including a targeted protein readout or DNA methylation, to provide a more holistic view of cellular regulation54,55. Targeting the mitochondrial genome with SDR-seq could enable clonal tracing of cell populations based on mitochondrial somatic variants56,57. Enhanced gene expression readouts might enable measurement of larger RNA panels or a whole-transcriptome readout in parallel to a highly sensitive targeted gDNA readout for multiple loci. Although our attempts for a combined whole-transcriptome readout by using template switch oligonucleotides during the in situ RT reaction were unsuccessful, other experimental approaches might be successful, thereby broadening the scope of potential applications.

SDR-seq offers a powerful, scalable and sensitive approach to link genomic variants to gene expression in single cells, and this method is flexible to assay both genetically engineered cell lines and primary tissue samples. With the vast majority of predicted variants for common diseases located in the noncoding genome, SDR-seq enables the study of these variants systematically at scale1,2,3. In combination with gene editing tools, it holds great potential to decipher the regulatory mechanisms that underlie endogenous variants, complementing other high-throughput approaches that assay the gene expression-to-variant link of endogenous loci or via barcoding approaches12,13,14,15,58,59. This method advances our ability to study gene expression regulation and its implications for disease, providing insights that could drive the development of therapeutic strategies and enhance our understanding of complex genetic disorders.

A detailed protocol for SDR-seq is published on protocols.oi at https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6qpvr9q43vmk/v1.

WTC-11 iPS cells (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, GM25256) were verified to display a normal karyotype, were contamination free and were regularly tested for mycoplasma. Cells were cultured in Essential 8 medium (E8; Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1517001) on Vitronectin XF-coated (StemCell Technologies, 07180) tissue culture plates. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. iPS cells were split using Accutase (StemCell Technologies, 07922) and E8 supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (RI; Tocris, 1254). After single-cell dissociation, 1 volume of E8 + RI was added, and cells were spun at 200g (5 min), resuspended and plated in E8 + RI. Mouse NIH-3T3 (DSMZ, ACC 59) cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, 11965092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin and 1× nonessential amino acids on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

WTC-11 iPS cells were dissociated into single cells using Accutase, filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer and counted. For all experiments performed in human iPS cells, 1.5 × 106 cells were used as input for fixation. This was the minimum number of cells that were used as input for fixation in any experiment that involved human iPS cells.

For glyoxal fixation, cells were resuspended in 200 µl of glyoxal fixation solution (3% glyoxal, 20% ethanol and 0.75% acetic acid (glacial), pH 4.0) and incubated for 7 min at room temperature. One milliliter of ice-cold wash buffer 1 (1× PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM DTT and 0.5 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor; Promega, N2615) was added, and cells were spun at 500g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the wash step was repeated with wash buffer 1 for a total of two washes. Cells were resuspended in 175 µl of ice-cold permeabilization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor, 1 mM DTT, 2% BSA, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 and 0.01% digitonin) and incubated for 4 min on ice. One milliliter of ice-cold wash buffer 2 (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor, 1 mM DTT and 2% BSA) was added, and the tube was gently inverted four to six times. Cells were spun at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in ice-cold resuspension buffer (1× PBS, 2% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor), filtered through a 40-µm strainer, counted and diluted to 1.4 × 106 cells per ml.

PFA fixation was performed as described elsewhere with adaptations60. In short, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 1× PBS with 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor, 3 ml of 1.3% PFA solution (in 1× PBS) was added, and cells were fixed for 10 min on ice. One hundred and sixty microliters of permeabilization buffer (5% Triton X-100 with 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor) was added, and the tube was gently inverted four to six times and incubated for 3 min on ice. Cells were spun at 500g for 3 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was carefully removed, and cells were resuspended in 500 µl of 1× PBS with 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor. Ice-cold 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 (500 µl) was added and mixed by inverting the tube. Then, 20 µl of permeabilization buffer was added and mixed by inverting the tube four to six times. Cells were spun at 500g for 3 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed, resuspended in 300 µl of 0.5× PBS with 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor, filtered through a 40-µm strainer, counted and diluted to 1.4 × 106 cells per ml.

Cell loss during fixation ranged between 10 and 30%. This was achieved by performing spins in swinging-bucket rotors and using 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes during the entire process.

RT master mix consisting of a final concentration of 1× RT buffer, 0.25 U µl−1 Enzymatics RNase Inhibitor (Biozym, 180520), 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor, 500 mM dNTPs and 20 U µl−1 Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher, EP0752) was prepared on ice in 8 µl for a total reaction volume of 20 µl. Four microliters of RT oligonucleotides (12.5 µM) was combined in each 96-well plate with 8 µl of RT master mix (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Eight microliters of fixed and permeabilized cells (10,000 cells) was added to each well, yielding a total reaction volume of 20 µl. We used a total of 48 RT reactions, yielding 480,000 cells, and recommend this number as it provides enough surplus to be in the range of the optimal cell concentration needed for the Tapestri microfluidic device from Mission Bio (105,000–200,000 cells). RT was performed in a thermocycler using the following program: 10 min at 50 °C and three cycles of 2 s at 8 °C, 45 s at 15 °C, 45 s at 20 °C, 30 s at 30 °C, 2 min at 42 °C and 3 min at 50 °C, followed by 5 min at 50 °C. All RT reactions were pooled into a 15-ml conical tube containing 10 ml of 1× PBS with 1% BSA, and cells were spun at 500g for 5 min.

Samples were processed using a Tapestri microfluidic device from Mission Bio (version 2, MB51-0007, MB51-0010 and MB51-0009) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with modifications. The in situ RT-processed cell pellet was resuspended in cell buffer from Mission Bio, and cells were counted and diluted to the appropriate concentration of 4,000–8,000 cells per µl. Custom primers were used in the multiplexed droplet PCR amplification step. RNA primers were designed using the TAP-seq primer prediction tool with a targeted optimal melting temperature of 60 °C (minimum 58 °C and maximum 62 °C) and a product size range from 150 to 300 bp using published single-cell RNA-sequencing iPS cell data for primer prediction (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress with E-MTAB-6687)4,33. gDNA primers were designed using the Tapestri Designer (https://designer.missionbio.com). Primers were not validated before use; a dropout of around 10–20% is expected for gDNA primers.

Especially for gDNA primers a dropout of custom primers is to be expected. An overview of version 1 and version 2 primer sequences with corresponding overhangs can be found in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Version 1 gDNA and RNA primers both had CS and R2N overhangs (only used in the POP experiment). Version 2 gDNA primers had CS and R2N overhangs, whereas RNA primers had CS and R2 overhangs. Detailed information on sample multiplexing using RT primers can be found in Supplementary Table 3. Forward and reverse stock primers had concentrations of 20 µM and 120 µM for both versions, respectively. Both reverse and forward primer mixes contained equimolar amounts of gDNA and RNA targeting primers. For version 1, final sequencing libraries were generated according to the Mission Bio user guide. For version 2, RNA and gDNA sequencing libraries were generated separately using the corresponding library amplification primers (Supplementary Table 2).

Human iPS cells (WTC-11) and mouse fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) were fixed as described above with glyoxal. Cells of each species origin were either used individually or mixed during subsequent in situ RT using a distinct sample BC-introducing RT primer per well (48 in total). Human and mouse genes to profile by SDR-seq were selected to display a range of expression. RNA targeted primers were designed as described above using public data (https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/500-1-1-mixture-of-human-hek-293-t-and-mouse-nih-3-t-3-cells-3-lt-v-3-1-chromium-x-3-1-low-6-1-0) from 10x Genomics for NIH-3T3 primer design. Genomic sites were randomly selected, and gDNA targeted primers were designed as described above. Samples were processed using a Tapestri microfluidic device from Mission Bio (version 3, MB03-0091, MB03-0092 and MB03-0093) with modifications as described above.

The study (S-254/2016) was approved by the University of Heidelberg's Ethics Committee. Informed consent from every participant was gathered beforehand. Lymph node samples were processed and frozen following previously described methods61,62. Frozen samples were thawed, added to 10 ml of RPMI (Gibco, 11875093) supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5 mM EDTA and spun at 400g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 1× DPBS supplemented with 5% FBS, filtered through a 70-µm strainer and spun at 400g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 100 µl of bead solution from a Dead Cell Removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-090-101) and incubated for 15 min in the dark. Binding buffer was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the LS column (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-042-401) was washed with 500 µl of binding buffer. Cells were applied to the column and washed four times with binding buffer while collecting the flow through. Cells were spun at 400g for 5 min and resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer. We proceeded with glyoxal fixation and SDR-seq as described above. For primary cells, input can be a limiting factor to perform SDR-seq. As described above, we recommend 48 wells with 10,000 cells each for the in situ RT reaction yielding 480,000 cells, enough surplus to be in the optimal range for the Mission Bio microfluidic device (105,000–200,000 cells). If there are not enough cells in an individual primary sample, they can be multiplexed on the same Tapestri run by using distinct sample BCs during the in situ RT reaction to achieve the optimal cell concentration needed as input for the Tapestri device. To fill up an entire lane of a Tapestri run, the minimum number of cells that was used in this study for a primary sample was 380,000 cells as input for the glyoxal fixation and 350,000 cells as input for the in situ RT. This represents the lowest number used in this manuscript and yielded around 8,400 cells for this particular run.

The gDNA panel was constructed for regions with >20% VAF detected in the selected tumor samples from the targeted DNA-sequencing data, which were sampled previously in Fitzgerald et al.44. Genes for a targeted expression readout of the profiled B cell lymphoma samples were chosen based on both the literature and CITE-seq data from the same samples44. These included genes from maturation markers found in the literature and variable features, differentially expressed genes and housekeeping genes based on single-cell RNA-sequencing data (Supplementary Table 4). Primers were designed as described above.

For each SDR-seq dataset generated, we first performed custom BC identification and error correction, mapped reads to custom reference sequences and built read and deduplicated UMI matrices. This was performed with a software package we named SDRranger (https://github.com/hawkjo/SDRranger; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14762618 (ref. 63)).

The full BC structure for the RNA targeted libraries is of the format cell BC1 (variable-length linker (14–17 bp)), cell BC2 (constant length linker (15 bp)) and sample BC (UMI). The gDNA libraries are the same but lack the sample BC and UMI. To identify these, we first aligned each read to all possible linker backbone sequences to account for the variable-length linker sequences. We discarded alignments with length-normalized alignment scores more than two standard deviations below average, measured from the first 10,000 reads. We then performed error correction on BC1 and BC2 to unique corrected BCs with a Levenshtein distance of 0 or 1. Due to the adjacent UMI, the sample BC does not have an identifiable end point in the case of insertions and deletions, so we corrected sample BCs with free divergence of 0 or 1 and with no other BC with free divergence only 1 higher64.

Following BC identification, reads were mapped to custom alignment references built for each gDNA and RNA library. For gDNA, the chromosomal locations of the amplicons were used to extract reference sequences. For RNA, the site of the primer binding until the end of the poly(A) tail was used to extract reference sequences. Reference sequences were extracted from GRCh38.p14. Custom fasta and .gtf files were generated and used to build references using the genomeGenerate function of STAR (v2.7.11a). Separate gDNA or RNA-sequencing libraries were aligned to the corresponding reference, except for checking the specificity of the sequencing libraries.

For the POP experiment, reads were separated into gDNA and RNA reads before BC identification by a separate mapping step to the corresponding references. Final bam files are produced, which contain tags with cell BC and sample BC sequences for each read, both before and after error correction.

Matrices were then constructed by tallying reads by cell BC and sample BC versus gene or gDNA amplicon. To construct the UMI matrices, UMIs were deduplicated by adapting the directional network deduplication method described in the UMItools package65. For all reads from a given cell and given gene or amplicon, a connectivity graph of all observed UMIs is constructed. Each node is a unique UMI sequence and read count of that sequence, and directed edges are added between nodes A and B if the two UMIs have a free divergence of 1 to allow for indels, but only if nA ≥ 2nB – 1 reads, where nA and nB are the respective numbers of reads. This is based on the observation that each additional error to a UMI sequence should reduce the frequency of observing that sequence. Furthermore, only one incoming ‘parent' edge is allowed per node to avoid artifactual connections through singletons. The final number of UMIs is the number of connected components of the graph at the end of this process. This is repeated for each cell and sample BC for each gene or amplicon to build the full matrix.

The resulting cell–gene (UMIs–RNA) and cell–amplicon (reads–gDNA) matrices were analyzed in R using the Seurat R package (v5.0.3). First, a general threshold per cell was set on reads per cell (RNA + gDNA) based on rank–rank plots of reads per cell ranked by size to determine an initial set of cells to include in the analysis. Then, multiple metrics were used to filter for high-quality cells. Only one distinct set of sample BCs is expected to be found per cell; therefore, this can be used to effectively remove doublets in the dataset. Contaminating reads that did not belong to the maximum sample BC found per cell were removed. RNA count matrixes were processed (log-normalized, scaled). A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on all genes measured for RNA matrices. A probabilistic PCA was performed on all variants measured for VAF matrices. This was followed by subsequent UMAP embedding. For clustering, the shared nearest neighbor graph was calculated and used as input for Louvain clustering.

Each cell that was defined as high quality was then used to call variants using the GATK HaplotypeCaller (v4.2.3.0)66. Individual bam files were generated using the cell BC of the high-quality cells using the package sinto (v0.10.0). Each individual cell bam file was modified to contain the cell BC in the read name and indexed using samtools (v1.17), and the MAPQ scores were set from 255 (STAR output) to 60 and to be compatible as an input in the GATK HaplotypeCaller. GATK HaplotypeCaller was run using no maximum read threshold per cell and using a diploidy of two, and resulting vcf files were merged to yield a matrix of cells to variants compatible as input for Seurat. Low-frequency variants (<0.1% for editing and <0.3% for primary human samples) were removed, and remaining variants were input into the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor for functional annotation67. This functional annotation was added as metadata. Genotypes of the GATK HaplotypeCaller were added as an assay to the previous Seurat object, while the remaining output was added as metadata. Wild-type alleles were included based on the read depth for a given amplicon per cell. Both wild-type alleles and variant alleles were excluded from subsequent analysis if the read depth was low (<10 reads) or the genotype quality score of the GATK HaplotypeCaller was low (<30 GQ).

For comparison of variance in the proof-of-concept experiment, published 10x Genomics and ParseBio data (https://www.parsebiosciences.com/customer-datasets/multi-omics-approach-for-near-full-length-human-ipsc-transcriptomes-in-cardiomyocyte-models/#download) were used33.

For constitutive CRISPRi and PEmax and PEmax-MLHdn1 cell lines, the corresponding transgene was inserted into the AAVS1 locus in WTC-11 iPS cells as previously described using specific TALENs5,68. The AAVS1 targeting vector containing the homology arms, the CAGG promotor and a WPRE was a kind gift from J. A. Knoblich (Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Science, Vienna BioCenter). For the CRISPRi plasmid, pHR-UCOE-SFFV-dCas9-mCherry-ZIM3-KRAB (Addgene, 154473) was modified to pHR-UCOE-SFFV-dCas9-mCherry-KRAB-MECP2 with DNA fragments ordered from Twist Bioscience containing KRAB–MECP2. dCas9, KRAB–MECP2 and dTomato were amplified and cloned into the AAVS1 targeting vector described above with NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs, M5520). For the PEmax and PEmax-MLHdn1 plasmids, the CRISPRi plasmid was used as a backbone while inserting the PEmax or PEmax-P2A-MLHdn1 (Addgene, 174828) sequence with NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix. To generate transgenic iPS cells expressing the CRISPRi, PEmax or PEmax-MLHdn1 transgene from the AAVS1 locus, WTC-11 iPS cells were electroporated with the corresponding homology plasmid (3 µg per electroporation) and two TALEN plasmids (0.75 µg per electroporation each) targeting the AAVS1 locus (Addgene, 52341 and 52342). iPS cells were dissociated into a single-cell suspension and counted, and 1 × 106 cells were electroporated using the CB-150 program of the 4D-Nucleofector System and the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L (Lonza, V4XP-3024), according to the manufacturer's protocol and plated in E8 + RI. Cells were sorted 7–10 days after electroporation for dTomato using a BD Fortessa instrument running Diva (V9.0.1) sofware, plated at low density in E8 + RI, grown to colonies, picked and genotyped (Supplementary Table 5). Positively genotyped clones were checked for homogenous dTomato signal and validated for activity in a corresponding assay, and three clones of each cell line were subjected to a genotyping array screening using an Infinium Global Screening Array-24 kit (Illumina, 20030770) to check for chromosomal rearrangements in iPS cell clones. Only clones that showed no or minor differences to the WTC-11 wild-type parental cell line were used in this study.

All gRNA and pegRNA libraries were cloned in pools. eQTLs were selected based on high confidence from published data, and both lowly expressed genes (counts per million (CPM) > 150) and essential genes in iPS cells were removed also based on published data5,36,37,69. eQTLs for the base editor screen were further filtered by overlap with ATAC-seq peaks, expression (transcripts per million > 10) and compatibility with transversion by adenine or cytosine base editors (A > G, C > T, G > A, T > C)38. Sites to introduce STOP codons were chosen manually in the selected genes. pegRNAs were designed using PrimeDesign (https://drugthatgene.pinellolab.partners.org), and linkers to separate the pegRNA from the tevopreQ1 3′ stabilizing sequence were designed using pegLIT (https://peglit.liugroup.us)70,71. For the CRISPRi experiment, the spacer sequences of the above pegRNAs were used for eQTLs and STOP controls, whereas gRNAs targeting the TSS for genes predicted to be affected by eQTLs were designed using CRISPick (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public), and NTCs were chosen from the GeCKO-v2 library72,73,74. BE gRNAs were designed and selected based on highest predicted editing efficiency using the BE-Hive tool75. The pegRNA screening vector was a kind gift from J. A. Knoblich. This vector was modified to remove the ERT2-Cre-ERT2 sequence and the gRNA scaffold and include a 3′ stabilizing tevopreQ1 after the insertion site for pegRNAs via BbsI Golden Gate cloning. The BE vectors were all-in-one cytosine or adenine base editor + guide expression constructs (Addgene, 158581 and 179097). The gRNA screening vector was a modified CROP-seq vector (Addgene, 86708) to also express eGFP and include a distinct gRNA CS in the scaffold of the gRNA76. Oligonucleotide pools for pegRNA and gRNA libraries were checked for the presence of BbsI and Esp3I sites within the spacer/RT/PBS sites and ordered from IDT as oPools. pegRNA oligonucleotides included a spacer sequence, PBS and RT with overhangs for amplification that included BbsI sequences compatible with Golden Gate cloning. Spacer and PBS/RT sequences were separated by a constant sequence containing two Esp3I sites for a second round of Golden Gate cloning to introduce the pegRNA scaffold. gRNA oligonucleotides consisted of spacer sequences and overhangs for amplification that included BbsI sequences compatible with Golden Gate cloning. Oligonucleotides were amplified (eight cycles) with compatible primers. The purified PCR product was cloned into the respective pegRNA or gRNA screening vector described above using BbsI and Golden Gate cloning. Electrocompetent bacteria (Lucigen, 60242-1) were electroporated (10 µF, 600 Ω, 1,800 V, E = 184 V cm−1) with purified ligation product and grown in a pool for 10 h at 30 °C before extracting plasmid DNA. For pegRNA and base editor guide libraries, a scaffold sequence was ordered with overhangs that included Esp3I overhangs (IDT), amplified with complementary primers (eight cycles), purified and cloned as described above using Esp3I Golden Gate cloning. Sequence overviews for cloning of the respective gRNA/pegRNA libraries can be found in Supplementary Table 5.

Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T (ATCC, CRL-3216) cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco, 35050061), 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122) and 1× MEM nonessential amino acids (Gibco, 11140050) and coated using VSV-G. The day before transfection, HEK293T cells were plated at 80% confluency, plasmids were lipofected using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection reagent (L3000001), and the cells were split 1:10 5 h after lipofection. The supernatant was collected 3 days after lipofection, cell debris was pelleted at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C, the remaining supernatant was spun at 28,000g for 5 h, and the virus pellet was resuspended in the appropriate volume of E8 + RI. On the day of infection, human iPS cells were split 1:2.5 2 h before infection using Accutase. Infections were performed overnight in E8 + RI. Medium was replaced the next day with E8. For some editing experiments, constructs were only expressed transiently in human iPS cells. For this, transfection was performed using Lipofectamine Stem Transfection Reagent (STEM00003) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Public variant information data for the WTC-11 cell line was downloaded from University of California, Santa Cruz (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/downloads.allencell.org/genome-sequence/AH77TTBBXX_DS-229105_GCCAAT_recalibrated.vcf.gz). Variants were filtered using bcftools for heterozygous variants and quality (GT = ‘het', filter = ‘PASS', format/DP > 70, format DP < 150, QUAL > 1,000, INFO/MQ > 59.8) and subset to contain single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions/deletions or multinucleotide polymorphisms. Candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) for five human iPS cell lines (H1, H7, H9, iPS DF 6.9 and iPS DF 19.11) were obtained from SCREEN (https://screen.encodeproject.org), and corresponding regulatory elements were subset from these34. Genomic regions were defined as OEGs or NOEGs if the gene overlapping that genomic region was expressed in bulk RNA-seq data (>10 CPM)5. These OEG or NOEG regions were then overlapped with the filtered WTC .vcf file to select for regions containing high-quality variant information. One hundred and twenty regions were randomly subsampled for each cCRE within the OEG and NOEG classes, and primers were designed as described above. Each cCRE with OEG and NOEG was equally represented in both the total and shared panels. Genes were subset into highly (>400 CPM), medium (<400, >40) and lowly (<40, >4) expressed gene groups. Primers were designed as described above. After determining high-quality cells in all panels, as described above, they were subset from the bam file, and reads per cell for gDNA and RNA were scaled according to panel size in a way so that the average number of reads per cell for shared gDNA and RNA targets was the same. Variants were called as described above.

B cell maturation states were mapped to each tumor sample from a published reactive lymph node single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset through shared gene expression features using previously described methods44,46. Gene expression was used to determine immunoglobulin light chain restriction. Log-normalized counts (without batch effect correction to prevent bias introduced by sample integration) were used to find transfer anchors and project samples on the reference PCA (50 dimensions) and UMAP (2 dimensions) reductions. The expression of genes encoding immunoglobulin-κ (IGKC) and immunoglobulin-λ (IGLC1–IGLC7) light chain was used to determine cell malignancy through light chain restriction47.

Separate NGS sequencing libraries for gDNA and RNA were analyzed with SDRranger, and variants were called as described above. Low-frequency variants (<5% or less than 30 heterozygous/homozygous variants) were excluded from the analysis. GO term analysis was performed using the R package topGO (v2.54.0), the weigth01 algorithm and a Fisher's exact test. Enrichment for biological processes was computed for the top 21 differentially expressed genes in the LZ versus DZ across all samples versus all genes measured.

No data were excluded from analysis, and cutoffs for defining high-quality cells in SDR-seq were set as described above. Differential gene expression testing in the single-cell data was performed using MAST and by subsetting cells in the respective genotype within a given cell or perturbation state77. Differential abundance testing of variants between maturation states in primary B cell lymphoma samples was performed using χ2 testing, followed by adjusting P values with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. All box plots shown in this study show the center line as the median, box limits indicate 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers indicate 1.5× the interquartile range; all outliers are displayed.

Zoe Schiffer: Hey, this is Zoe. Before we start, I want to share some exciting news with you. We're doing a live show in San Francisco on September 9th, in partnership with KQED. Uncanny Valley cohosts Lauren Goode and Michael Calore will sit down with our editor in chief, Katie Drummond and a special guest for a conversation that you won't want to miss. You can use the link in the show notes to grab your ticket and invite a friend. We can't wait to see you there. Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoe Schiffer, director of business and industry. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week, including our exclusive scoop on how at least three AI researchers recently recruited by Meta's Superintelligence Labs have already decided to jump ship. I'm joined today by our senior politics editor, Leah Feiger. Leah, welcome.

Leah Feiger: Hey Zoe, thanks for having me.

Zoe Schiffer: So Leah, our first story this week is about how AI is already starting to replace certain jobs. And let me tell you, when I read this study, I instantly thought of you. This is a study from Stanford University that our colleague Will Knight reported on, and the study found the strongest evidence yet that AI is starting to eliminate a slice of entry-level jobs, particularly in customer service and software development. In those industries, they found a 16% decline in employment for workers aged 22 to 25.

Leah Feiger: I think the thing that really got me about this study and from Will's excellent write-up is that the main thing that you do in these entry-level jobs is figure out how to be a real human and how to live in an adult world and how to respond to emails and show up places on time. I think we have to actually be a little bit more forward-thinking. We have to think about what does that then mean for people who would have become managers, would have become leaders in these different industries where these entry-level jobs are getting cut. We're losing a big pipeline, and that's what freaks me out the most. Do I care that menial tasks are being done by AI? Not hugely, but there's these intangibles of becoming a human straight out of undergrad that we're just going to miss now.

Zoe Schiffer: I completely agree with you. These jobs are really about training you how to be a professional, and when you don't get that training, these companies still want more experienced workers and they want those people to be collaborating with artificial intelligence, but it's like how do you get people to that point if the entry-level jobs are being eliminated?

Leah Feiger: How do you get experience? How do you get experience?

Zoe Schiffer: Staying with AI a little bit longer. Elon Musk's company, xAI filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI earlier this week, and he's accusing them of behaving like monopolies and claiming Apple deprioritized ChatGPT rivals like Grok in the App Store. The lawsuit takes particular issue with Apple's integration of ChatGPT into the iOS operating system last year.

Leah Feiger: I know this isn't the first time that Musk has sued OpenAI either. The thing that really gets me is these two men hate each other.

Zoe Schiffer: This feud goes way back. Elon Musk was one of the founders of OpenAI, and early on, they actually had this leadership fight where both Sam Altman and Elon thought that they should lead the company, which at the time was a nonprofit. Obviously, Sam Altman won that fight. And then in the aftermath, Elon Musk eventually sued OpenAI saying, hey, you've abandoned your founding mission, because at a certain point they started a for-profit subsidiary.

Leah Feiger: Is that actually serious? Is having a second spot, does that actually detract consumers?

Zoe Schiffer: It is a big deal. If you look for a productivity app and you see ChatGPT first and Grok second, you are more likely to download ChatGPT, but I think the argument that you'll definitely hear from OpenAI, but even reasonable third-party observers, will say that's not evidence necessarily of Apple colluding with OpenAI. It might just be a more popular app.

Moving on to our next story. WIRED contributor, Taylor Lorenz reported about a mysterious group that seems to be funding Democratic influencers. These people are just like regular influencers except they post about liberal politics. Taylor learned that back in June, a group of them received an offer to get as much as $8,000 per month to take part in a program aimed to bolster Democratic messaging via their accounts. The offer came from Chorus, the nonprofit arm of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and the offer came with a lot of strings attached. The influencers were not allowed to tell anyone about their involvement in the program. They had really strict restrictions on what type of content they could post. What did you think when you heard this?

Leah Feiger: I thought two things. One, we got to publish this story. Two, our readers are going to kill us. Republicans have done something similar to this for a very long time. Paying influencers and doing your very best to not disclose any part of it is not new to the political process. A lot of folks in 2024 were like, Democrats need to be going harder. They need to be doing so much better with their social media, with their influencers, with whomever. And at WIRED, we went really hard on that too. And watching the Harris campaign, and before that, the Biden campaign put out very canned content. They were playing by the old rules, and that's just not how the internet works anymore. And so while the Republicans are paying their influencers, it's happening in different ways and it's happening under a much larger tent. The thing that's been incredible about watching the Republican social media strategy is that you have influencers who pick fights with Trump. You have influencers who pick fights with different campaigns, with JD Vance, with whomever, but they're still underneath this tent and they're still able to coalesce, whereas the Democrats have kept their tent so much tighter. So I'm not going to weigh in one way or the other what necessarily I believe the Democrats should be doing, but this has not won them campaigns in the past, this level of control, and I'm eager to see if anyone thinks it will going forward. And to be very clear, the DNC is not implicated here. This is a specific group. This is not Democrats as a whole. They are Democrats, but they are not the Democrats.

Zoe Schiffer: One more story before we go to break, and this one, stay with me, it's morbid as hell. It's by WIRED contributor Jess Thomson, who recently reported on what are known as Body Farms. These sites are basically what they sound like. They are forensic scientists to study how the human body decomposes. Obviously, all the bodies are donated. And by observing how fast cadavers break down in a controlled setting, investigators can learn about the decomposition and better pinpoint exactly what happened to dead bodies that are found out in the real world. They give classes to law enforcement and fire investigator partners based on their findings. They're only a handful of body farms in existence, and most are in the US. And the people running these facilities, interestingly, are mostly women.

Leah Feiger: Yes. So many thoughts. I have so many thoughts.

Zoe Schiffer: I know. The article, it's like a horror movie. It's an outdoor space where bodies are just laid out and you're watching them decompose. It's so scary.

Leah Feiger: Don't forget the netting that's around them to keep scavengers away. But also to be said, there's something kind of beautiful in a part of the article. These bodies are donated. It's literally to help law enforcement in the future figure out body decomposition when it comes to violent crimes.

Zoe Schiffer: And they do say right at the beginning the thing in cop shows where they're like, the body's been here for three days, and they were like, well, that's not real.

Leah Feiger: I loved that. Anything that tells me that Law & Order SVU is not in fact accurate is good by me.

Zoe Schiffer: We need that.

Leah Feiger: We definitely need that.

Zoe Schiffer: Coming up after the break, we dive into how some recently recruited AI researchers at Meta's Super Intelligence Labs are already packing their bags and leaving. Stay with us.

Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoe Schiffer. Here with me is our Senior Politics Editor, Leah Feiger. So our main story this week, our colleague Will Knight and I recently learned that at least three people who were recruited to Meta's Super Intelligence Labs have already resigned just two months after CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the initiative. But this is the kicker. Two of the staffers have recently returned to OpenAI where they previously worked and they had less than one month stints at Meta.

Leah Feiger: That's wild.

Zoe Schiffer: Meta obviously felt some type of way about the reporting.

Leah Feiger: Did you get yelled at?

Zoe Schiffer: I got yelled at. But I think their POV was, these people didn't last any length of time. What is this telling us? But in my mind, Mark Zuckerberg just went on this massive multi-billion dollar recruiting spree. He's giving people pay packages more often associated with professional sports stars. And the fact that some people are already leaving very, very shortly after starting that is just such a bad sign, I think. It's not to say that this lab couldn't be successful or they couldn't turn things around, but it just seems like there's a lot of chaos right from the beginning.

Leah Feiger: Well, you're being offered $100 million in a bonus. You get there. You don't even have time to bring in your favorite mug. I know there's incredible food at Meta. You can't even find your favorite cafeteria yet. A month is not enough time. What got them back to OpenAI, do you think?

Zoe Schiffer: So this is something that I'm still trying to figure out, because it didn't seem like from my reporting so far that Sam Altman just dangled an even bigger pay package. And Meta has deeper pockets. They can offer more money, which isn't to say that OpenAI isn't trying to compete on that front, but the whispers that I was hearing were more about mission alignment and leadership. You'll hear people say, well, Alexander Wang, who is the CEO of Scale AI, this very young founder, he's not technical, is what people will allege. He's not a hardcore researcher, and he's now leading Meta Superintelligence Labs. He was tapped earlier this summer to take on this really big role at Meta. Sam Altman's not a super technical researcher either, but he really has almost what I would say is a cult of personality around him at OpenAI. And Mira Murati had this too. Mira was the CTO, but she wasn't like Ilya. She wasn't a hardcore researcher in that way, but she was able to talk to researchers. They really felt understood by her. They trusted her. And so I think she too is able to get a lot of loyalty from the people she works with, even if she's, from what I hear, not paying the astronomical sums that Meta might be.

Leah Feiger: But those sums clearly aren't even enough. I was really trying to think about it. If someone offered me $100 million and I couldn't make it through the first month, what would've had to have happened?

Zoe Schiffer: Yeah. I'm struggling because I love money.

Leah Feiger: I'm really not sure. You've done such a good job of this as you've covered the AI talent wars throughout the summer of these cults of personality, but also you covered some messaging that Altman was sending the entire team earlier. It was so mission driven. And on the Meta side, it's really kind of felt like a cash grab.

Zoe Schiffer: Yeah, that's such a good point. I think when you compare it to OpenAI and Anthropic, whether you believe what Sam or Dario are selling in terms of like, oh, AI is going to completely change the world, it's going to have these biomedical breakthroughs, it's going to create personalized medicine, it's going to do X, Y, Z, that is a very compelling mission if you buy into it even 20 or 30%. Versus on the Meta side, we talk to people who went through the recruitment process with Mark Zuckerberg and were like, yeah, it's basically like AI slop for Instagram and Facebook. That's in completely their interpretation. I'm 100% sure if you talked to them, or an executive, they would have a very alternate view, but it's personalized AI content for people, which is entertainment sure, but it's not the groundbreaking world changing initiative that these other companies are at least claiming.

Leah Feiger: Yeah, it's the shiny bubble.

Zoe Schiffer: Exactly.

Leah Feiger: We have to get in on it because the bubble.

Zoe Schiffer: It's the bubble. And honestly, it's worth saying it'll probably make Meta a lot of money, that will probably be successful from a business perspective.

How time flies. I first reviewed the original Urban Arrow in 2020, when my kids were 3 and 5. Back then, nothing delighted a couple of preschoolers more than strapping into a big, motorized cargo bike and scooting around town, shrieking, with the wind blowing in their tiny faces. Alas, they are now 8 and 10. When I picked up my 8-year-old two days ago, he crouched down in the box while sitting on the padded seats (with seat belts!) so that none of his friends would see him.

All this to say: My Tern GSD and I are great friends, but I wish my kids were five years younger so I could've bought the FamilyNext Pro instead. Urban Arrow's new electric cargo bike has a lot of great upgrades, is easier to ride than ever, and is even more useful as my kids have gotten older.

To the naked eye, the two biggest upgrades to the FamilyNext Pro are a newly redesigned cargo box and suspension on the front fork. (It also comes in a very classy, new sage green, but unfortunately, my demo bike was in black.)

The box looks totally different—my friend asked if my bike had gotten longer somehow. It's longer and slimmer, with rounded corners instead of square ones, and there are now headlights on the bike. It has shorter sides, so it's easier to get in and out. Unlike other bakfiets, or box bikes, that I've tried, the box sits much lower to the ground. I can confirm that in my testing, both adults and kids had an easy time climbing in and out.

The box is made from expanded polypropylene (EPP) foam, which is initially disconcerting—it shows dings and bumps very easily. However, Urban Arrow describes it as “an upside-down helmet,” and the foam cushioning did reassure me that even if I let the bike tip over, my kids or friends wouldn't just immediately hit the pavement. You can also replace the foam easily in the event of a crash or some other unsightly event.

The front cargo box now has a front fork with 60 millimeters of travel. I truly love this. It really is a safety issue when you're going fast with 60 to 150 pounds in the front box. I was cruising along at 20 mph and hit a pothole, and I just boinged right out of it.

This cargo ebike uses a by-now-typical Gen 4 Bosch Cargo Line smart system, with a 250-watt motor, a 545-Wh battery, and four assist modes—five if you include walk assist, which you can toggle on by pressing the down button as you're pushing the bike. (I can definitely feel the assist, although it's a little less helpful than you might expect.) I got about 20 miles of moderate riding with and without cargo on one charge, but that's fine, as there is room in the frame for a double battery. I would definitely recommend getting a double battery if you want to put serious miles and cargo on this bike, and are not just going a mile back and forth from school with giant cardboard dioramas in it.

My test unit also has the Enviolo CVT hub, which is a pretty common shifting system on ebikes where balls rotate in a hub for stepless shifting. As someone who regularly carts heavy, fragile things around, I think it's indispensable, especially if you are often starting and stopping around cars. You just downshift at a standstill and up the assistance to get some momentum going; it supersedes the need for a throttle if you're smart about it.

I find 250 watts to be adequate for my needs of transporting stuff and kids on mostly flat ground, and I did test it by carrying 160 pounds of human and biking it up some steep 10 to 15 percent grade hills in my neighborhood. However, it does seem worth noting that Oregon is one of several states that allows 1,000-watt motors, and many here prefer a less natural-feeling (i.e., a more powerful) ride.

As befits a high-end bike, the Urban Arrow FamilyNext Pro is a pure delight to ride. I was a little scared to ride with a 160-pound adult in the box. (It's a matter of physics; I am always a little nervous when my cargo outweighs me.) But the Bosch motor took off with enough power to make it easy. The box has enough room for both a medium-sized adult and a few backpacks.

The upright seating geometry is comfortable when I'm waiting at a stoplight with four kids around me. The ergonomic handles are a positive pleasure to hold. It's pretty easy to lock it up on a bike rack if you lock it on the frame by the rear tire, and it also has an included Abus wheel lock for a little extra peace of mind if you're just waiting in front of the school for pickup.

Considering that many commuter direct-to-consumer bikes weigh 50 to 60 pounds without a cargo box, I found it pretty astonishing that this enormous bike itself only weighs 112 pounds. It was relatively easy to move (as long as you don't forget when you actually have cargo in it) and easy to store, now that my garage door works again.

I happen to live in an area with parents who are addicted to cargo biking. Every morning, dozens of people set off with kids sitting on rear racks or come home with bikes strapped in Tow Haulers. Every morning, an extremely fit dad passes by my house at around 25 mph with his kid under a rain cover in an older Urban Arrow, and r/CargoBike has a ton of different tips and tricks to turn your cargo bike into your own personalized hauling machine.

If you're a more experienced parent and cyclist who has a good place to store it and lock it up, I can't recommend the Urban Arrow FamilyNext Pro enough. Just an hour ago, as I was biking with my kid downtown for his haircut, an (ahem) blue-collar gentleman shouted at me, “Hey, you hauling gravel in that thing?” I could if I wanted to, sir! It's $9,000, and I can already tell you it's worth every penny.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","China Is About to Show Off Its New High-Tech Weapons to the World","https://www.wired.com/story/china-victory-day-parade-weapons/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

China is preparing for one of the most anticipated and politically charged military events in recent years. On September 3, in Tiananmen Square, China will celebrate the 80th anniversary of the victory over Japan in World War II with a spectacular military parade that is not only a ritual of historical remembrance but also a message to the entire world to be prepared for the war of the future.

President Xi Jinping and several foreign leaders and officials, including Vladimir Putin, will attend the ceremony. The Russian president's presence is reported to have prompted several European ambassadors to consider defecting from the event, fearing it would contribute to the Kremlin's international legitimization amid the ongoing war against Ukraine.

The parade will last about 70 minutes and will see dozens of formations parading down Chang'an Avenue in the heart of Beijing. Xi, as supreme commander of the armed forces, will review the troops before the march through the square. More than 10,000 military personnel, more than 100 aircraft, and hundreds of ground vehicles will be involved.

The official theme is the celebration of peace and international justice, but the real content will be the demonstration of the People's Liberation Army's ability to fight high-tech wars in new strategic domains: cyberspace, outer space, electronic and hypersonic warfare. According to leaked information from Chinese dress rehearsals and official sources, more than 100 models of weapon systems, all domestically produced and already in operational service, will be on display.

Among the most anticipated weapons are the new YJ (Ying Ji, ""Eagle Shot"") series anti-ship missiles, designated YJ-15, YJ-17, YJ-19, and YJ-20. These are systems designed for a specific mission: to neutralize large US naval units, particularly aircraft carriers, the heart of American supremacy in the Pacific. These carriers are part of China's A2/AD (Anti-Access/Area Denial) strategy, i.e., the creation of ""defensive bubbles"" that can prevent or make it too risky for enemy fleets to access the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and the Western Pacific.

China has developed a wide range of anti-ship missiles in recent decades, often starting with Soviet technologies, and then surpassing them with indigenous designs since the YJ-8 in the 1980s, derived from French Exocets. With the new series, China is aiming for a further qualitative leap, combining stealth, hypersonic speed, and artificial intelligence.

The exact specifications are top secret, but from general tests and expert analysis, some distinguishing features come into focus. First: speed of at least Mach 4-6, thus in the range of hypersonic missiles, with terminal maneuvering capability to evade anti-missile systems. Second: range of hundreds of kilometers. Third: combined flight profile, with the cruise phase at medium-high altitude, followed by grazing descent to the sea to reduce the possibility of interception. Fourth: multiple guidance with Beidou satellite, active radar, and IR sensors. Fifth: launch versatility, adaptable to aircraft, ships, submarines, and mobile land platforms, increasing possible saturation against enemy fleets. Put together, these weapons signal to the United States that aircraft carriers are no longer untouchable, and the Pacific is no longer an ""American sea.""

Also expected at the parade are new launchers capable of overcoming US missile defenses and providing Beijing with credible strategic deterrence. Rehearsal images show road-mobile ballistic missile systems, an ideal weapon to ensure so-called second strikes in the event of a nuclear conflict. China is developing and deploying a new generation of advanced mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), designed to ensure the survival of the nuclear deterrence force in the event of a preemptive strike.

Among the main models is the DF-31AG, with an estimated range of more than 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles), capable of hitting any target in the continental United States. Next up is the DF-41. Considered the most powerful intercontinental missile in China, it has a range of over 12,000 to 15,000 kilometers (7,456 to 9,320 miles) and can carry up to 10 MIRV warheads, each capable of hitting a different target. It is mobile and can be launched from both silos and rail platforms. Beijing is also banking heavily on the JL-3, an ICBM that can be launched from nuclear submarines, currently being deployed on the new Type 096 class of submarines.

According to several analysts, the September 3 parade will also feature the FH-97: China's first unmanned aircraft declared combat-ready. Nicknamed “loyal wingman,” it is capable of operating in synergy with manned fighters, carrying out reconnaissance, attack, and electronic jamming missions. If confirmed, China would become the first country in the world to have a this type of stealth drone declared ""combat ready,"" ahead of even the United States and Australia, which are still experimenting with similar models such as Australia's Boeing MQ-28 Ghost Bat or the US Skyborg project.

Many details remain confidential, but from what has emerged, the FH-97 can carry guided bombs and air-to-air or air-to-surface missiles, and packs sensors for reconnaissance and electronic warfare. In addition, it can network with fighters such as the J-20 or J-16, acting as a force multiplier for offensive and defensive missions. Finally, it should have artificial intelligence systems to maneuver independently, follow preprogrammed routes, avoid threats, and cooperate with manned aircraft. Showing this aircraft in public means signaling to Washington, Tokyo, and Taipei that Beijing is capable of supporting next-generation air operations that are difficult to counter with current defense doctrines.

Alongside hypersonic missiles and ICBM, China's developing weapons include a less conspicuous but potentially revolutionary arsenal: electronic warfare systems and directed-energy weapons. If missiles are the weapon of visible deterrence, electronic and directed energy weapons are silent tools that can blind enemy radar and communication systems, neutralize drones and missiles in flight, and protect Chinese forces from cyber- and space attacks.

China has invested heavily in the field, seeing it as decisive in winning ""informatized"" and ""intelligentized"" conflicts. China's mobile land and naval systems can jam the frequencies used by airborne radars, cruise missiles, and satellites, while some People's Army brigades combine cyberattacks and electronic jamming, simultaneously targeting enemy hardware and software. Direct-energy weapons, on the other hand, use concentrated beams of energy (lasers, microwaves, high-power electromagnetic waves) to strike targets without traditional projectiles.

Also on display will be the latest models of reconnaissance drones and combat drones, including unmanned underwater ones, expanding Chinese surveillance capabilities in disputed waters. The debut at the September 3 parade of these systems has strong symbolic value: Beijing wants to show that it has not only caught up with the West, but in some areas, aims to surpass it.

Latam-GPT is new large language model being developed in and for Latin America. The project, led by the nonprofit Chilean National Center for Artificial Intelligence (CENIA), aims to help the region achieve technological independence by developing an open source AI model trained on Latin American languages and contexts.

“This work cannot be undertaken by just one group or one country in Latin America: It is a challenge that requires everyone's participation,” says Álvaro Soto, director of CENIA, in an interview with WIRED en Español. “Latam-GPT is a project that seeks to create an open, free, and, above all, collaborative AI model. We've been working for two years with a very bottom-up process, bringing together citizens from different countries who want to collaborate. Recently, it has also seen some more top-down initiatives, with governments taking an interest and beginning to participate in the project.”

The project stands out for its collaborative spirit. “We're not looking to compete with OpenAI, DeepSeek, or Google. We want a model specific to Latin America and the Caribbean, aware of the cultural requirements and challenges that this entails, such as understanding different dialects, the region's history, and unique cultural aspects,” explains Soto.

Thanks to 33 strategic partnerships with institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean, the project has gathered a corpus of data exceeding eight terabytes of text, the equivalent of millions of books. This information base has enabled the development of a language model with 50 billion parameters, a scale that makes it comparable to GPT-3.5 and gives it a medium to high capacity to perform complex tasks such as reasoning, translation, and associations.

Latam-GPT is being trained on a regional database that compiles information from 20 Latin American countries and Spain, with an impressive total of 2,645,500 documents. The distribution of data shows a significant concentration in the largest countries in the region, with Brazil the leader with 685,000 documents, followed by Mexico with 385,000, Spain with 325,000, Colombia with 220,000, and Argentina with 210,000 documents. The numbers reflect the size of these markets, their digital development, and the availability of structured content.

“Initially, we'll launch a language model. We expect its performance in general tasks to be close to that of large commercial models, but with superior performance in topics specific to Latin America. The idea is that, if we ask it about topics relevant to our region, its knowledge will be much deeper,” Soto explains.

The first model is the starting point for developing a family of more advanced technologies in the future, including ones with image and video, and for scaling up to larger models. “As this is an open project, we want other institutions to be able to use it. A group in Colombia could adapt it for the school education system or one in Brazil could adapt it for the health sector. The idea is to open the door for different organizations to generate specific models for particular areas like agriculture, culture, and others,” explains the CENIA director.

The supercomputing infrastructure at the University of Tarapacá (UTA) in Arica, Chile, is a fundamental pillar for Latam-GPT. With a projected investment of $10 million, the new center has a cluster of 12 nodes, each equipped with eight state-of-the-art NVIDIA H200 GPUs. This capacity, unprecedented in Chile and the region more broadly, not only enables large-scale model training in the country for the first time, it also encourages decentralization and energy efficiency.

The first version of Latam-GPT will be launched this year. The model will be refined and expanded as new strategic partners join the effort and more robust data sets are integrated into it.

The interview was edited for length and clarity.

WIRED: Tech giants such as Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic have invested billions in their models. What is the technical and strategic argument for the development of a separate model specifically for Latin America?

Álvaro Soto: Regardless of how powerful these other models may be, they are incapable of encompassing everything relevant to our reality. I feel that today they are too focused on the needs of other parts of the world. Imagine if we wanted to use them to modernize the education system in Latin America. If you ask one of these models for an example, it would probably tell you about George Washington.

We should be concerned about our own needs; we cannot wait for others to find the time to ask us what we need. Given that these are new and very disruptive technologies, there is room and a need for us, in our region, to take advantage of their benefits and understand their risks. Having this experience is essential to guiding the use of technology forward along the best path.

This also opens up possibilities for our researchers. Today, Latin American academics have few opportunities to interact in depth with these models. It is as if we wanted to study magnetic resonance imaging but didn't have a resonator. Latam-GPT seeks to be that fundamental tool so that the scientific community can experiment and advance.

The key input is data. What is the status of the Latam-GPT corpus, and how are you addressing the challenge of including not only variants of Spanish and Portuguese, but also indigenous languages?

We have put a lot of emphasis on generating high-quality data. It's not just about volume, but also composition. We analyze regional diversity to ensure that the data does not come disproportionately from just one country, but that there is a balanced representation. If we notice that Nicaragua is underrepresented in the data, for example, we'll actively seek out collaborators there.

We also analyze the diversity of topics—politics, sports, art, and other areas—to have a balanced corpus. And, of course, there is cultural diversity. In this first version, we have focused on having cultural information about our ancestral peoples, such as the Aztecs and the Incas, rather than on the language itself. In the future, the idea is to also incorporate indigenous languages. At CENIA, we are already working on translators for Mapuche and Rapanui, and other groups in the region are doing the same with Guaraní. It is a clear example of something that we have to do ourselves, because no one else will.

Could you tell us more about CENIA and how this initiative was established in Chile?

Between 2017 and 2018, a group of experts, which included me as a member, developed Chile's National Artificial Intelligence Policy. One of the conclusions of the group was that there was a need to create an institution that would oversee the development of a synergistic and healthy AI ecosystem that encompassed science, technology transfer to industry, and social responsibility. CENIA was created to be that institution.

Although it started in Chile, we have a regional vision and we believe that together we are stronger. We have promoted initiatives such as the Latin American Artificial Intelligence Index, a collaborative study that measures the progress of AI in countries across the region.

Your specialty is cognitive robotics. How does a regional language model relate to an autonomous agent's ability to interact in a Latin American context?

In cognitive robotics, the cognitive part is intelligence. My career has focused on developing intelligence for physical machines. Today, language models and foundational models are at the forefront of AI. They are the most powerful tools we have, so my work is dedicated to understanding and contributing to the scientific and applied development of this type of technology.

Models face issues around geopolitics and power that have been covered by media. What are the specific challenges in Latin America when it comes to these models?

We face many challenges, but we also have many strengths, such as our openness and our capacity for collaboration, which we have seen in the Latam-GPT project. That said, one of the key areas we need to focus on is education. These technologies are going to change the skills required of younger generations. Rote learning will be less critical; what will be important is knowing how to use the knowledge of AI. We must prepare our young people for this, while also promoting the social sciences and critical thinking. If I had to choose where to apply these technologies, it would be in education, because it addresses the root cause of many of our problems.

A project like this requires massive computing power. Is it realistic to think that our region can develop the necessary infrastructure? What implications does this have for the technological sovereignty of Latin America?

It's essential. If you want to play football, you need a field and a ball. Here, computing power is the field. We need to develop it, whether in the cloud or in our own data centers. It's a necessary infrastructure for this new technological era, just as telecommunications infrastructure was for the internet.

Looking ahead to 2030, what would be a successful scenario for a model like Latam-GPT? Will we be technology developers and not simply consumers?

Success would mean that Latam-GPT has played an important role in the development of artificial intelligence in this region. That different organizations can take this technology and apply it, for example, to education. That new generations of Latin Americans are better prepared because they had access to tools that spoke to them in their context, with their cultural references, with figures from our history, and not just using examples from other parts of the world. If we manage to give this technology a Latin American stamp and contribute to its development, the project will have been a great success.

Suddenly, everyone is obsessed with magnesium supplements. It's the key ingredient in #sleepygirlmocktails, powders stirred into tart cherry juice and prebiotic soda, a wellness cocktail for anxious millennials. Your coworkers are popping magnesium glycinate before bed instead of melatonin, because it allegedly cures insomnia, constipation, and existential dread. Folks seem especially concerned with optimizing their poop and pillow time. In the past year, Google searches for “which magnesium is best for sleep” and “which magnesium makes you poop” have more than doubled.

Magnesium is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. It's also one of the most abundant minerals in the human body, running more than 300 biochemical reactions, from protein synthesis to nerve function and blood sugar regulation. It supports bone structure and helps shuttle calcium and potassium across cell membranes, a process that allows for muscle contractions and normal heart rhythms.

You can get it from foods like legumes, leafy vegetables, and whole grains, or from fortified foods and dietary supplements. The question is: Do you need to supplement?

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

While an essential mineral for overall health, many people don't get enough magnesium. This is partly because magnesium is predominantly found in high-fiber foods, and a significant portion of Americans do not consume sufficient fiber, according to registered dietitian Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes. Research confirms this: More than 90 percent of women and 97 percent of men fail to meet the recommended daily intake for dietary fiber.

Older adults are particularly at risk, as the body's ability to absorb magnesium decreases with age. Health conditions like Crohn's disease or kidney disease, alcohol use disorder, and the use of diuretics can all lead to magnesium depletion.

Anderson-Haynes notes that a magnesium deficiency (also known as hypomagnesemia) can result in a range of symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, constipation, tremors, heart palpitations, and muscle soreness. Chronic magnesium deficiency can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

There are several forms of magnesium supplements, including:

Supplements are most useful for people with a confirmed deficiency, but early research suggests possible benefits for specific conditions, including migraines, insomnia, and cardiovascular disease.

“It's really overlooked that magnesium can help with menstrual cycle irregularity in terms of making sure that you're not having severe cramping,” says Anderson-Haynes, who adds it may also benefit women in perimenopause and menopause. Clinically, it may be part of the treatment for pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and eclampsia.

The recommended dietary allowance is 320 milligrams per day for women and 420 milligrams per day for men. These are amounts most people can reach with a balanced diet; healthy kidneys regulate magnesium levels, excreting excess when magnesium intake is high and conserving it when it's low.

Daily supplements under 350 milligrams are generally considered safe for healthy adults. “If you take too much magnesium, you'll probably get diarrhea, because it loosens the bowels,” Anderson-Haynes says. Other side effects include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and, at very high levels of magnesium (usually from overusing laxatives or antacids), low blood pressure, muscle cramps, breathing problems, and, in rare cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease are at the highest risk of toxicity.

For most healthy adults, magnesium supplements aren't essential. If you struggle with migraines, insomnia, or other conditions where research suggests health benefits, they may be worth trying—but first talk to a health care professional.

Otherwise, focus on magnesium-rich foods. These include but are not limited to: legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), leafy greens (artichokes, kale, spinach), whole grains (oats, barley, quinoa), nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts), fruit (bananas, avocado, dried apricots), and soy products (tofu, soy milk, edamame).

If you do decide to take any dietary supplements, “look for a seal or certification that says GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or NSF,” says Anderson-Haynes, stressing the importance of third-party tests and verifications, considering the FDA doesn't regulate dietary supplements in the US.

Labor Day weekend is almost over, but there is still a pontoon boat load of deals to score while shopping with a cold beer and a hot dog. The unofficial end of summer brings with it bargains on WIRED-tested gear, including home office essentials and some of our favorite gadgets. For the past few weeks, we've been tracking prices on the gear we recommend to our friends and bringing you the best sale prices.

Check our Best Labor Day Mattress Deals and Labor Day Outdoor Gear Deals stories for additional savings. We've also got some updated roundups for Back to School Deals and Back to School Laptop Deals.

Updated September 1, 2025: We've added 10 new deals from Steelcase, Solo Stove, JBL, Sonos, and more.

It's a small discount, but our favorite Bluetooth speaker very rarely drops below this price. The deal varies slightly by color, but almost all of them are on sale. The JBL Flip 7 is durable, with IP68 dust and water resistance. And it has impressive, clear, punchy sound and a long-lasting battery. You can even pair it with other JBL speakers.

The Sonos Roam 2 is the best smart speaker. It's nice and compact, with IP67 dust and water resistance and a 10-hour battery life. It's easy to pair with your phone and it has excellent sound to boot. You can control it hands-free with Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control.

This beefy power bank is our favorite upgrade pick, and this price comes within $10 of the lowest we've tracked. It's stylish and has nifty features like two built-in USB-C cables and a display that shows remaining battery, temperatures, charging rate, and battery health. The 25,000-mAh capacity and up to 165-watt delivery means it can top off your laptop, phone, or tablet on-the-go.

https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16/RZ09-05285EN3-R3U1

The Razer Blade 16 is the best gaming laptop overall. It's got a sleek, clean aesthetic with thin bezels, a fantastic keyboard, a nice OLED screen, and a slim footprint. And while the 16 doesn't feel obtrusive to travel with, it doesn't skimp on performance. Graphics options range all the way up to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and base storage starts at 1 terabyte—though, in a first for Razer, you can only choose an AMD CPU. Get more nitty-gritty details in our full review.

PopSockets just dropped MagSafe cases for Kindles, letting you easily pop one of PopSocket's popular grips onto the back. It's a great way to customize your Kindle, and the new MagSafe cases make it easy to pop any PopGrip you like on and off the case. While the brand-new cases aren't for sale, buying one gets you 30 percent off any PopGrip you add to your cart, letting you make a matching set like the Curled Up With a Good Book PopCase ($40) and PopGrip ($30), or mix and match to your heart's desire. It only works for one PopGrip, but if you add multiple PopGrips to your cart, it'll apply the discount to the most expensive one. My personal favorite is the Heart of Silver ($40) which you can get a $12 discount on, but most PopGrips are $30 and will get a $9 discount.—Nena Farrell

This is a match of the best deal we've tracked on the best wireless earbuds we've tested. The Nothing Ear (a) have a slick, clear case and a fun bright yellow color option. And they sound even better than they look, with great controls and EQ customizations available in the app. Round it all off with active noise canceling and long battery life, and you've got a recipe for some truly excellent buds. The discount makes them an even smarter purchase.

The TCL QM6K is the best TV for most people, according to our expert reviewers who spend hours and hours testing all the models they can get their hands on. This deal matches the best price we've seen for the 65-inch model, though other sizes are also discounted right now. There's a lot to love about it. It's got a uniform screen, great black levels, natural colors, and decent off-axis viewing. The Google TV operating system is easy to use, and there are bonus features for gamers too. The only thing we overtly dislike is the sound quality, but then again, you should have a soundbar anyway.

I love this power bank so much that I purchased another at full price after misplacing my first one. I bring it with me to every festival. It's compact, but heavy, and it has a display that shows you power output, battery life, the charge level, and more. It's great because of its large 24,000-mAh capacity and up to 140-watt delivery, and because of its 3 ports (two USB-C, one USB-A). But my favorite part is that the battery itself charges lightning-fast. It can be topped off from empty to full in just about an hour—no more waiting overnight for your power bank to be ready. The price is exclusive to Amazon Prime Members.

This deal is a match of the best we've seen for our top streaming stick pick. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus was just upgraded for 2025, and it's great. It's easy to set up, and the remote has voice controls so you can search by speaking. The interface is also very easy to navigate, and the gadget plugs right into the back of your TV's HDMI port. If you're on the hunt for a good 4K streaming stick, and you don't care about the lack of Dolby Vision support, this is a solid deal.

This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite budget mesh Wi-Fi router. It supports Wi-Fi 6, which should still be fine for most people even though Wi-Fi 7 is already a thing. The Deco X20 has solid coverage and performance, especially with the three routers you'll get with this deal (though singles and two-packs are also on sale if you're in a small space). They're easy to set up and they have optional parental controls and antivirus protection. You can also split the two 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands, which will help if you're running any smart home devices that explicitly require one or the other.

The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It's in our Best TVs buying guide as the pick with the most immersive picture. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price.

The iPad Air is our favorite upgrade iPad. If you need an iPad that you can rely on for important tasks like work or school, this is a very safe bet. The M3 chip makes graphics-intensive tasks look great, and the design is nice and modern with Touch ID built into the power button and USB-C charging. This tablet can handle multiple tasks running in the background and it'll get you about 10 hours of battery life per charge. If you want a smaller screen, the 11-inch version is also on sale for $449 ($150 off)—but we prefer the 13-inch. For more recommendations, check out our guide to the Best iPad Accessories.

The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) is the iPad we recommend for most people. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which may be a blessing or a curse depending on whom you ask. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories.

The M4 Apple MacBook Air is the best MacBook for most people. This is the cheapest we've seen it. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further.

These are the best noise-canceling earbuds we've tried. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort.

The Fitbit Charge 6 is the best fitness tracker overall. It has gone on sale for $100 in the past, but $125 is a pretty good deal, since it regularly jumps up to full price. It looks nice and has all the features most folks would want, like step counting, sleep tracking, stats on calories burned and workout effectiveness, heart rate readings, and insights into SpO2 levels. It also has a long-lasting battery and integrations with Google Wallet and Google Maps (though it can be used with iOS devices as well as Android). Some of the better features are locked behind a subscription that costs $10 per month, but the gadget still works without that subscription.

This is a great deal for the best electronic sleepbuds, and you'll also get a free travel case. The earbuds are comfortable to wear while you're sleeping, and they have 10-hour battery life and passive noise cancelation as well as excellent audio quality. There's a solid companion app, too, which lets you choose from different Sleep Sounds and access biometric data (which we have not yet tested).

This is a solid deal on the best laptop docking station. The Satechi Dual Dock Stand slightly elevates your laptop for better ergonomics, and it has a collection of ports, including three monitor outputs, several USB ports, and a solid-state drive enclosure. It connects to your laptop via two USB-C cables. If you don't need a full-on docking station, check our guide to the Best USB Hubs.

Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. It has oodles of adjustable elements, including the arms, armrests, seat depth, recline, lumbar support, and seat tilt. The foam cushion seat is comfortable and the mesh backrest is supportive, too. The affordable price tag is icing on the cake, and while it doesn't go on sale very often, you can save 10 percent until the sale ends with code LABORDAY.

If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. It's very easy to assemble. and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. Even with its quirks, it will be a definite upgrade if you're still working from the ratty chair you picked up off Craigslist when you first built your home office.

Sitting all day is bad for you! This telescoping desk can be raised up as high as 45 inches, with simple setup and two available sizes. It comes in a few different finishes. The leg motors aren't the quietest, but they work well, and the desk looks great in any setup. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide.

The Steelcase Gesture is the best premium office chair. The prices vary slightly depending on the color you choose, but most of them are discounted for Labor Day weekend. The Gesture is comfortable, with a cushy seat and elegant adjustment options. Assembly is easy, and there's a 12-year warranty. Should you be looking for an office chair upgrade, and you want something a bit more luxurious than the Branch models we've mentioned, this is a choice worth considering.

This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. The Freedom Headrest is the best reclining office chair, and it drops from $1,743 to $1,394 with code SEMIANNUAL20. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “This chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. It falls from $1,294 to $1,035 after code.

Ruggable makes our favorite machine-washable rugs. Each rug is a two-piece system, with a rug pad and a cover that attaches via Velcro. You can easily take the cover off and pop it in the washing machine, or switch it out for another Ruggable cover to redecorate without having to buy a new rug entirely. The covers are water- and stain-resistant, too. Nearly everything on the website is 25 percent off right now. Our favorite, the Pamir Ivory Multicolor Rug, is on sale for $277 ($92 off) in the 6x9 style.

There aren't many things I've tested for work that I reach for every day. This is one of them. The ChomChom pet hair remover is beloved among almost all of the pet parents on the WIRED Reviews team. Simply swipe it back and forth across your furniture or carpets and be amazed at how much hair it collects. It works fast, it's easy to empty, and it's endlessly reusable. The price is right, too, coming within $7 of the lowest we've tracked.

The Traeger Woodridge Pro is an excellent smoker. It's user-friendly, offering consistent temperature control with just a few buttons. It's easy to clean when your cookout is over. It can reach temperatures up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and down to 180. We wish the app was a bit more detailed, but it isn't required to produce delicious meals. (Seriously, just look at the photos in this review.)

Mouth tape isn't for everyone, but Dream is the best we've tried. It's soft, flexible, and breathable, and it stays secure throughout the night. It also doesn't drop in price very often. If you want to try it out but want to spend a little less, we also liked the Dream Full mouth tape that's on sale today too.

Ettitude makes the best cooling bamboo sheets. This sheet set feels soft and silky, but stays cool to the touch, making it a great option for hot sleepers. The sheets are breathable and lightweight, and they're available in seven different colors to match your bedroom decor. There's also a 60-day trial period so you can make sure you like them before committing.

The Silk & Snow S&S Organic Mattress is our favorite organic latex mattress. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. You can also get two pillows or a sheet set for free with your purchase. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations.

The Buffy Breeze is one of my favorite comforters. It's been on my bed since I started testing it more than 3 years ago. It's cooling in the summer, and its lightweight warmth is just the right amount of comfy for hot nights. But in the winter, it still works well to keep you warm, especially if you throw another blanket on top of it. It isn't officially marketed as down alternative, but I do like it as an alternative to down.

Need to upgrade your bedding? This sleep set from Buffy is a solid way to do it. You'll get the Buffy Cloud Comforter, Breeze Sheet Set, Breeze Duvet Cover, and two Cloud Pillows at a 30 percent discount. WIRED reviewer and bedding expert Nena Farrell uses the Cloud Comforter for almost all of her testing. She recommends the Breeze sheets in our cooling sheets buying guide, and the Cloud pillow in our pillows buying guide.

This is one of our favorite organic mattresses and it's extremely customizable. Each side can have different levels of firmness—so if you prefer firm, but your bed partner prefers soft, you'll both be set. There's a cover that zips over the whole system, and you get a 100-night trial to swap the latex layers out so you can fine-tune your desired firmness. The mattress is made of organic cotton, latex, and wool, and it has the certifications we look for in organic mattresses.

This is one of the best down comforters I've tried, and you can get it on sale ahead of the colder months ahead. It has that classic, hotel-like, crinkly, starchy shell, with fluffy down insides that stay inside. The baffle box construction and Hutterite down clusters help ensure that you never have to worry about your blanket's insulation shifting around in your sleep. It stays warm all night, and it's soft enough that you don't really need a duvet cover.

This is the bed frame I'm currently using, and I love it very much. Assembly wasn't my favorite, but once I got it all put together, I fell in love. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets.

Brooklyn Bedding is offering 30 percent off sitewide for its Labor Day sale. If you're a retired or active military member, you can get an additional 5 percent off by verifying through ID Me. We like a few different products from Brooklyn Bedding. Its CopperFlex 401 Mattress Topper is the best mattress topper overall, and it's on sale in the queen size for $419 ($180 off). Brooklyn Bedding also makes our favorite firm mattress, the Plank—on sale for $1,072 ($460 off).

This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. For a more affordable option, we also like the Benchmade Modern Laguna (pictured above) on sale for $2,397 ($599 off). “My family and I have been sitting on it for a year and a half now, and the single cushion (as well as the rest of the couch's cushions) is comfortable and supportive,” says reviewer Nena Farrell.

We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our couch buying guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. There are many different fabrics to choose from, and you can choose the stain of the wooden legs too. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing.

This sale runs the gamut from kitchenware and mattress toppers to bedding, towels, and furniture. We haven't tested most of the brands in the sale, but if you're shopping for something like guest bedroom linens or new dining room chairs, you might find what you're looking for.

The Joybird Eliot Sleeper Sofa is comfy and has a slick, MCM silhouette. It's one of the best couches you can buy online. It's custom-made for you, with dozens of options and finishes available (including bright pink velvet, which I chose.) It has deep seats that can be removed to reveal a pull-out mattress (which is also surprisingly comfortable). If you're in the market for a custom couch, this sale is worth a look. The deal ends on September 1.

This is the best budget-friendly travel pillow. The outside is covered in a soft fabric made with recycled water bottles, and the memory foam construction is nice and firm, with high sides so you can easily lean your head toward your shoulder. It also has a chin strap to prevent your head from falling forward. Make sure you choose the option with the carrying case if that's important to you!

I first started using this when I formerly tested meal kits for WIRED, and I still reach for it nearly every time I process produce in my kitchen. It's oversized, measuring 12 by 16 inches, and it doesn't slip around on my countertops. I like the built-in juice groove and the fact that I can still store it in my cupboards even though it's bigger than standard cutting boards. It has zero knife damage, is BPA-free, and is dishwasher-safe.

We love Cozy Earth's soft, super-comfortable products, and you can use coupon code WIRED to get 35 percent off almost everything on the website. The excellent Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set falls to $200 ($108 off)—they're our favorite splurge pick thanks to the soft, buttery bamboo construction, but the splurge is a bit smaller with our coupon code. We also recommend the women's pajama set, which is silky-soft and makes a great gift. The Cozy Earth Long-Sleeve Pajama Set drops from $148 to $96 after the promo code.

Several colors of our favorite carry-on luggage are on sale right now. The Away Carry-On has long been a favorite of several WIRED reviewers. It has a light, durable shell and a built-in TSA-approved combination lock. The four wheels can rotate fully, so you won't get stuck on sidewalks or stray cords. The handle is padded and there are compression straps inside the suitcase. You'll also get a laundry bag and a limited lifetime warranty. Away sales are quite rare.

The Solo Stove Bonfire is the best fire pit. And what better time to pick one up than ahead of autumn, AKA the best time to hold a backyard campfire? It's small enough to tote around if needed, but large enough to comfortably gather around with a handful of friends. The removable ash pan makes cleanup easier, and the air holes along the top help cut down on smoke. We do think the lid is a worthwhile accessory, and you can get it in a bundle with a base plate and a stand for an extra $100. There are many other accessories available that are on sale right now, too—but the lid is the most essential.

Curie's natural deodorant is an honorable mention in our buying guide. It caused me some irritation when I first started using it, but a few of my friends and family members really like the formula. It smells great and applies evenly, though you might experience some clothing stains if you apply it under a black t-shirt. The scent doesn't stick around all day, but it does smell nice when first applied. And that might be a benefit if you want odor protection without a strong scent.

When I tried Hexclad, I liked it just fine. Really! A score of 5 is “recommended with reservations.” It's important to know what you're getting, and what you're getting is easy-to-clean cookware that works fine. I'd prefer to use two separate pans—a nonstick and a stainless steel—but I understand that some people want a one-and-done cooking companion. These frying pans are worth considering on sale, like they are right now. You'll get three pans in 12-, 10-, and 8-inch sizes, plus their matching lids. If you know you want hybrid cookware, check out this sale.

The All-Clad Factory Seconds sale is one of the best, most reliable ways to save on the investment that is All-Clad. You'll need to enter your email address to access the sale. There's a reason why professional chefs reach for their trusty All-Clad constantly—this cookware is simply fantastic. It's the gold standard. And it's backed by a lifetime warranty! These Factory Seconds items aren't in perfect condition. Sometimes there's packaging damage, and sometimes there are minimal scuffs. Each item has details listed on the product page. This sale is absolutely massive and worth checking out if you need a cookware upgrade of any kind. Might I suggest the 10.5-inch All-Clad Fry Pan for $70 ($80 off)? Or perhaps get ahead of the holidays with the All-Clad Nonstick Large Roaster for $130 ($90 off)? The list goes on, but the sale will end in a few days' time.

This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. But it's a great entry-level kitchen composter, and it doesn't drop in price very often.

The Bruvi BV-01 is the best pod coffee machine. It's super-cute and easy to use, with a large touchscreen, fast brewing times, remote scheduling, and used pod collection. The best part, though, is that the proprietary B-Pods are biodegradable. They make perfectly fine coffee, tea, or espresso, and they don't sit in a landfill forever. This price matches the best we've seen. You'll get the coffee maker itself, plus 20 B-Pods in a variety of flavors.

The Ooni Volt is the very best electric pizza oven. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za.

Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. The bacteriostatic showerhead was able to filter total chlorine down to undetectable levels in reviewer Matthew Korfhage's chloramine-treated water. This deal is for the automatically replenishing subscription bundle. Hydroviv says you should replace filters every six months, but you can pause or cancel that subscription if you decide you want to order them separately.

Our favorite feeder pet camera goes on sale relatively often, but this is still a solid deal since it regularly jumps up to full price. It has 1080p streaming video, night vision up to 30 feet, two-way audio, and 8x zoom. What sets this camera apart is its treat- or food-dispensing capabilities. Fill up the container with your pet's chosen treats, and you can use the app to toss them remotely. The best features, like motion and sound alerts and 90 days of video storage, are locked behind a Petcube Care subscription which costs $10 per month.

This is the best pickleball paddle if you play every day (or on a very regular basis). The closed-cell foam core is durable (it even has a lifetime warranty!) and can handle intense temperatures. While it might take some getting used to, resident pickleball expert Martin Cizmar says this is the paddle he reaches for most often. It has a soft, forgiving feel and absorbs vibration, making it particularly useful for defensive plays.

Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go, manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. It also has a few extra features like turn signals, a bell, and self-healing tires. We haven't seen it sell for less.

The Helinox Chair One (re) is an excellent camping chair. It's a refresh of the cult favorite original, and it has a higher sitting position. It's still lightweight, packable, and portable. These chairs are surprisingly comfortable and easy to put together. This is the best price we've seen for it. We recommend a few other Helinox options in our buying guide, which are also on sale right now.

The XPress 750 is our favorite ebike for folks on a budget. The frame is comfortable and the pedaling feels natural, so it feels more like a classic bike and less like a lean, mean electric machine. The range could be better, but you'll have no trouble zooming around your neighborhood at top speeds of 28 mph. And the LCD display and controls are simple and easy to use, so this is an especially great bike for beginners.

Breeo makes the best upgrade firepit. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's 2 feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard.

WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu tested and loved this outdoor couch and armchair set. The couches come with OuterShell, which is a built-in cover that helps protect the couch cushions from the elements (and stray bird poops). The performance fabric is made from recyclable materials, and the covers are machine washable. Julian still has to see how the couch fares in New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a 10-year warranty and available in four different fabric options.

This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite Theragun. It's the same model used by many professional sports teams, and it has heat therapy as well as an optional cold therapy attachment (the latter is a separate purchase). There's a vibration head, LED light therapy, and a guided breathwork option too. If you want to invest in your recovery routine, this is a good way to do it.

The Therabody TheraFace Mask is an LED face mask with vibration. It has red, blue, and near-infrared LEDs, plus vibration motors to help you relax during your three- or nine-minute sessions. We like the cordless, hands-free design, though we wish it had a few more bells and whistles like app controls or a battery indicator. If you've been eyeing it, though, it rarely gets cheaper than it is right now.

The Plunge Original pool being used to refill squirt guns during a water fight, which is not its intended purpose.

WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar liked this full-featured cold plunge tub almost as much as his top pick, and it's significantly cheaper. It has a sleek, modern aesthetic, and the acrylic walls are easy to clean. We regret to inform you that while it is unpleasant to submerge yourself in near-freezing water, it has a number of notable health and wellness benefits that our testers have personally felt. If you want a great-looking cold plunge tub and you don't want to overpay for it, this deal is worth checking out.

A new Seattle nonprofit is aiming to provide a structured pathway for Black startup founders, offering support that includes networking, mentorship and guidance on raising venture capital funding.

SEA619 is designed as a three-stage journey starting with a grassroots business association, then an incubator, and finally an accelerator. Entrepreneurs apply and enter at whichever phase they're ready to join.

SEA619, which combines references to Seattle and the Juneteenth holiday honoring the emancipation of enslaved people, has been accepting pre-applications to gauge interest and connect with potential participants. On Monday, SEA619 started its official application process and programming starts in October.

Arif Gürsel, a tech veteran and champion of innovators of African descent, is leading the group. He was inspired by engaging with founders and creators who had great ideas but lacked the resources or experience to develop them into a product or business. He was also juggling a stream of requests for professional advice, and seeing other mentors with the same challenge.

The effort aligns with Gürsel's long-held values around helping his community. 

“I was raised in Brooklyn where we were always taught, those of us who make it forward always have to go back and get those who didn't,” he said, adding that a guiding principle for the effort is “We lift as we climb.”

Gürsel began his career with more than a decade at Microsoft and held leadership roles with Zillow, Salesforce, Netflix and Google. He founded a brand and design company called Vibeheavy and a creative consultancy named 8genC, and is a startup investor.

Working in tech, “every room that I was always in, I was always the only one that reflected my culture, my upbringing, my heritage,” he said, and Gürsel wants to change that.

Years ago, Gürsel advised companies participating in the now-defunct Seattle Techstars. But many of the Black founders weren't ready for the accelerator, he said, and wound up giving away 6%-10% of the equity in their startup before they'd charted their business path.

SEA619 fills in the missing pieces for the startups with free support during the first year of engagement, then it takes a 1% equity stake and maxes out at a 2% cut. The nonprofit is self-funded and seeking grants.

“I love it,” Kirby Winfield, founder of Seattle venture capital firm Ascend, said of the effort. “A lot of entrepreneurs need a crash course in startup building BEFORE they join programs like Techstars, 500 Startups, [Y Combinator] and the like.”

Winfield added via email that he has met entrepreneurs “from every background” who would benefit from working with Gürsel and the SEA619 team.

“A lot of times, founders need help understanding the best way to finance and grow their business, and what the different paths, like VC, entail and require,” he said. “If a founder chooses the VC path, SEA619 is equipped to help them truly understand and prepare for the positioning, pitch and vision a venture investor expects.”

Winfield said he plans to offer office hours to SEA619 accelerator participants and to keep the organization “in the loop for broader ecosystem participation.”

SEA619 is part of a larger effort launched by Gürsel a decade ago called Pan African Center for Empowerment, or PACE. PACE also includes The Union, an innovation hub and event space located on 2nd Avenue south of the Seattle Art Museum; Tribe called TECH (technology, entrepreneurship, culture and heritage), which hosts mixers in Seattle and beyond; plus initiatives focused on engineering education and arts and media projects.

One piece of Gürsel's strategy is meeting and partnering with venture capitalists in African countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa who are interested in backing U.S. startups. 

Seattle is home to another initiative supporting Black entrepreneurs called Venture Black, which launched last year. The program is led by Evan Poncelet, who is CEO of the Washington State Black Angel Network and previously worked as an engineer at Fluke and Cicso.

SEA619 kicks off at a time when the Trump administration has worked to squelch wide-ranging efforts supporting diversity and equity in education, healthcare and the corporate world. DEI opponents argue that the programs are illegal and a form of reverse discrimination that devalues individual merit. 

Gürsel said that SEA619 is not discriminatory but aims to serve a specific audience. 

“I'm not worried about an administration that's based in hate when the work that we're doing is based in love and lifting people up,” Gürsel said. “So they'll do what they do, we'll do what we do. One thing I'm not going to do is stop serving my community. There's nothing that they can do to make me stop.”

Runway has spent the past seven years building visual-generating tools for the creative industry. Now, it sees a new opportunity for its technology: robotics. 

New York-based Runway is known for its video and photo generation AI world models, or large language models that create a simulated version of the real world. Most recently, the company released Gen-4, its video-generating model, in March and Runway Aleph, its video editing model, in July.

As Runway's world models started to improve — and get more realistic — the company began to receive inbound interest from robotics and self-driving car companies looking to use the tech, Anastasis Germanidis, Runway co-founder and CTO, told TechCrunch in an interview.

“We think that this ability to simulate the world is broadly useful beyond entertainment, even though entertainment is an ever increasing and big area for us,” Germanidis said. “It makes it much more scalable and cost effective to train [robotic] policies that interact with the real world whether that's in robotics or in self driving.”

Germanidis said working with robotics and self-driving car companies was not something Runway initially envisioned when it launched back in 2018. It wasn't until robotics and other companies in other industries reached out, that the company realized their models had much broader use cases than they originally thought, he said.

Robotics companies are using Runway's tech for training simulations, Germanidis said. He added that just training robots and self-driving cars in real-world scenarios is costly for companies, takes a long time, and is hard to scale.

While Runway knows it isn't going to replace real-world training by any means, Germanidis said companies can get a lot of value running simulations on Runway's models because they have the ability to get incredibly specific.

Unlike in real-world training, using these models makes it easier to test for specific variables and situations without changing anything else in the scenario, he added.

“You can take a step back and then simulate the effect of different actions,” he said. “If the car took this turn over this, or perform this action, what will be the outcome of that? Creating those rollouts from the same context, is a really difficult thing to do in the physical world, to basically keep all the other aspects of the environment the same and only test the effect of the specific action you want to take.”

Runway isn't the only company looking to tackle this. For instance, Nvidia released the latest version of its Cosmos world models, in addition to other robot training infrastructure, earlier this month.

The company doesn't anticipate releasing a “completely separate line of models” for its robotics and self-driving car customers, Germanidis said. Instead, Runway will fine-tune its existing models to better serve these industries. The company is also building a dedicated a robotics team.

Germanidis added that while these industries weren't in the company's initial pitches to investors, they are on board with this expansion. Runway has raised more than $500 million from investors like Nvidia, Google and General Atlantic at a $3 billion valuation.

“The way we think of the company, is really built on a principle, rather than being on the market,” Germanidis said. “That principle is this idea of simulation, of being able to build a better and better representation of the world. Once you have those really powerful models, then you can use them for a wide variety of different markets, a variety of different industries. [The] industries we expect are there already, and they're going to change even more as a result of the power of generative models.”

Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.

The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.

It doesn't hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what's known as scientific breakeven, and while it's still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.

Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.

CFS's Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. 

Sparc's reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.

The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output.

CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.

Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. 

The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook.

Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.

Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma's own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor's magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.

The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.

Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.

The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion's funding might be massive, but the startup hasn't gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that's common in biotech.

Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it's starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn't picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it's developing necessary skills for when that time comes.

The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.

In General Fusion's reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.

General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. 

In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat.

Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. 

The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup's ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company's magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.

In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.

Zap Energy isn't using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.

Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.

Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.

Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.

Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma's quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.

Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry's decades of experience.

The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.

First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. 

First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent.

Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that's behind the National Ignition Facility's breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF's setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.

Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Every seat in Copenhagen's Bella Center was full as Anton Osika, the co-founder of the AI coding app Lovable, took the stage at this year's TechBBQ conference.

Lovable specializes in helping people build apps and websites, especially people with no coding experience. It's one of the standouts in the popular AI category known as vibe coding, which lets users guide AI models as they produce code, websites, or whole applications.

It's been an attractive proposition for users: In just eight months, the Swedish company said it surpassed $100 million in ARR and raised a $200 million Series A at a $1.8 billion valuation – making it Europe's fastest-growing unicorn. The Financial Times reported that investors are already hoping to launch a Series B, offering deals that would value the company at $4 billion. So far, there's no indication that Lovable is interested.

Speaking to TechCrunch, Osika laid out a vision for Lovable as the best place to build software products: a platform that can take users — founders specifically — through all the stages of product development so they can build AI-native companies more easily.

“If you're running a business, there are a lot of things you want to set up, like payments, understanding your users, and in the future, maybe even like ‘I need to incorporate my company,'” he said. “I want Lovable to help with all these things.” 

In late June, Lovable released an agent to help users read files, debug errors, search the web, generate images, and locate files – a first step toward making good on that vision.

Lovable says it now has more than 2.3 million active users, 180,000 of which are paying subscribers. Osika said the company chose its pricing simply by deciding what would help the company cover its own costs. His favorite Lovable use cases include a marketer building a sales training platform and an engineer running multiple small businesses on the platform.

“In the past, you could create a really great first draft using Lovable. Now, you can build a full product, and it's much more like working with a real developer,” he said. 

AI-generated code has been criticized as overly brittle – better suited for demos than finished products – but Osika says he's not concerned. All code should be reviewed before it is published, the CEO told us, “whether it is AI or human-generated.” 

Right now, Lovable operates on other foundational models, including Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT-5. There is some tension in that relationship, as Anthropic and OpenAI both operate their own product-development services: Claude Code and Codex, respectively. Those systems aren't exactly the same as Lovable, but it's easy to imagine either model company trying to steal Lovable's users with a strategic product shift.

So far, Osika doesn't seem worried. He told TechCrunch that Lovable is simply focused on building the best product and is able to do that by leveraging all the different types of AI model providers, whereas providers need to stick to their own models. 

“That puts us in a better position than them,” he continued, arguing that tapping into numerous foundation models gives its users “unmatched capabilities,” while also giving the company the flexibility to grow rapidly without carrying the weight of duplicative infrastructure. 

“The scope of what you can achieve is constantly expanding,” he continued. To beat the competition, he says the team focuses on how to remain fast and secure while providing an easy user experience. 

“If we continue to do that, we're going to build more trust with our customers than anyone else,” he said. “Simple as that.” 

It's been only one month since Figma, one of Lovable's peers in the app-design space, launched its blockbuster IPO, reaching a $19.3 billion market cap on its opening day. When asked about Figma, Osika again said his company is focused on making the best product for its users. 

“As long as we are listening to our users and giving them what they need, that's all that matters,” he said.  

Lovable is already deeply tied to the Swedish tech market. Osika grew up in Stockholm and founded the company there. The company's list of investors, according to PitchBook, includes a list of top European firms and angel investors, like Stefan Lindeberg (Swedish, Nordic Game Ventures); Fredrik Hjelm (Swedish, founder of Guestit), Greens Ventures (Nordic), Hummingbird Ventures (London); and 20VC (London, founded by Harry Stebbings, who launched Project Europe to funnel more investments into the ecosystem). 

Revolut CEO Nik Storonsky, who is based in Europe, is also an angel investor in the company, as is Swedish founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski, whose company Klarna is also a client of Lovable. Other well-known clients include HubSpot and Photoroom. 

All around the conference, investors and founders lamented what the company staying in Europe means for the Nordic startup ecosystem. 

“The success of Lovable and other European AI unicorns is a success for all of Europe,” said Shamillah Bankiya, a principal at the UK's Dawn Capital, in an interview with TechCrunch. Though not an investor, her firm has followed Osika as a founder for a while and has invested in other AI companies through Dawn. 

“Beyond the immediate impact of the thousands of Europeans employed by these companies, the greater effect is cultural,” she continued. “It raises the bar for what ambitious founders across the continent can dream of and achieve.” 

Osika said Lovable plans to stay nestled in Europe, though it does have a team in Los Angeles. Many European tech companies eventually find themselves migrating to the States for more capital and access to opportunities – but Osika doesn't see Lovable as one of them, for now.

In the wake of Lovable's success, Osika has started to invest in other founders himself. Dennis Green-Lieber's Danish customer intelligence company, Propane.ai, just received an investment from Osika as part of its $1.2 million pre-seed round. Green-Lieber said that Lovable proves what many in the Nordic scene already feel: They, too, have world-class talent and can play on the global stage. 

“Yes, we've had giants like Zendesk, Unity, Klarna, and Spotify over the past decade, but what Lovable shows is that with small teams, a global mindset, and relentless effort, you can still build a category-defining company,” he continued. “As a founder, I can say it's lit a fire in our ecosystem to see this happen right here at home.”

This article was updated to clarify the round Osika invested in.

I wish they elaborated on how they measure commercial promise. I've seen papers that attempt to link grants to value via a 4 step chain: grants fund projects, projects make papers, papers make patents, patents create jumps in stock for US firms. Of course, this is a reductive way to measure progress, but if you want to use AI you'll need a reductive metric.> And so far, public funders are being cautious. In 2023, the U.S. National Institutes of Health banned the use of AI tools in the grant-review process, partly out of fears that the confidentiality of research proposals would be jeopardized.It sort of annoys me that this is framed as ""fear"" about a single issue. The NIH is increasingly criticized for funding low-risk, low-reward inefficient science. People are suggesting that they instead fund high-variance work, stuff that goes against the grain or lets the researcher chart a new path. Using AI would prevent this, because it tends to be a conventional wisdom machine. Its trained on our body of knowledge; how could it do otherwise?

If the NIH responds by globally lowering the limit to two or three proposals per year, they hurt 1%er mega labs that expect to have several active grants  and now need to bat web above .500 to stay afloat. So I think it's likely that we see elitist criteria as you said, maybe a sliding scale for the proposal limit where labs that currently draw large amounts of funding are allowed to submit more proposals than smaller labs.One place this may end up is with grant proposals requiring a live presentation component. You can use AI to crank out six proposals in a day, but rehearsing and practicing six presentstions will still take quite some time and effort.

Also, for a very high stakes proposal, I doubt people are just going to ask ChatGPT to do it, which would basically guarantee that their proposal is indistinguishable from some equally lazy competitors in their field.

- Arms race between writing and reviewing AIAs if there weren't numerous grant requests for dead end research before LLMs. Not saying this to discredit past research but when AI is used on both sides this changes none of the fundamental issues or incentives.

There's certainly a case to be made about using LLMs to find needles in haystacks, since most grants tend to be awarded to “repeat offenders” rather than newcomers and outsiders* with different methodologies.

I like wireless earbuds because I love music. It's very straightforward; music exists, and I want to listen to it, and wireless earbuds are the thing that gets me to the thing I love. Problem solved. You can't see it, but I'm smugly dusting my hands right now like a mathematician at a chalkboard. There's a symbiosis between the buds and me. A simplicity. A supply and demand so fundamental that in the gadget world, it feels like a law of nature.

But, as much as I love wireless audio, there are some reasons for loving buds that I have never thought of before. For instance, productivity. It has never once occurred to me that wireless earbuds can turn me into some kind of capitalist brain machine, as much as employers would love that. Or using them to “remember everything” and/or “know everything.” I personally like it when they make fun sounds, but I guess becoming some kind of omnipotent techno-deity would be sick, too. I have also never thought to use them as a tool to record every conversation I ever have without telling anyone, either—probably because I ain't a NARC. But this is the age of AI, and maybe I'm just not thinking big enough; maybe I need to expand my mind; maybe it's time to optimize my future, maaaan.

Oso AI Earbuds

These ChatGPT-equipped wireless earbuds are fine for transcription but nothing else.

Pros

Cons

To help open me up to the possibilities of wireless earbuds in the era of AI, I shoved a pair from a brand called Oso in my ears. These $170 AI wireless earbuds were crowdfunded through Kickstarter and promise big things. Marketing highlights include “revolutionizing productivity, one conversation at a time,” and “remember everything, know everything.” And here I was just trying to have a news roundup podcast serenely explain to me how messed up the world is!

To pave the way toward a more productive self, Oso AI Earbuds have zeroed in on using ChatGPT via the cloud to power a few capabilities. Chief among them seems to be transcription. Indeed, with a companion app, you can use your Oso AI Earbuds to listen to your surroundings and then have that conversation, or presentation, or YouTube video transcribed by AI in the cloud. There's nothing groundbreaking about AI transcription, but I guess putting it in wireless earbuds is a newish approach? I used Oso's wireless earbuds to record some stuff while I was at a press briefing, and it worked fairly well, despite the fact that the presenters were not native English speakers and the volume of their mics wasn't ideal. You can also use it to record virtual meetings and calls.

I took a call with the Oso AI Earbuds and used them to transcribe part of it, and while the transcription worked just fine, the experience for the person on the other end was not ideal. According to the person I called, these wireless earbuds pick up a lot of ambient noise—she was able to hear someone moving glasses in Gizmodo's communal kitchen, an elevator beep, and someone having a phone call about 20 feet away from me. On one hand, it's good that these wireless earbuds can pick up so much, since it means they won't miss a word when you're recording, but for the person on the other end, the experience can be ridiculously distracting. It's especially strange considering the wireless earbuds are advertised as having “dual beamforming mics with ENC.” That's not a typo for ANC; ENC stands for “environmental noise cancellation.” I'm not sure which environmental noise the Oso AI Earbuds are cancelling, but they certainly weren't interested in tackling ambient noise in my office.

Another pillar of the Oso AI Earbuds is being able to use them as a voice assistant powered by ChatGPT. Again, this isn't a novel idea; Nothing's wireless earbuds were the first to advertise a ChatGPT integration last year. I tested that feature out, and while I could see its potential usefulness in theory, I wasn't wholly impressed with actually using it for real-life stuff like figuring out where to eat or what the Knicks' score is. I was looking forward to testing out if there was any difference between testing ChatGPT out last year and now, but unfortunately, Oso's AI Earbuds had other plans.

Since iPhones don't play nice with anything that doesn't come freshly baked out of Foxconn with an Apple logo on it, Oso's app offers a Siri shortcut that is supposed to act as a workaround for activating the buds' voice assistant, which has (comically, I may add) been dubbed “Judy.” I added my Judy shortcut to Siri in iOS just like the app asked, but when I tried to activate it by uttering “Siri, Judy,” like the shortcut is designed to do, I was met with a notification that I have not paid for “Laxis Pro,” which is a premium version of the app that powers the AI wireless earbuds. I'm not sure if that's a bug or not, but if it's not, I suppose no one ever said reaching productivity god status came without a price—in this case, a literal one in USD.

There are a bunch of other weird things about these wireless earbuds that are both fun and totally useless, and they're maybe my favorite part of Oso. For one, the case has a display on it, and that screen has a silly-looking robot face. It grabbed my attention and the wonder of other Gizmodo staff right away, because (duh) cute robot assistant. Unfortunately, I'm still unsure what the purpose of that face is outside of just looking cute. There are also some other features on the screen that let you control aspects of the buds or audio playback, like skipping tracks, play-pause, and preset EQ adjustments for “rock,” or “pop” etc… There's also a timer, a volume slider, and a screen that shows the date and time. All of those can be swiped through Tinder-style. Nothing about this experience is necessary or really that useful, but I love it anyway. These are the types of strange form factors you can only get in a crowdfunded device, and even if they're impractical, it breaks the monotony of AirPods dupes.

As long as we're talking about hardware, it's worth touching on some stuff I definitely don't like. One of those things is the wireless earbuds themselves, which don't have ear tips, but just a bud that is meant to nest in your outer ear (think AirPods 4). That design is intentional since it allows you to hear your surroundings with the wireless earbuds in and makes them more comfortable during longer periods of use, but it also just kind of sucks. I never feel like the Oso AI Earbuds are fully secure in my ears, and I know I'm not alone in feeling that way with earbuds sans tips. That design also has a ripple effect on the worst part of these buds: the sound.

These are not wireless earbuds you should listen to music on. The sound is flat and not super loud, which is a problem given the ambient noise bleed I described above. No amount of preset EQ can fix that, either. Music playback, while built into the experience via the case with touch controls and preset EQ is clearly an afterthought here, and if you're looking to get a pair of wireless earbuds that can work for AI transcription and double as your daily driver for music, you will be very disappointed. That's a bummer on any pair of wireless earbuds, but especially so when you consider the $170 price tag.

Oh, and battery life is middling. Oso rates the wireless earbuds for 6 hours of playback, which would be fine until you realize that most earbuds at this price have 6 hours of battery with ANC. These wireless earbuds, as a matter of record, do not have ANC. If you can stand listening to Oso AI Earbuds for extended periods, the case holds 21 hours of battery.

Maybe I'm expecting too much from a pair of crowdfunded wireless earbuds, but I was promised (at the very least) a useful tool for productivity. And maybe recording everything all the time, pissing people off that I'm calling off with ambient noise bleed, dealing with unexpected paywalls, praying that my wireless earbuds don't fall out of my ears on the subway platform, trying to figure out whether the face on my earbuds case is mad at me, and failing to use a voice assistant named Judy are getting me closer to the ultimate cog in the productivity machine, and I just can't see it yet. Or maybe the simplest explanation is best. Maybe wireless earbuds don't have to help me transcend—maybe they shouldn't. Maybe it's okay that they just do what they've always done: connect to my phone and play some really good fucking music.

If you have been following high-end noise-cancelling headphones lately, you know there are big hitters like Sony, Bose, Sonos, Apple and Beats out there. Since Apple purchased Beats back in 2014, the brand has really upped its game, and blends style and sound together in a way that appeals to many.

Right now, during Back to School, Amazon is offering an amazing deal on the Beats Studio Pro and sells them for half price—$179 vs. the typical $350. With the price this low, it's difficult for other high-end headphones to compete on value and quality.

See at Amazon

The Beats Studio Pro are wireless Bluetooth over-the-heads that include some amazing features to make listening even better. One of their best features is the active noise cancelling which is highly effective at eliminating ambient noise without muffling your music. This lets you fully immerse yourself in your songs or focus on work even in noisy environments like cafes or public transport. The headphones also come with individualized spatial audio which shifts sound based on how you hold your head, making the experience more immersive and natural.

Sound quality is where the Beats Studio Pro is absolutely great, and we love its balanced and clean sound profile: The bass hits hard without overwhelming the mids and highs, giving you a deep listening experience whether you listen to deep electronic beats or acoustic melodies. Controls are intuitive as well, you can turn volume up or down, skip a track, and answer a call with ease, all without needing to reach for your phone.

We also like the USB-C lossless audio feature so you can plug in and listen to a perfectly clean sound without compression. Perfect for those who desire clean audio quality from their wired output, whether you listen on an Apple or an Android phone. Platform compatibility is a significant feature if you switch devices often, since the Beats Studio Pro play equally as well with both.

Battery life is always a make-or-break feature on wireless headphones, but the Beats Studio Pro offer up to 40 hours of playtime (probably the best in the entire industry). And when you do charge it, fast-charging gives you a speedy boost – approximately an hour of play after a quick top-up.

These Beats headphones provide excellent sound, long battery life and decent noise cancelling technology at a price that can't be beat on Amazon right now.

With hackers on the corner of every internet space, having your stuff in an offline external hard drive is one of the safest things you could possibly do. From your precious documents to those irreplaceable photo memories, having them stored in an internet-less device means much less chance of being hacked.

Seagate is a name you can trust when it comes to hard drives, and right now, their 24TB external hard drive is dropping jaws with a price that works out to just about $1.10 per gigabyte ($279) on Amazon. That's a record low in the industry, which makes it even cheaper per GB than the 22TB or 20TB models.

See at Amazon

With 24 terabytes of capacity, you've got room for everything you need – thousands of photos, a metric ton of video, all your work files – without ever having to worry about having too little space in the future. It's USB 3.0 so copying files is effortless and much faster than it was with earlier versions of USB drives. Just plug it in, and watch it effortlessly handle big files like a pro and save you time and hassle.

What's cool about this Seagate hard drive is that it's super simple to use: No complicated software, just plug it in and you're good to go. The design is straightforward but solid, perfect for home or office, and it doesn't need a separate power plug since it gets its juice from the USB connection.

Oh, and it also covers Rescue Data Recovery Services. So in the event something unexpected happens (like a crash or accidental delete), they can help recover your data. That's peace of mind you don't want to miss.

This drive isn't just for storage—it's great if you're into video editing, photography, or just want to keep your digital life organized. Offloading big files to a drive like this frees up your main computer, which can even help it run a bit faster.

At $279 today, this 24TB Seagate drive is a steal: Do the math by price per gigabyte and it's highly unlikely to find this kind of deal and especially from a high-profile brand with that extra recovery feature. If you'd like to have your data safe and have tons of space without taking out a second mortgage, this one's definitely going to be worth a look.

DJI is a company most people are first familiar with through drones, but the company has expanded into cameras and portable power stations as a global reference point in those related spaces.

Portable power stations have gotten extremely popular for a reason: they provide back-up power at the moment you need it whether that is for a night on the town with your buddies, unexpected winter blackouts or off-grid van life. Right now, the DJI Power 1000 is available for a record low of $499 at Amazon—half of its normal $999 price. This price is so low that brands like Anker, EcoFlow, or Jackery don't offer anything similar for less than $800.

See at Amazon

The DJI Power 1000 over performs with its 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that is famous for being more resilient and longer-lasting than the typical lithium-ion battery. That means what you get is a long-lasting power source that will not deteriorate at a fast rate even after millions of cycles. It provides 2200W of continuous power and can peak at 2600W so it can power an assortment of devices from laptops and cell phones to appliances or tools.

One of the features that make the DJI Power 1000 a pleasure to use is its ultra-quiet operation: Rated at just 23 decibels, it's quieter than a whisper, so it won't disturb your environment whether you're working indoors or relaxing at the campsite. This is a big plus compared to many other power stations that can become noisy under load.

There are other charging inputs that are flexible and can see you top it up from multiple sources: There are two 140W USB-C and two USB-A ports to charge other devices that are compatible very quickly, and the two AC ports are reserved for anything else. If you want to take it further off-grid, this version can be paired with solar panels in order to generate clean and renewable power.

The design is also easy to use: The power station also features an easy-to-read LCD screen that displays charging status, battery level and output wattage so you're always monitoring how much power you have left and where it's going. The carry handle and compact design make it easy to take with you which adds that extra layer of convenience for those who need to have power on the go.

If you're looking for a portable power station that delivers solid performance without the premium price tag of its competitors, the DJI Power 1000 deserves your attention.

Soundbars can be tricky. You head into the store or browse online and suddenly there are models selling for well over $1,000, and the sound isn't even always that incredible. If you've been looking to upgrade from your TV's built-in speakers but don't want to blow your budget, Bose has a sale running right now that's pretty hard to ignore. The best part? This compact Bose TV Speaker not only enhances your TV's sound but it also doubles as a living room Bluetooth speaker that you can control right from your phone.

Here's what makes this such a no-brainer right now: the Bose TV Speaker is down to $163 on Amazon, from $279. That's the all-time low for this model, with a 41% discount that brings premium sound well into “affordable” territory.

See at Amazon

 

Bose designed this soundbar to integrate easily into your living room without cables, complicated receivers or endless setup menus. At just over two inches tall and a little under two feet wide, it fits neatly right in front of almost any flat-screen TV without blocking the view. If you'd rather mount it instead, those brackets are available but even leaving it on a console looks clean and unobtrusive.

Yet it is not just about looks: it is also about transforming the way you hear your films and shows. The speaker uses two angled full-range drivers to open the soundstage beyond what you would expect for something so compact. That means explosions during an action scene have real depth, and sweeping scores in dramas are more immersive. The difference is immediate: TV programming no longer sounds flat.

One of the features people appreciate most is the way it clarifies voices: We've all been there, turning up the volume to hear actors clearly, only to be blasted the second music or background sounds kick in. This Bose TV speaker is engineered to focus on dialogue and sharpens those mid-tones so voices come through naturally without cranking the volume.

It wouldn't be a modern Bose product without Bluetooth: With wireless connectivity built-in, it's easy to switch from TV to music streaming. Pair your phone, tablet, or other device and use the soundbar as your home speaker. It can remember three input sources, and the one that turns on first will connect automatically for as easy an experience as you can have. Add in the possibility of a bass boost through the remote if you prefer a bit more depth, and you're ready for gaming marathons and casual playlists alike.

At the end of the day, this deal comes down to value. For $163, you're getting a trusted Bose soundbar that dramatically improves TV sound, makes dialogue crystal clear, delivers a surprisingly wide audio experience from a small frame and doubles as a living room Bluetooth speaker. Many soundbars selling for far higher prices don't tick all those boxes.

Reverse Hyper-Threading?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel has patented a technology it calls 'Software Defined Supercore' (SDC) that enables software to fuse the capabilities of multiple cores to assemble a virtual ultra-wide 'supercore' capable of improving single-thread performance, provided that it has enough parallel work. If the technology works as it is designed to, then Intel's future CPUs could offer faster single-thread performance in select applications that can use SDC. For now, this is just a patent which may or may not become a reality.

Intel's Software Defined Supercore (SDC) technologies combine two or more physical CPU cores to cooperate as a single high-performance virtual core by dividing a single thread's instructions into separate blocks and executing them in parallel. Each core runs a distinct portion of the program, while specialized synchronization and data-transfer instructions ensure that the original program order is preserved, maximizing instructions per clock (IPC) with minimal overhead. This approach is designed to improve single-thread performance without increasing clock speeds or building wide, monolithic cores, which can increase power consumption and/or transistor budgets.

Modern x86 CPU cores can decode 4–6 instructions and then execute 8-9 micro-ops per cycle after the instructions are decoded into micro-ops, which achieves peak IPC performance for such processors. By contrast, Apple's custom Arm-based high-performance cores (e.g., Firestorm, Avalanche, Everest) can decode up to 8 instructions per cycle and then execute over 10 instructions per cycle under ideal conditions. This is why Apple's processors typically offer significantly higher single-threaded performance and lower power consumption compared to Arm counterparts.

While it is technically possible to build an 8-way x86 CPU core (i.e., a superscalar x86 processor that can decode, issue, and retire up to 8 instructions per clock), in practice, it has not been done because of front-end bottlenecks as well as diminishing returns in terms of performance increase amid significant power and area costs. In fact, even modern x86 CPUs can typically hit 2–3-4 sustained IPC on general workloads, depending on software. So, instead of building an 8-way x86 CPU core, Intel's SDC proposes pairing two or more 4-wide units to cooperate as one large core in cases where it makes sense.

On the hardware side, each core in an SDC-enabled system includes a small dedicated hardware module that manages synchronization, register transfers, and memory ordering between paired cores. These modules utilize a reserved memory region — known as the wormhole address space — to coordinate live-in/live-out data and synchronization operations, ensuring that instructions from separate cores retire in the correct program order. The design supports both in-order and out-of-order cores, requiring minimal changes to the existing execution engine, which results in a compact design in terms of die space.

On the software side, the system uses either a JIT compiler, a static compiler, or binary instrumentation to split a single-threaded program into code segments to assign different blocks to different cores. It injects special instructions for flow control, register passing, and sync behavior, enabling the hardware to maintain execution integrity. Support by the operating system is crucial as the OS dynamically decides when to migrate a thread into or out of super-core mode based on runtime conditions to balance performance and core availability.

Intel's patent does not provide exact numerical performance gain estimates, but it implies that in select scenarios, it is realistic to expect the performance of two 'narrow' cores to approach the performance of a 'wide' core.

Small form factor (SFF) PC specialist Shuttle has rolled out a new compact PC and barebone system dubbed the XPC slim DH810. This sub-1.4 liter system packs in a tiny Intel H810 chipset motherboard, and is ready for your choice of Intel Core Ultra 200 series (Arrow Lake-S, LGA1851) CPU with up to 65W TDP, dual DDR5 SODIMMs, plus SATA and M.2 storage options. It is described as “semi-ruggedized” but we don't see any related specifications or certifications shared by Shuttle.

With Shuttle's assertion that this system is capable of handing any Arrow Lake-S chip up to 65W, you could conceivably spec it up to a very capable Intel Core Ultra 9 Processor 285. These are currently on a ‘limited time deal' for $520 on Amazon.com. For the money you get a total of 24 cores at your disposal (8 P-cores and 16 E-cores), running at up to 5.6 GHz, and aided by 36MB of Intel Smart Cache. It also features four Intel Xe cores in the Arc iGPU (max 2.0 GHz), and a dedicated NPU for 13 TOPS AI boost.

 




Arrow Lake CPUs, like the one highlighted above are a good choice for edge applications which need a little extra processing power, and from Shuttle's blurb it is indeed targeting such applications. Specifically, it highlights the potential use of the XPC slim DH810 in automation, surveillance, digital signage – as well as for general office computing. The presence of serial ports (COM ports) and dual Ethernet also hint at this device's targeting of industrial markets. This device can also be VESA mounted behind a screen.

Shuttle doesn't discuss the cooling system that comes built-into the XPC slim DH810 at any great depth, but we can see the chassis looks well vented, there are two 70mm system fans placed above a chunky heatpipe threaded heatsink that covers perhaps 70% of the motherboard area.

Tariffs and inflation are largely to blame


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


From PCs to consoles, patient gamers are often rewarded with falling console prices. Those who are willing to wait for their games see falling prices as interest in any game or generation of hardware wains. But not this generation. The current crop of consoles are all now more expensive than when they launched several years ago.

When the Xbox Series X launched in 2020, it was priced at $499, but now its official price is $599 for the standard edition. The series S launched at $299, but that's now $380 with 512GB storage capacity, or $429 with a terabyte. The PS5 is much the same, now priced at $550 after price increases from its $499 launch price.

Even Nintendo hasn't been immune to price increases. Its last-generation Switch launched at just $299 in 2017, but it's now between $320 and $340 depending on the retailer after an early-August price rise.

This makes this console generation the first that has become more expensive as time has gone on. We're approaching nearly five years since some of this hardware launched and it's much more expensive than it used to be - games included. That's prompted a serious outcry from the gaming community.

This is the first ever generation where console prices have INCREASED, rather than fallen.Also, less console exclusives than any previous gen too.#PlayStation #GamingNews pic.twitter.com/K06PqWGlChAugust 29, 2025

Gamers have been quick to point to tariffs as the main reason for these price increases, and considering the timing, it's hard to blame them - Although a recent ruling that the tariffs are largely illegal could throw the whole scheme into confusion.

However, it's also worth considering inflation as a major driver of these price increases, too. While typical inflation of a couple of percent a year would make older items at lower prices much more expensive if launched later, the last few years have seen rampant inflation. That original Xbox Series X launch price would be over $622 today. The Switch's 2017 launch at $299 would be more like $398 if launched today.

That perhaps puts these price increases in context, even if it's hard to swallow how much more expensive everything seems to be in 2025.

However, Ars has gone to the effort of crafting some charts to show how great the disparity is, and what we missed this generation. It suggests that if historical price drops of consoles were mirrored today, we could expect the Switch to cost as little as $116 for the base model, and the Xbox Series X and PS5 to be as little as $286.

Indeed, prices are supposed to come down as production of the consoles ramps up, the process node matures and enhancements in manufacturing allow for reduced production costs that often become cost reduced models that appear as the console ages.

It's clear that hasn't happened this time around. Surprisingly, none of the console manufacturers have taken the opportunity to keep prices lower to stand out from the pack. Historically, console manufactures have been happy to take a loss on the hardware if it meant making it up on software. Considering game prices have also risen in recent years, it's hard not to think that at least some advantage is being taken of the situation, rather than it being purely driven by market forces.

 September 01, 2025  

In August, Thomas Pontinen, MD, a Chicago-based anesthesiologist, found himself spending far more time with his billing vendor than he wanted.

It was a new contract — the fifth billing company he has hired in the 20 years since opening his integrative pain management clinic, which sees about 4000 patients each month. Initial meetings were promising, but the training process quickly became tedious.

“The most frustrating thing about outsourcing billing is they give you a great sales pitch, and then they change their tune,” Pontinen told Medscape Medical News.

Since midsummer, his new vendor had challenged his clinic's workflow with what he called “nitpicky arguments.” The latest dispute was over a minor data entry issue. Because of his software setup, insurance information doesn't integrate into the clinical notes. Staff must click a link to view it in a separate tab — a single extra step. The biller pushed back, saying it slowed them down and that Pontinen's staff should take on more work.

“It seems like a stupid argument,” he said. “But because it's not like what they are used to, they don't want to do it.” Ultimately, Pontinen reminded the biller that flexibility was his top priority. “If you can't be accommodating, this isn't going to work.”

Medical billing vendors have become indispensable for many practice owners, but choosing the right one and streamlining the process, can be complicated. Not to mention, their added efficiency can come with a hefty price tag.

Outsourcing helps solve a longstanding problem: turnover among in-house billing staff. Conrad Fisk, MD, a family practice physician and practice owner in North Carolina, said, he repeatedly tried to manage billing in-house for cost and control, but turnover made it unsustainable. Training new hires only to lose them to nearby hospitals, or insurers drained time and revenue.

“When a biller leaves, the backlog of uncollected claims can drain a practice's revenue almost overnight,” Fisk said.

Medical billing vendors, in contrast, provide a steady supply of staff. “Income can still fluctuate, but at least you're insulated against it dropping to zero overnight,” Fisk said.

That protection comes at a price. Most billing vendors charge a percentage of collected claims, though some use a flat per-claim fee or bill based on the number of full-time employees required.

Pontinen said, 4%-6% for charge entry and accounts receivable are standard, with rates jumping to 8% or even 10% for claims older than 90 or 120 days.

Fisk has seen fees range from 4.5% to 8%, which can be cutthroat for a family practice provider. “It's difficult to pay 7% of what comes in the door and still stay afloat,” he said.

Earlier this year, Fisk dropped a vendor that kept increasing rates without adding services. After shopping around, he found a more competitive option.

Even with the right vendor, oversight is essential. “You have to run regular reports and make sure you're getting what you pay for,” Fisk said.

“If you start to see any of those [30, 60, or 90-day claims] going up above the promised rate, you have to decide what to do,” Fisk said. If the proportion of unpaid claims at 30, 60, or 90 days starts creeping above expectations, it's time to act.

Billing issues are sensitive for both patients and practices. When outsourcing, physicians need to clarify upfront how communication will work.

“Many companies outsource overseas, which makes it cheaper but more difficult for patients who call with questions,” Fisk said.

Trying to communicate across multiple staffing layers and time zones to resolve a billing error can be costly and slow down resolution. Pontinen recommends asking early who your team can communicate with and how quickly to expect responses. Also, confirm whether you can speak directly to the billing staff handling your claims or only through a middleman.

Equally important: Establish how the vendor will report back to your practice. Will you get monthly analytics? How often will your billing manager meet with theirs? Fisk said once a month is usually sufficient — but only if it's guaranteed in writing.

Both Pontinen and Fisk agreed: The process starts with understanding your own practice.

Know your break-even point, patient volume, and revenue cycle. Be clear on what parts of billing you want to outsource and what you'll keep in-house.

“Be as specific as possible,” Pontinen said. For instance, how will the vendor contact patients if a claim is denied? He once discovered too late that a vendor expected his staff to make those calls.

Similarly, does the biller cap the number of times they will try and collect on a claim? Pontinen said that's nonnegotiable.

It's nearly impossible to think of everything but attempt to work through every step in your revenue cycle and see how the potential vendor aligns with your needs. Here are other questions to consider:

Even after careful vetting, problems will arise — whether coding issues, pricing disputes, or workflow mismatches like Pontinen experienced.

“Billing is such a big part of a medical practice that when you outsource it, you need ongoing conversations and corrections,” Fisk said.

Edited by Vineeta Teotia

 September 01, 2025  

MRI-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was well tolerated and safe among patients with liver metastases, with 97% completing treatment and only one grade 3 radiotherapy-related toxicity being reported. Quality of life (QOL) remained satisfactory, although clinically significant worsening occurred in role functioning, loss of appetite, pain, fatigue, and constipation at 3-month follow-up.

""MRI-guided SBRT for the treatment of patients with liver metastases is safe and well tolerated. We observed low toxicity rates and satisfactory quality of life outcomes, with the ability to reach BED10Gy [biologically effective dose using an alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy] > 100 Gy in more than 75% of patients. These results can contribute in informing patients about short-term side effects and provide physicians with insights about technical aspects of MRIgRT [MRI-guided radiotherapy] for patients with liver metastases,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Julia E. Peltenburg, MD, PhD, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was published online on August 21, 2025, in Practical Radiation Oncology.

This study was limited by missing data for physician-reported toxicity outcomes and patient-reported outcomes. Treatment techniques and dose prescriptions varied between institutions, potentially introducing bias. The researchers also noted difficulty in distinguishing between radiotherapy-related and unrelated toxicities. The potential underestimation of peak toxicity and reliance on general questionnaires that may miss treatment-specific symptoms were additional limitations.

This study received funding through a grant from the Dutch Cancer Society. Some authors reported receiving grants or speaker fees and having other ties with various sources. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Feeding blueberries to infants in the first year of life may help alleviate allergy symptoms and alter immune responses, suggesting a new dietary approach in infant health research.



Study: Blueberry Consumption in Early Life and Its Effects on Allergy, Immune Biomarkers, and Their Association with the Gut Microbiome. Image Credit: SoNelly / Shutterstock 

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers examined the impact of blueberry intake in early life on allergy-related symptoms, gut microbiota, and immune biomarkers. The complementary feeding period represents a critical time frame for shaping infant immune development, diet, and gut microbiota.

Infants started the blueberry powder around 5 months old, consuming roughly one serving daily mixed into purees or breastmilk throughout the complementary feeding period.

Current recommendations suggest introducing a range of plant-based foods from six months of age, in conjunction with continued breastfeeding. Growing evidence supports a role for blueberries in the microbiota-inflammation-immunity axis and gut microbial homeostasis.

The first year of life is a critical window for establishing immune competence and preventing allergic diseases. Dietary exposures during this period can influence the induction of immune tolerance, epigenetic programming, and gut microbial succession.

Suboptimal or aberrant microbial colonization has been linked to increased gut permeability, impaired innate immune responses, and low-grade inflammation, all of which are associated with a higher risk of diseases in later life.

Researchers tracked microbiota changes at multiple points (7, 9, 11 months), not just the endpoint, revealing dynamic shifts alongside the intervention.

In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of early-life blueberry intake on allergy-related symptoms, gut microbiota, and immune biomarkers. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited participants from households with infants aged 3 to 4 months.

Term-born infants were included if they were healthy, exclusively breastfed, and had no prior exposure to complementary foods. Infants were randomized to a blueberry or a placebo group.

The blueberry group received blueberry powder at 10 g per packet, while the placebo group received a color- and flavor-matched, isocaloric powder. Caregivers were instructed to offer one packet daily from baseline to 12 months (of age), and avoid other forms of blackberries or blueberries throughout the intervention. Infant blood and stool samples were collected at several time points. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to assess gut microbial profiles.

The team analyzed 29 chemokines and cytokines, as well as their associations with microbiota characteristics. Caregivers were asked whether their child had any respiratory symptoms, such as whistling or wheezing in the chest, dry cough unrelated to chest infection or cold, nasal symptoms unrelated to cold, skin-related concerns (e.g., itchy skin), gastrointestinal symptoms, or other symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction, at each study visit.

Baseline characteristics were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's exact tests. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare differences in cytokines/chemokines between groups. Correlations between cytokines and bacterial taxa were examined using Kendall's rank correlation test.

Furthermore, linear regression modeling was performed to investigate the associations between interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-13 and bacterial taxa, while accounting for treatment group and covariates.

Anthocyanins, the key pigments in blueberries, appear central to the effects, potentially suppressing allergy-related immune pathways while boosting regulatory functions based on cited lab studies.

The study randomized 38 infants to receive the blueberry powder and 37 to the placebo group; of these, 29 and 31 infants completed the intervention, respectively, and were included in the final analytic sample. The paper also reported that 61 infants (30 blueberry, 31 placebo) completed the study overall; however, the final analyses used 60 infants (29 blueberry, 31 placebo).

Both groups had similar baseline characteristics, with a mean age of 22 weeks at enrolment. Vaccination rates were high in both groups.

No infant in either group received cough suppressants, antibiotics, or had feeding concerns at baseline. Respiratory symptoms were significantly different between groups at baseline. In the blueberry group, seven infants had some respiratory symptoms, and four had a history of dry cough. Conversely, the placebo group had no such symptoms.

Longitudinal analysis of allergy symptoms revealed significant differences in the trajectories of respiratory (p = 0.02) and overall allergic symptoms (p = 0.05). Four subjects in the blueberry group had respiratory symptom resolution, with fewer developing new symptoms during the follow-up, compared to the placebo group.

Although the blueberry group had more respiratory symptoms at baseline, a greater number of infants in the blueberry group achieved symptom resolution by the end of the study compared to the placebo group.

Caregivers collected infant stool samples using special biodegradable liners placed inside diapers, freezing them at home before transport to the lab for microbiota analysis.

Most cytokines did not show significant differences between groups. IL-13 was lower in the blueberry group than in the placebo group in a small, sensitivity analysis without imputation (n≈7 per group; p=0.035), and IL-10 was borderline higher in the blueberry group (p=0.052).

Cytokine analyses were only available for 48 infants, which limited the statistical power. Changes in allergy symptoms were not significantly associated with IL-10 or IL-13.

In total, 32 cytokine-bacteria associations, involving 18 bacterial groups and 19 cytokines, were reported. IL-10 levels were positively associated with Megasphaera, Clostridiaceae, and Lactobacillus at 12 months. IL-10 showed negative associations with Peptostreptococcaceae, Blautia, and Lacticaseibacillus at 12 months.

IL-13 levels were positively associated with Clostridia and Citrobacter, and negatively associated with Peptostreptococcaceae, Lactobacillus, Blautia, and Anaerostipes at 12 months.

These microbiota–cytokine associations were exploratory and not adjusted for multiple comparisons, so they should be considered hypothesis-generating.

In summary, the findings indicate that blueberry intake during infancy may influence the resolution of allergic symptoms and modulate immune development.

The associations of immune markers, such as IL-10 and IL-13, with specific bacterial taxa highlight potential targets for further mechanistic investigations. However, the cytokine analyses were limited by small sample sizes and missing data, and the study was not designed to detect clinical endpoints.

More patients with hypercholesterolemia at high/very high risk of cardiovascular (CV) events achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals with inclisiran compared with placebo, when given on top of individually optimized lipid-lowering therapy, according to a late-breaking trial presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025.

Elevated LDL-C is causal for the development and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, most patients do not achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals with available lipid-lowering therapies due to suboptimal treatment escalation, nonadherence or concerns about safety, such as muscle pain.

Principal Investigator, Professor Ulf Landmesser from the Deutsches Herzzentrum der Charité, Berlin, Germany, explained the aims of the VICTORION-Difference trial: ""When given as a subcutaneous injection every 3 or 6 months, inclisiran interferes with the production of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lowering LDL-C levels. The purpose of the VICTORION-Difference study was to compare inclisiran with placebo, on top of individually optimized lipid-lowering therapies, for LDL-C goal achievement and novel endpoints related to muscle-related adverse events and pain-related quality of life (QoL) in a population that mirrors real-world practice.""

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase IV trial was conducted at 133 centres in Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, France, Germany, Latvia, Poland and Spain. Eligible patients were at high or very high CV risk according to 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines3 and had elevated LDL-C despite being treated with an individualised maximally tolerated statin dose. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either subcutaneous injections of inclisiran sodium 300 mg (equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran) or placebo. In addition to inclisiran/placebo, open-label rosuvastatin (starting dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) was sequentially and optimally titrated to the maximally tolerated dose if individual LDL-C goals were not achieved. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving 2019 guideline-recommended individual LDL-C goals (very high CV risk: <55 mg/dl [<1.4 mmol/l]; high CV risk: <70 mg/dl [<1.8 mmol/l]) at day 90.

A total of 1,770 individuals were randomized who had a mean age of 63.7 years and 30.2% were female. Most participants (92.3%) were classified as having very high CV risk.

Regarding the primary endpoint, a significantly higher proportion of participants in the inclisiran vs. the standard-of-care arm achieved their individual guideline-recommended LDL-C goals at 90 days (84.9% vs. 31.0%; odds ratio [OR] 12.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.59 to 15.24; p<0.0001).

Time-averaged mean percentage LDL-C reductions from baseline to day 360 were −59.45% and −24.31% in the inclisiran and the standard-of-care groups, respectively (least squares mean treatment difference 35.14%; p<0.0001).

Fewer participants in the inclisiran vs. standard-of-care arms experienced a muscle-related adverse event (11.9% vs. 19.2%; p<0.0001). In addition, numerically larger time-averaged reductions were noted with inclisiran vs. standard-of-care for pain-related severity (−0.11; p=0.0389) and interference scores (−0.11; p=0.0285) using the Short-Form Brief Pain Inventory, which did not reach statistical significance.

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between the inclisiran and standard-of-care arms (71.3% and 75.9%, respectively).

In conclusion, Professor Landmesser commented: ""This large study demonstrated the effectiveness of an inclisiran-based treatment strategy over current usual care in bringing patients to early and sustained LDL-C goals, with significantly fewer adverse muscle symptoms. These findings indicate that inclisiran represents a convenient, effective and well-tolerated treatment option for the high number of at-risk patients who currently do not respond adequately to other lipid-lowering therapies.""

Time is of the essence in a cardiac emergency, and the ability to restart the heart immediately after a cardiac arrest, even before the arrival of the emergency medical services, markedly increases the chance of survival. However, easy-to-use automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are not always readily available. 

The Avive Connect AED®—developed by California-based Avive Solutions, Inc., and manufactured by Tecan's Paramit® contract manufacturing business—is designed to address this challenge, guiding device owners and bystanders to nearby emergencies to enable more rapid assistance. 

There are over four million AEDs currently deployed across the United States (US), and these devices are becoming increasingly common in locations ranging from national fitness chain gyms and resorts to universities, police departments, and federal government buildings. Despite this trend, which is seeing the market for AEDs growing at a consistent 10 percent a year, the survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remain almost unchanged year on year.

Sameer Jafri, CEO and co-founder of Avive Solutions, has outlined some of the issues contributing to the lack of improvement in survival rates.

AEDs can be situated in any public access setting, from restaurants, coffee shops and shopping malls to large enterprise buildings and airports. If they are deployed quickly, there is a much greater chance of saving a patient's life; the likelihood of survival decreases by 10 percent for every minute that a defibrillation shock is delayed.

Sameer Jafri, CEO and Co-Founder of Avive Solutions

Delays in AED deployment can occur for three main reasons. First, there may be multiple AEDs near an incident, but no one knows their locations. Second, untrained bystanders often hesitate to use what appears to be a complex medical device. Finally, most AEDs are not connected to a monitoring system, so their functionality can only be confirmed through physical inspection. This makes maintenance more burdensome and increases the risk of inconsistent device performance.

Avive Solutions was founded to address these issues by creating a revolutionary AED that can integrate into existing emergency response systems, meeting the needs of patients, end-users and emergency service coordinators.

Sameer explained: “When a 911 call is made to the emergency services, the call handler will ask if an AED is available, and it is often the case that the caller will not know. Even if an AED is located and used on the patient before the emergency services arrive on the scene, the person usually arrives at the hospital without an ECG recording from the AED. This forces clinical decision-making without critical incident information from before the arrival of the emergency services. A more connected system of response is essential, and so we developed the Avive Connect AED.”

The Avive Connect AED is extremely compact and weighs just over 950 grams (just two pounds), making it highly portable. Crucially, it offers advanced connectivity with cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth technologies, allowing devices to be integrated into 911 call centers using Intelligent Response™ software.

In the event of a suspected cardiac arrest, the call handler can activate an audible alert on Avive Connect AEDs near the emergency location. Once a person has accepted that alert on the AED, the device will display a map and navigate them to the location of the patient. The call center is also able to monitor the location of the device in real time, see whether the patient is in a shockable rhythm, and register how many shocks have been delivered.

Alternatively, if the Avive Connect AED is deployed before an emergency call has been made, its QuickRescue™ feature automatically notifies 911 once the electrode pads are placed on the patient and the initial rhythm analysis is complete. Emergency communication centers receive the device's location and event details, which are then shared with first responders to give them critical information about the patient's condition before they arrive. This data can also be transferred via the cloud to the hospital's cardiologist or emergency department, ensuring they have access to the patient's pre-hospital history.

Maintaining a network of AEDs in working order can be a significant cost and time burden, especially for government departments or large enterprises.

The Avive Connect AED is equipped with a rechargeable battery, eliminating the need for costly routine replacement of traditional batteries, and can perform simple, automated maintenance checks. Data from each device is uploaded to the REALConnect Platform™ fleet management software, which displays the status of an organization's entire AED fleet. This allows device owners to know where their devices are, confirm they are functional, and see if they are in use, removing the need for routine physical inspections.

Reliability is obviously a critical consideration for any life-saving equipment, so Avive Solutions carefully assessed potential manufacturing partners before beginning production.

We spoke to several contract manufacturers before choosing Paramit. We wanted a manufacturer that would partner with us in the later stage of the development phase, and chose Paramit for several reasons, the main one being its focus on medical devices. These devices must adhere to strict quality standards, and Paramit is unparalleled in this regard. 

The company's new product introduction team understood our concept from day one, so the onboarding time was short, and the customer service was incredible. There was also a strong desire from both parties to work together, and we had access to the highest levels of the company, meeting with the executive leadership early in the process.

Sameer Jafri, CEO and Co-Founder of Avive Solutions

The product design was optimized using ‘Design for Manufacturing' principles, then the AED was manufactured using the Paramit vPoke® computer-directed assembly technology. Avive Solutions was also able to draw on Tecan's expertise in preparing for FDA regulatory audits, helping to accelerate approvals and get the system to market sooner.

“We received FDA approval in the fall of 2022, and have been manufacturing and shipping devices for more than 15 months now, which has already led to many lives being saved in the field. Tecan and its contract manufacturing team at Paramit are great partners for us: it is truly a symbiotic relationship,” Sameer concluded.

 

​Tecan is a leading global provider of automated laboratory instruments and solutions. Its systems and components help people working in clinical diagnostics, basic and translational research, and drug discovery bring their science to life.

In particular, the company develops, produces, markets and supports automated workflow solutions that empower laboratories to achieve more. Its Cavro® branded instrument components are chosen by leading instrumentation suppliers across multiple disciplines.

Scientists reveal how plant-based compounds may combat Alzheimer's through multi-target actions, but poor bioavailability and the blood-brain barrier limit the way dietary hope can be translated into real therapies.



Review: Polyphenols and Alzheimer's Disease: A Review on Molecular and Therapeutic Insights With In Silico Support

In a recent review published in the journal Food Science & Nutrition, researchers synthesized evidence on how dietary polyphenols modulate Alzheimer's disease (AD) biology and evaluated mechanistic, computational, and translational insights.

Resveratrol sparks a cellular ""cleanup crew,"" activating SIRT1 proteins linked to longevity and neuronal survival, offering a dual defense against Alzheimer's pathways beyond just reducing inflammation.

More than 50 million people worldwide are currently living with dementia, with numbers projected to rise substantially in the coming decades.

AD, the leading cause of dementia, features amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation that gradually erode memory and independence.

Interest in polyphenols from fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, and wine has grown because many people hope that everyday foods can support brain health. People also want to know whether these plant compounds can truly change disease biology, not just symptoms. 

By understanding the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and amyloid-modulating actions of these compounds, clinicians and consumers can make more informed choices about their diet and potential therapies. Current treatments are limited, which increases the demand for safe and accessible options. 

Further research is needed to turn these promising mechanisms into dependable, patient-centered benefits.

Curcumin teams up with unexpected partners, like steroid molecules or probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, creating combinations that show stronger memory protection in animal studies than curcumin alone.

AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which Aβ peptides accumulate as plaques, microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, and neurons are injured by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and persistent immune activation. These connected processes weaken synapses and cognition over time so that a little forgetfulness can grow into lost names, unpaid bills, and eventually complete dependency.

Polyphenols, plant phytochemicals that include flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans, are abundant in common foods and drinks, and they draw attention because they show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and amyloid-modulating actions that align with core features of Alzheimer's biology.

Preclinical studies of resveratrol, curcumin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have reported improved cognition and reduced neurodegeneration in models, suggesting that dietary patterns and nutraceuticals may complement medical care rather than replace it.

Together, these signals support a translational focus on how polyphenols act across oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, as well as on how such actions might be applied in clinical practice.

Beyond Nrf2 and NF-κB, polyphenols quietly influence other key players, like enzymes breaking down brain barriers (MMPs) and hormone signaling pathways (ESR1), suggesting wider biological effects than commonly discussed.

Oxidative stress is a core driver of neuronal injury in AD. Polyphenols such as EGCG, resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin enhance endogenous defenses by activating nuclear factor erythroid 2 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and temper pro-oxidant cascades regulated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

In experimental models, EGCG increases superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, promotes Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and induces heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which together mitigate ROS damage and support cognitive function. 

Resveratrol similarly attenuates NF-κB-mediated signaling, reducing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Quercetin, on the other hand, exerts dual actions—activating Nrf2 and inhibiting MAPK, to prevent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. 

These concerted effects make polyphenols more than simple radical scavengers; they act as network modulators that recalibrate redox homeostasis in vulnerable neurons.

Activated microglia and astrocytes release cytokines and chemokines that amplify synaptic loss. Polyphenols counter this response by inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK signaling, thereby lowering inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and curbing inflammatory cascades.

Resveratrol suppresses microglial activation and decreases the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α; curcumin limits NF-κB translocation by preserving the inhibitor of kappa B (IκB). By shifting the glial environment toward resolution rather than attack, polyphenols preserve synapses and support plasticity that underpins learning and daily function.

Tau proteins aren't just tangled; polyphenols like EGCG act like molecular shields, physically preventing the specific chemical changes (hyperphosphorylation) that turn tau toxic and disrupt vital cellular transport systems.

Computational biology strengthens the mechanistic case by showing how polyphenols may bind proteins that drive AD. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicate interactions with beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), tau, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3-β), a kinase that promotes tau hyperphosphorylation.

In the present review, myricetin, luteolin, kaempferol, caffeic acid, quercetin, apigenin, curcumin, and ferulic acid exhibited strong predicted binding to GSK3-β, with docking scores from approximately −11.8 to −8.7 kcal/mol and recurring contacts at residues such as VAL A:135 and ASN A:64, stabilizing inactive conformations and implying a route to reduce tangle formation.

Related analyses note marine-derived compounds that inhibit AChE and BACE1 while modulating NF-κB, underscoring a multi-target strategy. Such in silico evidence does not replace validation, but it accelerates candidate selection and analog design, focusing scarce trial resources on scaffolds that are most likely to modify the disease.

Naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, gets a delivery upgrade – specially designed ""biomimetic"" nanoparticles boost its brain levels, allowing lower doses (20mg/kg) to reduce amyloid plaques effectively in tests.

Promise meets pragmatism at the pharmacokinetic bottleneck: many polyphenols have poor bioavailability and limited blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Rapid metabolism and low central exposure can blunt otherwise potent mechanisms.

Advances in drug delivery, including the use of nanoparticles, liposomes, and prodrugs, aim to enhance stability, improve transport, and increase brain uptake, while medicinal chemistry tailors lipophilicity and target engagement. 

The review also notes that inter-individual gut microbiota variability can influence polyphenol metabolism and brain-active metabolite profiles. However, this remains a secondary limitation compared with bioavailability and BBB challenges. These strategies aim to translate bench signals into clinically meaningful effects without compromising safety.

Because polyphenols are found in daily diets in foods like berries, apples, onions, green tea, coffee, and olive oil, the science relates to grocery choices.

Diets inspired by Mediterranean or Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) patterns, combined with exercise and social engagement, are associated with lower oxidative stress and inflammation, and may help slow cognitive decline, providing families with practical steps while research advances.

Polyphenols are not stand-alone cures: AChE inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists remain foundational for symptom management, and monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ have sparked debate over their benefits and risks.

A realistic path blends lifestyle measures, symptomatic drugs, and polyphenol-rich patterns, with trials testing add-on effects and standardized dosing. Guidance should respect cultural cuisines and budgets, ensuring that brain-healthy actions are feasible for all in routine clinical care.

This review characterizes how polyphenols can address AD through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and multi-target actions that intersect with Aβ, tau, and redox biology.

Preclinical and in silico evidence support the activation of Nrf2, the restraint of NF-κB and MAPK, and the engagement of BACE1, AChE, and GSK3-β. Yet bioavailability and BBB limits temper promise. 

Going forward, trials, standardized formulations, and delivery systems that enhance brain exposure are essential to translating bench insights into benefits that matter to patients and their families.

Scientists have discovered how mouth bacteria hide inside artery walls, escaping detection until they erupt and spark the inflammation that can cause plaques to rupture.

Study: Viridans Streptococcal Biofilm Evades Immune Detection and Contributes to Inflammation and Rupture of Atherosclerotic Plaques. Image credit: Cata Arango/Shutterstock.com

Bacterial DNA from oral, respiratory, gut, and skin taxa has been reported in plaques. Its presence hints that chronic inflammation is key to atherosclerosis. A recent study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association explores the role of chronic plaque inflammation triggered by bacteria and the immune response to them in atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic subclinical inflammation caused by the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is deposited within the endothelial cells of the coronary arteries to form an atheroma. This deposition, as well as its progression and eventual rupture, is driven by inflammation.

Prior research suggests that the innate immune system recognizes oxidized LDL via pattern recognition receptors like the Toll-like receptors (TLR). The primary recognition site in oxidized LDL is phosphocholine, which is also present in multiple bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Immune responses to bacterial infections and to atheroma-promoting inflammatory molecules are shared. For instance, TLR2 and TLR4 receptors are important elements in the pathogen-associated molecular pattern mediating immune recognition of many bacteria. They are also found on multiple host structures, like oxidized LDL, and activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways.

This raises the question of whether plaque formation involves infection. Nearly 50 years ago, the presence of Chlamydia and dental infections in patients with heart disease spurred the infection hypothesis. However, despite a few promising results, mostly from smaller trials, most of the antibiotic trials that took place during that period failed to show protection against recurrent cardiovascular events.

Another possibility was that biofilm-forming bacteria caused chronic inflammation that failed to activate innate immunity. The biofilm also conferred resistance to antibiotic action, perhaps explaining the lack of benefit from antibiotics. Some unknown factors may trigger the dormant biofilm, causing virulent bacteria to eat away at the protective coating and escape into the atheroma, causing infection.

The current study sought to find evidence for this hypothesis. The authors have earlier reported finding viridans streptococci in multiple vascular thrombotic sites, including those from patients with heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis, and acute ischemic stroke.

Viridans streptococci are harmless oral cavity commensals. They initiate dental plaque formation (the oral biofilm), and are most likely to be found in the blood after dental procedures. They are also the most common microbes to be isolated in infective endocarditis, a biofilm-linked chronic bacterial infection of the heart lining.

However, they could simply be markers of inflammation. Alternatively, they might just happen to attach to the rough plaque surface as they pass through the bloodstream. In such a case, there would be immune activation, and the microbe would not be present only in atheromas.

In a healthy artery, complement factors coat bacteria, allowing macrophages to target them. Conversely, as hypoxia develops, new vessels begin to grow inside a growing atheroma. These bring bacteria from the blood directly to the atheroma. Bacteria may enter and circulate briefly in the bloodstream during dental procedures, and indeed, people who die of sudden cardiac death often have poor dental health.

The researchers examined coronary plaques from 121 individuals who suffered sudden death in the Tampere Sudden Death Study (TSDS) from Finland. Additional samples were taken from endarterectomy procedures performed on 96 patients. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing, immunohistochemistry, and genome-wide expression analysis were used, and the signaling pathways activated by bacteria were examined.

Bacteria were detected in 65% of TSDS plaques and 58% of endarterectomy specimens. In both series, the most common was oral viridans streptococcus, which was present in 42% of coronary plaques and 43% of endarterectomies.

The investigators then used immunohistochemistry with anti-viridans streptococci antibodies to detect bacterial antigens in plaques, supporting a bacterial presence, rather than cross-reactivity to oxidized LDL. They found immunopositivity to viridans streptococci in 60% and 53% of the TSDS and endarterectomy samples, respectively. The scientists hypothesize that both may play a role in the early progression of the plaque.

The occurrence of viridans streptococcus was associated with severe atherosclerosis and death due to coronary heart disease.

Most interestingly, the viridans streptococci colonized the atheroma core and wall, forming a biofilm. This shielded them from macrophages' recognition within the plaque core, whereas dispersed streptococci at the rupture site triggered innate and adaptive immunity responses. Biofilm formation is a characteristic of most chronic infections, containing extracellular polymers that mask outer bacterial wall structures from immune cells.

At rupture sites, dispersed streptococci were detected by TLR pathways, which can drive host cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that weaken the fibrous cap. Weakening and rupture of the fibrous cap are critical in atherothrombosis.

The more advanced or complicated the plaque, the higher the rate of immunopositivity. For instance, only 11% of artery segments with minimal atheroma formation were positive for antibodies. Still, with ruptured or thrombotic plaques, viridans streptococcal infiltration was observed in 100% of ruptured plaques in the autopsy series, and 75% in the surgical series.

“This evidence suggests that viridans streptococci are not innocent bystanders in the plaque.”

The most common signaling pathway to be activated in such cases was the TLR2 pathway. Both innate and adaptive immunity were activated at the plaque locations. Genome-wide expression analysis showed that bacterial recognition pathways were overexpressed in the endarterectomy samples.

The study suggests that “the change from a stable soft‐core coronary atheroma into a vulnerable rupture‐prone coronary plaque, as well as the development of a symptomatic peripheral artery plaque, may be contributed to by a chronic bacterial infection in the form of a dormant biofilm.”

This corroborates the role of inflammation in secondary cardiovascular events, as shown in the CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti‐Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) trial. These findings may also present new diagnostic and preventive targets in atherosclerosis.

Further research could uncover the potential protective role of a short course of antibiotics during acute myocardial infarction to prevent complications due to virulent streptococcal plaque invasion.

Despite extra training hours, only a small fraction of Polish students achieve good motor skill proficiency, raising concerns about how schools prepare children for lifelong physical activity and talent development.

Study: Assessing fundamental motor skills proficiency in school-based sports physical education programs: implications for talent development. Image credit: Drazen Zigic/Shutterstock.com

A Polish study, published in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living, reveals that although sports-based physical education programs perform better than traditional programs, both groups still show alarmingly low proficiency levels overall.

Motor competence is a person's ability to perform skilled, coordinated movements. These basic building blocks form the basis of more complex movement patterns called fundamental motor skills. They are crucial for developing and refining more complex sport-specific skills.

Fundamental motor skills, including locomotor skills (running, jumping), object control or manipulative skills (throwing, kicking), and balance or stability skills (body rolling, static balancing), are essential for participating in different physical activities and achieving long-term involvement in sports and exercise.

Fundamental motor skills can be developed in children through a structured and often difficult training process delivered by physical educators, sports coaches, or parents. Inadequate acquisition of these skills during the childhood developmental phase can lead to a lack of physical and mental fitness later in life.

Early specialization and early diversification are two primary models of developing fundamental motor skills in athletes. Early specialization involves participation in a single sport from childhood, maximizing performance outcomes. In contrast, early diversification refers to participation in various sports during childhood through self-motivated, loosely organized, and socially enjoyable play activities. This model encourages a delayed approach to specialization, typically beginning in adolescence, and comprehensive skill development.

Given the significant contribution of fundamental motor skills to a person's overall well-being, the current study was designed to assess and compare the overall fundamental motor skill proficiency of school students undergoing sport-based physical education programs or traditional physical education programs.

The study also examined whether distinct sport-specific tracks in these programs promote early specialization or early diversification.

The study population included 1,332 students from 12 schools across Poland. Of enrolled students, 547 participated in sport-based physical education programs and 785 attended traditional physical education programs.

The male students in the sport-based physical education group were divided into four sports categories: basketball, track and field, soccer, and volleyball. Similarly, female students were divided into three sports categories: basketball, track and field, and volleyball.

The fundamental motor skill in sport (FUS) test was carried out to evaluate fundamental motor skill proficiency across six motor tasks, including hurdles, jumping rope, forward roll, ball bouncing, ball throwing and catching, and kicking and stopping a ball.

The study findings revealed insufficient fundamental motor skill proficiency in both groups. Although both groups showed low proficiency, students in sport-based programs performed significantly better across all tasks. Nevertheless, most students in both groups remained at an insufficient level. They were less likely to fall into the insufficient category than those in traditional programs.

In the sport-based physical education group, a small proportion of students exhibited an excellent level of proficiency, and a significantly higher proportion of students exhibited good or elementary level proficiency compared to those in the traditional physical education group.

The study revealed that the analyzed physical education programs primarily focus on sport-specific skill development rather than improving overall fundamental motor skill proficiency. This indicates these programs tend to exhibit characteristics consistent with early specialization within sport-based physical education programs.

The study reveals that students attending sport-based and traditional physical education programs in schools in Poland have alarmingly low levels of fundamental motor skill proficiency. This is a matter of critical concern, given the substantial impact of childhood fundamental motor skill proficiency on overall physical and mental well-being in adolescence and adulthood. The study also highlights that sport-based physical education programs are more closely associated with early specialization than early diversification.

The study identifies good or excellent motor skill proficiency in only around 14% of boys (12.6% good and 1.2% excellent) and 6% of girls (5.6% good and 0.5% excellent) in sport-specialized physical education programs. This finding raises concerns about the developmental adequacy of these programs as early talent pathways and the efficiency of early specialization models in improving overall fundamental motor skills.

By analyzing motor skills in participants involved in distinct sport activities, the study finds that basketball players exhibit strong performance in ball bouncing, soccer players excel in kicking and stopping the ball, and track and field students perform best in hurdles and forward rolls. Volleyball participants showed relatively stronger performance in throwing and catching. However, as shown in comparative analysis, these sport-specialized groups tended to underperform in other tasks outside their primary sport.

These findings indicate that repeated practice of a specific set of tasks may facilitate isolated skill development; however, such sport-specific training approaches may not improve overall fundamental motor skills, which are necessary for long-term talent development and physical fitness.     

The study enrolled students from a specific nationwide sport education program in Poland, which may restrict the generalizability of its findings. The study did not measure participants' physical characteristics, such as body mass index and stature, which may potentially influence motor development.

Future studies should consider these potential confounders and adopt a longitudinal study design to evaluate the effect of different training approaches, particularly those focusing on early specialization or diversification, on fundamental motor skill development and long-term physical activity behaviors.

A tightly controlled clinical trial reveals that ultra-processed foods not only drive weight gain and worsen cholesterol levels but also impact reproductive hormones and sperm health, highlighting harms that extend beyond calories alone.



Study: Effect of ultra-processed food consumption on male reproductive and metabolic health. Image Credit: Rimma Bondarenko / Shutterstock

In a recent article in the journal Cell Metabolism, researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate whether ultra-processed foods (UPFs) harm reproductive and metabolic health. They found that UPF-rich diets increased unhealthy cholesterol levels, fat mass, and body weight. These diets also altered hormones related to reproduction and metabolism. Sperm motility showed a non-significant downward trend after multiple-testing correction compared with unprocessed diets.

UPFs have become a significant part of diets worldwide, accounting for more than half of daily energy intake in countries such as Canada, Australia, the UK, and the USA.

These foods, classified as NOVA category 4, are made from highly processed or synthetic ingredients. They are high in added sugars, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates, but low in fiber. Beyond poor nutritional value, UPFs may expose consumers to contaminants like phthalates. These can leach from packaging or processing, disrupt hormonal balance, and potentially harm reproductive and metabolic functions.

Epidemiological studies link UPF consumption with obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and mental health problems. While prior research has examined cardiometabolic outcomes, far fewer studies have explored reproductive effects. 

There is evidence of a global decline in sperm count, around 60% since the 1970s. Factors such as higher body weight, poor dietary fat intake, and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may contribute. UPFs are likely to play a role. 

Previous randomized trials have confirmed that UPFs increase calorie intake by 500–800 kcal/day compared to unprocessed diets; however, it remains unclear whether adverse outcomes result from excess calories alone or the inherent properties of UPFs.

In this study, researchers directly compared unprocessed and UPF diets at both adequate and excess calorie levels. They recruited 43 men to participate in a dual-arm, 2 × 2 crossover study with a 12-week washout period.

Each participant received both an unprocessed and a UPF-rich diet for 3 weeks at either a calorically adequate or excess level, with the diet order randomized. Both diets were similar in macronutrient composition, but UPFs contained more saturated fat, cholesterol, refined grains, and sugar, and less fiber. After seven study visits, participants underwent anthropometrics, Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans, blood draws, and semen collection.

Semen quality was assessed within 90 minutes, while blood and plasma were analyzed for biochemical, hormonal, inflammatory, and pollutant markers using standardized assays and mass spectrometry. Data were evaluated with mixed linear models that adjusted for diet order and multiple testing.

The UPF diet resulted in significant weight gain (approximately 1.3–1.4 kg) and an increase in fat mass (approximately 1 kg) in both calorie arms, primarily due to weight loss during the unprocessed diet.

Cholesterol levels and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) rose with UPF intake, in the adequate-calorie arm only, while diastolic blood pressure increased in the excess-calorie arm only.

Hormonal changes included lower growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) and a trend toward higher leptin in the excess-calorie arm, and T3 and TSH trends upward in the adequate-calorie arm. Reproductive effects were notable, with the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) decreasing in the excess calorie arm and testosterone showing a downward trend in the adequate arm, while sperm motility tended to decline but was not statistically significant.

Exposure to environmental pollutants also shifted in relation to diet. UPF intake decreased lithium and mercury in blood and semen, while slightly raising serum levels of a phthalate metabolite (cxMINP). Both experimental diets were cleaner than participants' habitual diets, leading to lower overall pollutant exposure, though UPFs still introduced specific harmful compounds.

Mental health markers were essentially unchanged, though depression scores trended upward with UPFs. 

Inflammatory markers showed minor shifts, with relative to baseline, the unprocessed diet showing a transient pro-inflammatory signature in lean participants (higher IFN-γ and CRP, lower IL-4); however, versus UPF, the unprocessed diet increased IL-4 and tended to reduce MCP-1, while CRP was unchanged.

This trial showed that UPFs negatively affect cardiometabolic and reproductive health, even when calorie intake is controlled. Participants consuming UPFs gained more weight and fat mass, had higher LDL:HDL cholesterol ratios, and showed hormonal shifts linked to energy balance and reproduction, including reduced FSH and altered GDF-15.

Importantly, these effects were not fully explained by calorie load, suggesting that calories from UPFs and unprocessed foods are metabolized differently. 

Trends in pollutant accumulation were also observed, with increased levels of certain phthalates after UPF intake, which may contribute to cardiovascular, reproductive, and mood-related effects. 

This report presents secondary outcomes only; the trial's primary endpoint (sperm DNA methylation) will be reported separately.

Overall, the study supports reducing UPF consumption to promote metabolic, reproductive, and mental health. However, limitations include reliance on self-reported adherence, a relatively short intervention period, and possible transient effects that may differ with longer-term diets.

With a simple swish of his right boot on Sunday, Folarin Balogun provided a timely reminder of what he can do.

The 24-year-old had motored up the field early in the second half in Monaco's game against Strasbourg and found himself in the right position to convert a quick break with his first goal of the Ligue 1 season.

After just four goals over an injury-ravaged campaign last time round, it was an important early milestone this term — and will maybe have eased Mauricio Pochettino's concerns about his goalscoring options with the United States men's national team.

Balogun's initial hold-up play then clever flick to team-mate Lamine Camara in his own half was pivotal in the goal, Monaco's second of the game; as was the striker's pace to collect the subsequent pass then surge into the Strasbourg penalty area before drawing the keeper and finishing.

Ce ballon piqué de @balogun 🥵

3️⃣-2️⃣ #ASMRCSA pic.twitter.com/Hwkwa0StKr

— AS Monaco 🇲🇨 (@AS_Monaco) September 1, 2025



Monaco eventually won the game 3-2 with a late injury-time goal, and Balogun lasted 90 minutes to provide a further boost as he heads to the United States for this month's friendlies.

He was only called into the squad late after Brian White damaged a hamstring playing for Vancouver Whitecaps but, if he was feeling disgruntled by that initial omission, at least Balogun — who was first choice in the 2024 Copa America — will bring some momentum with him when he links up.

Pochettino will need that as he bids to raise the mood around his prospects ahead of a crucial year.

His decision not to select Haji Wright, who has scored four goals in four games for Coventry City in the English Championship this season (his latest coming in a draw with Oxford on Saturday), perhaps raised eyebrows. Although Josh Sargent has also started the season in fine form for Norwich City — it's five in four for him after a double on Saturday — the latter hasn't scored for his country in six years.

Wright's omission is a calculated risk.

Pochettino could do with a result in the games against South Korea and Japan to dispel doubts over his tenure and, instead of selecting a player in form that he knows, he has opted for a closer look at Southampton's Damion Downs (no goals in three club appearances so far) and Alex Zendejas, who is not an outright striker and has only one in six games for Liga MX side America.

Only the next few weeks will tell whether he has made the right call, but Balogun's flicker of form ahead of the camp will be welcome.

One player Pochettino knows he can rely on to deliver, when he makes himself available, is Christian Pulisic.

The 26-year-old says he's done adding fuel to the fire over his war of words with former USMNT greats this summer, and is doing his talking on the field again for Milan.

His goal ensured their season is up and running after that dismal opening day loss to Cremonese, as he made it 2-0 against Lecce on Friday.

He started on the bench, with reports suggesting a flare-up of his ankle issue, and only came on after 75 minutes. Pulisic doesn't need long to show his class, though, and he seized on on a defensive error before firing a precise left-footed effort home.

He has another high-profile new attacking team-mate to bounce off when domestic action resumes too, with Milan having completed the signing of Christopher Nkunku from Chelsea on a permanent deal.

If Milan manager Massimo Allegri got a kick from Pulisic's late goal, he also dished one out of his own.

The eccentric Italian aimed a gentle kick at Yunus Musah, presumably urging him to get up, as the New Yorker rolled about in the technical area after a collision during the game.

Perfectly normal interaction between Allegri and Musah…  pic.twitter.com/d74YrlVAW1

— Tactical Manager (@ManagerTactical) August 31, 2025



It appeared good-natured and Musah barely flinched, as he played the full game against Lecce despite being on the brink of a loan move to Atalanta.

Let's hope it wasn't his parting gesture to the USMNT midfielder, who was undergoing a medical on Monday ahead of that move to Bergamo.

The 22-year-old has 47 USMNT caps but could benefit from a change of scene after being left off the roster for this month's friendlies.

Pochettino, meanwhile, was a guest on Fox's Big Noon Kickoff in Columbus on Saturday, chatting to presenter Rob Stone before the midday start of the weekend's first college football game.

Also on the panel was former USMNT international Alexi Lalas, who wasted little time making it all about him.

After some stilted chat between Stone and Pochettino about how thrilled he was to be there, Lalas took the mic and embarked on a WWE-style monologue about Columbus' sporting pedigree, then mock-searched for a U.S. flag, found one and hoisted it over his head to chants of “USA, USA”.

— Big Noon Kickoff (@BNKonFOX) August 30, 2025



A penny for Poch's thoughts. Perhaps he might consider inviting Lalas into the dressing room as hype-man before the South Korea game. That would make for some interesting fly-on-the-wall footage.

Tyler Adams was in sparkling form for Bournemouth as they beat Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.

Adams was a big part in a disciplined win, and helped Bournemouth see the victory out with a bit of savvy time-wasting that earned him a booking. His typical defensive solidity built the platform for Andoni Iraola's men to make it back-to-back wins in the Premier League, and end Tottenham's unbeaten start to the domestic campaign.

Over in Germany, Malik Tillman recovered from injury to make his belated bow for new team Bayer Leverkusen, and did so in style.

Tillman, 23, joined the German club for €32million (£27.7m; $37.5m) from Dutch champions PSV in the summer and scored Leverkusen's second goal in their 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen — a result that admittedly was not good enough to keep manager Erik ten Hag in a job.

Speaking to The Athletic afterwards he said: “The World Cup is just under a year away, so it's still a lot of time. I have to stay sharp. I have to stay focused. And then just be consistent over the season.”

In Eindhoven, there was an uncomfortable lesson for Tillman's former PSV team-mates, who were reminded that things don't always run to script (i.e. turning up and hammering whatever opponents are in front of you). The reigning Eredivisie champions suffered a shock 2-0 home defeat at the hands of lowly Telstar.

Upsets don't get much bigger than that in the Dutch top flight, and the full return of Ricardo Pepi can't come soon enough for manager Peter Bosz or, indeed, Pochettino. The USMNT striker at least played 45 minutes on his second run-out of the season since knee surgery in the summer.

Sergino Dest was on form too — he completed the most dribbles in the game, won the most fouls and highest number of duels, according to Opta — but he could not make the difference.

Among the celebrating away team was goalkeeper Ronald Koeman Junior, son of Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman. In other ‘sons of iconic players' news, Jonathan Klinsmann, on the back of his call-up to the September roster, conceded a 91st-minute goal as his team Cesena drew with Virtus Entella in Italy's Serie B.

Finally the upward trajectory keeps going for Chris Richards at Crystal Palace. The Eagles pulled off an impressive 3-0 win against Aston Villa on Sunday, with Richards as ever part of Oliver Glasner's three-man defence.

It is, of course, the international break but there is plenty to look forward to when European action resumes.

See if Tillman can build on his first goal for Leverkusen as they take on Eintracht Frankfurt in Bundesliga on Friday September 12 (2:30pm, ESPN +). Also in Germany, things are going well for Kristoffer Lund on loan at FC Koln, with two wins in two Bundesliga games. He will be back in action the following day against Kevin Paredes' Wolfsburg (Saturday September 13, 9:30am, ESPN +).

Also that morning watch Adams and Bournemouth against Brighton (10am, Peacock Premium) and at the same time, same channel, Richards and Palace face Sunderland.

Weston McKennie's ups and downs continue at Juventus. He was benched for their 1-0 win at Genoa on Sunday, has played a grand total of two minutes for his team in their opening two games, but let's see if he can get more against Inter Milan on the Saturday (12pm, Paramount +).

When Chelsea won the FIFA Club World Cup in July, the players were joined for the trophy lift by US President Donald Trump. Cameras caught the awkward glances as Trump refused to leave for the celebrations, painting an absurd but telling picture.

Trump had attended the match as the guest of Gianni Infantino, President of the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA). His attendance shows how FIFA has become a venue where global politics is conducted, and is often a player in its own right.

The global football body has also broken free of European governance. After decades of clashes with EU regulators and courts, massive injections of Saudi and Qatari cash have allowed FIFA to cut its reliance on the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and cast off European oversight.

“I do feel the Club World Cup was a game-changer,” Miguel Delaney, author of the book States of Play and chief football writer at The Independent, told The Parliament. “It feels like it's autocratic states who just get to use football for political purposes.”

The story of football in the past few years resembles the story of the global economy writ large: Europe's shrinking economic heft has diminished its ability to set the global rules, business and politics have moved closer together, power and wealth have been centralised — and Donald Trump is stood in the middle, grinning.

FIFA's power used to be balanced by UEFA, which manages many of the world's top clubs, leagues and players. This provided a platform for the European institutions to influence global football through the application of labour law and competition rules.

A series of rulings by the EU Court of Justice reshaped football governance from around 1995, when the landmark Bosman ruling ensured free transfers for out-of-contract players, fundamentally changing the labour market. The Meca-Medina case of 2006 confirmed that sporting rules could fall under EU competition law, giving the European Commission unprecedented leverage over football governance.

In December 2023, the Court of Justice found that FIFA and UEFA's authorisation rules for new competitions, in this case the highly controversial European Super League, breached EU competition law.

Most recently, in October 2024, the Court ruled in Diarra v FIFA that certain transfer restrictions unlawfully limited players' freedom of movement, disproportionately curtailing already short careers. 

Stephen Weatherill, emeritus Jacques Delors professor of European law at Oxford University, said that FIFA had chafed against these restrictions and tried to minimise compliance. “Even when these few cases are decided by the Court of Justice, FIFA is really good at delaying reform and minimising reform,” he told The Parliament. “Court of Justice decisions … bring about change only slowly and only in a fairly ad-hoc kind of way.”

Even after 2024's Diarra ruling, the global players' union FIFPRO continues to support the player after what it described as “unsuccessful settlement negotiations with FIFA.”

“FIFA's continued resistance nearly a year after losing at Europe's highest court is only one of many examples that indicate the systemic problems we currently face,” a representative FIFPRO Europe told The Parliament. 

FIFA is built on a contradiction: it is both a regulator and a business. The conflict was most visible in this year's massive expansion of the Club World Cup to a multi-stage competition with 32 teams. FIFA held talks with FIFPRO about fixture congestion and player fatigue, but nonetheless ended up pressing ahead with the expansion.

“The situation is intrinsically complex. It's almost a Gordian knot, knowing that FIFA is both judge and party in a given case,” Stefaan Van den Bogaert, professor of European Law and director of the Europa Institute at Leiden University, told The Parliament.

As FIFA has come to resemble a giant global business, it has become even less welcoming of European regulatory oversight. “For an institution or a president like Infantino, who only wants to talk to other world leaders, getting a slap in the face from a regional court like the Court of Justice is not something that they are all too happy about,” Van den Bogaert said.

The global governing body has therefore turned to a new set of allies to reduce its reliance on UEFA. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, was a sponsor of the Club World Cup.

PIF was also represented at the tournament by Al Hilal, one of the four Saudi clubs it owns. The TV rights were held exclusively by UK-based streamer DAZN, in which PIF recently acquired a $1 billion minority stake.

In late 2023, FIFA awarded Saudi Arabia the 2034 World Cup unopposed. An investigation by The New York Times suggested that Infantino had personally played a major role in that decision.

The newly entrepreneurial streak has led to FIFA being labelled “a disrupter more than a regulator,” said Delaney. For a body long suspected of corruption, including a well documented 2015 scandal, the shift raises uncomfortable questions about its power and who holds it to account.

Petros Mavroidis, a professor of foreign and comparative law at Columbia University, said that FIFA's opaque rules and weak oversight had allowed this influence to take shape. “The moment the rules of the game are crystal clear, then autocratic and sovereign wealth funds will have to play the game by the book,” he told The Parliament. “The big problem is the total absence of accountability.”

The benefits flow both ways. FIFA enjoys the backing of states and sovereign wealth funds willing to bankroll its ambitions without demanding much in the way of regulatory oversight. That means less reliance on UEFA, and less accountability to the EU.

For their part, FIFA's new backers get to increase their soft power and wash their image. The Saudi PIF bought English club Newcastle United while the kingdom was still under heavy criticism over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

Qatar hosted the 2022 World Cup following a cash-for-votes scandal and the country's influence permeates European football. Nasser Al-Khelaifi is chairman of the government-run Qatari Sports Investments (QSI) and also sits as the president of the QSI-owned Paris Saint Germain and as chairman of the European Club Association, the voice of Europe's top clubs.

Football clubs could in theory push back against FIFA's initiatives, rejecting the burden of extra tournaments by simply not participating. But the top clubs are no longer community-based groups of local players; they are international businesses worth billions of dollars, and managed accordingly. More tournaments mean more revenue streams.

“The clubs basically have the power to reshape the game, because they know that's where most of the interest lies,” Delaney said. “But essentially FIFA co-opted them with this Club World Cup.”

Unlike clubs, players cannot simply walk away. An ever-expanding calendar means more bonuses and prize money, but also raises the risks of burnout, injury, and careers being cut short.

“Shouldn't we think about how many days a player should take off? We kill players now by adding one competition after the other. Shouldn't they have a minimum days of rest? All of these things you have in a CBA [collective bargaining agreement]. I think this is to me where the change should happen,” said Mavroidis.

The EU has aimed to address these issues. A report on how EU policies can shape the European Sport Model is going through the European Parliament, with provisions designed to promote collective governance, athletes' rights and fans' voices.

The European Commission has joined social dialogue meetings with the European Professional Football Leagues (EPFL), the European Club Association (ECA) and FIFPRO, chaired by UEFA. This dialogue has resulted in standard contract levels for players, among other changes — but the results remain limited to Europe.

In US sports, CBAs have forced leagues to negotiate with players' unions on salaries, rest days and workload. Global football has no such framework, leaving FIFPRO with limited leverage over FIFA. Rumblings about player strikes have taken place, but no action has yet been taken and players' welfare remains secondary to FIFA's commercial ambitions.

Some observers believe that the EU can and should still exert power over FIFA by setting and enforcing clear legislation.

“We need legislation standards setting out systematically how sports governing bodies should behave and how they should be structured and how should they represent all affected interests,” said Weatherill. “If the EU establishes standards, many of those are going to spill over and be adopted as global standards, not just European standards.”

“It would generate an awful lot of political capital for the EU if it did this and it did it well,” he added. “But it's not going to happen anytime soon, I'm realistic about that.”

The Parliament reached out to the European Commission for comment but had not heard back at the time of publication.

European attempts to regulate FIFA could also draw opposition from other footballing countries around the world, said Van den Bogaert. “To adopt such a regulation, you will need to have the majority of the member states going for it and I'm not sure whether this will be feasible,” he said.

But with growing pressure on players and the centralisation of power, football governance could be heading for a collision. “I think it's underestimated what a fragile and likely transformative stage of football history we're at, where you have all these factors coming together,” Delaney said. “I think we're at the brink of a huge change.”

A concerning surge in malicious domain registrations designed to exploit the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup, with threat actors already positioning themselves more than a year before the tournament begins.

A comprehensive investigation by PreCrime Labs, the threat research division of BforeAI, has revealed that cybercriminals are systematically registering fraudulent domains to capitalize on the massive global interest surrounding the FIFA World Cup 2026. 

The research, conducted in August 2025, analyzed 498 suspicious domains containing FIFA, football, and World Cup-related terminology, exposing a sophisticated pre-positioning strategy by malicious actors.

The findings emerged from observations during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 held in the United States, which served as a preview of the cyber threats expected during the larger 2026 World Cup tournament. 

This upcoming event, scheduled to be hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, represents an unprecedented target for cybercriminals due to its massive scale and global audience.

The research revealed a disturbing trend: threat actors are registering domains well in advance of major sporting events, allowing these malicious websites to “age” and appear more legitimate by the time they launch their attacks. 

Some domains have already been registered for FIFA tournaments scheduled as far out as 2030 and 2034, demonstrating the long-term planning involved in these criminal enterprises.

The investigation uncovered several alarming patterns in domain registration activity. A significant spike occurred between August 8-12, 2025, when approximately 299 domains were registered in just five days. 

The most popular registrars facilitating these registrations included GoDaddy.com LLC, Namecheap Inc., Gname.com Pte. Ltd., Dynadot Inc., and Wix.

Domain analysis revealed specific targeting strategies, with 173 domains containing “FIFA,” 212 incorporating “football,” and 129 using “worldcup” terminology. 

Particularly concerning is the geographic targeting, with 23 domains specifically referencing host cities including Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Texas.

The research identified multiple threat categories that fans and businesses should be aware of. Merchandise fraud represents the largest category, with 56 domains designed to sell counterfeit World Cup merchandise such as jerseys, scarves, and other fan gear. 

These fake storefronts typically collect payment without delivering goods or provide low-quality counterfeit items.

Illegal streaming services constitute another major threat vector, with 55 domains promising free or “official” access to World Cup matches. 

These platforms often serve as delivery mechanisms for malware, credential theft, or subscription scams targeting unsuspecting fans seeking to watch games online.

The gambling sector shows significant exploitation, with 32 domains incorporating betting, slot, or casino terminology. One of the websites uses the common “generator scam” format often seen in gaming cheats, free currency, or airdrops. 

These sites often operate without proper licensing and frequently serve as fronts for financial fraud or money laundering operations.

The domain analysis revealed sophisticated evasion techniques employed by threat actors. The majority of malicious domains use .com extensions (58.9%), followed by .online (7.1%) and .football (4.7%), with attackers deliberately choosing a mix of legitimate-appearing and low-cost disposable domain extensions to avoid detection.

Typosquatting represents a particularly insidious tactic, with domains like “fifaworldcupstadiucom” (missing the “m”) and “fifaclubwccom” (missing the dot) designed to capture users who make typing errors when searching for official FIFA content. 

These domains can redirect visitors to malicious sites or collect personal information through fake login pages.

The research uncovered evidence of sophisticated targeting strategies tailored to specific regions and languages. 

Multiple domains feature Chinese-language content and Pinyin-style constructions, indicating targeted campaigns toward Chinese-speaking audiences. 

Additionally, Spanish-language domains align with Mexico's role as a host country, suggesting attackers are customizing their approaches based on the tournament's international scope.

Perhaps most concerning is the discovery of domains registered for tournaments years in the future, with 41 domains specifically mentioning 2026, 10 referencing 2030, and one targeting 2034. 

This long-term approach allows cybercriminals to establish seemingly legitimate web presence over time, making their eventual malicious activities more difficult to detect and more likely to succeed.

The cryptocurrency angle adds another layer of complexity, with several domains promoting fake “FIFA coin” initial coin offerings (ICOs) and staking opportunities. 

These schemes typically display fabricated statistics showing millions in staked funds and hundreds of thousands of participating wallets to create false legitimacy.

Security experts recommend that FIFA, official sponsors, and host cities implement proactive domain monitoring systems to track suspicious registrations using event-related keywords. 

Defensive domain registration across known malicious top-level domains could help prevent brand abuse and protect fans from fraud.

Fans are advised to only purchase tickets through official FIFA channels and verified partners, avoid unofficial streaming platforms, and be extremely cautious of unsolicited messages or advertisements related to the World Cup. 

The combination of brand recognition, emotional investment, and limited availability makes FIFA World Cup-related scams particularly effective and financially damaging.

As the 2026 World Cup approaches, this early intelligence serves as a crucial warning that the cybersecurity landscape surrounding major sporting events continues to evolve, requiring unprecedented vigilance from organizers, sponsors, and fans alike.

With just hours remaining in the transfer window, Eintracht Frankfurt are reportedly on the verge of breaking their transfer record.

According to the Daily Mail, the Bundesliga side are close to agreeing a €35 million deal for Newcastle United forward William Osula, which would include a buyback option for the Premier League club.

Frankfurt's current record signing is Hugo Ekitiké, who cost €31.5 million including add-ons when he joined from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2024. He moved on to Liverpool for €95 million this summer.

Osula, 22, has scored three goals in 22 appearances for Newcastle since his €11.6 million move from Sheffield United last summer.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Home › Soccer › FIFA › A look at what's left in the sports rights marketplace

2YWK52A File photo dated 18-12-2022 of A general view of the FIFA World Cup Trophy. Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, with Spain, Portugal and Morocco confirmed as the principal co-hosts of the 2030 tournament, FIFA has announced. Issue date: Wednesday December 11, 2024.

With UFC off the market and MLB poised to wrap up negotiations on ESPN's expiring package, the U.S. sports television rights marketplace will soon quiet down. But there are still notable properties on the market. SMW contributor Jessie Karangu takes a look at what's left and the potential favorites.

After the United States hosts the World Cup for the first time in 32 years next summer, rights to soccer's biggest tournament will be up for grabs beginning in 2030 — and there is no telling how much the 2026 Cup could help increase the popularity of soccer in the United States. Here is a look at the contenders.

Paramount/CBS: Under David Ellison, Paramount has already shown that it is not afraid to spend money for content that will help their streaming service accrue value. Paramount+ is already home to numerous leagues around the world and counts UEFA Champions League games as one of its biggest pillars. Adding the World Cup would make Paramount+ a must have for every soccer fan if it wasn't already.

FOX: The incumbent has not only been the exclusive English-language home of the World Cup and Women's World Cup since 2015, it also carries an annual ‘summer of soccer' — featuring various worldwide tournaments over the years such as Copa America, the Gold Cup and Euro — that has garnered solid ratings during time slots that would normally be filled with syndicated programming. It is the sole English language linear rights holder of MLS games and has a new streaming service, Fox One, that is focused on live events. Fox seems like a network FIFA would be happy to continue doing business with. It is clear that even outside of World Cup years, Fox is invested in promoting soccer in the United States. 

NBC: Peacock has been one of the biggest streaming beneficiaries of live sports. 1.79 million people signed up for the service after the 2024 Olympics, according to Antenna. The streamer has already carried World Cup matches thanks to NBCU owning Spanish language rights via Telemundo. Purchasing the English language rights would give soccer fans another reason to subscribe and could help the service retain viewers who may otherwise drop out after the NFL and NBA seasons.

DAZN/TNT Sports: FIFA recently signed an expansive deal with DAZN to launch a 24/7 streaming network dedicated to FIFA soccer and initiatives. This comes after DAZN served as the main broadcaster of the FIFA Club World Cup. Could FIFA reward DAZN for believing in the Club World Cup concept that was initially panned by many soccer fans? DAZN sublicensed CWC games to TNT Sports and in a recent discussion with Sportico, president Walker Jacobs expressed interest in co-bidding on upcoming sports rights.

Netflix: As a future rightsholder of the 2027 and 2031 Women's World Cup, it would make sense to take on the men's tournament to create a yearly behavioral pattern and become an official hub for international soccer. Just as Netflix is doing with the Women's World Cup, the service could explore a documentary following the sport's top players leading into the tournament and fuel even more anticipation before the world's nations face off.  

Amazon: While the streamer's only investment in soccer stateside is the NWSL, Prime Video is a major force to be reckoned with overseas. In the United Kingdom, it owns the rights to the UEFA Champions League as well as World Cup qualifiers and the UEFA Nations League. Given its experience in broadcasting world class soccer, could Prime Video step in to broadcast the beautiful game in the States? With 181 million subscribers and more sports fans becoming accustomed to the platform with NFL and NBA coverage, no streamer has a greater foothold in live sports.

Apple: Despite its reputation for ingenuity, the tech giant has struggled to become a behemoth in the sports media world. Its MLS Season Pass streaming service has been a disappointment with only an average of 120,000 unique viewers per game and one could question whether it will recoup its $2.5 billion investment any time soon. A rights package with FIFA would immensely boost their soccer streaming service and it would provide a great transition for the MLS as newfound World Cup fans will look for the soccer dopamine they'll be missing once the tournament is over.

As part of the NFL's deal to acquire a 10 percent stake in ESPN, the league was able to free up rights to four regular season games that previously aired on NFL Network to potentially re-sell to the marketplace in 2026. Here are some possible contenders:

YouTube: Google's video giant has shown major interest in live sporting events. It is airing this year's Week 1 game from Brazil, owns rights to Sunday Ticket, and has a live sports history with MLB games. As another way to make its offering even sweeter for sports fans and to promote paid services such as Primetime Channels and YouTube TV, it could make sense for the streamer to pick up a couple of more games during the season. 

Apple: A soon to be announced deal with F1, an MLB Friday night package and an MLS streaming service are the pillars of Apple's sports offerings. Based on the glance we recently got into the MLS' ratings, it's clear that sports fans have not been clamoring to subscribe to Apple TV+ for games. A tandem of NFL games could help draw some new attention and exposure to the sports Apple provides for fans throughout the year and forges a deeper connection between Apple and the league. Apple is currently the Super Bowl halftime show sponsor.

Fox/CBS: The league's Sunday afternoon schedule has been spliced and diced in so many ways over the years and the two broadcasters who have had to pay the biggest price are Fox and CBS. The league is a small stakeholder in CBS now and is a long-time partner of Fox. It may make sense to just send these games back to CBS and Fox to enhance their Sunday afternoon lineups, which are the highest rated NFL windows of the week.

Both networks have a history of spending extra money to secure more NFL inventory. Before its current run on Amazon Prime, “Thursday Night Football” previously aired on both CBS and Fox while CBS has paid for extra playoff games in the past. As Puck's Matt Belloni also points out, the league wants bidding for their games to stay competitive. To ensure traditional TV companies are thriving and tech companies are kept at bay from desiring too much control, it makes sense to continue providing as many quality games to CBS and Fox as possible.

NBC: When Peacock aired an exclusive playoff game in 2024, 2.8 million people signed up for the app, according to Antenna. As mentioned before, Peacock understands the power live sports can have for a streaming service. The streamer has struggled to achieve profitability and may feel a financial crunch as its NBA deal goes into effect. This could be an easier way to expand their sports palette without breaking the bank. NFL games don't come cheap though. In 2024, Amazon paid $120 million for one playoff game.

The second leg of horse racing's Triple Crown is signed to NBC through 2026. The race itself is undergoing changes and will be run in Laurel, Maryland rather than Baltimore in NBC's final year as Pimlico Racecourse gets a makeover. The new deal would begin under the first year of the track's transformation.

FOX: As a major stakeholder in FanDuel's parent company, Fox has a lot of interest in horse racing. Initially, discussions with Barstool's Dave Portnoy and Fox centered around horse racing coverage — not college football, according to Puck's John Ourand. It already owns the rights to the Belmont Stakes. Adding the Preakness would give Fox the chance to own horse racing in case a potential Triple Crown winner was in the realm of possibility.

NBC: After a recent decision to move the Kentucky Oaks to primetime, it is clear NBC is interested in maximizing its horse racing content to the fullest extent. Re-signing a deal for the Preakness gives NBC the opportunity to potentially move the second leg of the Triple Crown to primetime and make horse racing even more of a national pastime.

The National Women's Soccer League has a chance to re-evaluate its TV situation after the 2027 season. With the additions of Denver and Boston, the league is only getting bigger, and with WNBA rights off the board, it may be the best option for TV networks and tech companies looking to invest in women's sports.

Incumbents: Each of the rightsholders that are currently invested in the sport (ESPN, CBS, Ion, Amazon) have developed great rapport with league officials, working together to amplify the league — particularly in 2024 after Alex Morgan retired. The NWSL holds prominent spots in each network's sports lineup so it wouldn't be a surprise if what's old is new again.

Versant: In an interview with CNBC, Versant's sports president Matt Hong explained how a core strategy of the USA Network/Golf Channel owner was to populate women's sports on their platforms. It is already the home to LPGA golf and will air WNBA games beginning in 2026. NWSL seems like a natural fit. Players with the league could even participate in instructional videos that make up the foundation of their SportsEngine Play streaming service.

True, Fox has the bulk of prominent National Team competitions, but they currently hold La Liga, Bundesliga and other league rights so I wouldn't be so quick to write them off just yet.

Northern Ireland have lost only four of their past 15 games

Fifa World Cup qualifier: Luxembourg v Northern Ireland

Venue: Stade de Luxembourg, Luxembourg Date: Thursday, 4 September Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Watch live on BBC Two NI, BBC Three, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app

Such is the nature of the international football calendar that when Northern Ireland begin their efforts to make it to the 2026 World Cup against Luxembourg on Thursday it will be their first qualifying game in almost two years.

A 2-0 win over Denmark at Windsor Park in October 2023 was the last time Michael O'Neill's side faced such a fixture with their success over the Euro 2024-bound side proving to be something of an outlier in recent times. 

In the side's preceding 17 qualifiers, they enjoyed just four victories, a pair of wins over both San Marino and Lithuania. 

If that run of results across two qualifying campaigns appeared to herald the end of a golden era for the side during which they qualified for Euro 2016 and reached play-offs for the World Cup of 2018 and Euro 2020, then the changing face of the squad across the next 23 months hammered home the point.

Since that last qualifying fixture, Steven Davis, Stuart Dallas, Craig Cathcart and the Evans brothers, Jonny and Corry, have all retired from football. 

In their place, an exciting young core centred around Conor Bradley, Isaac Price, Shea Charles and Trai Hume has emerged to lead the side into a campaign that will see them take on Germany and Slovakia as well as Luxembourg.

""That game against Denmark was probably the start of it,"" said manager Michael O'Neill. 

""It was quite a young team that played that night and it was a really positive result for us after a challenging campaign for 2024 which brought a closure on a lot of players' careers at international level.

""Over the last two years, we've had to develop and grow a team. We've maybe put young players in at times when maybe it was a little bit early, but we felt that was the right thing to do. 

""Over the two years, I think that's proven to be the right thing to do and we have a group of players now that are still very young, still got a lot to achieve.""

Steven Davis and Jonny Evans are among those who have retired since the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign

When O'Neill returned to the post in December 2022, the idea that he would have to ""grow a team"" was likely not foremost in his thoughts.

But Dallas and Davis were both forced into earlier than anticipated retirement through injury while other senior players were plagued by unavailability too. 

Having been dealt the unwanted hand, the former Newcastle United midfielder has played it well. 

When exposing talented youngsters ""a little bit early"" to the rigours of international football there have been some harsh lessons, most notably a 5-1 defeat by Spain six weeks before La Roja won Euro 2024, and a loss to Sweden by the same scoreline in March on a night when Alexander Isak ran riot. 

In the main, though, the past two years have produced a vast improvement in results, many chiseled out through what could be termed typically O'Neill style performances. 

In a period of such transition, there is a sense that the returned manager has been the one constant. 

Having taken charge of the side on 96 occasions across his two spells, O'Neill is preparing for his fifth qualifying campaign as boss after an eight-year international career as a player. 

""I think any football situation, whether it's club or international, benefits from stability. I think that's an important thing"" he said.

""Obviously, the IFA, when I left, I'd been in position for eight years. Then to come back and commit myself for five years again is creating that stability.

""For a number of these players, they've had that consistency coming into international football. I think that's what gives us success.""

Northern Ireland will expect Conor Bradley to play a key role in the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign

Drawn in a four-team group, Northern Ireland have had to wait to get their campaign under way, but it begins now with two intriguing, if vastly different, tests.

Away to Luxembourg on Thursday brings them to the lowest-ranked side in the group but back to a ground where they threw away a two-goal lead to draw in November's Nations League meeting.

Just three days later they will face four-time World Cup winners Germany in Cologne, a fixture that will be used as a yardstick to measure how far they have come since those tough outings against Spain and Sweden.

Such are the margins with only six games to play, four points this week would have fans frantically searching for flights and accommodations options, while fewer than three will feel like the dream is over before it begins.

And while, given the age profile of the squad, there could be a sense that this qualifying campaign comes one cycle too early, O'Neill rejects the idea.

""For most of the players in this group, this will be their first chance to qualify for a World Cup,"" said O'Neill.

""The message will be, look, don't take it for granted because you've got to go another four years to wait for this opportunity to come around again,"" said O'Neill.

""Our aim is to make sure we're as competitive as possible. 

""We obviously know that Germany are massive favourites to win the group, but we have to believe whatever route there is to get to a World Cup in 2026, we try and do whatever we can through whatever route to make sure that we give ourselves the best chance.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Germany's road to 2026 World Cup begins: What to know","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-national-football-team-2026-world-cup-what-you-need-to-know/a-73794861","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 09:40:46 GMT","

The German national team has six games to play in 2025. The plan is to win them all and secure early qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but injuries and struggles against top teams cast something of a shadow.

Germany are in Group A of European World Cup qualifying for the 2026 World Cup where they are to face Slovakia, Northern Ireland and Luxembourg. Their campaign starts this September and will all be done and dusted by the middle of November, provided Germany meet their expectations and top the group. If they don't and finish second they will have to play in playoffs in March 2026.

First up is, Slovakia in Bratislava (September 4) and then Northern Ireland in Cologne (September 7). A month later, Germany host Luxembourg (October 10) and then travel to Belfast to play Northern Ireland (October 13). Finally in November, Germany don't have to go far to play Luxembourg away (November 14) and then host Slovakia in Leipzig (November 17) to finish off.

After a slow start, Germany have looked really bright under Julian Nagelsmann but they haven't been able to find a way past the top sides. In the Nations League, there was a feeling that the hosts missed a chance to replicate some of the football fever that swept across the nation at the European Championship in Germany in 2024. Undone by Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in a second half in which they crumbled, Germany then lost to France in the third-place playoff as the Final Four started the summer on the wrong foot.

However, after a break, and with a very manageable schedule ahead for the rest of 2025, the expectation is that Germany can get back in the groove and reignite the optimism around the team going into the World Cup next year. Much will lie on the shoulders of superstar and new Liverpool signing Florian Wirtz, who formed a brilliant partnership with Jamal Musiala at Euro 2024.

Germany are enduring one of their worst injury crises in recent memory. Musiala, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Kai Havertz, Tim Kleindienst, Nico Schlotterbeck, Benjamin Henrichs, Niklas Süle, and Tom Bischof are all unavailable. This is far from ideal for Nagelsmann, who is looking to increase understanding between his established group of players. However, it does present an opportunity for Germany's younger hopefuls to perhaps take an unexpected chance.

The squad for the games in September includes three new players, goalkeeper Finn Dahmen (Augsburg), defender Nnamdi Collins (Frankfurt), and midfielder Paul Nebel (Mainz). Collins is perhaps the most intriguing, given he can play in both central defense and right back. Nagelsmann recently stated that captain Joshua Kimmich will be playing in central midfield from here on out, opening up the right back spot.

Other youngsters such as Nathaniel Brown (Frankfurt), Max Rosenfelder (Freiburg) and Nicolas Kühn (Como) are in with a chance of being called up for October's games, providing they can overcome their injuries. Nagelsmann admitted the trio were on his list, but injury kept them out this time.

Even with the injuries Germany have going into the campaign, they are resounding favorites in all of their match-ups. Julian Nagelsmann's team is ranked ninth in the world. Slovakia are number 52, Northern Ireland 71 and Luxembourg 92. The ideal outcome is six wins, lots of goals and clarity about what the World Cup squad will look like.

""We are the favorites,"" Nagelsmann said in August. ""We have already set ourselves the goal of dominating the group. That means we can't allow any doubts to creep into our game. Unfortunately, that's what happened against Italy and Portugal. We want to build up momentum, and there's not much time left in the new year to do so. It's all about showing dominance.""

Do that and Germany will top the group and can spend December analyzing their World Cup opponents because on December 5, the draw for the group stage of the 2026 World Cup will take place.

As of September 1, qualified teams for the 48-team (up from 32 in Qatar) World Cup include Australia, Iran, Japan, South Korea, as well as debutants Jordan and Uzbekistan. Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador have booked their tickets from South America, while New Zealand are also in. With Mexico, Canada and the United States already qualified as hosts, their group allocation has already been decided. With Mexico playing in the opening game in the Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, Germany could be their opponent if they land in A2. If they are drawn in Group B, they will face Canada, and if they are drawn in Group D, they will face the United States.

A concerning surge in malicious domain registrations designed to exploit the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup, with threat actors already positioning themselves more than a year before the tournament begins.

A comprehensive investigation by PreCrime Labs, the threat research division of BforeAI, has revealed that cybercriminals are systematically registering fraudulent domains to capitalize on the massive global interest surrounding the FIFA World Cup 2026. 

The research, conducted in August 2025, analyzed 498 suspicious domains containing FIFA, football, and World Cup-related terminology, exposing a sophisticated pre-positioning strategy by malicious actors.

The findings emerged from observations during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 held in the United States, which served as a preview of the cyber threats expected during the larger 2026 World Cup tournament. 

This upcoming event, scheduled to be hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, represents an unprecedented target for cybercriminals due to its massive scale and global audience.

The research revealed a disturbing trend: threat actors are registering domains well in advance of major sporting events, allowing these malicious websites to “age” and appear more legitimate by the time they launch their attacks. 

Some domains have already been registered for FIFA tournaments scheduled as far out as 2030 and 2034, demonstrating the long-term planning involved in these criminal enterprises.

The investigation uncovered several alarming patterns in domain registration activity. A significant spike occurred between August 8-12, 2025, when approximately 299 domains were registered in just five days. 

The most popular registrars facilitating these registrations included GoDaddy.com LLC, Namecheap Inc., Gname.com Pte. Ltd., Dynadot Inc., and Wix.

Domain analysis revealed specific targeting strategies, with 173 domains containing “FIFA,” 212 incorporating “football,” and 129 using “worldcup” terminology. 

Particularly concerning is the geographic targeting, with 23 domains specifically referencing host cities including Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Texas.

The research identified multiple threat categories that fans and businesses should be aware of. Merchandise fraud represents the largest category, with 56 domains designed to sell counterfeit World Cup merchandise such as jerseys, scarves, and other fan gear. 

These fake storefronts typically collect payment without delivering goods or provide low-quality counterfeit items.

Illegal streaming services constitute another major threat vector, with 55 domains promising free or “official” access to World Cup matches. 

These platforms often serve as delivery mechanisms for malware, credential theft, or subscription scams targeting unsuspecting fans seeking to watch games online.

The gambling sector shows significant exploitation, with 32 domains incorporating betting, slot, or casino terminology. One of the websites uses the common “generator scam” format often seen in gaming cheats, free currency, or airdrops. 

These sites often operate without proper licensing and frequently serve as fronts for financial fraud or money laundering operations.

The domain analysis revealed sophisticated evasion techniques employed by threat actors. The majority of malicious domains use .com extensions (58.9%), followed by .online (7.1%) and .football (4.7%), with attackers deliberately choosing a mix of legitimate-appearing and low-cost disposable domain extensions to avoid detection.

Typosquatting represents a particularly insidious tactic, with domains like “fifaworldcupstadiucom” (missing the “m”) and “fifaclubwccom” (missing the dot) designed to capture users who make typing errors when searching for official FIFA content. 

These domains can redirect visitors to malicious sites or collect personal information through fake login pages.

The research uncovered evidence of sophisticated targeting strategies tailored to specific regions and languages. 

Multiple domains feature Chinese-language content and Pinyin-style constructions, indicating targeted campaigns toward Chinese-speaking audiences. 

Additionally, Spanish-language domains align with Mexico's role as a host country, suggesting attackers are customizing their approaches based on the tournament's international scope.

Perhaps most concerning is the discovery of domains registered for tournaments years in the future, with 41 domains specifically mentioning 2026, 10 referencing 2030, and one targeting 2034. 

This long-term approach allows cybercriminals to establish seemingly legitimate web presence over time, making their eventual malicious activities more difficult to detect and more likely to succeed.

The cryptocurrency angle adds another layer of complexity, with several domains promoting fake “FIFA coin” initial coin offerings (ICOs) and staking opportunities. 

These schemes typically display fabricated statistics showing millions in staked funds and hundreds of thousands of participating wallets to create false legitimacy.

Security experts recommend that FIFA, official sponsors, and host cities implement proactive domain monitoring systems to track suspicious registrations using event-related keywords. 

Defensive domain registration across known malicious top-level domains could help prevent brand abuse and protect fans from fraud.

Fans are advised to only purchase tickets through official FIFA channels and verified partners, avoid unofficial streaming platforms, and be extremely cautious of unsolicited messages or advertisements related to the World Cup. 

The combination of brand recognition, emotional investment, and limited availability makes FIFA World Cup-related scams particularly effective and financially damaging.

As the 2026 World Cup approaches, this early intelligence serves as a crucial warning that the cybersecurity landscape surrounding major sporting events continues to evolve, requiring unprecedented vigilance from organizers, sponsors, and fans alike.

After FIFA awarded the hosting rights for the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, that nation's government built seven stadiums and overhauled one existing venue for the competition. Naturally, there were no naming-rights deals or branded signage when FIFA arrived to dress the venues with its tournament branding and the logos of its corporate partners.

The situation heading into the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada is completely different. Fifteen of the 16 stadiums, none of which was built specifically for the World Cup, have long-term naming-rights agreements, and all of them are adorned with sponsor logos. If FIFA has its way, none of that will be visible next summer. 

The governing body's policy ensuring that all World Cup venues are free and clear of existing commercial branding during the tournament is long-standing, but the process of “cleaning” stadiums of marks and logos is a uniquely complex — and potentially costly — undertaking in North America. 

“It's quite the task — pretty Herculean to be honest,” said Drew Bryant, chief creative officer at Elevate, which has been subcontracted by The Look Company to help create FIFA's venue dressings for the tournament. “The naming-rights partnership signage is the biggest challenge.” 

The motivation behind FIFA's insistence on commercially clean venues is protecting the exclusivity for which its sponsors are paying handsomely. The governing body expects to generate $1.8 billion in revenue from the sale of marketing rights in 2026, almost all of which is associated with the men's World Cup. Industry sources have put the value of top-level FIFA Partner deals between $150 million and $200 million per four-year cycle, with tournament-specific designations costing as much as $100 million. 

“If they told Hyundai-Kia that they would be playing in and talking about Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hyundai-Kia wouldn't have paid what they paid,” said Ricardo Fort, founder of Sport by Fort Consulting and a longtime executive with FIFA partners Visa and Coca-Cola. “And that goes for every brand.”

Unlike the IOC, which for the first time is allowing for the sale of naming rights for Olympic venues in Los Angeles, FIFA is sticking with its policy of requiring that all World Cup venues be devoid of corporate names. MetLife Stadium, for example, which will host the final on July 19, will be known throughout the competition as New York New Jersey Stadium.

Many naming-rights deals, particularly those signed in recent years, have carve-outs for major events like the World Cup to ensure the stadium operators don't have to compensate those partners when an entity like FIFA takes over its venue. In some cases, however, events like the World Cup weren't considered when the deal was signed. 

“Generally speaking, there is a willingness [from the brands] to work [with the stadium operators] and an expectation for some level of compensation,” one World Cup venue official said of situations without an existing carve-out. 

Referring to the venues by FIFA's unbranded names is just the beginning. According to contracts reviewed by Sports Business Journal, stadium owners have promised to turn their venues over to FIFA “free and clear of any and all advertising, marketing, promotion, merchandising and brand identification.” This includes branding on “any stands, scoreboards, seats, seatbacks, time clocks, staff uniforms, accreditation passes, fences or elsewhere inside, surrounding or in the airspace above and around the stadium.” 

Logos for the teams and leagues that typically occupy the venues must also be removed (all 11 U.S. venues are primarily home to NFL teams). Any exception to these rules would have to be granted by FIFA. 

FIFA wasn't in a position to pursue the same level of de-branding for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup given the short time frame in which the event came together and the unproven nature of the newly expanded competition, sources familiar with hosting discussions said. It's also unlikely that many naming-rights deals would have included carve-out language broad enough to include the Club World Cup. FIFA didn't force the issue and even referred to the stadiums by their corporate names in its official materials.

FIFA tapped two companies — The Look Company and Wasserman Live (formerly Bluemedia) – to help execute the “Venue Dressing Programme” for next summer's World Cup. This involves developing the look and feel of the various World Cup venues and physically bringing it to life. The firms will each utilize subcontractors for various parts of the job, including height access specialists and engineers. 

This dressing program intersects directly with de-branding the stadiums, creating some gray area about how much of the bill FIFA, the host cities and the stadium owners will each have to cover. 

FIFA, host city and stadium officials are in agreement that the individual host committees and stadiums (depending on their relationship in each city) are responsible for the costs associated with cleaning the stadium of existing commercial signage. Meanwhile, a FIFA spokesperson said the governing body would cover certain branding elements through its own dressing program and coordinate with cities and stadiums to avoid duplicating costs.

Chris Canetti, president of the Houston 2026 World Cup Host Committee, said his committee is budgeting more than $1 million for the process of commercially cleaning NRG Stadium to meet FIFA's guidelines. That figure, however, is based on FIFA's dressing program doing a lot of the work and covering the expense.

“We've got some exterior signage to cover and probably some concourse stuff, but FIFA is going to do a lot of branding,” Canetti said. “FIFA is already decorating to make it look the way they need it to look in the service areas and the player tunnels and all that kind of stuff.”

Where de-branding ends and dressing begins will be key to determining how much of the financial burden will fall on each party. It's a critical issue given the struggles most host cities have had raising money through FIFA's host city supporters program.

“The biggest question here on a city-by-city basis is who's going to pay for the work,” Fort said. “A lot of them are looking at the event and thinking, ‘I have to ‘clean' the venue, I have to do a public viewing, I have to do decorate and dress up the city to promote the event, and I haven't sold enough sponsorships.'” 

The degree of difficulty and the cost of covering or removing commercial signage will vary considerably by venue. While some venues, particularly newer ones, feature more flexible digital signage, others are chock full of physical signage that will be difficult and costly to remove or hide. 

Adam Fullerton, vice president of stadium operations at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, estimated that there are around 2,000 commercial elements inside, outside and adjacent to the downtown Atlanta stadium that will need to be covered. Jacob Burke, president of The Look Company, also said some stadiums will have more than 2,000 individual items that need wrapping. 

One of the most complex tasks could be obscuring large-scale overhead signage seen only from above at six U.S. stadiums. In Seattle, for example, the words “Lumen Field” stretch more than 400 feet in length on each side of the canopy roof of the Seahawks' home stadium. Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, NRG Stadium in Houston, Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City and AT&T Stadium in Dallas also bear branding visible from the air. 

Perhaps the trickiest signage to cover is Atlanta's retractable roof aperture that closes into the Mercedes-Benz emblem. The roof is expected to be closed for the duration of the tournament to ensure uniform grass-growing conditions. Fullerton said Mercedes-Benz Stadium staff is looking at several options, including creating a vinyl graphic to cover the automaker's star emblem on the roof, but he admitted this would be an expensive solution.

“That's a problem,” Fullerton said, acknowledging the tension between keeping costs down and not wanting a cheap-looking fix.

One possibility explored was whether FIFA's production and broadcast partners could use virtual technology to remove that branding from aerial shots used during World Cup telecasts. Host city leaders who spoke with SBJ remained hopeful this could help keep de-branding costs down. A FIFA spokesperson, however, said that option has been ruled out, claiming the technology is not advanced enough to guarantee complete coverage in aerial shots.

The de-branding process will be easier at some venues. BC Place in Vancouver, for example, doesn't have a naming-rights sponsor, meaning there's less exterior branding that needs to be covered. At SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, an especially modern venue that opened in 2020, most branded displays are digital. This makes commercially cleaning the stadium much simpler. 

“One of the great things about SoFi stadium and our design is we were very intentional about creating the LED opportunities we have,” said Otto Benedict, senior vice president of facilities and campus operations for all of Hollywood Park. “That allows us to go from a Chargers game to a Rams game to a concert without a lot of branding. For us, the lift is not as heavy as it is with other stadiums.” 

Host cities and stadium operators are waiting for guidance from FIFA on the finer details of their obligations. How stringent the governing body will be in enforcing its clean venue policies — and how the cost burden is shared — remain major unanswered questions with the competition just over nine months away.

Only one of the 16 North American venues that will host the World Cup next year does not have a naming-rights deal: Vancouver's BC Place. The other 15 will each undergo a significant name change for the 39-day event.

Stan Sport will exclusively air all 144 remaining pool fixtures, as well as every play-off match.

Stan Sport, the streaming service of Australian commercial broadcaster Nine Network, has enhanced its soccer offering with rights to the European qualifiers for next year's 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Under the deal, Stan Sport will exclusively air all 144 remaining pool fixtures, as well as every play-off match scheduled for March 2026.

Stan's coverage starts on Friday (September 5) with four matches: Netherlands vs Poland, Slovakia vs Germany, Bulgaria vs Spain, and Liechtenstein vs Belgium.

The qualification format sees 48 teams divided into 12 groups of four, with nations playing each other home and away. The group winner will automatically qualify for the World Cup finals, with the remaining teams competing in play-offs.

Australia's public broadcaster SBS holds the exclusive rights to air the World Cup finals, set to be staged across the US, Canada, and Mexico, and will broadcast all 104 games of the tournament via its SBS and SBS Viceland channels and SBS On Demand streaming platform.

The European qualifiers are the latest soccer rights to be acquired by Stan, having recently secured exclusive rights to England's top-tier Premier League (EPL) and FA domestic cup as part of a sub-licensing agreement with Optus Sport, the streaming service of the Australian telecoms firm, which is divesting from its broadcast commitments.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

Along with taking over the remaining three years of Optus' current six-season contract for the EPL, that deal covers rights to Japan's J.League, South Korea's K League, and the United States' National Women's Soccer League.

Those were added to the broadcaster's rights to all European soccer's UEFA club competitions, including the top-tier Champions League, second-tier Europa League, third-tier Conference League, and UEFA Super Cup, as well as Germany's top knockout soccer competition, DFB-Pokal.

Last week, Stan continued its soccer rights spree with a new multi-year deal for England's top-tier Women's Super League.

The rights come after Nine Entertainment, the parent company of Nine and Stan, posted revenue of $2.7 billion and a net profit after tax of $133 million in the 2025 financial year.

Other rights in the country held by Nine include rugby union's English Premiership, the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, and SVNS; tennis' Davis Cup; and motor racing's Formula E, World Athletics Championships, and PFL mixed martial arts action.

Nine's streaming service Stan has further expanded its football offering, adding the European Qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup to its slate.

Starting on September 5th from 12am (AEST), the remaining 144 pool matches, plus every play-off match in March, will be available live and exclusive on Stan Sport.

The format sees 48 national teams divided into 12 groups of four, playing home and away fixtures against each opposition. The group winners earn automatic qualification for the World Cup, while the remaining teams will enter the play-offs to secure a spot.

Europe has historically been the greatest footballing continent, winning 12 FIFA World Cups in total. Some of the biggest names in the sport will feature in the Qualifiers, including Portugal megastar Cristiano Ronaldo, French maestro Kylian Mbappé, England phenom Jude Bellingham, Norwegian leading scorer Erling Haaland, and Spain's teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal.

It is the latest football acquisition for Stan, after securing the exclusive Australian rights to the English Premier League earlier this year. The recent deal also included Japan's J.League and the U.S. National Women's Soccer League, and UEFA Women's EURO 2025™, starting July 3rd.

More recently, it also secured the rights to the Barclays Women's Super League.

Dan Taylor, Executive Director at Stan said: “The acquisition of the European Qualifiers further solidifies Stan Sport as the undisputed home of football. Combined with the Premier League, the Women's Super League and the UEFA Champions League, which also kicks off this month, Stan Sport is the only place to see the biggest stars in the biggest games.

 Get your daily dose of everything happening in music, film and TV in Australia and abroad.





“There has never been a better time to be a football fan.”

Nine Entertainment posted revenue of $2.7 billion and a net profit after tax of $133 million in FY25. Nine's streaming service Stan was a standout performer, fuelling second-half EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) to grow 8%.

Nine also pointed to audience growth across broadcast and streaming, with its platforms accounting for around 20% of TV screen time, ahead of competitors.

Sunday's game at Anfield was there for the taking, but it was the champions who stepped up - not the pretenders to their throne

Dull games are often decided by a moment of madness or magic. At Anfield on Sunday, it was very much the latter, as Dominik Szoboszlai earned Liverpool a 1-0 victory over Arsenal with a stunning free-kick.

The odds were against the Hungarian, with the ball lying 32 yards from the Gunners' goal, but Szoboszlai's strike was sensational - and utterly unstoppable even for a goalkeeper of David Raya's quality.

But what should we take away from this clash between the top two teams in England last season? Is it too early to start worrying about Arsenal's inability to beat their main title rivals away from home? Are Liverpool still a cut above everyone else in the Premier League?

Lionel Messi and Inter Miami had chances but couldn't contain a clinical Seattle team in front of a record home crowd

Lionel Messi had scored 33 goals across 33 club finals. But in his 34th, he was silenced as the Seattle Sounders stunned Inter Miami 3-0 in front of a raucous home crowd to lift the Leagues Cup trophy in the 2025 final on Sunday night.

Lumen Field delivered an electric atmosphere, with a record crowd of 69,314  - surpassing the old mark of 69,274. And, in a rare sight, most of that support was for the home side rather than the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner. Seattle fed off it from the start.

The Sounders pressed immediately and nearly struck inside three minutes. Osaze De Rosario, son of MLS legend Dwayne, found himself unmarked on a free kick just outside the box but sent his effort wide. Minutes later, Messi slipped into the area with a good look at goal, only for Oded Vargas to recover brilliantly with a sliding challenge.

De Rosario made amends in the 26th minute, capping a flowing sequence involving Pedro de la Vega, Jesus Ferreira, and Christian Roldan with a thumping header from Roldan's pinpoint cross. Ferreira nearly doubled the lead before the break, smashing a shot off the post from close range.

Inter Miami boss Javier Mascherano switched from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3 after halftime, and the Herons immediately looked more dangerous. Messi had a golden chance to equalize three minutes into the second half, but after being teed up perfectly by Luis Suárez, he skied his shot into the stands.

At 56 minutes, Mascherano doubled down by pulling defenders for more attackers - a gamble that backfired. The game opened up, and Seattle pounced. Paul Rothrock nearly scored after exploiting Sergio Busquets' move to centerback.

Brian Schmetzer introduced Georgi Minoungou, who made an instant impact, winning a penalty from Yannick Bright that Alex Roldan dispatched coolly past Oscar Ustari. Rothrock made no mistake with his second big chance, racing clear on a counter to bury Seattle's third and seal the Leagues Cup title. 

A brawl ensued after the game when Suarez appeared to put Vargas in a headlock. Both benches emptied, with players and coaches throwing punches. The sequence lasted for about two minutes before things ultimately calmed down, and both sides claimed their medals in the trophy presentation.

With the win, Schmetzer becomes the first manager to claim every major North American trophy, solidifying his place among the great American coaches. Both Seattle and Miami clinched berths in next year's Champions Cup as a result of their participation in the final, along with the LA Galaxy as a result of their third-place game win.

After back-to-back four-set victories, Novak Djokovic bounced back with a quick-and-clean performance Sunday at the US Open.

Following a tricky opening week in which he faced physical concerns and tough on-court tests, the 24-time major champion easily dispatched German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 in just one hour and 49 minutes to advance to the Flushing Meadows quarter-finals for the 14th time.

""I don't know how many more I'm going to have, so obviously each one is very special and I want to thank all you guys for being present here tonight,"" Djokovic said of playing another evening session inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.

It was not all perfect for the 38-year-old, though. Once again, Djokovic received multiple visits from ATP physiotherapist Clay Sniteman. After the first set, Sniteman worked on the area between Djokovic's right shoulder and neck. Following the second set, he massaged the four-time US Open champion's right forearm.



But whatever was bothering the 100-time tour-level titlist did not hinder his play. Struff entered the match with plenty of momentum after consecutive wins against Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe, but was unable to find his aggressive, dominating game like he did against those opponents.

Djokovic now owns 30 tour-level wins this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He broke serve six times and was efficient in all areas of his game, putting enough pressure on Struff to force the German to overplay, while using his serve to stay out of trouble in his own service games.

""It definitely helps if you serve well. I think I had a great serving performance in the last round and also tonight,"" Djokovic said. ""I just saw the stats, I out-served one of the guys that had the most aces during the tournament this year, so that's a great stat. Obviously that helps make my life easier on the court. Maybe I don't need to work as hard or unnecessarily more than I have to.""

Djokovic will take a 10-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his quarter-final clash with fourth seed Taylor Fritz. The defending finalist also earned a comprehensive fourth-round victory on Sunday, ousting 21st seed Tomas Machac in just one hour and 38 minutes.

Alex de Minaur underlined his intent on Monday at the US Open, where he is gearing up in his bid to crack the quarter-finals at a major for the first time in his career.

Despite dropping serve twice, the 26-year-old Australian produced a confident, counter-punching display sweep past World No. 435 Leandro Riedi 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 in one hour, 33 minutes. De Minaur, the No. 8 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, awaits a quarter-final showdown with Felix Auger-Aliassime or Andrey Rublev.

De Minaur, the 10-time ATP Tour is into his sixth major quarter-final, and third at the US Open, but he has never advanced beyond this stage.

“I'm super proud of what I'm doing,” De Minaur said. “Ultimately, this is where I want to be, playing for the big titles, I want to be in contention. I'm putting myself in the right places. I've got another great opportunity coming up in the quarter-finals, I'm gonna go out and have a swing.”

By far his biggest weapon, Riedi was unable to harness his forehand and use it to full effect against De Minaur's relentless defence. Even though he hit 20 winners throughout the clash, Riedi also leaked 39 unforced errors.

“I was happy with my level, my focus. I knew he had some big, big shots and he's had a hell of a week coming through qualies,” added De Minaur. “I wish him nothing but the best, but I'm just happy to be through to the quarter-finals.”

Riedi, who came through qualifying, was competing in the fourth round at a major for the first time. The Swiss player, who underwent two knee surgeries in the past 12 months ago, will leave New York having risen 271 spots to No. 164 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Highlighted by winning his first title of the season in Washington last month, De Minaur owns a Tour-leading 28 wins on hard courts in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He is just the fourth Australian man to reach three US Open quarter-finals in the Open Era after Lleyton Hewitt (7), John Newcombe (5) and Ken Rosewall (3).

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka -- into the quarterfinals of the US Open -- revealed her top 5 tennis GOATs of all time. (Hint: She's played one of them.)

Greatness knows greatness.

So when Aryna Sabalenka gets asked who she thinks are the tennis GOATs, we pay attention.

Speaking to Boardroom co-founder Rich Kleiman, the World No. 1 revealed that her favorite player of all time -- including men's and women's -- is Roger Federer, followed by Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi.

A post shared by Boardroom (@boardroom)

Sabalenka has only played one of her GOATs: In the fourth round of the 2021 Australian Open, Serena defeated Sabalenka 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in their one and only matchup. (At least she can say she took a set off one of her idols.) 

Serena is widely regarded as the GOAT of women's tennis, as her 23 singles Grand Slams are the most in the Open Era. (She also won 14 doubles Slams with her sister, Venus, who's still going strong in the US Open doubles draw with new partner Leylah Fernandez.) Her final tournament before retirement was the 2022 US Open, where she lost in the third round to Ajla Tomljanovic.

Graf made her Grand Slam debut at the 1983 French Open, when she was just 13. She went on to win 22 Grand Slam singles titles, 107 Hologic WTA Tour titles, a gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics and was No. 1 in the PIF WTA Rankings for a record 377 weeks. 

As for Sabalenka, she has three Slam titles of her known and is just three wins away from winning her fourth. The defending US Open champion, who has also won two Australian Open titles, is into the quarterfinals in New York after beating Cristina Bucsa on Sunday and has yet to drop a set in the tournament.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

The 27-year-old has now made the quarterfinals or better in her last 12 Slams.

""I'm super proud,"" she told reporters in regard to her consistency. ""I think that's an incredible achievement. I think for me, the key was balancing on- and off-the-court life. I think I've done a great job in balancing really hard work and also great recovery, and some fun time outside of the tennis court. I think that's been the key.""

Sabalenka, who has already qualified for the WTA Finals in Riyadh, will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova for a spot in the semifinals on Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Gauff or Osaka? Who has the edge this time in New York?","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4353229/gauff-delivers-her-cleanest-match-of-the-us-open","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:11:44 GMT","

Six years after their first US Open meeting, Coco Gauff has become a two-time Slam champion, Naomi Osaka a four-time winner and new mom. Both arrive in the fourth round with a point to prove.

NEW YORK -- They've hoisted the sterling silver trophy here three of the past seven times they've staged the US Open.

On Monday, Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka will face off in New York for the first time since 2019, when a 21-year-old Osaka defeated 15-year-old Gauff in straight sets.

The No. 3-seeded Gauff was a 6-3, 6-1 winner over Magdalena Frech, while No. 23 Osaka defeated No. 15 Daria Kasatkina 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.

Much has changed since their initial meeting.

Gauff is a two-time Grand Slam champion, and Osaka -- a four-time major winner herself -- is the mother of a two-year-old daughter.

The head-to-head record-- Gauff has won three of five matches -- is a little deceptive. That's because Osaka's two wins came when Gauff was 15 (at the US Open) and 17 (in Cincinnati). Gauff has won the past two matches, three years ago in San Jose in straight sets and last year in Beijing, when Osaka retired with a back injury after the two split sets.

“Can somebody come to the match and cheer for me?” Osaka asked the Louis Armstrong crowd. “I mean it's kind of tough playing an American here, but I hope you've adopted me as well.”

Gauff has vivid memories of that US Open match against Osaka.

“I guess I put way too much pressure on myself thinking I maybe had a chance in that moment to actually do something, which I definitely did, but I think it was just I felt more expectation that I should than maybe belief,” Gauff said.

Here's the case for each player:

Advantage, Gauff

She has a history of slow starts, and with all the hoopla surrounding her coaching change just ahead of the US Open, Gauff struggled early. It took her three sets to get past Ajla Tomljanovic in the first round and an emotional tiebreak before subduing Donna Vekic.

But Saturday's victory was a relatively stress-free affair. Gauff reported afterward that, after all the pressure she put on herself, she had fun again playing tennis.

In good company 🤝@CocoGauff | #USOpen pic.twitter.com/Uv1Yuh94VH

That's why she's through to her fourth consecutive fourth round here. And it's why she can beat Osaka.

“It's been like an emotional week, but I think I needed those tough moments to move forward,” Gauff said in her on-court interview. “Overall, I'm really happy how I played and to be through to the next round.”

In a way, Gauff is playing like the 15-year-old version of herself, when she beat Venus Williams and reached the fourth round at Wimbledon. She's taking a little bit off the service speed, creating more shape and margin on the forehand with topspin, and relying on quickness and defense.

And that patience worked beautifully against Frech. Tellingly, there were 25 extended rallies of nine shots or more -- and Gauff won 18 of them.

Gauff will need to amp up her game against Osaka, but the basic strategy will be the same. Hang in against that power and wait for errors. Gauff moves better and saw her patience pay off against Frech.

After hitting 18 double faults and getting broken 10 times in her first two matches, Gauff had only four doubles against Frech -- and was broken only once.

The case for Osaka

This is the kind of Grand Slam performance that Osaka envisioned upon her return from maternity leave.

In the seven majors since giving birth, she was eliminated in the first round twice, the second round three times and the third round twice.

This is Osaka's first fourth-round appearance since the 2021 Australian Open -- a tournament, it's worth noting, she won.

Since hiring coach Tomasz Wiktorowski in Montreal, Osaka has been playing with greater confidence. She's built gradually, winning two matches in Montreal, three in Cincinnati and now has the opportunity for a fourth at the US Open.

Building momentum in New York 🤩@naomiosaka | #USOpen pic.twitter.com/30GmJJJgae

It starts with the serve. Osaka had nine aces against Kasatkina. Only World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka (78) has more this Grand Slam season than Osaka's 70.

But the biggest leap for Osaka has come in the return game. She forged nine break opportunities against Kasatkina and collected seven of them.

Moreover, she's been lethal against second serves; she won 24 of 33 against Kasatkina. This could be huge against Gauff, who has been rolling in off-speed first and second serves in an effort to avoid double faults. 

When she was in her prime, Osaka's groundstrokes were unmatched. Through three matches there have been vintage flashes.

Take the last game against Kasatkina. After falling behind love-15, Osaka went:

Flick! Forehand winner.

Flick! Backhand winner.

Flick! Forehand winner.

Flick! Forehand winner.

She finished the match with 37 winners and a relatively modest 28 unforced errors.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka appeared determined to advance to her fifth straight US Open quarterfinal, wasting no time in defeating Spain's Cristina Bucsa 6-1, 6-4 in their fourth-round match Sunday night.

Aryna Sabalenka looked every bit the World No. 1 Sunday night, defeating Spain's Cristina Bucsa 6-1, 6-4 in 1 hour and 13 minutes in the fourth round of the US Open.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

Originally scheduled for early evening, the match began just over three hours later than anticipated, setting up an impromptu night session at Louis Armstrong Stadium. Fans who stayed were rewarded with a dominant performance from Sabalenka, who controlled the match from start to finish.

With the win, Sabalenka advanced to her fifth consecutive quarterfinal in New York, continuing her streak of deep runs in Flushing Meadows.

“I'm not playing not to lose; I play to win,” Sabalenka said after the match. “I don't care about what happened last year. I mean, of course it's a big achievement, and I'm super happy I was able to achieve it once, but the goal is to do it many more times.”

She then reiterated her mantra from earlier in the tournament: “My mentality is to go out there every time, bring the best fighting spirit, and just fight for my dream.”

That fighting spirit was evident from the start, as Sabalenka flashed a sharp slice forehand in the opening game en route to an early lead. After Bucsa held to level the first set at 1-1, Sabalenka reeled off five straight games to claim the set in just 27 minutes.

The second set was more competitive; with both players trading holds through the first four games. But Sabalenka found another gear, winning four of the final six games to seal the victory.

Bucsa fought to the end, saving four break points in an 11-minute service game to narrow the gap to 4-3. She pushed Sabalenka to deuce in the following game, but the Belarusian held firm to close out the match.

Sabalenka did not face a single break point on the night.

Next up is a quarterfinal showdown against Marketa Vondrousova.

Sabalenka owns a 5-3 career record against Vondrousova, and won their most recent meeting in Cincinnati just a few weeks ago in straight sets.

Another win against Vondrousova would send Sabalenka to a fifth straight US Open semifinal.

Under Cervara, Medvedev topped the ATP rankings and reached six Grand Slam finals, winning one at the 2021 US Open to prevent Novak Djokovic from clinching the Calendar Year Grand Slam.

Medvedev's last match with Cervara came at the 2025 US Open, where he suffered a third straight Grand Slam first-round defeat.

The 29-year-old has struggled mightily at major tournaments since the 2024 Australian Open, where he fell in the final to Jannik Sinner from two sets up. In four major appearances in 2025, Medvedev won just one match, and suffered three consecutive first-round losses.At the US Open, he took a second straight Grand Slam defeat to Benjamin Bonzi, who also defeated him two months ago at the Wimbledon Championships. It was during their match on Louis Armstrong Stadium that Medvedev incurred a $42,500 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct for berating umpire Greg Allensworth and delaying play for over six minutes as Bonzi served for the match. Medvedev ultimately lost in five sets and will drop further down the rankings after starting the year at No. 5.

After Djokovic finished off that opening set against Struff, he was visited by a trainer for treatment during the ensuing changeover.

I truly believe that this whole tournament has been a game changer for me. Taylor Townsend

“I think everything happens for a reason… this was part of the plan,” Townsend said afterward. “We still got a lot of tennis to play, and I'm still here for the doubles.“You never know what type of catalyst or catapult that this match could be to propel me forward. I truly believe that this whole tournament has been a game changer for me.”The loss ended Townsend's best singles run at a Slam since the 2019 US Open, when she upset Simona Halep en route to the fourth round. Since then, injuries, time away to have her son, and the grind of rebuilding her career meant essentially starting over from scratch.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

A yellow flag-related penalty will put Lewis Hamilton on the back foot heading to the Italian Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton has been given a five-place grid penalty for Ferrari's home race at Monza after he was found guilty of a yellow flag breach prior to the Dutch Grand Prix.

Hamilton crashed out of Sunday's race after losing control of his car at Zandvoort's Turn 3 amid drops of rain, before team mate Charles Leclerc collided with Mercedes rival Kimi Antonelli through the same section and made it a double DNF for the Scuderia.

Now, ahead of Ferrari's second home event of the season, it has been confirmed that Hamilton will lose five positions from wherever he qualifies next time out – due to a transgression relating to double waved yellow flags during the pre-race reconnaissance laps in the Netherlands.

“Due to the nature of the track, the Race Director had informed all participants that the last corner before the pit lane would have double yellow flags waved,” read a report from the stewards. “This was to ensure the safety of those on the grid and in the pit lane.

“The regulations require that any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector ‘reduce speed significantly…'.

“We looked through the available telemetry within the FIA system. We also requested the team to provide us with their telemetry data. All of this took some time and this decision was delayed as a result.

“In addition, Article 44.1 requires all drivers covering more than one reconnaissance lap to drive down the pit entry road at ‘greatly reduced speed'.

“The data showed that the driver had entered the double yellow sector approximately 20kph less than his speed at the same point in practice sessions, had reduced throttle application in the order of 10% to 20% and had lifted and braked 70 metres earlier when entering the pit lane.

“We did not consider that a 20kph reduction in speed at a double waved yellow sector constituted reducing speed ‘significantly'. We also did not consider the speed at which the driver entered the pit entry road as being at a ‘greatly' reduced speed.

“The penalty guidelines for such an infringement would ordinarily attract a penalty of 10 grid positions at the next race. However, given that the driver had made an attempt to reduce his speed and to brake earlier, we took that into account as mitigating circumstances and imposed a five grid place penalty.”

A collision at the banked Turn 3 ended Charles Leclerc's day early at the Zandvoort Circuit.

Charles Leclerc's Dutch Grand Prix came to an early end after contact with Kimi Antonelli, making it a double retirement for Ferrari on Sunday.

With a fresh set of soft tyres, Leclerc rejoined just in front of Antonelli, the Mercedes driver having pitted a lap early for fresh rubber towards the final third of proceedings.

Coming through the banked Turn 3, Antonelli took the low line on the inside but drifted up high, colliding with Leclerc which sent the Ferrari spinning into the barrier.

While Leclerc retired on the spot, Antonelli was able to recover back to the pits as a Safety Car, but the young Italian was slapped with a 10-second penalty for the incident.

The same spot also marked the end for Lewis Hamilton's race in the second Ferrari, the seven-time World Champion drifting up into the barrier as light rain fell on the Zandvoort Circuit early on.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Neither Liam Lawson nor Carlos Sainz left the Zandvoort Circuit happy after Sunday's race.

Liam Lawson and Carlos Sainz have given their opinions on the collision between themselves during the Dutch Grand Prix which ruined their chances of finishing in the points.

The pair had been circulating in seventh and eighth following a Safety Car period at the end of Lap 26, with Sainz getting a run on the Racing Bulls driver ahead into Turn 1 at the Zandvoort Circuit.

The Williams man went to the outside line as Lawson defended on the inside, with the front-right of Sainz's car clipping the left-rear of the Racing Bulls machine mid-corner.

Both drivers instantly suffered punctures and were forced to crawl back to the pits before finding themselves a lap down after rejoining, eventually finishing outside the points in 12th and 13th respectively.

Sainz was deemed at fault for the incident and handed a 10-second penalty but was left frustrated by Lawson's actions.

""I think I always try and be quite controlled and pick my words on the radio quite well, let's say level-headed. I try in this high adrenaline, stressful sport,"" said Sainz, who has not finished in the points in the last five Grands Prix.

""Today was very difficult because first of all I suffered an incident that cost me another 10 points in the championship when I was executing one of my best weekends of the year. That's frustration number one.

""Frustration number two is racing a guy that it's not the first time we see him exposing himself to having an incident with another driver.

""I've raced multiple guys around this track in Turn 1 and multiple quality guys that allow for a side-by-side movement like that in a beautiful corner. Today, I chose to have that side-by-side line with someone that prefers not to have it and prefers to risk an incident and risk losing so many points.

""It's very frustrating, very disappointed but on top of that to get a 10-second penalty is something unacceptable, something I don't understand.""

Lawson was also left frustrated by the incident on a weekend when team mate Isack Hadjar scored his maiden Formula 1 podium.

But the Kiwi believed he did nothing wrong in regard to the current regulations.

""It just sucks for both of us. It's obviously not my intention but it's lap one on a restart and we have very low grip going into Turn 1, said Lawson.

""The rules are written as they are and we all know how they're written so as much as we sometimes don't agree with it, I've been on the receiving end of it as well this year and I disagree with it as well, but that's how they are.

""For it to be his corner, he has to be ahead at the apex; he wasn't anywhere near that today so that's why he got a penalty for it I'm guessing. It just sucks for us but obviously for Isack on the other side of the garage, to have a podium is very cool.""

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort.

As widely predicted, we have an all-McLaren front row in Zandvoort, with championship leader Oscar Piastri on pole from team mate and title rival Lando Norris. Less expected was the second-row line-up of World Champion Max Verstappen in the Red Bull, alongside the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar, in a career-best P4.

George Russell is the lead Mercedes in fifth, followed by the Ferrari duo of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. Liam Lawson makes it two Racing Bulls in the top 10 in P8, ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin.

At the back of the order, the second Aston Martin of Lance Stroll lines up in P19 following his Q1 retirement, while starting from the pit lane will be the Haas of Oliver Bearman. The British driver had qualified one place ahead of Stroll, but has since had multiple power unit elements changed on his car.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

With his seventh win of the season and Lando Norris retiring, Oscar Piastri now sits with a 34-point lead in the Drivers' Championship.

Dutch Grand Prix winner Oscar Piastri claims ""there is a long way to go yet"" in his quest for a maiden Drivers' title, having taken a substantial points lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris after his retirement.

Piastri took a lights-to-flag victory at the Zandvoort Circuit, leading all 72 laps from pole but having faced constant pressure from behind by Norris.

The pivotal moment came on Lap 64, as Norris stopped out on track with smoke coming from the back of his McLaren having reported an issue over the radio.

With Norris out, Piastri rattled off the remaining laps for his seventh win of the season and now has a 34-point lead in the Driver's Championship with just nine races remaining.

""I controlled the race when I needed to and obviously incredibly unfortunate for Lando at the end, but I felt like I was in control of that one and just used the pace when I needed to,"" he said.

""It was a bit of a different race to 12 months ago so very happy with all the work we've done to try and improve around here. Very satisfied to come out on top.""

The result was dramatically different from last season, with Norris having taken victory by 22 seconds while Piastri had to settle for fourth.

Piastri also seemed on the back foot this weekend compared with his team mate and title rival initially, but peaked at the most crucial moment to take pole position on Saturday.

""Nothing special, just trying to improve everywhere we can,"" when asked what had changed from 12 months ago.

""At the start of this weekend it was looking like a difficult one and managed to get it together in Qualifying and then I was happy with the pace I had today.

""Very happy, obviously a couple of Safety Cars that spiced it up a little bit and we weathered it all so very proud of the whole team.

""It wasn't just myself that improved to get here it was the whole team around me, without them none of this is possible. It's a big team effort.""

While Norris' retirement has handed Piastri a healthy lead in the Drivers' Championship in the first race after the summer break, the Dutch GP victor stated: ""Starting out on top is a good way to go so if we can keep it running then that would be great, but there's a long way to go yet and keep doing it one race at a time.""

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The second retirement of the season for Lando Norris has put him on the back foot in his title fight with Oscar Piastri.

Lando Norris was left to come to terms with a pivotal retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix, claiming it was ""out of my control"" as he now trails McLaren team mate and title rival Oscar Piastri by a substantial margin.

Having quickly moved back ahead of Max Verstappen after losing second position on the opening lap, Norris shadowed Piastri for much of 72-lap race.

On the cusp of DRS range – the one-second-or-under gap required to use the drag reduction system –  Norris looked set to challenge his championship rival in the closing stages. But with eight laps remaining, the Briton reported over the radio he could smell smoke.

Shortly after, Norris was forced to come to a stop out on track and record his second retirement of the season, following contact with Piastri in Canada.

With Piastri taking his seventh win of the year at Zandvoort, Norris now sits 34 points adrift in the title battle having come into the first race weekend after the summer break just nine points behind.

“It's just a tough race,"" said Norris when asked about his feelings.

""I was a bit disappointed, but there's nothing I could really do about it in the end. Frustrating, but it's out of my control, so nothing I could do.”

Norris had looked stronger than Piastri for much of the weekend, having also taken victory at the Zandvoort Circuit 12 months ago, but crucially missed out on pole position by 0.012s.

Despite having to chase his team mate, Norris often looked the quicker of the two in the race but believed being able to overtake for the lead would have been incredibly difficult.

""You can't do a lot around here. I felt a bit quicker [than Oscar] but you have to be about eight-tenths quicker to overtake around here and I'm not eight-tenths quicker,"" said Norris.

“To follow within two seconds for pretty much the whole race was a good drive. There was nothing more I could really ask. You start to get dirty air at around four seconds. To be around three or two, I wasn't really expecting it today.

“I thought I did a good job, but it doesn't help much, doesn't mean much. It doesn't mean I got more points or whatever, it's just reassuring that the pace was strong, and I look ahead to the next one.”

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Mark Hughes is on hand to analyse the silver lining for Ferrari in the Netherlands, after they recorded a double DNF at the Dutch Grand Prix.

Two crashed cars and no points made the Dutch Grand Prix a dispiriting event for Scuderia Ferrari. But actually, both team boss Frederic Vasseur and Lewis Hamilton were taking positives from it.

Why so? Vasseur was greatly encouraged by the dramatic turnaround in competitiveness between Friday and Saturday.

In FP1 the cars, running a higher ride height than ideal to account for the heavy grounding the cars take on the fast compression corners – Turn 7 and 8 – were 1.7s off the pace of McLaren, Charles Leclerc and Hamilton languishing 14th and 15th respectively.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Oscar Piastri extended his championship lead with victory in the Dutch Grand Prix, but who else left the Netherlands happy after F1 returned in Zandvoort?

McLaren endured the extremes of human emotion at Zandvoort on Sunday as one of their drivers excelled while the other suffered the pain of a shock retirement in a chaotic Dutch Grand Prix. Lawrence Barretto picks out his winners and losers from the first race after the summer break...

Oscar Piastri's hopes of winning a maiden Formula 1 World Championship in only his third campaign took a big boost in Zandvoort as he converted a superb pole (his fifth of the season) and seventh win in 2025.

The Australian was outpaced by his team mate through practice, but delivered when it mattered in Qualifying and managed all the drama in the race (which included multiple restarts) to perfection.

His ninth career victory ties his manager and former Red Bull racer Mark Webber's total – while it was also the first time he's led from start to finish in Formula 1.

That success was compounded by a mechanical failure for his McLaren team mate Lando Norris, with the Australian moving 34 points clear in their near-private fight for this year's title.

Norris got up to speed around Zandvoort much quicker than his team mate Piastri, with the Briton coming out on top in all three practice sessions.

But he couldn't convert that performance into pole position – which left him with a mountain to climb on Sunday given the difficulties of overtaking on the narrow Dutch track.

The Briton gave it a good go, reclaiming second from reigning World Champion Max Verstappen before setting off in pursuit of Piastri. But he never got close enough to launch a proper attack and then saw his challenge extinguished when he smelt smoke that highlighted the issue that forced his retirement.

That's his first DNF since Canada, and means the momentum is firmly with his team mate with nine Grand Prix weekends to go.

Isack Hadjar's sensational rookie season reached new heights in Zandvoort as he recovered from, in his words, a ""disaster"" of a Friday to secure a career-best fourth on the grid.

The Frenchman then comfortably ran fourth, despite being ahead of faster cars – and then rode his luck when Norris retired to take a brilliant podium in only his 15th Grand Prix.

The Racing Bulls driver becomes the fifth-youngest podium finisher of all time, behind Verstappen, Lance Stroll, Kimi Antonelli and Norris, and is the youngest Frenchman to ever stand on a Formula 1 rostrum.

The huge points haul catapults him into the top 10 in the Drivers' Standings, while Racing Bulls close the gap to Williams to 20 points in the fight for P5 in the Teams' Championship.

Liam Lawson was on course to make it a double points finish for Racing Bulls after another top-10 start – but a collision with Williams' Carlos Sainz instantly ended any hopes of adding to his tally.

The New Zealander was the only Red Bull stable car not to score points on Sunday – with Verstappen second and Yuki Tsunoda ending a seven-race streak without points.

It also ended his run of two Grands Prix in the points, and now leaves him 17 points behind Racing Bulls team mate Hadjar.

Alex Albon was irritated after getting booted out of Qualifying, having had his out-lap compromised by queueing in the pit lane to end up 15th.

But his mood improved dramatically on Sunday with a stellar performance that began with him rising up five places at the start to run 10th.

Amid the chaos around him, the Briton kept his nose clean and raced well to rise up to fifth and ensure Williams scored well enough to keep their grip on P5 in the Teams' Championship.

His 10th points finish of the season is his most in a single campaign since joining Williams in 2022 and moves him level with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli in the Drivers' Championship.

Carlos Sainz rarely gets annoyed on team radio, but he was furious with the stewards' decision to hand him a 10-second time penalty for colliding with Lawson when trying to pass his rival around the outside.

It ruined a weekend that had been bright to start with for Sainz, with the Spaniard out-qualifying his team mate Albon to line up ninth for his first Q3 appearance since Imola way back in May.

He was in great shape to finish fifth but the collision with Lawson forced a pit stop for new tyres and a new nose, which dropped him to the back of the field and out of contention for points.

That extends his point-less run in Grands Prix to five, though he did score in that period courtesy of a strong drive to sixth in the Belgian Sprint.

Ollie Bearman has driven well this season but all too often left race weekends empty-handed (he finished 11th four times in a row from Canada).

His chances of adding to that tally looked bleak when he qualified badly before opting to start from the pit lane after changing a host of engine components.

But in running a long opening stint and then pitting under the Safety Car on Lap 54 of 72, he used fresh tyres to pass Fernando Alonso, Gabriel Bortoleto and Pierre Gasly and rise up to eighth, which became sixth courtesy of Norris' DNF and Antonelli's time penalties for his collision with Charles Leclerc and speeding in the pit lane.

Kimi Antonelli recovered from a poor start to his weekend when he beached his Mercedes in the gravel after just six laps in Friday practice to qualify just outside the top-10 in 11th.

The Italian then raced superbly to run sixth – but a move on Leclerc, which his Ferrari rival described as ""overly optimistic"", earned him a 10-second time penalty.

Combined with the five seconds for speeding in the pit lane, he dropped from sixth on the road to 16th in the classification.

Crashes in both second practice and Qualifying kept Lance Stroll's side of the Aston Martin garage busy in Zandvoort.

The Canadian lined up 19th – following his 10th Q1 elimination of the season – but some smart strategy with an early pit stop hauled him into points contention.

He went on to finish seventh for the third time in four races, moving him ahead of Aston Martin team mate Fernando Alonso in the Drivers' Standings.

Ferrari recovered from a challenging Friday to get both cars into Q3 – something Lewis Hamilton hadn't done since Silverstone.

While they lacked the pace to fight McLaren or Red Bull's Max Verstappen, they were easily a match for Mercedes on race day.

But while chasing Russell, Hamilton uncharacteristically crashed, suffering his first DNF for Ferrari and failing to score for the second successive race.

Leclerc bullishly passed Russell but a top-five finish evaporated when he was hit by Antonelli, forcing him into retirement.

It ended Ferrari's 100% finishing record in 2025 and was the second time this year they have failed to score with either car (the first was when they were disqualified in China).

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Isack Hadjar became the eighth different driver to stand on the Formula 1 podium in 2025 with an astonishing drive to third place at Zandvoort.

Isack Hadjar felt “unreal” after scoring a surprise podium result at the Dutch Grand Prix, and believes this is the first step towards “much more”.

Just 15 races into his rookie Formula 1 season, Hadjar has claimed his first piece of silverware. Having started from fourth place, the Frenchman looked comfortable lapping at the front, as he closely followed Red Bull driver Max Verstappen for the majority of the distance.

The decisive moment came when championship contender Lando Norris pulled off to retire with a reported oil leak, promoting the Racing Bulls driver into the top three positions.

“It feels a bit unreal,” said Hadjar. “What was most surprising for me was keeping that fourth place for the whole race.

“Unfortunately for Lando, we took advantage of his [retirement], but we made no mistakes. The car was on rails the whole weekend, and I'm really happy about myself because I really maximised what I had, made no mistakes and brought home the podium, so I'm so happy for my guys.”

The result ended a five-race streak without a point for Hadjar, and pushed him into the top 10 in the Drivers' Championship standings, where he sits level with Nico Hulkenberg on 37 points.

The 20-year-old becomes the eighth podium finisher of the season, and Racing Bulls the sixth team to be represented in the post-race ceremony.

Asked if he could have dreamed of this result as a young kid, Hadjar said: “Yeah, that was always the target since I was a kid. This is a first step, my first podium and hopefully much more.”

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

McLaren's Team Principal reflected on a weekend of mixed fortunes for his drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.

Andrea Stella admits that the McLaren team ""experienced the two extremes of motorsport"" during the Dutch Grand Prix, following Oscar Piastri's victory but retirement for Lando Norris.

The 2025 pacesetters looked on course to record an eighth 1-2 of the season at the Zandvoort Circuit on Sunday, with Piastri having led every lap from pole and been closely shadowed by Norris.

But with just eight laps to go, Norris reported smelling smoke over the radio and soon stopped his McLaren out on track to record his second retirement of the season and lose crucial ground in the title fight.

""I think we experienced today the two extremes of motorsport where we were happy on one side; joy for the victory, for McLaren, for the team coming back from the break and for Oscar, a great drive this weekend,"" said McLaren Team Principal Stella.

""And on the opposite side we have the pain, we have the disappointment for Lando. He drove well as well, he was there in contention to win the race but then we had a problem with the car, something that we are still investigating.

""Lando, as soon as he stopped the car, he got on the radio, he said it's just bad luck, nothing that we can control.

""I haven't talked to him yet but I know that he has already said very clearly that we look forward, we look at the next race, we will try and recover the points and that's the spirit and the attitude which we expect in Lando.

""So I think we look forward to a fighting spirit from Lando's side and just joy for Oscar but it's still not even two-thirds of this championship. A long way to go.""

Norris trailed Piastri by nine points in the Drivers' Championship heading into the first weekend after the summer break, but his retirement on Sunday means he now sits 34 points adrift with nine races remaining.

Stella believed there would be no issue in motivating Norris for the rest of the season despite the huge blow to his title aspirations.

""Well the fighting spirit and the racing attitude, the competitiveness, I don't think we have to do anything,"" added Stella of Norris.

""This is natural, and very strong in Lando, likewise in Oscar. So from this point of view, not much we can do. I think what we will do is try to keep enforcing our racing principles so that Lando and Oscar can express their talents, their ability, can have their chances to pursue their aspiration to become World Champion.

""That's what we can and what we will do and it's just a shame that today, somehow, it was a problem with the car that kind of interfered as a factor with their individual quest.

""But let's see the following races and how the championship will unfold. Certainly we will keep pushing and we will keep supporting both drivers the same.""

Think you saw it all? Here are seven moments you might have missed from Zandvoort that fans will be talking about long after the chequered flag.

Max Verstappen's home charge fell just short of the win after Oscar Piastri dominated the weekend, but the sea of orange still lifted Zandvoort into full party mode, with the off-track action at the Dutch Grand Prix keeping fans buzzing all weekend.

Zandvoort proved yet again it's equal parts festival and Formula 1. Here are seven moments you might have missed from the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix.

Rookie sensation Isack Hadjar etched his name into the history books with his first-ever F1 podium, finishing third in front of a jubilant Dutch crowd. As the Racing Bulls driver pulled into parc fermé, fellow drivers lined up to congratulate him, with hugs, pats on the back, and plenty of smiles for the young superstar.

The blooper reel began right after the chequered flag, as Hadjar looked hilariously confused about finding his way to the podium.

As if the day wasn't memorable enough, Hadjar accidentally broke his trophy during the celebrations. It seems Hadjar's rookie year now comes complete with his very own entry in F1's accidental-trophy-damage hall of fame.

The Zandvoort marshals have become icons in their own right, and 2025 was no exception. Between sessions, cameras caught them waving flags in rhythm, dancing on the barriers, and hyping up the crowd.

Their enthusiasm mirrored the energy in the stands and proved once again that at the Dutch Grand Prix, everyone, even the officials, are a part of the spectacle of Zandvoort.

Qualifying took a turn when an unexpected intruder joined the action, a fox darting across the circuit in front of Charles Leclerc's Ferrari. Fortunately, the creature made it across safely and Leclerc carried on undisturbed.

The incident was a reminder that Zandvoort, being nestled in the dunes, is still very much part of nature's playground, as well as the drivers'!

The Dutch Grand Prix doubled as a football reunion, with Dutch legend Ruud Gullit, the former Chelsea, AC Milan and Netherlands star, soaking up the paddock buzz. On Sunday, World Cup winner Paulo Dybala, currently playing for AS Roma, took centre stage as he waved the chequered flag to close out the race.

Xavi Simons, who signed for Tottenham on Friday before being officially presented to the team's crowd on the same day, still couldn't miss the action in Zandvoort, which he attended on Sunday. He was happy to be in his hometown and eagerly rooted for Verstappen.

Adding to the prestige of the event, members of the Dutch Royal Family were spotted in the paddock, joining tens of thousands of fans in celebrating the nation's premier sporting weekend.

Their presence has become something of a tradition, underscoring how the race has grown into a point of national pride since its return to the calendar in 2021.

Zandvoort once again turned into a sea of orange, with grandstands moving in unison as fans roared Verstappen on. From coordinated chants to choreographed flag waves, the atmosphere felt less like a race and more like a national celebration.

The Orange Army were the heartbeat of the weekend, showcasing the pride and passion that has made the Dutch Grand Prix one of F1's most unique stops.

For many, the race is just one part of the Dutch Grand Prix experience. Beyond the roar of engines, Zandvoort turned into a full-scale party with DJs, live acts, and beachside stages running long into the night. Fans were treated to sets from Oliver Heldens, Snollebollekes, and Afrojack, alongside Dutch favourites like Yves Berendse and Kraantje Pappie.

The mix of international names and homegrown stars gave the weekend its signature race-meets-rave energy. With music thumping from the dunes and thousands of supporters dancing in unison, the Dutch Grand Prix once again proved it's as much a cultural event as a sporting one.

The upcoming series also cast a number of new Hogwarts students and staff members.

HBO‘s upcoming Harry Potter TV series has cast a familiar face to play Hogwarts Professor Filius Flitwick.


	Warwick Davis, who played Flitwick in the original Harry Potter film series, will reprise the role for the TV series, which will debut on HBO and HBO Max in 2027. 




	Davis is the only actor (so far) to play the same role on the TV reboot as in the original films. His return to the franchise was announced as part of the annual Back to Hogwarts event, which is held each Sept. 1 and celebrates the franchise.

	In addition to Davis, HBO also announced castings for seven other roles in the upcoming series: 

	











	HBO has been active in casting the show over the summer, starting with the new actors playing Harry, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, with John Lithgow playing Dumbledore, Janet McTeer playing Professor Minerva McGonagall, Paapa Essiedu playing Professor Severus Snape and Nick Frost playing Hagrid, among other roles.


	You can see the full cast list so far here.


	The new Harry Potter series is in production now and will take a more expansive approach to author J.K. Rowling's original book series, delving into storylines that weren't able to be included in the films. While the cast is new, the inclusion of Davis as the Hogwarts charms professor provides some connective tissue between the original film franchise and the upcoming series.


	Davis also portrayed Griphook in the film franchise but is not returning for the role in the TV series. The actor has also appeared in the Star Wars and Leprechaun franchises as well as the title character in Willow.

	











	The series is being written and executive produced by Francesca Gardiner. Mark Mylod will executive produce and direct multiple episodes of the series for HBO in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television. The series is executive produced by Rowling, Neil Blair and Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films.

Emily Blunt co-stars in the true story of Mark Kerr, a former college wrestler who battled trauma and drug addiction during the early years of the UFC.


							By 

	Jordan Mintzer



	Sticks, stones, body blows and multiple knees to the head may break his bones, but names are what do real damage to pioneering UFC fighter Mark Kerr, a beast of a man who could crush opponents in the ring and fall apart as soon as he stepped outside it.


	In Benny Safdie's compellingly gritty and offbeat biopic, The Smashing Machine, Kerr wavers between hot and cold, passive and aggressive, chilled-out on the couch and pulverizing a door in his living room, showcasing a fragility that's way bigger than his ballooning biceps. Played by Dwayne Johnson in the wrestler-turned-actor's most absorbing turn yet, the mixed martial arts champ anchors a rise-and-fall fight flick that takes many cues from the genre but never delivers a Rocky-style knockout — nor does it even try to.

The Bottom Line

	
	A well-performed and punishing fight flick, both in and out of the ring.
	



Venue: Venice Film Festival (Competition)Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Ryan Bader, Bas RuttenDirector, screenwriter, editor: Benny Safdie

								2 hours 3 minutes			






	Marking the director's first feature made apart from his brother, Josh, the film retains much of what rendered the Safdies' work so original: a stylized moody realism; a cast mixing trained actors with regular people; an overall downbeat vibe enlivened by flashes of raw humor and energy; and stories carried by protagonists often addicted to something, whether it's theft (The Pleasure of Being Robbed, Good Time), drugs (Heaven Knows What) or gambling (Uncut Gems).




			Related Video		







	Sports have also been a Safdie staple, from their melancholic b-ball doc Lenny Cooke to Adam Sandler's obsession with the NBA in Gems, and this may explain why both bros chose to make solo debuts about two very particular kinds of professional athletes. In Josh's case, that would be a 1950s table tennis star in his upcoming Marty Supreme, whereas Benny focuses here on an ex-college wrestler duking it out in the early years of the UFC, when fighters were far from household names and the sport wasn't yet a billion-dollar behemoth (not to mention a favorite of America's current president).

	











	Set between 1997 and 2000, a period which saw Kerr punching, headbutting and grappling his way through tournaments in the U.S., Brazil and Japan, Safdie's script underscores how the UFC started as a fringe organization whose poorly paid brawls usually ended in blood. The violence is what both repelled and attracted the public, and it eventually takes its toll on Kerr, who practices mixed martial arts as a discipline requiring rigorous training, which he does with best bud and fellow MMA fighter Mark Coleman.


	The latter is played by former UFC fighter Ryan Bader in a convincingly grounded performance, while Kerr's trainer for his final bouts is played by UFC legend Bas Rutten. This means that three of the four main cast members in The Smashing Machine are real heavyweights with bulging cauliflower ears. (Johnson's were impressively created by prosthetic designer Kazu Hiro, who makes the actor nearly unrecognizable.) And yet Safdie coaxes great turns out of all of them, focusing on the gristly camaraderie the men share — how they may look mean as hell in the ring but are more like gentle giants in person.  


	In fact, Kerr is such a sweetheart that he tends to gets stomped on by his longtime girlfriend, Dawn (Emily Blunt), who winds up posing a greater threat to him than any of his opponents. Aggressive, nagging, constantly chewing gum in an obnoxious manner, but also supportive and loving when Kerr hits some seriously rough patches throughout the narrative, Dawn is both the bedrock for the fighter's rollercoaster of a career and his Achilles' heel.

	











	Safdie stages their squabbles as intensely as the ones in the octagon, in a movie that shifts between the pounding blows Kerr puts up with as a pro fighter and the mental anguish Dawn gives him at home. This isn't to say she's solely responsible for all the domestic drama: Kerr is under so much pressure that he can be impossible to live with, going from intensive training periods when he judges how well Dawn makes his protein shakes in the morning, to opiate-fueled binges that leave him comatose on the bathroom floor. Still, the film stacks the cards rather heavily against its female lead, forcing Blunt to play a woman who seems to do more harm than good to the man she loves.


	Kerr's many weaknesses are also the strengths of a story in which fights are lost more often than they're won. The Smashing Machine may borrow some tropes from the sports genre, such as a fun training montage set to Elvis' version of “My Way,” or multiple scenes of journalists interviewing the fighters in Japan. In truth it's a movie much less about athletic victory than human vulnerability, and thus falls in line with other Safdie bros flicks about likable losers getting hammered by everything life tosses at them.  


	Johnson has rarely played a loser, but he's always been likable, displaying a massive grin to match his massive pecs in action vehicles that never allowed him to showcase much range. He manages to go deep here without overdoing it, killing the audience with kindness as a benign warrior who suffers from one scene to the next, triumphing briefly in the ring before succumbing to addiction and/or romantic grief. Like Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler — a film from which Safdie seems to take a few cues — the actor delivers an intoxicating mix of blood, sweat, tears, protein and total helplessness.

	











	Those elements fuel Kerr as he finally kicks his opiate habit and makes his way to the kind of finale you'd expect from any good fight flick, with the chance to face his bestie Coleman in a Tokyo-set championship organized by Pride (a rival Japanese group that the UFC swallowed up in 2007). But The Smashing Machine is more Raging Bull than Rocky, refusing to give combat fans what they want in a downbeat ending that doubles down on the realism, not to mention the traumas caused by so much violence.


	Realism is also a big part of the film's grungy and unflashy aesthetic. DP Maceo Bishop (who worked with Safdie on his Showtime series, The Curse) captures the action documentary-style with long lenses and lots of grain, while production designer James Chinlund highlights how unglamorous Kerr's world is, from the chintzy ballroom arena where he wins his first MMA fights to the bland Arizona home he shares with Dawn. Costumes by Heidi Bivens show how the late-90s wasn't exactly a bastion of sophistication, at least in the world of mixed martial arts.


	For a movie anchored by an actor who became famous for his staged bouts in the WWE, The Smashing Machine's greatest attribute may be the way much of it doesn't feel fake at all. Excluding some of the drama with Dawn, which goes a bit overboard in the last act, Safdie succeeds in making Kerr's struggles as lifelike as possible. When, in a late switcheroo that's yet another fit of realism, the actual Kerr briefly replaces Johnson, it's 25 years later and he looks nothing like the man we've been watching. Yet he seems to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders.

Co-written by director Mona Fastvold with Brady Corbet, this portrait of the 18th century religious leader who founded the Shaker movement also stars Lewis Pullman, Thomasin McKenzie and Christopher Abbott.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	You have to hand it to Mona Fastvold and her partner and longtime collaborator Brady Corbet — they never play it safe with conventional, easily digestible material. Fastvold's ambitious third feature, The Testament of Ann Lee, is a speculative account of the life of the 18th century religious leader who founded the Shakers and was falsely accused of treason, witchcraft and whatever else the Congregationalist establishment of New England could throw at her. Amanda Seyfried holds nothing back as the title figure in a movie that, for better or worse, often seems fueled by the same hysterical intensity that characterizes the movement's worship.

	Elevated by mesmerizing songs of thanks and praise adapted by composer Daniel Blumberg from traditional spirituals and animated by the whirling rapture and vigorous physical expression of Shaker prayer, in which believers surrender their bodies to the Holy Spirit, this is certainly not a movie in which I was ever bored.

The Bottom Line

	
	Dizzying, in ways both stirring and taxing.
	



Venue: Venice Film Festival (Competition)Cast: Amanda Seyfried, Lewis Pullman, Thomasin McKenzie, Matthew Beard, Christopher Abbott, Viola Prettejohn, David Cale, Stacy Martin, Scott Handy, Jeremy Wheeler, Tim Blake NelsonDirector: Mona FastvoldScreenwriters: Mona Fastvold, Brady Corbet

								2 hours 14 minutes			






	The overarching impression it leaves is of a filmmaker drawn not so much to the devotional aspects of her subject as to the impassioned radicalism of Lee's utopian ideal for a self-sustaining society, isolated from the world, in which all assets were communal.


	Core beliefs, including pacifism, spiritual and physical purity, the collective expunging of sin as a kind of exorcism, social equality extending to gender and race and the nonbinary representation of God, doubtless are not all shared by Fastvold. But the filmmaker clearly identifies with the dedication of the Shakers to common goals that parallel the clarity, collaboration and discipline demanded by any creative endeavor.

	











	What holds the film back to a degree is the disparity that creates, favoring the auteurial connection over the interpretive one. Seyfried builds a powerful force around Ann's convictions, but there's too little intimate knowledge of this historically significant woman to convey much beyond her zeal. The fact that she was illiterate and therefore unable to record her own experiences and beliefs means most of what is known about her comes from second-hand accounts, from both adherents and opponents.


	All that proves a bit of a hurdle, making The Testament of Ann Lee a big, muscular movie thrumming with energy and spirituality but lacking the personal insight into its protagonist to justify the epic treatment.


	Ann remains somewhat opaque and often more strident than persuasive in her evangelism. Everything from the choice to shoot in 70mm to the dense, front-loaded title credits treatment suggests the desire to create a companion piece of sorts to The Brutalist, which Fastvold co-wrote with Corbet. But the story doesn't have the novelistic sweep or thematic complexity to sustain all that weight, becoming a bit of a repetitive slog at times, rather than deepening our understanding of the woman whose name is in the title.


	I confess I knew relatively little about the Shakers going in, beyond the famed woodworking and furniture traditions grounded in the sect's philosophy — designs for doors, cabinetry and other household objects had to be necessary and useful, in other words utilitarian, but if they were necessary and useful, the craftspeople were also encouraged to make them beautiful.

	











	My other previous encounter with the movement was in the Wooster Group's transfixing hour-long show Early Shaker Spirituals, a faithful performance interpretation of a 1976 recording of hymns and work songs. It offered the novel fascination of watching Frances McDormand — an associate member of the New York experimental theater company who returned for the 2014 production — gallop around the stage in a bonnet and housedress.


	Fastvold's film expands on such basic knowledge — though regrettably not much on the woodwork history. Regardless of its merits or failings as a cinematic experience, I appreciated the immersive access to a semi-obscure community that had a peak population in the 1840s of 6,000 but today counts just two believers, putting the movement at extinction level.


	The movie is less compelling as biographical history. Narrated on and off by young acolyte Mary (Thomasin McKenzie), it chronicles Ann's life in somewhat unimaginative fashion, starting with her childhood in Manchester, England, in the mid-1700s. She grew up experiencing heavenly visions alongside unheavenly sights like her father grinding away on top of her mother, which gave her a disgust with indulgences of the flesh.


	From a young age, Ann devotes herself to God's work but struggles to find a religion that aligns with her beliefs, until she happens to attend a revivalist meeting in the home of Jane Wardley (Stacy Martin), who leads the session of purging and praise, and her husband James (Scott Handy).

	











	The wild, almost convulsive stomping and shaking as sins are absolved appeals to Ann's fervid nature — the movement's eventual name evolved from their original description, “Shaking Quakers.” But she's perhaps even more captivated by the group's belief in the promise of a second coming in the form of a woman: “God created us all in his image, so he must be both man and woman.”


	She marries handsome young blacksmith Abraham (Christopher Abbott) and complies with his brusque sexual demands for a time — lots of bare-assed birch branch lashings and “Take me in your mouth” orders, which she declines — until the last of four babies that die in their infancy is gone, leaving Ann near death. She believes the tragedies that have befallen her are the result of Abraham and her father convincing her to marry and submit to the sin of sex.


	Converting her suffering into evangelism, she starts preaching that fornication is the curse separating man from God. After three days of boisterous worship, noise complaints prompt municipality officials to have Ann dragged out and tossed into a prison cell, where Fastvold and Corbet's script takes perhaps its most extravagant license. I get the levitation, but the sudden covering of soft, downy white fur? Mercifully it comes off but only increases Ann's thirst for true righteousness.


	The most involving section begins after Ann and others start believing she is the second coming, calling her “Mother.” Accompanied by a small group that includes her loving brother William (Lewis Pullman) — who tames his own taboo sexual proclivities to get with the celibacy program — they cross the Atlantic.

	











	The detailed construction of the 18th century ship is impressive, as are all the physical set builds, most of them done at the same studios in Hungary where The Brutalist was made. Fastvold and Corbet clearly have figured out how to get bang for their buck on large-scale period films that would be exponentially costlier as studio productions.


	The arrival in America requires adjustments, and there's some disharmony within the group, notably when Abe puts his foot down after six years of abstinence and demands what he considers his conjugal rights. But the shift in location that follows has a lovely Thoreauvian quality as Ann and her group set out into nature in search of isolation and transcendence. One of the members, John Hocknell (musician, playwright and stage performer David Cale), buys a piece of land on which to build and start a farm.


	The period that follows includes successes, in terms of expanding the flock, and setbacks, usually stemming from word getting out to people instantly threatened by any belief that veers from their own. The drama builds with its share of distressing scenes to a violent climax as attacks against the peaceful community intensify.


	I wish I could say I found the arc of Ann's life more affecting, but there's a stodgy quality to the narrative only partly ameliorated by the rhapsodic beauty of the songs (even that can wear a bit thin) and the chiming notes of Blumberg's score, which effectively introduces non-period electronic elements. That said, Seyfried, McKenzie, Pullman and Abbott all make strong impressions and are clearly in sync with the director's vision.

	











	Ultimately, Fastvold commands admiration for mounting a project clearly conceived with few commercial concerns. Without pushing the point in any obvious way, she suggests contemporary parallels with the Shakers' desire for equality across the entire spectrum of civil and religious rights and their rejection of any form of tyrannical rule. The filmmaker also deserves credit for making something that could not be called a faith-based movie and yet treats the religious beliefs of its subjects with profound respect.

The Brothers Gallagher played their first show in the New York area since 2008 on Sunday (Aug. 31), and were clearly a little overwhelmed by the experience.


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



	“Nobody has fans like this. Nobody.” 


	Whether or not it was technically true, Noel Gallagher's pre-encore observation about the tens of thousands who packed into East Rutherford, New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on Sunday night (Aug. 31) to see Oasis‘ first gig in the New York area (the entire East Coast, really) since 2008 couldn't be considered much of an exaggeration. For two months now, Oasis fans new and old have been swarming major cities one at a time at a level rarely seen outside of Taylor Swift and Beyoncé tours, lining the streets with box-logo shirts and bucket hats and impromptu “Don't Look Back in Anger” singalongs as the Brothers Gallagher ready their next triumphant mini-residency. If other bands have fans on the same level, they certainly aren't showing out like this in 2025. 


	And now, Oasis have finally conquered the States, territory that proved at least somewhat resistant to the band upon its first invasion in the mid-'90s. Three decades later, the lads are packing MetLife Stadium with more fans and merch than the woeful Jets and Giants might be able to manage for many weeks in this upcoming NFL season. Given the context, it's hardly shocking — though also somewhat touching — that even the historically unimpressed Gallaghers couldn't help but be a little sentimental at the showing, as they were throughout Sunday night's typically spectacular first of two gigs at the New Jersey venue.


	Though surprises were few outside of the occasional mushiness — a well-oiled machine by now, Oasis stuck to the same 23-song setlist it's played at every show so far on the Live '25 Tour, albeit with new intro music this time in The Rolling Stones' psych-era gem “We Love You” — there were plenty of highlights to be had on Sunday. Here were five of the biggest.






	Early in the set, after a soaring “Some Might Say,” Liam put to bed the notion that, despite his band's somewhat contentious relationship with America, that they lacked affection for the U.S. of A: “No, we like coming here,” he swore. What he didn't like, he clarified, were the people who told him “You gotta play the game, kids” — presumably when it came to stateside media and radio and promo and such — “or else you'll be chopped liver.” The brothers' refusal to follow industry rules may have hurt their American prospects back in the late '90s, but Sunday night's sold-out crowd certainly validated their approach in the long term, as Liam testified: “I'm standing here in this beautiful stadium to tell you you don't have to play the game.”


	“Gonna need your help in the choruses,” Liam tasked the audience when gearing up for the Be Here Now power ballad “Stand By Me,” while also pre-emptively chiding anyone in the stands still worried about not looking cool: “No one's keeping score here.” If they were, though, it would've been point: Liam, as the crowd lifted the singer across the song's refrains like it was one of the band's signature hits — somewhat ironic, since in the U.S., it was never even officially released as a single, and thus relatively unlikely as a particular stateside crowdpleaser. Nobody knows the way it's gonna be, indeed.


	Liam introduced Definitely Maybe peak “Slide Away” as one “for the lovebirds,” before jokingly assuring the crowd that they were safe from any “Coldplay cameras.” Even if there were, couples in the crowd would have likely still been unable to resist getting a little PDA-ish in response to the heart-melting love song — which has become such a highlight of the band's Live '25 show that fans were already singing it (along with the climactic “Take me there!” chants) in the bathrooms ahead of the show. 


	After kicking off the band's encore with fan-favorite B-side “The Masterplan,” Noel asked for a show of hands of who had never seen the band before. “You might've wondered what it might be like to sing this next song with 60, 70,000 of your fellow Oasis fans,” he teased for those with their hands up. “Well, you're going to find out what that feeling is like.” Naturally, the band subsequently launched into “Don't Look Back in Anger” — and there wasn't a silent throat in the house as Noel let the crowd take both of the song's first two choruses, ably demonstrating that even the first-timers knew the drill when it came to the lads' preeminent singalong. 


	As the band winded down its stupefyingly loaded encore — with a run of “Anger,” “Wonderwall” and “Champagne Supernova” that still feels almost unsportsmanlike for a show's closing run — a dazzling display of fireworks lit up the East Rutherford sky. Launched from MetLife's top level, the fireworks felt like an appropriately momentous capper to a stellar first New York-area stadium outing — one that proved that Oasis had won the game, whether or not they'd ever really played it.

	Police are investigating the death of a white adult male who was found in a “pool of blood” at the Burning Man festival on Saturday night, Aug. 30, just as the “Man” effigy was beginning to be torched.

	The Pershing County Sheriff's Office Deputy was flagged down at the campsite in Black Rock City at about  9.14pm, where a male was found to be lying on the ground, “obviously deceased,” a statement reads.

	Forensics specialists have been called in to help with the collection of evidence and processing the scene in the northern Nevada desert. Officers, at this stage, are treating the death as a homicide.


	Although this act appears to be a “singular crime,” all participants “should always be vigilant of their surroundings and acquaintances,” reads a statement signed by Pershing County Sheriff Jerry Allen on Sunday, Aug. 31.

	The identity of the man hasn't been released and no further information will be available at this time, the message continues, “but it will be released as appropriate to provide communication, while still preserving the integrity of the complicated investigation of a crime in a city which will be gone by the middle of the week.”


	The Pershing County Sheriff's Office, which investigates all deaths that occur in its jurisdiction, will be the primary source of further information.

	











	Burning Man organizers said they are cooperating with law enforcement. “If you are in Black Rock City,” reads a statement from Burning Man Project, “do not interfere with law enforcement activity.”


	Earlier, producers of the annual gathering announced that several installations and projects had been destroyed or damaged following a fierce sandstorm. Among them, the Orgy Dome space was closed to the public following damage by heavy winds, and a 50 foot tall art installation called Black Cloud, created by a team of artists from Ukraine, was reportedly damaged.

Martin has spoken candidly of alcohol addiction after a troubling performance at Schaghticoke Fairgrounds on Friday night (Aug. 29).

	Country artist Bryan Martin has put his hand up after he was pulled off stage, intoxicated, and forcibly removed by police.


	Martin's performance at Schaghticoke Fairgrounds on Friday night (Aug. 29) went south, and caused enough concern among fans and event organizers that the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Office was notified.


	According to a statement from local police, Martin “displayed signs of intoxication and erratic behavior, which ultimately required him to be removed from the stage. Deputies and event staff attempted to assist Mr. Martin offstage, but due to his impaired state, he became resistant and had to be forcibly escorted out.”

	The moment was captured on camera, and shows Martin lifted and removed from the site by a small team of officers.

	











	Martin later turned to social media to apologize for — and explain —  his behavior. “Sorry I let yall down tonight… truth is I'm not ok… been hitting it hard for a while and haven't took time to be honest with myself about my mental health and it's nothing new to struggle with my anxiety and depression,” he writes in a post on Instagram.

	Martin continued, “I apologize for the bad days … but I'm grateful for the countless good nights we've shared this year. It's been the most consistent streak I've seen in years.”




	He continued, “I'm not ever proud when I reach for another drink.”


	In the hours following the incident, reads the police report, Martin “acknowledged that he is struggling with alcoholism. This admission shifts the perspective from one of conflict to one of compassion.”


	The larger issue is “not the resistance we encountered—it is the battle Mr. Martin himself is facing,” reads a message from Sheriff Kyle Bourgault. “Addiction is a disease, and it requires both accountability and empathy.”


	The Louisiana native reportedly performed the following night at 290 Maine Street in Norway, ME.


	Martin, who is signed to Average Joes Records, has had hits including “We Ride,” which reached No. 3 on Billboard Country Airplay chart last year. The single also gave Martin his first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, entering at No. 96.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	Close to 30 years have passed since Doug Liman's breakout feature Swingers played in the Venice Film Festival's now defunct Overtaking Lane sidebar devoted to emerging directors, having been rejected by Sundance.


The Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow director was back on the Lido this year unveiling his XR thriller Asteroid, which is among 30 works competing in Venice's Film Festival Immersive Competition.


	Starring Hailee Steinfeld, Rhenzy Feliz, DK Metcalf, Ron Perlman, Frieda Pinto and Leon Mandel, the work revolves around a group of strangers who head to an asteroid in an old Russian Soyuz rocket on a risky mission to mine wealth beyond their wildest dreams. Only one of the space travelers will return to Earth.

	It is the latest work from 30 Ninjas, the immersive studio Liman created more than a decade ago with Julina Tatlock and Jed Weintrob using technological developments to expand the boundaries of storytelling.


	Produced by 30 Ninjas in association with Google's 100 Zeros, Asteroid is among a slate of XR films being lined up for the launch this fall of Android XR, the new operating system, combining AI, AR and VR, being developed by Google and Samsung.


	“At 30 Ninjas, our mission has been to embrace new technology and storytelling. I have always been interested in movies that reflect the moment they're made — that can be through the content, but also, the technology,” Liman told Deadline in Venice.


	“I'm a huge fan of Jim Cameron because he's on the cutting edge. He's telling stories that couldn't have been told until that moment in time,” he continued, adding that the work's unveiling in Venice had extra resonance for him. 


	“I'm sitting here in Venice, not far from where I first premiered Swingers, which I was also able to make because of new technology.”


	Written by and starring Jon Favreau, Swingers was a buddy comedy about a struggling comedian getting over heartache shot over the course of 18 days on a budget of just $250,000. It went onto gross $4.6 million at the U.S. box office.

	











	“Back then we shot movies on film, but there were new film stocks, and I thought, ‘With these film stocks, I can shoot a movie without a crew and lights, and with the camera on my shoulder.' I was like, ‘People have been shooting movies the same way for 100 years. I think given where film stocks have evolved to, I can change how you shoot a movie.' Swingers doesn't look like other movies, and I think it's a better movie for that.”


	“Right from the beginning, my career has been intertwined with advances in technology and obviously with Asteroid, this is by far the most ambitious thing I've ever done. It's a giant Hollywood movie idea told in a VR headset and that just hasn't existed before. The reason I'm so proud of it, is it was so friggin' hard to make and why I now get why it hasn't existed before.”


	The Asteroid experience, tried out by Deadline in Venice, features a pre-chat with NFL player Metcalf generated by Gemini, Google's AI assistant; an immersive 180-degree, live-action short, and an  interactive extension, also using Gemini technology, in which the viewer is given the opportunity to help  solve what really happened on the perilously icy slopes of the asteroid.


	The 180-degree short immediately plunges the viewer into chaotic scenes inside the Russian Soyuz rocket as Metcalf's character has second thoughts and tries to quit the vessel via a hatch before it lifts off, with the story proceeding on the icy terrain of the asteroid, and then an interrogation room as one of the crew members is questioned on what went down on the trip.   


	Steinfeld emerges as an ambivalent figure whose true motives for her actions remain unclear. Mandel plays a former Russia astronaut, whose avarice gets the better of him, while Perlman's character is an older man struggling to cope with harsh terrain and sub-zero temperatures. Pinto plays as an official leading the investigation back on Earth.


	“Asteroids is a story I've been wanting to tell for a long time … in my movies, I pride myself on my world building, and part of the world building is the visual spectacle but it's also about the characters,” said Liman.


	“In the way that The Bourne Identity changed how you looked at a spy movie, I've been very interested in doing movies or stories told in outer space with characters who have no business in being there. Characters who look up at the moon and see money, not romance,” he continued. 


	“In Asteroid, five of them are cramming into a Soyuz capsule that's designed for three because they think there's a trillion dollars to be made on an asteroid that's passing near Earth.”


	Perlman, who also made the trip to Venice alongside cast members Feliz, Metcalf and Mandel, said working on the XR thriller had been an revelatory experience.


	“I thought that I had done everything in show business until I saw this,”” said the veteran actor.  “I'm gonna have to stick around for a little while longer to be able to say, been there, done that.”


	“Sometimes it felt a little detached. but Doug knew exactly what he needed to do for the storytelling in this thing, including the fights with the gravity and conditions,”


	For Liman, Asteroid was one of most technically challenging films that he has ever shot.


	“The moment you say you're going to cram people in a teeny space and shoot that for a VR headset you're in for a world of hurt. Right from the beginning you're like, ‘You can't do that, you can't get the camera that close to people,' but you have to be close because the space is claustrophobic when they're in the capsule.

	











	“Technically how to film that was more ambitious than any filming I've ever done,” he continues, adding further challenges included capturing the impact of the different gravitational forces in the capsule and on the asteroid.


	“The world building of the asteroid, I loved. My production designer from Edge of Tomorrow (Oliver Scholl) designed the asteroid. Some of that is sort of conventional, but how you technically film for the headset and give the audience a Hollywood cinematic experience … it's more technology than I've ever used in a movie.”


	30 Ninjas co-partner Weintrob added: “All the stuff in the spaceship and on the asteroid is performance capture in the game engine Unreal, then touched up with VFX, which enabled us to get that close into the capsule and the characters, but also with a huge focus on performance fidelity of the actors. None of it's generated. It's all live performance capture. All the actors were scanned using Google's next generation top secret scanning stage. Then the stuff in the interrogation room is shot with a somewhat more traditional camera.”


	Liman and his 30 Ninja partners said it was too early to say whether there will be further instalments of Asteroid, or indeed a feature film spinning off the immersive experience. For now, the next focus is nailing down the extension element of the overall experience.


	“This started as a feature script which I cut down, or just one part of it, to create a short film. I haven't made a short film since film school. They're really hard. If you saw my film school short films, you would be like, ‘Oh my God, these things are terrible.' I literally have never made a good short film until Asteroid… it's never too late,” said Liman.


	“There is a full story I want to tell of Asteroid that is feature length or longer and then part of the excitement of getting to do this with Google and with the Android XR headset is that I'm hoping you want to know more. With The Bourne Identity, you wanted more, and you got four more movies,” said Liman. 


	“My goal is to create movies and experiences that people want more of… but I'm also really excited about where it's going with the story extension,” he continued. “You're just getting a little taste of it. The film is done, other than a few technical things that I noticed here, because it's really right off the press, but you only saw part of the story extension. My plan had been to do the short for Android as a launchpad to go make the feature. The reality is that the experience is so powerful in 180-degrees, that I've set a very high bar for what I would hope to create on the big screen if I did it for Imax because as incredible as Imax is, it's hard  for it to compete with the experience you have watching on a headshot.”


	A feature version of Asteroid remained an ambition, he continued but said no such had project had been greenlighted as yet.


	“We could end up making seven more instalments for the headset… I've learned so much about storytelling on this… I was also planning to go shoot a movie in outer space with Tom Cruise and the reality is the experience you have watching Asteroid on the Android XR is that you are so inside a Hollywood movie in a way I've never experienced before,” said Liman


	Pressed on the outer space project with Cruise, first revealed by Deadline in 2020, Liman said it remained on the cards, but there were no updates.

	











	“I've just finished this [Asteroid] so I'm now processing what next and what I learned, part of it will be how the audience reacts to it. You'd rather I give you more concrete answers but you're getting me totally raw… I don't know where it leaves me. I know I want to do more in space… I am more excited about this idea of characters who have no business of going into space after making this. In the way, I was excited after The Bourne Identity, “ said Liman.


	“My movies are all anti-heroes. Tom Cruise is a coward in Edge of Tomorrow; he's a full on criminal in American Made; Matt Damon kills people for a living in The Bourne Identity; and Brad and Angie both kill people for a living [Mr. and Mrs. Smith]. I'm interested in like my kinds of characters going into space and I love that in Asteroid, we got to cram five of them into this teeny second-hand capsule.”


	Liman added that shooting a film in outer space remained on his bucket list but that nothing was scheduled as yet, with both he and Cruise tied up in other projects. 


	“I'm more excited about going to space, not less … but our goal is too make something great. A lot of people are trying to do gimmicky things like, ‘Oh, it's in space.' I'm not interested in doing something that's a just promotional gimmick. I want to make a film that people watch in a hundred years when maybe there's hundreds of movies shot in outer space and there's nothing special about it being in outer space. That's the goal of everything I do. With Swingers, it's very meaningful to me that lots of people who watch it weren't even born when it premiered here.”


	“If I ever shoot a movie in outer space, the question will be what could I do that you couldn't do on Earth that makes for a great piece of entertainment, that's better than if you didn't do it it space. Again, its also about technology and storytelling… you can run a line from Swingers all the way through to this potential film in outer space.”

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	The Shaking Quakers might sound like a '90s rock band from the state of Georgia but it's actually an accurate description of the late 18th-century religious sect we now know simply as the Shakers. Contrary to the image presented by their immaculate furniture, the Shakers were quite a messy bunch, given to involuntary expressions of rapture, a very physical and even sensual act that's entirely antithetical to their sexually uptight dogma. Needless to say, their obsession with celibacy didn't catch on, and may explain why the Shakers all but died out in recent times. This strange and oddly visceral film by Mona Fastvold captures the group's enduring appeal by joining in with all that crazy, puritanical abandon, and the result, like any religion, is suitably divisive. Like, really divisive.

	











	It begins with the early life the group's founder, Ann Lee, born in Manchester in 1736 and the second eldest of eight children. Ann, seldom seen without her loyal brother William, is pious from the get-go, promising her heart to God. The catalyst comes when Ann, played now by Amanda Seyfried, attend a salon at the home of Jane and James Wardley, founders of The Wardley Society. Recently estranged from the Society of Friends — aka The Quakers — the Wardleys are busily espousing their own gospel, positing that for his Second Coming, Christ will take female form, something described in the book of Revelation as “[a] woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ann is about to take this to heart. After marrying Abraham (Christopher Abbott), a local blacksmith, she gives birth to four children, all of which die in infancy. As the film's narrator tells us, Ann Lee sees this as God's judgment on her, and “with nothing left to lose, she boldly turned her suffering into evangelism.” This is bad news for Abraham, for whom religion is a kink, lightly whipping Ann while tut-tutting about original sin during their highly formal lovemaking sessions. In an ingenious case of “hold my beer.” Ann then takes his hypocritical moralism to the next level, refuting sexual behavior of any kind, renouncing “fornication” even for the purposes of reproduction.

	











	As her notoriety grows, drawing unwanted attention from the police for disrupting regular Christian gatherings, Ann decides to take her brood further afield; to New England, where “their hearts and minds are spoiled.” So it happens that, in 1774, Ann charters a boat to the New World, taking a violent sea passage that very nearly wipes out the movement overnight. Reaching New York, Ann uses her gut instincts to find accommodation and, more importantly, patronage, meanwhile sending a three-man party upstate to find a plot of land where they all can settle. Again, Fastvold indulges the sublime, deadpan nonsense in all of this, resulting in some of the film's few outright comedic moments.


	The last third of the film deals with the settlement there and Ann's frequent travels to spread the word, a project that, just as it did in England, riles the authorities and invites brutal retribution. This, really, is the key to the movie; though it follows a very simple trajectory, the story that accumulates is just how much women bring to religion and how little they get back in return. Ann Lee is something of a footnote in today's history books, especially when one considers how much fame was afforded to Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith. It also wryly pokes fun at the importance of sexuality; it's telling that a sect that tried to shut it out entirely is now pretty much a museum piece.


	Reuniting three of the main factors of the success of The Brutalist — Fastvold plus composer Daniel Blumberg and writer-producer Brady Corbet — The Testimony of Ann Lee plays like a light yin to that film's dark yang, telling a similar but much warmer story of troubled genius, social torment, and escape. Though she's clearly some kind of fruitcake, Ann has optimism, compassion and life, which Fastvold reveals in a series of mesmerizing musical numbers taken from real Shaker scriptures. It also helps to have Amanda Seyfried in the leading role; showing a whole new side to herself, Seyfried makes for a very credible messiah, and an earth mother with a great natural gift. But for what? Fastvold's wryly witty saga leaves us to work that out for ourselves.

			Watch on Deadline		







	Dean was a member of Gryffindor House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry alongside Harry, Hermione, and Ron. The half-blood wizard spent many years of his life unaware that his father was a wizard. He was played in the films by Alfred Enoch. 


	The core trio will be played by Dominic McLaughlin (Harry Potter), Alastair Stout (Ron Weasley), and Arabella Stanton (Hermione Granger) on the small screen.


	Crabbe and Goyle were members of House Slytherin and were always side by side with Draco Malfoy, doing his bidding. Both are pure blood wizards and the children of Death Eaters. Jamie Waylett and Josh Herdman played Crabbe and Goyle, respectively, in the films. 


	Draco will be played in the series by Lox Pratt.


New Hogwarts staff include:


	Sirine Saba as Professor Pomona Sprout, Richard Durden as Professor Cuthbert Binns, and Bríd Brennan as Madam Poppy Pomfrey.


	Professor Sprout is the Head of Hogwarts' herbology department. She famously nurtured Mandrakes, the shrieking plant that, when mature, its cries could be fatal. Sprout was a member of House Hufflepuff as a young student, who grew up to become Head of Hufflepuff House. Miriam Margolyes played Sprout in the films.


	Professor Binns is a wizard who taught Hogwarts students the History of Magic. After his death, his ghost continued teaching. He is famous for being the only ghost to teach at Hogwarts and for his amazingly boring teaching style. The character of Binns exists in J.K. Rowling's novels, but the character was not in the films. 

	











	Madam Poppy Pomfrey played a vital role in the lives of Hogwarts students as a matron, who nursed the sick and injured. Although she was known for being strict, she stood by her students during Hogwarts' darkest and most challenging days. Gemma Jones played Madam Pomfrey in the films.


	Earlier casting includes John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall, Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape, and Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid. Additionally, Bertie Carvel will play Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, and Johnny Flynn will portray Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy. The Dursleys, Harry's aunt and uncle, will be brought to life by Bel Powley as Petunia and Daniel Rigby as her husband Vernon. 


	The series, set to premiere in 2027, is based on the beloved books by Rowling, who serves as executive producer with Neil Blair, Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films. The new Harry Potter project is written by Francesca Gardiner, who executive produces alongside Mark Mylod, director of multiple episodes. HBO produces the original title in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television.

	“It's my first time in Venice,” Dwayne Johnson told the audience this morning as gingerly he entered the room for the official presser for his competition title The Smashing Machine.


	The veteran WWE fighter turned actor was joined at the presser by his co-star, Emily Blunt, and director Benny Safdie. The film, which debuts this evening in Venice, marks Safdie's first outing as a solo director. 


	The film follows fighter Mark Kerr (Johnson) from the no-holds-barred era of the UFC at the peak of his career as he questions himself and struggles with life and his relationships. Meanwhile, Mark's girlfriend Dawn Staples (Blunt) struggles as well to find her place in Mark's chaotic and contradictory world.

	On why he decided to tackle mixed martial arts with a story set in the 1990s, Safdie told the crowd in Venice: “At that time period, there was something so experimental about what was going on. You had all of these different martial arts forms competing against one another, and it was just such a unique sport.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Safdie added: “It was also such a close-knit community, where everybody knew one another and everybody loved one another, and there was such a closeness amongst them, and to have that contradiction of this fighting world, but this love between them was something that was really beautiful to me, and I wanted to explore that.”


	During the presser, Johnson spoke consistently about how this film quenched his longtime desire to challenge himself as an actor and push past his reputation as a performer who is only suitable for blockbuster flicks. 


	“When you're in Hollywood, it becomes about box office. And you chase the box office. And the box office in our business can be very resounding, and it could push you into a category,” Johnson said. 


	“I made those movies, and I liked them. They were fun. Some were really good and did well. And some not so much. But what I did realize is that I had this burning desire, and a voice in my head that said, What if there is more?” 

	











	Johnson added that when you're “pigeonholed” as an actor, it becomes increasingly difficult to push yourself artistically. He said it is only possible to switch directions when “people who you love and you respect, like Emily and Benny, say, you can do it.” 


	Mark Kerr was a two-time UFC Heavyweight Tournament Champion, World Vale Tudo Championship tournament winner, a Pride FC heavyweight champion, 1992 NCAA national wrestling champion, 1994 National Freestyle Champion, and 4x ADCC World Submission Champion. In 2003, he was the subject of an HBO documentary titled The Smashing Machine, which detailed his MMA career fighting in Vale Tudo, the UFC, and Pride.


	On her role as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn Staples, Blunt said she was “delighted that there was a woman in the midst” of the violent MMA world. 


	“There was a lot going on behind closed doors of what it means to live with a fighter and be with a fighter. The all-consuming world of that,” Blunt said. “I got to know Dawn well, and she was very generous with her story, with me, the full weather system of it, the regrets, the eruptions, the hazardous nature of the relationship at times, and the deep, profound love and devotion they had to each other amidst an impossible environment.” 


	Blunt said her Smashing Machine role was distinct from many other roles she's played, which she said were more “curated” movie arc relationships. Smashing Machine, she said, provided a more “full spectrum of what a relationship really looks like,” including both ups and downs. 


	“It was just exciting to be able to work like that with Benny's visceral way of shooting that was so spontaneous, so it was just like the guardrails came off for us every day,” Blunt added.


	Producers on The Smashing Machine include Safdie via his Out for the Count banner, and Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Hiram Garcia for Seven Bucks Productions. David Koplan and Eli Bush are also producers. Ryan Bader, Bas Rutten, and Oleksandr Usyk round out the film's cast.


A24 will release the film theatrically on October 3.


	Venice runs until September 6.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	“The ghost of Alfred Hitchcock was undeniably present during the making of this film,” says a note in the closing credits of Alexandre O. Philippe's latest artisanal documentary, Kim Novak's Vertigo. For once, though, the film's subject has nothing but affection for the late master of suspense, clearly having fared better than Tippi Hedren did in the pantheon of Hitchcock blondes. Indeed, the 92-year-old sees their one and only collaboration — on 1958's celebrated thriller Vertigo — as the highlight of her movie career, which opened with a bang and ended with a slow fade after she willfully absented herself from Hollywood (she now lives in Oregon).

	











	Philippe tells that story in a roundabout way; like some of his previous films (Chain Reaction, Lynch/Oz or Memory: The Origins of Alien), Kim Novak's Vertigo is all about subtext and nuance as opposed to any kind of objective truth. Towards the end of the film, Novak decides that she has lived “a big, beautiful circle,” and this is the approach Philippe has embarked on, taking no small inspiration from Vertigo's unforgettable title sequence and the hypnotic, almost psychedelic spirals devised by graphic designer Saul Bass.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In this respect, the title has a double meaning, the more literal interpretation being Novak's uneasiness with life at the top. Not only does she recoil at the thought of ever having been a movie star, she even refutes the word actor, claiming to have been more of a re-actor, like her Vertigo co-star James Stewart, whose toes come under special scrutiny in a clip from their second 1958 pairing, Bell, Book and Candle. In fact, the Hollywood years are recalled with something approaching horror; having stumbled into acting after a brief stint modelling for a refrigerator company, the Chicago-born Novak soon found herself under contract to Columbia Pictures and its notoriously controlling head Harry Cohn, who called her “the fat Polack” and made her change her first name from Marilyn to Kim.

	











	This particular experience is at the very heart of Philippe's film and leads us to the other meaning of the film's title. Though it is ostensibly a thriller about a very elaborate murder plot, Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is actually a study of obsession in which Novak effectively plays two roles: the mousey brunette Judy and the ice-cool blonde Madeleine. It doesn't take a degree in psychology to see how this relates to Novak's own insecurities — “I was Marilyn Novak from nowhere,” she says — and her feelings of impostor syndrome. It also rather brilliantly illustrates her frustrations with Hollywood, a town she talks so much about leaving that it's easy to forget her movie career lasted nearly 40 years.


	“I had to get reborn,” she says, and running through the film — alongside clips from her mostly underrated performances in the likes of The Man With the Golden Arm (1955), Pal Joey (1957), Kiss Me, Stupid (1964), and the delirious, almost Fassbinder-esque Hollywood drama The Legend of Lylah Clare (1968) — is her ethereal artwork, which she paints with her left hand. Hitch's influence can be seen here too, in the circles and spirals that fill the frame, although the director — inserting himself into his own story, which might be a first for Philippe — points out that her romantic depictions of birds, and bluebirds in particular, is distinctly at odds with Hitchcock's famously dim view of them.


	The climax of the film, if it can be called that, comes when Philippe discovers the iconic gray suit that Novak wears in Vertigo when she's playing Judy, who's pretending to be Madeleine. The emotion Novak shows is a lot, especially considering it's just been sitting in a box upstairs the whole time and it hasn't taken any special effort to find it. It does, however, take her spinning back in time, to a brief but clearly momentous period in her early 20s, and her power of recall is truly remarkable, not even just for her age. “My body was in this, and my body and soul were in it too,” she marvels, and it immediately takes on the significance of a sacred relic. (Does she try it on? Spoiler: She does not.)Chances are, the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock was also in the house when Philippe's film premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where he debuted Spellbound (1945), Rear Window (1954) and To Catch a Thief (1955). Hitch would undoubtedly approve, because Kim Novak's Vertigo only adds to the mystique of one of his many masterpieces, augmenting its many layers of mystery without seeking to explain and thus destroy them. More importantly, it gives Novak an excuse (she humbly calls it “permission”) to look back on her life and give us her side of the story — unapologetic and, right from the start, impressively unfiltered.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


	It was a fairly sleepy weekend at the international box office as summer draws to a close in many of the majors. Still, there were some strong holds out there and one big new milestone. 


	Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps crossed the five-century mark globally, reaching $505.1M in the 6th frame. The offshore cume is $240.5M after adding $4.4M this weekend. That was just a 29% drop from last session, with significant holds in key majors including Brazil (+35%/No. 1 again), UK (-1%), France (-24%), Mexico (-33%), Spain (-36%), Australia (-37%) and Netherlands (-38%).

F4:FS remains the highest grossing superhero release of 2025 across the Latin American region as well as Italy and Thailand. It's the No. 8 studio movie of the year both internationally and worldwide.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The Top 5 overseas for the family are: UK ($31M), Mexico ($28.2M), France ($16.2M), Brazil ($14.4M) and Australia ($11.4M).


	New movies this session included Searchlight's The Roses with $9.2M in 40 overseas markets ($17.2M global including the estimated 4-day domestic opening). The comedy update was No. 1 in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands and a handful of other markets. 


	Opening in about 89% of the international footprint, the start is comping ahead of Game Night in like-for-likes at today's rates. In the Netherlands, the Olivia Colman/Benedict Cumberbatch-starrer posted the biggest opening weekend ever for Searchlight (excluding previews). 


	The Top 5 starts are: UK ($3M), Germany ($800K), France ($800K), Netherlands ($700K) and Italy ($600K).


	Key markets still to release include Australia, Korea and Japan. 


	Holdover play for the studios was led by Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2 which added another six markets, including Germany. In total, 75 offshore markets rustled up $12.5M for a $103.5M international cume and $176.5M global so far. The overseas drop was a mere 19% while the sequel is running above the original, excluding China.

	











	At present, the Top 5 markets are: China ($23.3M), UK ($15.9M), France ($10.5M), Spain ($7.2M) and Mexico ($6M).


	Australia releases later this month.


	New Line/Warner Bros' Weapons put another $9.4M in the arsenal from 74 offshore markets, taking the overseas cume to $100M and global to $234.6M.

	The Top 5 through Sunday are: UK ($13.9M), Mexico ($8.6M), France ($7.6M), Spain ($7M) and Australia ($5.9M).


	Elsewhere, and before it debuts domestically in a little under two weeks, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle continued its Southeast Asia run via Sony/Crunchyroll, lifting the cume to $42M from nine markets after a $4.3M third weekend. The anime hit is now bigger than Incredibles 2, Ne Zha 2, Toy Story 4, Moana 2 and The Super Mario Bros. Movie across like markets. Among those are Hong Kong ($9.4M), Indonesia ($6.9M), Thailand ($6.5M), Malaysia ($5.9M), Philippines ($5.8M), and Vietnam ($4.4M).


	In total, including non-Sony markets, comScore has the international weekend at $20.4M while the global cume on the Aniplex/Ufotable movie has surpassed $250M. Releases are still to come in North America, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, UK, Spain, France and Germany.

Shame the film hasn't done bigger numbers, it's a better film than James Gunn's live action Saturday morning cartoon Superman.

they don't need to be set up against each other, they're both refreshingly colorful and imaginative takes on some of the most iconic characters in comics.

I for one prefer Superman—better fights, more emotional moments, it's camp in the way that Superman has always been and is supposed to be (if you're not doing something like Kingdom Come), it's funnier, it has better castings, seeing him fly in Dolby was exhilarating—but it's neat that the best superhero team in comics finally have an actually good movie, and that Marvel are expanding their aesthetic repertoire.

oh, and actual Galactus instead of the vaguely intimidating cosmic cloud was astonishing.

Weapons, Materialists, Freakier Friday are three examples that together show the hope for an actual future for hollywood – we need to reset back to a time when more modestly budgeted films were the standard, where something like Weapons could make a healthy profit, something like Materialists can be very low risk and turn a tidy profit, and an intelligently budgeted film like Freakier Friday can underperform a little but still come in black.
These are still profits, not enough to satisfy wall street but then, we want those people to deem films an unacceptable risk and leave us alone – instead let it be be for patient investors content with lower risk lower rewards that allow the creative process to be reinvigorated.
The only hope is that cinemas can stay alive long enough for this reset to take hold

Weapons may turn a profit but Materialists and Freakier Friday are both money losers.

That's fine for the studios but what about the cinemas that need to stay open to actually show the movies in the first place?

If a studio makes a low budget movie, say $50M budget, then it makes say $175M at the box office, that's fantastic news for the studio because they've made a nice profit there, but the cinemas won't be able to sustain themselves on movies like that alone. They need the big budget franchise blockbusters as regularly as possible if they hope to survive.

The movie industry can't simply go back to the days of original movies being the focus because the vast majority of people won't pay to go see them and instead wait for streaming. There's room for originals alongside the franchises and that's how it should be, but there's got to be a healthy balance of both.

Just to be clear no $50 million movie is in profit at $175 million gross, it doesn't make the advertising any cheaper.

Erm. It does. Because you don't need to earn as much to break even you choose cheaper mediums. Time slots etc to advertise. You also don't advertise for as long.

None of those movies you mention are going to drive streaming subscriber numbers – like a blockbuster movie can.

Fantastic Four will be pushed out of the top 10 worldwide grossers of the year by Wicked and Avatar.  No top 10 this year for Marvel.

Is what it is. I think anyone who was paying attention knew this year's MCU releases were going to be lower earners. 

As much as I've always enjoyed Sam as Cap in the comics, in the MCU he had zero setup prior to Brave New World unless you had seen FATWS on Disney+, so expecting the general audience to really care about the new Cap when all they had ever seen was Steve giving him the shield at the end of Endgame (six years earlier!) was a huge gamble.

Thunderbolts was a similar risk, given that none of the characters had appeared since 2021 and even then most of them were on Disney+ shows. As for Fantastic Four, I've read every single issue of their comic books from 1961 to date but even I accept that they have never been massively successful with the mainstream movie audience. That this new movie has made over $500M is, to me, a huge win. Just was never going to be as big as some were hoping.

Bottom line, the three 2025 MCU movies were never going to be hugely successful and especially not at a point where Marvel has had to start regaining the trust with the general audience. That none will be in this year's top ten doesn't surprise me too much.

Next year though, I guarantee you there's gonna be two MCU movies in the top three. No doubt about it.

At least the film is an actual hit. That's what matters. Of course, if China were still taking these films, these would be hits automatically, easily moving past $650M.

Pretty sure Zootopia 2 also will beat FF worldwide.

Yes it will.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","What's the greatest action franchise of all time?","https://www.avclub.com/best-action-franchise-bracket-tournament-round-one","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 16:09:05 GMT","

Before the age of superheroes, action stars were the musclebound good guys that could shoulder evolving, escalating conflicts over the course of a series of films. Like slasher killers—which were the subject of The A.V. Club‘s last big bracket showdown—the immortality of the central characters meant mythologizing a business decision. Earning consistent, dependable profits (whether in gigantic blockbusters or in the direct-to-video bin) entailed stretching fictions to the breaking point, replacing actors, retconning deaths, and otherwise making legends out of hunky A-listers and wooden martial artists. In the dog days of tentpole season, now's the perfect time to pit them all against each other to find the greatest action franchise of all time.

From the martial arts movies that Bruce Lee helped popularize to the unlikely underdogs trapped in single locations that followed Die Hard, which action series hit audiences hardest? Many of the best action movies, while they may have led to sequels or inspired prequels, often feel freed from the baked-in need to continue forward. But in the serialized world of stakes-raising, fight-aping, plot-complicating action franchises, maintaining the rush across multiple films is just another way that choreographers, directors, and stunt professionals could prove themselves in the underappreciated trenches. That's something special that even a standalone stunner can't boast.

So here is our Action Franchise Tournament, a five-round, single-elimination battle royale. Over the next five days, 32 franchises—seeded as if they were heading to Martial Arts Island to duke it out in front of a sinister benefactor—will compete for the title belt. Each day, half the contenders will tap out, until only two franchises face off for the final prize. We'll crown a winner on Friday.

To make it a bit more orderly, we set ourselves some limits. For a series to qualify, it had to contain at least three entries. It also needed to be intentionally and predominantly—if not entirely pure—action. That means film series that muddy the genre waters with too much fantasy or sci-fi or superhero spandex were best left on the sidelines. There are certainly franchises included in this bracket that have their share of adventure-movie digressions or killer aliens or ravenous zombies, but at their adrenaline-juiced heart, they're here for the fist fights, the chases, and the shoot-outs. For this initial entry, we tackle a ton of franchises at the same time—quite unlike a crowd of henchmen about to move in on a hero one by one.

You, the reader, will also be able to participate in our parallel poll that will be running concurrently with our writers' decisions, found at the link and at the bottom of this very piece. Voting for each round ends every day at 11:59 PM ET. Feel free to complain to the referees, rally for your favorite fighters, and dance around the hot rods.

Winner: Die Hard

The Die Hard films may have eventually devolved into conservative old-man actioners, but that's all The Equalizer films have ever been. Though there's little competition between Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis as movie stars, (un)retired superagent Robert McCall gets blown away by sarcastic screw-up cop John McClane. Willis' take on McClane and Die Hard‘s Swiss watch screenplay had a massive impact on the world of action movies; how many movies are now described as “Die Hard on a [insert differentiating element here]?” That shorthand works because it gets so much across so quickly: A smarmy everyman, brave but certainly not perfect, put into a contained scenario getting way out of hand. As much fun as Washington is as a shadowy, aged killer dispensing life lessons with the same ease as musclebound thugs, he's operating within a genre subtrope. Die Hard established its own. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: In The Line Of Duty

The Rush Hour series is chock-full of what made Jackie Chan special. Combining his high-wire stunts and his inimitable ability to become a Looney Tunes cartoon, the Brett Ratner-helmed franchise is a formative piece in Jackie's crossover canon. Therein lies the rub, however, as no series fronted by Ratner could ever truly surpass a series featuring a who's who of Hong Kong action. The loosely connected In The Line Of Duty series begins with Corey Yuen's Yes, Madam, which also stars a buddy cop team-up in Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock. The films then dovetailed into Royal Warriors, also starring Yeoh, this time paired with Hiroyuki Sanada. Both are rock-solid, but it's In The Line Of Duty III where the series is injected with high-octane adrenaline. Introducing a livewire Cynthia Khan to the proceedings, Hong Kong's most underrated star and series finally take shape. By part IV, directed by the legendary Yuen Woo-Ping, In The Line Of Duty becomes action royalty. A handsome young Donnie Yen joins Khan and, enacting Yuen's jaw-dropping choreography, the two create magic. The series would go on to spawn five more sequels, but those first four movies make In The Line Of Duty a must-see. Rush Hour may have Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker delightfully bouncing off of one another, but their energy pales in comparison to the speeding bullet Cynthia Khan. [Brandon Streussnig]

Winner: Ip Man

You'd be hard-pressed to find two performers more different than Sonny Chiba and Donnie Yen. Chiba broke out as the snarling wild man of 1974's The Street Fighter while Yen is now best known for embodying the unflappable grandmaster in Ip Man. Both performed in the shadow of Bruce Lee. Chiba's trilogy springboarded off the late star's trend-starting martial arts hits, while Yen's series focuses on deifying Lee's Wing Chun teacher. But Yen's melodramatic mythologizing has the edge over Chiba's ridiculously violent (and ridiculously cheap) grindhouse films. No amount of eyeballs knocked out of heads, ripped-out vocal cords, or x-rays of shattered skulls (which inspired Mortal Kombat‘s fatalities) can quite measure up to glossy fights choreographed (and sometimes performed) by Sammo Hung. Both series have something cartoonish about them, either on their surface, like in the increasingly indecipherable Street Fighter plots, or on their edges, like in Ip Man‘s nationalist screeds. But Ip Man gets the edge here, since the over-the-top plots are balanced by filmmaker Wilson Yip's slick, prestige-sheened battles royale. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: Police Story

As the premier franchise for car carnage, Fast & Furious, has become a bloated, neverending mess, France has quietly been pumping out a series with tactile, small-scale vehicular madness. The Lost Bullet films may be tucked away on Netflix, but they contain some of the best stuntwork of the 21st century. Written and directed by Guillaume Pierret, the Lost Bullet trilogy follows down-and-dirty cop Lino (Alban Lenoir) as he's framed for murder and must clear his name, his cars becoming Frankensteined behemoths as the series chugs along. Whatever Lost Bullet lacks in originality, it more than makes up for in burnt-rubber madness. So, it's a little unfair that the Little French Car Franchise That Could is going up against Jackie Chan's finest series. From that face-melting fall through the glass chandelier in the mall at the end of Police Story to the motorcycle chase that announced Michelle Yeoh as an action star in Supercop: Police Story 3, the series is simply Jackie Chan at his best. Without Police Story, Jackie Chan's ascension as the greatest action star of his generation may never have happened. A foot chase after a speeding bus, which turns into hanging off of said bus for dear life, is the stuff of action dreams. After a perfect first three entries and a solid fourth, the series fell prey to the grim, ultra-serious nationalism that's plagued Chinese cinema for the last few decades. The finale, Police Story: Lockdown, might be a swing and a miss, but this is as near-perfect a cop franchise as you'll ever find. [Brandon Streussnig]

Winner: James Bond

Two long-running series about globetrotting, adventuring, sardonic do-gooders whose effectiveness relies on the power of their rotating central performer and the audience's acceptance of the campy, inconsequential plots, the Kickboxer franchise and the James Bond films are unlikely reflections on opposite sides of the budgetary spectrum. Both express the action-movie dream of total masculine individualism—an ability to single-handedly save the day, through either suave secret agent feats of daring or blunt-instrument physical prowess. Kickboxer, though, succumbs to the deeply diminishing returns that 007 has always escaped at the last minute; as soon as the Cannon franchise lost Jean-Claude Van Damme (which was almost immediately, though he returned in the recent reboot films), Kickboxer lost its goofy charisma. Even at their most ridiculous, Bond films still find a higher level of charming fantasy to tap into, whether in their action setpieces, over-the-top sex, or clotheshorse style. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: The Roundup

What we've got here are some thick-cut beefsteaks. Sylvester Stallone and Ma Dong-seok are massive forces of nature, fleshy cannonballs shot into bad guys in their respective franchises. But despite seeming like an underdog (in terms of name recognition, at least), the Korean cop series is infinitely more enjoyable than the bloody carnage scattered by John Rambo. First Blood is a killer B-movie, smarter and more emotional than the majority of its peers; everything after is lucky if it has an exciting set piece or two to offset its mumbly, meatheaded warmongering. And yet, those in search of good-natured mumbly meatheadedness need look no further than the films of Lieutenant Ma Seok-do a.k.a. The Beast Cop. Ma hams it up in the role, acting like he can barely fit through doorways, wielding his outsized mass (which Stallone has always made grotesque) with a chummy confidence. Rambo is a haunted, hollow-eyed murder machine. Ma has bad dates, tired knees, and lousy subordinates—but when he hits someone, it's still like a plunger popping a pinball across the board. The grungy humanity of The Roundup‘s police stories makes them so much more palatable than the racist fantasias that Rambo devolves into, without sacrificing the compelling chases and fights that keep the pulse racing. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: Lethal Weapon

The Bourne films are less about the workmanlike first entry from Doug Liman or the Matt-Damon-less Legacy, care of Andor creator Tony Gilroy. Instead, the legacy of Jason Bourne will be writ nauseatingly in the stars by Paul Greengrass, who convinced Liman's cinematographer, Oliver Wood, to abandon all tripods and transform the rogue supersoldier's globe-trotting antics into barely legible, handheld smears of close-quarters scuffling and digital detritus. As far as visceral action filmmaking goes, the exhilaration of Greengrass' shaky-cam style belies the series' standard spycraft. But Greengrass is no Richard Donner, the steadiest of Hollywood hands, and the ice-cold Bourne films are rarely as delightful as Donner's four Lethal Weapons. In retrospect, it's both a small miracle and potential war crime that Donner could help codify Mel Gibson as a likable leading man, but paired with Danny Glover at his warmest, Martin Riggs (Gibson) is actually wildly unlikable, a deeply traumatized '80s action hero flailing between pre-24 neoliberal brutality and post-Peckinpah slo-mo surreality. Riggs needs Murtaugh (Glover); add Joe Pesci—a manifestation of Riggs' homophobic panic, a small squeaky man who values cleanliness and manners and intimate male friendship—and the franchise is a big violent hug, an essential template for every buddy-cop blowout since. [Dom Sinacola]

Winner: The Matrix

We all know The Matrix. It's silly to run through the merits of a film with Yuen Woo-ping choreography that revolutionized the industry. It is, however, prudent to mention that its greatness doesn't begin and end with the first film. From the mindbending Burly Brawl in Reloaded to the rain-soaked finale of Revolutions, The Wachowski sisters' magnum opus was always more than “Bullet Time.” Aesthetically and thematically, no other action series has changed the landscape of blockbuster filmmaking like The Matrix. But make no mistake, the Undisputed films are also heavyweights. Walter Hill's first entry, Undisputed, featured a clash of boxing titans: Ving Rhames' “Iceman” Chambers against Wesley Snipes' “Undisputed” Hutchen. A prison picture through and through, the redemption tale was a solid one-off. But it's in the confines of direct-to-video where the series shines, introducing the world to perennially undersung action legend Scott Adkins. With the sequel, Last Man Standing, recasting Michael Jai White as Chambers, the series became entirely martial arts-focused. After Adkins exploded in popularity as that film's villain, Boyka, he took over as the star. The follow-up films (Redemption and Boyka) are showcases for Adkins, and he more than lives up to the responsibility. Redemption‘s fight against Marko Zaror remains Adkins' finest outing. The Matrix is the genre-defining icon, but don't count Undisputed out. [Brandon Streussnig]

Winner: Mission: Impossible

These are two franchises that quickly became gratuitous love letters to their stars, one fully defined by its vulgar auteur and the other whose genre-topping stunts were filtered through a procession of directors. Despite Milla Jovovich capably leading the longest-running female-fronted action franchise, very few people can compete with Tom Cruise trying to kill himself in front of a popcorn-munching audience. Paul W.S. Anderson's silly B movies get blown out of the water by M:I‘s AAA heaters, though it's not like they don't share some of the same pulpy DNA. Convoluted plots, skeptical yet interconnected with modernity and technology, devoted to superhuman feats performed by actors pleased to be ogled by the camera and audience alike. And yet, though the video game adaptations (loose as they are) play with the strange maps and boss battles and replayability of their sister medium, Mission: Impossible is the franchise that truly taps into the bewildering, laugh-gasp-evoking, death-defying cool that unexpected, power-fantasy moments in gaming can grant. When Ethan Hunt and his merry band of besties roar through city streets or hang by their fingernails off of rocketships (if that hasn't happened yet, it will soon enough), one is invigorated by the carnival-barker spirit of Evel Knievel—capturing a life-affirming danger in a way no zombies ever could. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: Once Upon A Time In China

“This is not necessary!” Det. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) shrieks in the middle of Bad Boys II. He's in the passenger seat of the Cadillac he and partner Det. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) stole from Dan Marino, in the midst of a high-speed chase requiring Mike to swerve around corpses spilling from the back of the van they're pursuing. An enduring belief behind Michael Bay's auteurism is an acceptance that all cops are psychopaths because the world is psychopathic. So for Marcus and Mike, meaningless reigns, bystanders' lives are fodder, and urban America is a slaughterhouse. Fun stuff, but no match for the picturesque fight scenes and silly-ass, carnivalesque set pieces throughout the six Once Upon A Time In China films. In the hands of Hong Kong legend Tsui Hark, who directed four of the six, the story of folk hero Wong Fei-hung (Jet Li) becomes a myth crafted from action tropes. Dazzling umbrella battles, lion dance competitions, and lines of golden bodies training in unison on sand-swept shores limn the Once Upon A Time In China films with grandeur. The Bad Boys films are equally festooned, but with carnage. Tsui's films celebrate the human form; Bay's films eviscerate it. In this head-to-head, Bad Boys has too many bad vibes. [Dom Sinacola]

Winner: Fast & Furious

With a name like “Vin Diesel,” you're pretty much guaranteed to be either an action hero or some kind of mechanic-themed porn star. But as endearing as nerd-mode Diesel is in his sci-fi Riddick films (and they're really his, since he traded his appearance in Tokyo Drift for the rights to the character), he's best utilized as a high-gravity central character that a solar system of supporters can orbit around. The Dungeons & Dragons dork is simply better with a party. Though Pitch Black is a slick, beautiful little Alien riff—a mode the franchise would return to in the tight third film—The Chronicles Of Riddick expanded out of control like a DM going from helming a one-off to a goofy, full-blown space opera. That's not necessarily always a bad thing; the Fast & Furious only got better by doing so. But it got nutty over time, adding absurdity to its himbo soap opera and Hot Wheels car chases over the course of several films as it found its ridiculous voice. And, of course, it doesn't entirely rely on the questionable charisma of Diesel, since it's got his friends family. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: The Terminator

Unstoppable killing machines making a mockery of humanity, the endless and painful cycle of war: This is where the six-entry Universal Soldier and The Terminator franchises find common ground. Their quality, though, follows opposite trajectories. James Cameron's first two sci-fi gamechangers are unassailable—and much more will be said about them later in this competition—while the trashy Universal Soldier movies didn't find their groove until all but the most devoted DTV sickos had long abandoned the series. By the time John Hyams got his hands on the films nearly 20 years after Roland Emmerich's doofy original, the undead supersolider franchise was in a spot where creative tonal risks were very much encouraged. His harrowing yet meaty fifth and sixth entries, Regeneration and Day Of Reckoning, both worth seeking out, even sound like they might be Terminator films. Hyams' brawling forever-killers develop a great deal of human suffering as they age, which is a far cry from the god-awful middle entries that, for a few films, rely on the MST3K charms of ex-Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Matt Battaglia. Those low lows are just part of why the Soldiers fall here, though. They could still be making bad Terminator movies, and T2 alone would probably be enough to make up for them all. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: Predator

The SPL (or Sha Po Lang) films, born in Hong Kong and eventually becoming co-Thai productions featuring Tony Jaa, are thematically linked action films bonded by women in danger, concerned dads, overly complicated cop plots, and terminal health conditions. The Predator films are thematically linked action films bonded by sick-ass Predators. This is not a fair fight. For every excellent moment of bone-breaking that emerges from the narrative bog of the SPL trilogy, there are hours of Infernal Affairs-lite melodrama to wade through. The Predator films, on the other blade-gauntleted hand, march audiences through jungles of high highs and low lows that maintain a consistent threat. While the post-Predator films dropped off in quality after John McTiernan's gorgeous aliens vs. action figures jungle slasher, Dan Trachtenberg has brought an exciting scrappiness back to this high-tech franchise with Prey and this year's Predator: Killer Of Killers. Despite hitting a nadir with Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem, the Yautja have remained cinematic icons for a reason: They're mysterious enough to be flexible as antagonists and antiheroes, iconic enough in design and arsenal (cloaking device, thermal vision, shoulder-mounted blasters, etc.) to have survived crossover showdowns and disastrous reboots intact. The SPL movies conjure up a shared mood punctuated by moments of adrenaline, but there's nothing as memorable as a spine-hoisting Predator. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: John Wick

A comeback for an action star squares off against the arrival of another. John Wick started small: Once destined for DTV, the Keanu Reeves-led revenge thriller was a back-to-basics action programmer that looked great and moved even better. It served as a strong calling card for stuntman-turned-director Chad Stahelski—who knew it would spawn the finest martial arts/gunplay franchise the West has ever produced? As Wick's epic saga of vengeance ballooned, so did his cast of villains. Its all-star team of action stars added everyone from Mark Dacascos to Scott Adkins to Marko Zaror to Donnie Yen. As the rogues gallery expanded, so did the stunts, culminating in the wildest stair fall you'll ever see on film (performed by the great stuntman Vincent Bouillon). Similarly small-scale and gritty, the first Transporter was another simple tale of vengeance as a fixer sought to clear his name. Announcing Jason Statham to the world as a mean, bald bastard of few words, directors Corey Yuen and Louis Letterier combined for a low-key action classic. By utilizing the Hong Kong model of one guy directing the talky scenes, another directing the fights, The Transporter showed Hollywood a new way of making action and, in turn, provided some of the most stylish, brute-force fights of the aughts. Although the sequels (including an Ed Skrein-led reboot and a TV series nobody saw) were diminished goods, the impact the first had can't be denied. It may not touch Keanu's thirst for bullet-ridden revenge, but its scrappy heart gave us an enduring modern action icon. [Brandon Streussnig]

Winner: A Better Tomorrow

In terms of kids movies operating as gateways to the larger worlds of their genres, the Kung Fu Panda franchise is about as good a starting point as it gets for martial arts movies. With high regard for the classics, a well-stocked voice cast, a charming pair of inter-species dads, and some of DreamWorks' smoothest animation, the silly “Skadoosh” series is better than it has any right to be. But there's no need to stop at the gateway when the riches beyond that threshold are readily available. The heroic bloodshed spilled by John Woo and Chow Yun-fat in their career-making action-crime trilogy isn't just sublime, it was transformative to an entire genre. The rowdy, masculine-not-macho operatics of Woo's shoot-outs and the dudes rock that precede them wield automatic weapons and emotions akimbo. A Better Tomorrow and its two sequels started this movement, with Chow's endless charisma powering Hong Kong action away from honorable hand-to-hand combat and towards loyal gangsters with endless squibs. That its violence is just as cartoonish as the fights in Kung Fu Panda is all part of the fun. [Jacob Oller]

Winner: Mad Max

The movie that gave audiences Jean-Claude Van Damme in all his sweaty, eventually bare-assed glory, Bloodsport is as good as fight tournament movies get. As Frank Dux, JCVD's doe-eyed descent into violence is a sight to behold, and by his final fight (against the great Bolo Yeung), it's impossible not to leap off the couch and scream in triumph with him. None of the sequels, DTV vehicles for Daniel Bernhardt, match the original, but Bernhardt is a hell of a fighter and just as striking and handsome as his predecessor. You won't have a bad time falling down the Kumite rabbit hole. Unfortunately for those svelte, shiny men, we have to give it up for something even sleeker and shinier: Chrome. George Miller's opus started small. Mad Max is a relatively quiet and somber film. As with many series on this bracket, it's a tale of revenge: Mel Gibson's cop, Max Rockatansky, loses his mind with bloodlust after his family is attacked by savage outlaws. By part two, The Road Warrior, Miller's vision of the future was in full view: sadistic car gangs clashing over guzzolene in the wasteland that used to be Australia. The series hit its mythic apex with Oscar darling Fury Road. An equally gonzo, but more contemplative spin-off following Fury Road‘s Furiosa (aptly titled Furiosa) continued to expand the world of Mad Max into an epic Greek tragedy. In his 80s, one might think Miller would be finally slowing down, but as long as that lunatic lives and breathes, there will always be V8 rumblings of another film. [Brandon Streussnig]

“BTG” is the only soap to take a break for an entire holiday week. Other shows typically only take a day off, airing a repeat episode.

“GH” will also be preempted for Labor Day next week, so no new episode will air on Monday, September 1. The hit ABC soap will air a replay episode from January 31, 2025, instead.

Emily Simpson may just be one of the busiest Bravo stars around! The “Real Housewives of Orange County” star is a lawyer by trade, busy raising three kids with her lawyer-husband, Shane Simpson. Add to that the fact that the two recently began hosting a weekly podcast, “Legally Brunette.”

Emily recently chatted with The Daily Dish about her latest endeavors and how they will factor into RHOC.

Emily is no longer a practicing attorney, so her new legal podcast is perfect for her.

She recently told The Daily Dish, “I love doing a legal podcast because it gives me the ability to still feel like I'm in that world cause I do so much research for it.”

“And so, it allows me to research cases and read about things and come up with a plan of what we're gonna talk about, so I really enjoy it, ” Emily explained. I feel like I get to be a nerd, like a law nerd again. And then do it in an entertaining way, cause it's done really well.”

It initially came as a surprise to Emily that so many fans of RHOC were invested in her legal career. They were also intrigued by Shane's fight to pass the bar. “To me, it wasn't that interesting. Just because I've been through law school and done all that. People get really invested in their lives, and it makes sense that they were invested in him and the bar and all of that,” she explained.

The Bravo star also confirmed that she continues to work with California's The Innocence Project, an organization dedicated to helping those who have been wrongly convicted.

“I work with them, just doing a lot of fundraising. There's something that comes up later in the season with the Innocence Project, which is great. They have some things going on. They've reached out and want me to do some things with a legal podcast, so I'm hoping that maybe we can do something together. So, yeah, always in constant contact,” says the reality star.

Have you listened to “Legally Brunette” yet? If so, what are your thoughts on Emily and Shane's podcast?

Fans of “The Voice” are eagerly awaiting the premiere of season 28 on September 22, 2025, and season 29, set to debut in early 2026. 

With two new seasons to look forward to, most fans didn't expect producers to announce on August 26 that auditions would soon open for season 30. The Voice Casting Instagram account said that virtual auditions will take place on September 17 and 18. 

Coaches have not been announced for season 30, but the notification has thrilled many up-and-coming singers hoping to land a spot on the series, which would not likely air until the fall of 2026. 

A post shared by The Voice Casting (@thevoicecasting)

Several winners and past contestants of “The Voice” have celebrated the season 30 announcement, including season 25 winner Asher Havon, who wrote, “SEASON 30 LETS GOOOOOOOO 😍😍”

Season 26 winner Sofronio Vasquez shared one of the casting department's posts in his Instagram Stories and encouraged others to audition, writing, “Its your time!!!!!”

Victor Solomon, who placed fifth on season 20 (and also appeared on season 23 of “American Idol” in 2024), wrote, “Oh woowww🔥🔥🔥🔥 I know this gon be a big one !!”

Auditions for season 30 of “The Voice” are the next chance for up-and-coming artists to try to get on the show, since season 28 and 29 contestants began filming in July. 

Season 28, set to premiere on September 22, will feature coaches Snoop Dogg, Reba McEntire, Michael Bublé, and Niall Horan. They began filming Blind Auditions in early July and have since filmed the Battle and Knockout Rounds. 

Season 29, billed as a “Battle of Champions,” will air in the spring of 2026 with returning coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Adam Levine. They, too, began filming Blind Auditions in July, and their Battle and Knockout Rounds in August. 

To audition for season 30, singers can create a free account on the show's website. Many artists have already commented on the show's season 30 announcement, excited to give it a try — and some plan to return after auditioning before. 

One wrote, “Just turned 30 this year. Had a callback 6 years ago. Maybe this is a sign I need to audition again? 😍”

“First time auditioning for anything this big,” another commented. “I'm excited and nervous 🥹🥹”

Another hopeful admitted, “I've been doing this since I was 16 years old and never got picked, but I still try every time they have an audition”

Headlining action-movie idol and wrestler Dwayne Johnson drops “The Rock” from his identity in all senses to reveal a heartfelt core in Benny Safdie's nimbly executed and oddly endearing “The Smashing Machine.” Johnson, rarely considered a quote-unquote serious actor but most certainly a bona fide movie star thanks to the “Fast and the Furious” films and an abundance of popcorn outings often dismissed by critics, emotionally strips down to play pioneering MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the hole of painkiller addiction while trying to mount a post-rehab comeback. 

 










Safdie's first solo-directed feature after helming episodes of TV's “The Curse” and creatively breaking up with his brother Josh sounds like the stuff of awards-season bait: An actor going out of his range to play a tortured athletic soul, physically transformed in a steroidal, vein-bulged-muscles sense, on the rocky path to redemption.

But “The Smashing Machine” is not that, nor is it “The Wrestler,” either (but that a Bruce Springsteen song also plays in this film at a moment of Mark's rock bottom will put you in the headspace of Darren Aronofsky's melodrama). Safdie's film is rather a sweet duet between a remarkably unembellished Johnson and a blazingly good, blue-collar and freshly blown-out Emily Blunt as his codependent girlfriend and eventual wife Dawn Staples-Kerr. 

 










Johnson is an ideal match for Safdie and the material, bridging without sensation or cloying affect the disconnect between who Mark is in the octagon (intimidating, undefeated, all primal machismo energy) and who he is outside the cage (wounded, insecure, cauliflower-eared). All of that is to say while “Smashing Machine” doesn't play like easy awards catnip, Johnson earns a sizable position among this year's prize-seekers.

While a creative parting of ways has seen mixed success for other auteuristic brother-director pairings (see: the Coens) and makes you wish the gang would just get the hell back together again, Safdie's solo outing post-Josh stands on its own. It also signals hopes for when his brother premieres another A24 movie, “Marty Supreme,” in December. The script here is a little undercooked, as “The Smashing Machine” is more a vibe than a fists-up drama in fighting form, but Johnson and Blunt balance a screen chemistry effervescent enough to compel you to wonder if maybe “Jungle Cruise,” their last collaboration and seemingly another cynical Johnson cash-grab, was actually… good?

“A day without pain is like a day without sunshine,” says Mark Kerr, who made his MMA debut at the World Vale Tudo Championship 3 in São Paulo in 1997 and didn't lose a fight until Pride 15 in Japan in October 2000. That sense of invincibility, however, is a suit of armor, as outside the octagon (where the mixed martial art plays out), he's nursing a dependency on opioids that frequently leads to him mentally dropping out, his eyes gone dark. 

 










There's also a torrent of rage in him that, when triggered into reaction by a needy and dejected Dawn who tends toward feeling shut out, trips a grenade within and risks doors being torn off their hinges in the middle-class Arizona ranch he shares with her. When he elicits painkillers after a fight gone bad and is only offered Advil, he adorably asks Dawn, “Would you like some?” But the ask, the minor panic over a craving unsated, also indicates a scratchy need that may gouge him out.

Their bittersweet romantic dynamic is what makes “The Smashing Machine” so unexpectedly poignant for a high-pressure sports biography about a UFC fighter. “I think I miss taking care of him,” Dawn tells a friend after he checks into an outpatient clinic, hoping for 30 clean days before his next fight in Japan. Safdie shoots on-location in Tokyo, wending DP Maceo Bishop's handheld, docudrama-style camera — and “The Smashing Machine” can often tend toward resembling a docu- or even mockumentary about a sensitive athlete — through the narrow-alleyed Golden Gai district of shanty pubs whose low ceilings Johnson (who, at 6-foot-5, is a few inches taller than the real Mark Kerr) could likely never clear.

Adding to that documentary-like stamp is an ensemble of first-time actors, such as MMAer Ryan Bader as Kerr's rival-turned-coach Mark Coleman (his acting inexperience is apparent, but it gradually manages to bring authenticity to the picture). Then, there's a suite of modern-day fighters making their screen debuts as Kerr's most worrisome adversaries, including Oleksandr Usyk and Satoshi Ishii. As “The Smashing Machine” spans 1997 to 2022 in a nifty but distracting fourth-wall-breaking cameo, some of these fights and their gruesome particulars lose specificity in their own shuffle, but outside the octagon is when “The Smashing Machine” is most engrossing. 

 










It's not a shock that Safdie's naturalistic style and abilities are better applied to human drama than gladiatorial gut-punches and jiu-jitsu kicks; what I think he's trying to do here is subvert the grandiose violence of similar movies. Poetic flourishes buoyed by Nala Sinephro's ambiently riff-some jazz score, which often works antithetically to the toughness of the images onscreen, almost find the movie daydreaming in space the way Mark does when on an opioid high (which here looks more like a low). 

Safdie has completely reverse-engineered the high octanes of his other co-directed movie about a man on a rampage, “Uncut Gems,” for a soft-spoken piece more aligned with the wandering asides of his often harshly funny TV satire about performative do-gooders, “The Curse,” co-created with Nathan Fielder. And the “Nathan for You” and “The Rehearsal” creator's droll fly-on-the-wall style occasionally seems to have influenced Safdie here, though Benny and Josh were already holding tight on vérité, medium-shot discomfort in early films like “The Pleasure of Being Robbed” and “Daddy Longlegs.”

Johnson here, upholstered in prosthetics and varying wigs and noses and bruises, is neither hero nor antihero, but neither is he a toxic-tempered Jake LaMotta out of Martin Scorsese's touchstone fighter drama “Raging Bull.” Safdie asked Johnson to get puffier, rather than bigger — how do you make Dwayne Johnson bigger, anyway? — with a tiny waist and oversized traps that often make the actor look deliberately too overstuffed for his own body, a life-sized teddy bear who's taken to too much CrossFit. 

 










Johnson's performance is out-and-out wonderful, a beady-eyed fusion of body and spirit that osmoses Safdie's sensibility to deliver what can't be disputed as the most layered work of the actor's career. A vividly contradictory Blunt, funny and sad especially in articulating Dawn's conflicted response to Mark's post-rehab emotional about-face during a tense argument, is equally sensational. 

“All you're giving me are leftovers when you say it's time for dinner,” she says, a line that seems at first profound until Mark asks where she read that one. Ultimately, you emerge out of the gentle afterglow of “The Smashing Machine” with a rejuvenated respect for Johnson, and maybe even a keenness to revisit his crassest box-office slop (hello, “Red One,” you corporation-crafted Christmas lump of coal, you) to rediscover what was under the surface of his blockbuster bloodsport all along.

“The Smashing Machine” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. A24 releases the film October 3.

Hot on the heels of “The Brutalist,” Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet have returned with another sweeping historical epic about a European iconoclast who comes to America in order to build a new kind of church. Even more excitingly, “The Testament of Ann Lee” — a speculative, feverish, and altogether rapturous biopic about the Mancunian preacher who founded the Shakers and believed herself to be the female incarnation of Christ on Earth — addresses the most glaring problem with last year's story about the fictional architect László Tóth: It wasn't a musical. 

 










“The Testament of Ann Lee” isn't exactly a musical either, to be fair. Sure, its characters are prone to singing and dancing when the spirit grabs them (a divinely heightened play on the “Quaking Shakers'” full-body approach to religious devotion), but the film's euphoric “movements” cleave a lot closer to prayers than to traditional numbers. Oscar-winning composer Daniel Blumberg transfigures a dozen traditional hymns into propulsive and electrifying choral jams that thrum with biblical fervor, while “Aftersun” choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall rearranges the figures of Ann Lee's close-knit congregation until they form a human alter to the heaven their “mother” is hoping to create with them here on Earth.

As in a more straightforward musical, the Shakers are using song and dance to express a range of feelings that plainspoken words couldn't hope to convey. But the exultation of these movements, and of the rest of Fastvold's film beyond them — which, like “The Brutalist,” she co-wrote with life partner Corbet — has much less to do with any lyrical content than it does with the elation of collective harmony. With the orgiastic glory of creating a shared purpose between people, and the evangelical labor of converting that purpose into action. 

Fastvold may not be a Shaker herself, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering that there are exactly three of them remaining at last count (and only then because a new adherent joined the other two just a few weeks ago), but “The Testament of Ann Lee” is one of the most consistently ecstatic movies I've ever seen precisely because it doesn't get hung up on the gospel truth. This is a film defined by a profound respect for its namesake's faith, but it's also a film driven by an even more profound appreciation for the more secular ideals that she leveraged her faith to pursue; it's remarkable as a testament of Ann Lee, and even more so as a testament to her quasi-artistic ability to marshal people together in the service of creating a better world. 

 










In a sense, “The Testament of Ann Lee” is a celebration of — and then in its less rhapsodic second half, a plea for — the conditions required to make a movie like “The Testament of Ann Lee.” Here is another mad pursuit with shallow pockets and grand ambitions (which looks like a mega-budgeted studio project, thanks to production designer Sam Bader). It's another utopian prayer led by a woman in a business dominated by men, a woman who, in Fastvold's case, had to harness the energies of a crew much larger than Ann Lee's initial congregation in order to fulfill her vision. Like “The Brutalist” before it (to say nothing of Fastvold's heart-wrenchingly great “The World to Come” before that), the film doubles as a workable alternative for how films might be made. Just as Ann Lee's upbeat message appealed to a Christian population that had grown tired of being promised salvation through suffering, Fastvold and Corbet's model offers a more actionable response to an industry sick of Hollywood doomsayers. 

Then again, it takes a lot more than a few cheap Hungarian budget hacks to conjure the kind of spell that Fastvold does here. For starters, there's only one Amanda Seyfried, whose moonstone eyes were made to convey religious bliss. The “First Reformed” actress gives the best performance of her career as “The Woman Clothed by the Sun,” her Ann Lee convincingly yearning for purpose even before she begins to create one for herself. 

 










Set in the gray and unforgiving Manchester of 1736, the first section of this movie is the story of a wayward soul trying to find a harmony between God (who she loves) and the church (which doesn't love her back). She finds a measure of creature comfort in the arms of her smitten but severe husband Abraham (a terrific Christopher Abbott, masterfully navigating real affection and 18th century male entitlement), who ravishes Ann with a fetishistic attention that his bride isn't sure how to receive. For one thing, she's young and uneducated. For another, even worldly sinners like us would probably be confused if our partners wanted to smack our bare asses with a broom while reading from the Book of Revelations. 

But Ann's sexual ambivalence runs far deeper than old-timey kink. She first became skeptical of the subject as a little girl, when she was forced to watch her father grunt on top of her mother just a few feet away, and that skepticism began to calcify into a deeper mistrust when her mother died during the delivery of her eighth child. For a woman like Ann, marital sex is a crucial part of affirming her Christian duty, but the sense of self-becoming that it provides is rhymed by the autonomy that “belonging” to her husband strips away from her in return. 

 










These conflicted feelings come to a head in the film's most astonishing sequence, a whirlstorm of sex, labor, dance, anguish, song, death, and mourning in which Ann delivers four children, none of whom survive beyond infancy despite her desperate attempts to feed them with life. The choreography here is breathtakingly evocative; heightened but not unreal, modern but true to the spirit of the Georgian era, as suspended between modes as Ann is between this world and the next. Needless to say, the experience has a soul-scarring effect on Ann, who becomes convinced that her awful ordeal is punishment for her sins of the flesh. “Our unbearable tragedies are God's judgment upon me,” she concludes before declaring that procreation is sacrilege and leading the first Shakers in three days of spasmodic worship so intense that Sister Mary (Thomasin McKenzie) — Ann's most devoted acolyte and this movie's narrator — insists that people thought she was going to die. 

Carefully balanced between agony and ecstasy before it gradually begins to claw its way closer toward the latter, Seyfried's possessed performance has no trouble selling us on the credibility of those fears. She's a study in unbridled expiation, her body open and tilting upwards to the sky as if she were receiving instruction from the heavens, her every rhythmic breath a kind of transubstantiation. 

 










“The Testament of Ann Lee” would never hold together if not for the unwavering conviction that Seyfried affords its title character. Since a film made for Shakers would only stand to gross about $40 at most, Fastvold understands that most viewers won't share Ann's self-beliefs; what's more important is that we believe that Ann does. We may come to a more psychological rationale for her prophetic awakening, which is clearly borne from the pain of her losses, but we're also disabused of any cynicism regarding the sincerity of her faith (even if, uh, we might question the long-term outcome of a religion that forbids its followers to start families and fortify their ranks). 

The people closest to Ann, especially her young brother William (a terrific Lewis Pullman, sturdy and receptive to the idea of a sibling Christ 2.0), have no trouble accepting hers as the only truth, and so the movie's spectacular-looking second act takes to the seas as Mother Ann and her two dozen adherents set sail for the New World, whose faith was still unformed. The boat set is where William Rexer's 35mm cinematography really begins to shine, as the Caravaggio-like interiors of the first act contrast against the violent gray-blue seas that threaten to capsize the ship and drown Ann's upstart religion in one fell swoop. The journey is a perilous one between two mutually antagonized lands, but the Shakers' shared purpose proves to be their salvation, and sees them safely to Manhattan. 

 










It's there, on the shores of pre-Revolutionary America, that “The Testament of Ann Lee” most neatly dovetails with “The Brutalist,” as Fastvold begins to exalt in the promise of a country still waiting to be born. America's self-invention runs parallel to Ann's, and rhymes with it in all of its aspiration and strife. If (like “The Brutalist”), the second half of this film is a much slower, darker, and less dynamic meditation on the events of the first, it's also where Fastvold and Corbet's script begins to lament how America has always been so eager to snuff out the idealist spark that is — or was — capable of making it such a beacon of hope for the rest of the world. 

Through the lens of the nascent Shaker community that Ann establishes near Albany (and where she instructs her followers to begin making the furniture they're still remembered for today), we see this country as a place built on the strength of cooperation, as well as a place vulnerable to the same provincial thinking from which it was hoping to declare independence. The Shakers thrive by trading with the local indigenous population, and from offering new ideas to frustrated white colonialists who'd been conditioned for despair (embodied here by Tim Blake Nelson). They also suffer at the hands of brutish mobs who reject their presence on principle, oblivious to the irony of so violently betraying the same rights they've just fought a war to establish. A tale as old as time. 

 










Grace is a difficult thing to preserve, and “The Testament of Ann Lee” becomes a less viscerally singular experience as it transitions from sanctifying that grace to grieving it. The music grows less frequent, we begin to see Daniel Blumberg onscreen (a striking figure!) as much as we hear from him off it, and the clarity of Ann's vision is clouded by the brutishness that surrounds it. As in most stories, the inevitable isn't as compelling as the miraculous, and there's an exasperation — however necessary and/or deliberate — in watching the last act of Fastvold's film deprive us of the contagious ecstasy that carried so much of the first two, as if a movie so guided by voices has suddenly lost its tongue. 

Of course, Ann would be quick to remind us that there's a place for everything, and everything in its place. The ultimate brilliance of Fastvold's movie, which remains without question for all of its peaks and valleys, is that it has the courage to reimagine the essence of belonging itself; to see it not as something we find, but rather as something that we create together.    

“The Testament of Ann Lee” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Though his role in the new A24 film “The Smashing Machine,” directed by Benny Safdie, strikes somewhat familiar territory, with the WWE superstar playing early UFC champion Mark Kerr, actor Dwayne Johnson revealed that taking the project on required the encouragement of his co-star Emily Blunt.

“There was this voice inside of me; the little voice said, ‘Well, what if? What if I could do more, and I want to do more, and what does that look like?' And from the beginning, from the time we worked on ‘Jungle Cruise' together, she really encouraged and believed in me, and said, ‘You know, there's a place that you can put all this stuff that you have gone through as a kid . . . that place is what you love to do, which is acting. And you have me, let's do this together,'” said Johnson during the film's press conference at the 82nd Venice Film Festival.

“I'm very close with Emily and shared a lot of everything that I've gone through,” he added. “And then Benny was on the other side of that saying, ‘Hey, I got you both,' and ‘Let's go for it.' So that transformation could not have happened without my best friend being there to support, and encourage, and just say ‘You can do it.'”

When asked if he felt like playing Kerr in the sports biopic, which is already earning awards buzz, was due to him still having something to prove to Hollywood, Johnson clarified that it was more so about him proving something to himself. “[Hollywood] had become about box office, and you chase the box office. And the box office in our business that we know is very loud, and it can be very resounding, and it could push you into a category, and into a corner, and ‘This is your lane,' and ‘This is what you do,' and ‘This is what people want you to be,' and ‘This is what Hollywood wants you to be,' and I understood that, and I made those movies, and I liked them, and they were fun, and some [were] really good and did well, and some not so good,” he said. “A lot of times it's harder for us to, or at least for me sometimes, to know what you're capable of when you've been pigeonholed into something. It's harder to know, ‘Can I do that? I feel like I can.'”

Johnson alludes to “Jungle Cruise” being a turning point that began to drift him away from the massive blockbusters that were expected of him. “Sometimes it takes people who you love and you respect, like Emily and Benny, to say you can,” he said. The actor spent the next year looking around and thinking “Am I living my dream, or am I living other people's dreams? And you come to that recognition. And you could either fall in line — 'Well, it's status quo. Things are good. I don't want to rock the boat' — or go ‘No, I want to live my dreams now, and do what I want to do, and tap into the stuff that I want to tap into, and have a place, finally, to put all this stuff that I've experienced in the past, that I've shied away from, been scared to go deep and intense and raw until now, until I had this opportunity to do this.'”

 










Director Safdie responded to his film's star saying, “there's strength in that vulnerability.” Reflecting on working with Johnson on “The Smashing Machine,” he said “I felt like I could ask you to do anything, and the subtlest things, and it would just get internalized and processed, and then it would come out, and then the two of you together, it just created this kinetic thing. I would always say it was like pulling these moments out of the air, you felt it. And it was just the best.”

“Kim Novak‘s Vertigo” has one of the more heartwarming and, frankly, historically significant, codas to a film-focused documentary in recent memory. It's such a special moment that it mostly justifies the way the film has been assembled before it. 

Until then, it's quite an uneven and unstructured cinematic portrait, and one of the weaker efforts from its director Alexandre O. Philippe. The Swiss-born cinephile has become a kind of cross between Laurent Bouzereau and Mark Cousins with his succession of documentaries about iconic films and film subjects.

 










Novak is certainly a worthy subject for a documentary. She's not only the last survivor of the film that many consider the greatest ever made, Alfred Hitchcock's “Vertigo,” but she is the nexus of obsession in a film about obsession that has inspired so much obsession in the 67 years since its release itself. At 92, her star power is as grand and magnificent as ever. But more than commanding your gaze as any great star does, and as Hitchcock certainly did in that ultimate film about “the gaze,” Novak also holds your attention as a uniquely thoughtful artist in her own right.

Philippe takes us on a journey through her career. Born Marilyn Novak and assigned the name Kim by the tyrannical Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn, Novak existed in a constant state of tension in Hollywood. She bristled against what she calls the “overdone” acting of '50s movie stars and prized naturalistic “reacting” instead. And she wanted meatier, more substantive roles that the industry simply would not give her at the time: Having worked as a model, Novak, to the powers that be, embodied glamour above all else, and the moguls had no use for other types of meaning she could create and represent. They wanted to focus on her surface appeal, on her mystique. That she was a source of desire rather than a subjective force in her own right. 

If anything, Novak herself added depth and dimension that the suits didn't want or ask for in their desire to make her the industry's number-one box office star — which, in the late '50s, she indeed became. The number of great films to her name, then, is arguably limited: Joshua Logan's “Picnic,” Otto Preminger's “The Man with the Golden Arm,” Richard Quine's “Bell, Book, and Candle,” and of course, “Vertigo.”

“Kim Novak's Vertigo” shows some of the misogynistic indignities she had to endure onscreen, with clips from “Pal Joey” and “Kiss Me, Stupid” that probably added to Novak's ultimate desire to leave Hollywood altogether, which she had mostly done by the late '60s. The documentary is most interesting when it doesn't linger on clips from her movies, but when it focuses on her in the present at her home in Oregon. An avid painter for decades, Novak is seen at her easel putting brush to canvas and creating paintings of extraordinary swirling, whirlpool-like complexity. One definitely thinks of the spiral motif in “Vertigo.” And in several works, she's outright created her own version of “Vertigo” fan art, recreating images of her Madeleine and Judy from the film.

 










“Vertigo” has clearly haunted her the way that it has generations of film lovers. Aside from its reputation and its inherent artistic greatness on many levels, it's the one time in any movie that Novak was able to interrogate the very thing that frustrated her so much about her Hollywood career: That the industry was unable to see beyond the surface of her. And so she talks at length about how the characters of Madeleine and Judy speak to her deeply and remain with her and part of her. She talks about “Vertigo” as if both an insider and outsider — yes, she's in the movie and the very heart of it, but, perhaps because of Hitchcock's way of moving actors around like chess pieces, as objects for him to control, the way she talks about it is still somewhat removed, like that was another person onscreen and her at the same time. 

That means that, when she speaks about “Vertigo,” it's not that different from what any diehard obsessive of it would have to say, even as her experience is fundamentally singular. It lays bare the gulf between what's onscreen and what's real life, quite potently. Between the surface and what lies beneath. Between Kim Novak the movie star and Kim Novak the person.

She's articulate and searching throughout, the movie even opening with narration that you might think had come from Jonas Mekas more than from Novak — because of course at the height of her fame she wasn't allowed to be expressive like this. “I hesitate to even be recording this because I don't know what's gonna come out of what I say, what I mean,” she began. “What do I mean? Is that what it's about: What do I mean? What do I think? What do I feel? I don't know what's expected of me to feel, or to think, or even to be, for that matter.”

 










In every sense, what's most interesting about “Kim Novak's Vertigo” comes from Novak herself. Philippe's filmmaking seems especially rudimentary here, far more than in his William Shatner portrait “You Can Call Me Bill.” It's powerful and compelling that Novak can occupy the role of fan of “Vertigo” the way she does — less interesting is Philippe's own fan gushing. He has abandoned the close textual analysis of his other Hitchcock study, “78/52,” which precisely dissected how the “Psycho” shower scene achieves its effect, in favor of choosing not to give much perspective here at all. He just wants to revel in the feeling of “Vertigo,” the feeling of knowing Kim Novak, this time around — not examine what's at the root of those feelings. 

As a film then, “Kim Novak's Vertigo” is disappointing. It feels like a beautiful portrait without a frame. A worthy companion to her receiving the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 2025 Venice Film Festival, but not much of a cinematic achievement in its own right.

And yet, just as “Kim Novak's Vertigo” appears to occupy that space of 2024's “Merchant/Ivory” documentary — another doc made by a fan without much to say other than gush — it features a coda of jolting consequence. Novak goes through her belongings, collected over decades and in boxes for all that time, and comes upon what may be the most iconic suit-dress in movie history. The grey suit that Madeleine had worn and that Judy wears at the end of “Vertigo” in the moment that she's revealed to have been Madeleine all along. It's been sitting in a box in Novak's possession for 67 years. 

 










She pulls it out, and it's still soft and totally unfaded as if it were 1958 all over again. She sniffs it, to make it that much more a part of herself. And cries in gratitude over seeing it again and being with it again. Suddenly, film history is so very alive in that moment. Immediate and eternal all at once. Just like “Vertigo.”

“Kim Novak's Vertigo” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

By the age of 30, Canadian filmmaker Daniel Roher had won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature for “Navalny.” His next documentary, “Blink,” premiered at Telluride last year. Wasting little time, he returns to the Colorado Rockies one year later with “Tuner,” but “this one feels a little different,” he told a sold-out crowd Saturday, before its world premiere at the fest's Galaxy theater. He's referring to his pivot into narrative feature filmmaking, joining a host of his documentarian contemporaries making this same move of late — including Joshua Oppenheimer whose musical “The End” also played Telluride last year.

“Tuner” continues Leo Woodall's own move into leading man territory, after “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy” earlier this year. The Brit broke out as the conflicted rent boy in Season 2 of “The White Lotus,” and has also starred in recent TV series “One Day” and “Prime Target.” Here he plays Niki, a piano virtuoso whose promising career was cut short by a rare hearing condition which makes him “allergic to sound,” he explains in a scene. Also starring Dustin Hoffman, the veteran leans on his natural charm in limited screen time as Harry Horowitz, who runs a small piano tuning operation with Niki as his sole employee. A humorous opening montage catalogues the odd couple's drive across New York City's five boroughs, tuning pianos for a host of wealthy clients. Harry fills the drive with rants about mercury levels in tuna, or how it's not cholesterol you should be worrying about, it's inflammation. (On that latter point, my health nut friends in L.A. would say, he's not wrong.)

 










But this is not some kitchen sink, slice-of-life drama following two piano tuners, and the film's safe-cracking subplot is set up conveniently — perhaps a smidge too much so — with little wasted time. Early on, Niki returns home from dinner at Harry's and teaches himself, via online tutorials, how to crack Harry's small home safe as a favor, after Harry accidentally locks his meds inside. Niki quickly realizes his hearing condition has a single silver lining: It lends him a special knack for this practice. He makes nothing of it, because when would he possibly be called upon to use it again? 

But, as luck would have it, a few short scenes later, during a late night tuning session in a seemingly-empty mansion (Billy Joel is scheduled to play this particular piano at a benefit), Niki miraculously finds himself performing the same safe-cracking favor for some shady Israelis. Led by Uri (Lior Raz), the trio quickly ropes him into their small-time criminal enterprise, which involves swiping cash and luxury items (watches, jewelry, etc.) from Uri's wealthy clients. They reason that if they keep the take small, their clients won't miss the objects. And if they do? The clients fire their housekeeper and file an insurance claim. While not a foolproof plan, there have been less thought out criminal rackets. 

 










Hesitant to join them, Niki relents after learning that Harry, currently hospitalized after a heart attack, has $36,000 in past due Medicaid bills. Out on his first assignment, Niki freezes up, standing wordlessly in front of the safe, needing to be further convinced to pull the trigger and get to work. While committing a criminal act should give anyone not already in that line of work pause, he's already agreed, accepted a cash advance and gone out with Uri and gang to the site. Why is this hesitation manifesting now and not earlier? A lack of prior characterization and depth in Woodall's performance leads to a moment that feels included solely because this type of movie often includes that initial indecision. 

Niki's condition forces him to wear corded ear plugs, along with a pair of noise-cancelling headphones he slips on when things are especially noisy (which in NYC is often). This sends a clear signal to those around him that don't know the objects' purpose, to leave him alone. And so Niki has learned to navigate a life of isolation, outside of Harry and his wife Marla (Tovah Feldshuh). Woodall's quiet brooding and puffy blue eyes recall Jeremy Allen White, while his restless energy and physical appearance calls to mind a young Michael Pitt. This combination for a leading man is unique, but it's hard not to sense that Woodall is miscast as this former-pianist turned-tuner, turned-safe cracker, both physically and with a lack of interiority he renders onscreen in his silent stoicism. 

 










His large arms covered in an array of amateur stick and poke tattoos confound: Is there an unreferenced stint at RISD or CalArts in Niki's past? While the wealthy homeowners often mistake Niki and Harry's piano tuning practice as blue collar in nature, frequently asking the pair to perform tasks like fixing the toilet or the WiFi, piano tuning is positioned in the upper echelons of bourgeois culture, as a refined, likely even nerdy profession. What other profession would have clientele with $5,000 laying around — which the film makes clear is a cheap rate — to pay the pair to tune their Steinway which they will in turn likely never play? 

There is an artfulness to piano tuning that Woodall explains poetically to music student Ruthie (Havana Rose Liu), which kicks off a courtship between the two, hampered initially by Ruthie's own stubbornness and rightful suspicion of Niki's aloof schtick. “Tuner” comes fully alive when Liu enters the picture as Ruthie, and she is a revelation in her complex portrayal of this grumpy-yet-sweet, driven musician hellbent on securing a fellowship with a renowned composer known as Meissner (Jean Reno). Leaning into romantic comedy tropes, a chance run-in leads Harry to insist Niki walk her to class — a walk between two hardheads that goes about as well as you might expect. 

 










Roher and co-writer Robert Ramsey's script slyly brings them together once more, this time for good, when Ruthie's grandmother's piano is damaged from a ceiling leak. Out of options, she needs someone fast to come help mitigate the damage. Liu's portrayal of Ruthie is empowered yet never caricaturish; she enjoys the comforts of her newfound relationship with Niki, even if she is openly perplexed by him at times, like when he gifts her a vintage Rolex after only a month of dating. Closeups of her face in various states of puzzlement, affection, or frustration dazzle, and remove any doubt: Liu is a star. 

In this middle section, “Tuner” slides into a familiar narrative register: As Niki gets in deeper with this dangerous gang of thieves, he struggles to balance those commitments with the demands of his relationship with Ruthie. It becomes less about whether Niki can keep his dual lives separate, and more about how things will resolve between the couple once it inevitably does all come crashing down. 

With his extreme sensitivity to all sound, Niki's kryptonite is a blue airhorn that Uri uses to control him once Niki begins to actively look for a way out. A tool from an iconic “Jackass” prank being deployed to incapacitate the hero, leaving him screaming in agony on the ground, “Tuner” is undeniably very silly, hewing more closely to a Jacques Audiard picture than a hard-boiled crime thriller. Like Audiard, it seems to relish combining its quirky elements into something emotional and resonant. In fact, “Tuner” shares much in common with Audiard's “The Beat That My Heart Skipped” with both exploring the intersection of concert piano playing and small-time crime. 

 










The intentional throwback nature of “Tuner” carries benefits and drawbacks. There's a comfort in simply sitting back and allowing its competent filmmaking take you through its well-worn narrative beats. At other times, the script can feel unimaginative and overly paint-by-numbers, as if conceived by Roher and Ramsey with Robert McKee's “Story” in one hand, a highlighter in the other. Some genre subversion would be welcome, to freshen things up a bit. To a viewer with even a rudimentary understanding of this type of story, many of its twists are choreographed well in advance. But not always. A key third act twist is so coincidental it's almost impossible to see coming. This twist doesn't derail the narrative with its sheer implausibility, so much as clarify the type of movie you've been in the entire time. 

From the start, “Tuner” has largely been a fantasy. Where else do piano tuners occupy such status that their work days are filled with near constant house calls? And where else can Niki pay off Harry's medical debt in stacks of cash — $10K at a time — without arousing any suspicion? “Tuner” correctly recognizes that if an audience is invested in the love story at the center, they will be forgiving of any overly-convenient plotting. And while the love story at the center of “Tuner” can be captivating, especially during a montage cataloguing Niki and Ruthie's whirlwind first month, Liu is ultimately forced to carry too much of the burden in this department, which then draws these eyebrow-raising contrivances out into the light more openly. 

 










Visually, close-ups from inside the lock mechanisms of the safes make it easy to track Niki's progress as he carefully spins the mechanism, listening intently for that subtle metal clink in a just slightly higher register whenever the correct number aligns. It's a satisfying process to watch unfold and is rendered well on screen, both visually and aurally with sound designer Johnnie Burn's (“The Zone of Interest”) expert craft. Otherwise, “Tuner” throws a lot at the wall stylistically. As Roher's first narrative project, one senses a willingness to play around and try lots of things out. “What if we placed a camera on the safe handles as Niki spins it?” “What about a fisheye reflection of his face in the safe's chrome plating?” 

It's a playful movie in form and content, one that rarely takes itself too seriously, and as such, it can't help but skate by as a pleasurable ride, whether through allowing Hoffman, Woodall and Liu space to trade quips, or through snappy editing when entering a new location. Despite its light tone, Roher is not afraid to get darker and directly address the difficult situations his cast of characters find themselves in, and the film walks that tonal tightrope between light humor and the high-stakes world of both safe-cracking and new relationships well. But, as if to remind the audience where its true sensibilities lie, it's telling that the film undercuts an emotional closeup of Liu in the film's closing moments with an off-handed, off-screen, one-liner from Niki. Betting correctly on how this risk would play out, Niki's line drew a hearty laugh from the Telluride audience, ending the film on a high note.

 










“Tuner” premiered at the 2025 Telluride Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Mona Fastvold‘s “The Testament of Ann Lee” tells the story, through hymnal music and choreography, of the founding leader of the Shakers as she attempts to create an ecstatic utopia. Fastvold and her husband, producer/co-writer Brady Corbet, shot the Venice competition premiere in 2024 in Hungary again after “The Brutalist.”

Like the Corbet-directed Oscar-winning film from last year, the filmmakers also shot “The Testament of Ann Lee” on a budget (here, $10 million) and on film cameras (35mm, blown up to 70mm for maximalist effect). At one point, they took the cast and crew aboard a fully operational 18th-century ship they found in Sweden, as Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried) transports her followers (including Christopher Abbott as her husband, Lewis Pullman as her brother, and Thomasin McKenzie as her aide) from pre-industrial Manchester, England to colonial rural America.

Seyfried, Fastvold, Corbet, composer Daniel Blumberg (Oscar winner for “The Brutalist”), choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall (“Vox Lux”), producer Andrew Morrison, and more for the film convened at the Venice Film Festival press conference Monday afternoon ahead of its premiere at the Sala Grande. “The Brutalist” won best director here last year, which makes Fastvold's second film as a director in the Venice competition (after 2020's “The World to Come”) one of the festival's hottest acquisition titles.

Make no mistake that the scale of the movie is massive, emphasizing hands-on, practical filmmaking, from costumer Malgorzata Karpiuk designing most of the garments by hand to Blumberg and Fastvold working from actual Shaker hymns to craft the songs. 

Asked why she wanted to go so big for the story of Ann Lee, Fastvold said, “Well, I thought she deserved it. Don't you all? Don't you think that Ann Lee deserved something that was grandiose and wonderful? How many stories have we seen about male icons on a grand scale? How many stories again and again and again? Can we not get to see one story about a woman like this? The only thing I could think of was ‘Jeanne d'Arc,' that's it. I just wanted her to have this space.”

One journalist in the room asked Corbet and Fastvold how they decide who will direct a project vs. only write and produce it (they shared writing and producing duties on “The Brutalist” also). Corbet, keeping his shades on indoors, spoke up.

“We firmly believe that you can only serve one master at a time. Mona had final cut on this film, which is something that's obviously very important to us, and something that we've spoken about publicly quite a bit,” he said. “She came to me and said, ‘I want to make a film about Ann Lee.' We were huge fans of the design, the furniture is absolutely stunning. The architecture is significant, especially in the northeastern part of the United States. It was always Mona's film. Mona has a background in performing arts and dance, and we realized pretty early on, because the Shakers were a musical people, that the film had to be a musical.”

 










He continued, “When I have a project I'm working on, I bring it to her and say, OK, this is what I'm doing next. We just sort of go back and forth that way.”

Corbet, who directed second-unit on the film, continued, “I'm working for my director. It's not because I think a director is always right. It's because a director is always consistent, and that continuity of vision is significant to me. I'm not interested in watching films that are an exquisite corpse. I'm not interested in those sorts of public art projects where you can end up with something like the body of a mermaid and the face of a dolphin. I want there to be real continuity and consistency in a work of art. When I read a novel, I don't want to read a novel written by 100 executives; I want to read a novel by one novelist.”

Corbet then turned to producer Andrew Morrison, co-founder of the production company Kaplan, Morrison, who also steered “The Brutalist.” Asked how he got “Ann Lee” off the ground for $10 million, he said, “The goal [was] for [Mona] to have complete creative freedom, for her to get to actualize her vision without any sort of obstruction in her path. How do you make a movie that spans someone's whole life, that is an epic, that's a musical, with no constraint and also about a celibate religion that not many people were familiar with before? It was challenging, and we had to find partners who believed in it and supported it.”

 










“It was quite a feat, because as you can imagine, the elevator pitch for a Shaker musical was not the easiest thing to get off the ground,” Corbet said.

That Ann Lee sought a utopian society advocating for social equality makes for a narrative parallel to the environment on Fastvold's set. 

In trying to “create a piece of art in the business as very male-dominated as well, I am always trying to create a culture on set, a community on set that that is a bit different, and to sort of create that a culture that is nurturing, that is kind, that has a lot of empathy for everyone on on my sets,” Fastvold said. “Ann Lee's story … really spoke to me, the way that she is leading. Even though I was raised in a secular household, without any kind of relation to religion, I don't prescribe to [all ] Ann Lee's … ideas, but I do think that the way that she leads with empathy and kindness and wanted to create a space where everyone was equal, men, women, people of color, with empathy for children as well at that age, at that time period, I think is really important to talk about now.”

Chris Columbus, who directed 2001's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and 2002's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, doesn't expect the films' cast to reunite for related future projects. In an interview with The Times, the filmmaker confirmed that author J.K. Rowling‘s anti-trans views make actors reluctant to be associated with her work.


	When asked whether he wanted to direct a film adaptation of the stage show, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, using the original Potter movie cast, Columbus said, “It's never going to happen.”


	“It's gotten so complicated with all the political stuff,” the director explained. “Everyone in the cast has their own opinion, which is different from her opinion, which makes it impossible.” He added, “I haven't spoken to Miss Rowling in a decade or so, so I have no idea what's going on with her, but I keep very close contact with Daniel Radcliffe and I just spoke to him a few days ago. I still have a great relationship with all the kids in the cast.”

	











	The original cast includes Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, and both Radcliffe and Watson have spoken out against Rowling's controversial stance. Last year, Radcliffe said her viewpoint makes him “really sad.” “I do look at the person that I met, the times that we met, and the books that she wrote, and the world that she created, and all of that is to me so deeply empathic,” he said.

	A month prior, Rowling said she wouldn't forgive the stars who had spoken out against her, who include Radcliffe. She wrote on X, “Celebs who cosied up to a movement intent on eroding women's hard-won rights and who used their platforms to cheer on the transitioning of minors can save their apologies for traumatised detransitioners and vulnerable women reliant on single sex spaces.”

	











	A new multiseries adaptation of Rowling's Harry Potter books is currently in production from HBO. It features a new cast, and is being helmed by showrunner Francesca Gardiner and director Mark Mylod (Game of Thrones, Succession, The Last of Us). In his interview, Columbus criticized the forthcoming series for “basically doing the same thing we did,” only using other actors.


	“You have to understand that when Richard Harris passed away and Michael Gambon took over as Dumbledore that transition, even back then, was difficult for me,” he said. “So now it's difficult imagining anyone else in these roles. I still see Alan Rickman, and I still see Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane. It's part of my DNA and I can't get beyond it.”

	Earlier this year, HBO chief content officer Casey Bloys confirmed that Rowling is involved with the series, but her personal beliefs won't seep into it. “It's pretty clear that those are her personal, political views. She's entitled to them,” Bloys said. “Harry Potter is not secretly being infused with anything. And if you want to debate her, you can go on Twitter.”

	Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch has spoken out against indie film distributor Mubi after learning the company received investment from Sequoia Capital, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital film with ties to the Israeli military.


	Mubi co-produced the director's latest effort, Father Mother Sister Brother, which premiered yesterday at the Venice International Film Festival. During the film's official press conference, Jarmusch responded to a question about Sequoia Capital's parallel investment in Kela, a defense-tech startup founded by Israeli intelligence units in response to the Oct. 7 terror attack.


	“My relationship with Mubi started much before that, and they were fantastic to work with on the film,” Jarmusch told reporters (via Variety). “I was disappointed and disconcerted by this relationship. If you want to discuss it, you have to address Mubi. I'm not the spokesman. However, yes, I was concerned. I also have a distribution agreement with Mubi for certain territories, which I had entered into before my knowledge of this.”

	











	He continued, “Having said that, on a personal level, I have to say I'm an independent filmmaker, and I have taken money from various sources to be able to realize my films and I consider pretty much all corporate money is dirty money. If you start analyzing each of these film companies and their financing structures, you're going to find a lot of dirt. You can avoid it and not make films at all. But films are how I carry what I like to say. I'm concerned, but one thing I don't like is putting the onus of the explanation of us, the artists. It's not us. It's Mubi. You must address concerning this, and not just Mubi, but other companies as well.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In July, multiple filmmakers signed an open letter to Mubi urging the outfit not just to reconsider its relationship with Sequoia Capital, but also to publicly condemn the company over what the letter-writers characterized as “genocide profiteering.” It was revealed that Mubi received the investment in May, leading to immediate criticism about the source of the money.

	Mubi CEO Efe Cakarel responded to the outcry in August, writing in a statement, “The profits Mubi generates do not fund any other companies in Sequoia's portfolio. Our returns go to Sequoia's limited partners — institutions such as universities, foundations, and pension funds — not to other Sequoia-backed businesses such as Kela. Any suggestion that our work is connected to funding the war is simply untrue.” 


Father Mother Sister Brother was written and directed by Jarmusch, and stars Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Vicky Krieps, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Indya Moore, and Luka Sabbat.

	When Asleep at the Wheel decided to record a record of Texas-centric songs to commemorate the Western swing outfit spending 50 of its 55 years in the Lone Star State, Ray Benson had a simple request: “Let's just do songs about Texas that mean something to you.”


	The result is Riding High in Texas, a celebration of all things Texas, out now. The record features covers of high-profile artists and songwriters and an array of special guests across its 10 tracks, including Lyle Lovett, Brennen Leigh, and Billy Strings.


	Lovett joins Asleep at the Wheel to reprise his version of “Long Tall Texan,” and Leigh contributes vocals on a cover of the Carter Family's “Lonesome Pine Special.” Meanwhile, Strings plays guitar on the album-opening title track after Benson called in a favor with the modern-day bluegrass torchbearer.


	Benson appeared in Strings' 2024 spaghetti western video for “Seven Months in County,” playing, in Benson's words, “the old codger to be Strings' cellmate.” During that shoot, Benson decided Strings needed to play on “Riding High in Texas.”

	











	“We became friendly,” Benson tells Rolling Stone. “When they booked me to do his film, I just asked him, ‘Hey, could you play on this?' And I tell you what, that guy is busier than anybody, and he fit it in. Good thing, because I don't play that kind of flatpicking stuff well enough.”


	While the guests add intrigue and twists to the 32nd studio album for Asleep at the Wheel, the constant is the band's fiddle-forward Western swing sound played over a series of songs that evoke the Lone Star State. Renditions of “All My Exes (Live in Texas)” and “T for Texas” lay that point bare, while covers of Guy Clark (“Texas Cookin”) and Ernest Tubb (“Texas in My Soul”) serve as reminders of Benson's appreciation for Texas's songwriting icons.

	











	Asleep at the Wheel are a constantly-evolving project rather than a set-in-stone band, which is evident with the addition of Ian Stewart, who joined the band on fiddle in 2024 but quickly took over some vocal duties for the 74-year-old Benson. Riding High in Texas has Stewart swapping lead vocals with Benson, but the highlight is his fiddle playing on “Beaumont Rag,” the record's instrumental closing track.

	“Ian joined the band,” Benson says, “after I hired him as a fiddle player, but when it was obvious that he was gonna share singing, I said, ‘Bring some stuff.' I hope that everybody who's in this band will bring something to the table, so that I don't have to say, ‘Do this.' This is a collaborative thing.


	“In the contest world, where the fiddlers get together, Texas goes back to some guys from the Twenties and Thirties, after Bob Wills. They were not swing fiddlers, but they had a little swing in them, and that's what ‘Beaumont Rag' really shows. So, I said, ‘Ian, you're a Texas fiddler, and you're gonna have to play that. Let's put it on this album,' and he worked it up real good.”


	Before Riding High in Texas was released, Asleep at the Wheel already started touring the record, and they have a full schedule ahead of them, including festival stops at Austin City Limits and the Avett Brothers' Moon Crush: Avett Moon in Miramar Beach, Florida, in October. The group was also inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in August, which Benson attributes to the band embracing the Lone Star State since relocating there in 1974.


	He also says that relentless touring and a constant churn of new music help him maintain a focus, even with a catalog and accolades that could justify slowing down or retiring altogether.

	“The legacy of Asleep at the Wheel, I think, is pretty firmly entrenched. But my outlets are still creating music, and bringing people together — always by collaboration,” Benson says. “I don't see any way out of this mess unless I do something. Otherwise, I'll feel useless.”

	Rob Sheffield



	Everybody knows “Every Breath You Take.” It's the biggest hit the Police ever had, one of the most famous tunes of the Eighties. It spent 8 weeks at Number One in the classic pop summer of 1983. In 2019, BMI officially proclaimed it “the Most Played Song in radio history,” breaking the 22-year record set by “You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin.”  It spent another 11 weeks at Number One in the summer of 1997, when Diddy and Faith Evans turned it into a hip-hop tribute to the late Notorious B.I.G., “I'll Be Missing You.” It's one of the world's favorite songs — the most famous hit Sting ever wrote. 


	Or did he? That's now a legal matter. The music world got a shock this week when his ex-bandmates, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland, sued him in London High Court, claiming they should be credited — and paid — for writing “Every Breath You Take,” 42 years after it came out. 


	The bottle-blonde British threesome famously hated each other, so this might just seen like the latest of their nonstop battles. They recorded it while regularly punching each other out in the studio. Sting said he spent half the Synchronicity tour with a broken rib, after one of his backstage brawls with Copeland. But this is a unique case. There's no precedent for a band this famous having a songwriting credit dispute like this, in court, over such a beloved hit. (The Band, they might have complained a lot in bars, but they never took it to court.) Who the hell spends 42 years going to war over a love song?

	











	It's also a special case because there's no argument at all over who did what. Nobody's ever disputed that Sting wrote the lyrics, chords, and melody, as he almost always did in the Police. “Our current single, ‘Every Breath You Take,' wrote itself, largely because it was taken from a very old tradition,” Sting told Musician magazine in 1983. “It's very atavistic and yet it means something now. I woke up in the middle of the night in Jamaica and went straight to the piano and the chords and song just came out within ten minutes. Wrote the song. Went back to bed. It's a way of saying there's still something meaningful and useful in the old way of doing a rock & roll ballad. But it's not entirely derivative, there's something else I hear in it: a tinge of sadness.”

	His original demo was a fully formed song, with a Hammond organ part that they dumped after Andy Summers came up with the guitar arpeggios. The demo has the same words and tune as the final version from their 1983 smash Synchronicity. But in recent years, the 82-year-old Summers has been saying his riff earned a writing credit. “'Every Breath You Take' was going in the trash until I played on it,” Summers said on Jeremy White's podcast in 2023. “It's a very contentious [topic] — it's very much alive at the moment.” He hinted at legal action, saying, “Watch the press; let's see what happens in the next year. That's all I can tell you.” 


	The three Police men have made no comment on the case. Sting and his company Magnetic Publishing Limited are listed as co-defendants. In 2022, Sting sold the rights to his songwriting catalog — both solo and with the Police — to Universal Music Group, for an estimated $250 million. 


	It was the biggest hit of 1983, but it's never left the airwaves, with its seductive sound and sinister emotion. For a few decades, nobody seriously questioned that Sting wrote it, like he wrote all their hits. All three of them play brilliantly: Summer's guitar, Copeland's massive snare sound, Sting's bass throb at the 2:58 point. You can hear what each musician is doing at any given moment, because Hugh Padgham's expert production and engineering are so beautifully sparse, with so much open space in the sound. The only enigma, sonically, is the weirdly but awesomely clanging piano, played by Sting. He does for one-note piano solos what Neil Young's “Cinnamon Girl” did for one-note guitar solos.

	So it's not like there's any mystery about what each one contributed to “Every Breath You Take.” The issue is what counts as “songwriting,” versus what counts as “arranging.” It's an eternal argument for musicians, but it was different in the old days, when bands made money from album sales. That revenue stream has dried up, which means publishing royalties matter more than ever. The fights get uglier as musicians get older and their grandkids get thirstier. As the New Yorker's Adam Gopnik wrote, “Every biography or memoir set in the world of popular music turns out to be a book about music publishing.” Spandau Ballet songwriter Gary Kemp once got sued by the rest of the band, except his brother. Did the guy who played the sax solo on “True” write one-fifth of the song? (According to the judge, this much was not true.) 

	











	As Sting was always fond of saying, “Every Breath You Take” wasn't the most radically original song in the world. In 1993, when an interviewer told him, “You completely ripped Bob Marley off on ‘So Lonely,'” Sting agreed. “Totally. ‘No Woman, No Cry' sped up with a slightly different melody. Those chords, classic aren't they, C, G, A Minor, F. It's like the chord sequence around ‘Every Breath You Take' is generic. It's ‘Stand By Me' and it's ‘Slip Slidin' Away' by Paul Simon and the lyrics aren't particularly original either, they're straight out of a fucking rhyming dictionary. But somehow there's something quite unique about that song and I don't know what it is.” 


	It's no surprise the recording sessions were open warfare, with fistfights in the studio. “Sting wanted Stewart to just play a very straight rhythm with no fills or anything,” Padgham recalled. “And that was the complete antithesis of what Stewart was about. Stewart would say, ‘I want to fucking put my drum part on it!' and Sting would say, ‘I don't want you to put your fucking drum part on it! I want you to put what I want you to put on it!' and it would go on like that. It was really difficult.” As Copeland said, “The times when I came the closest to homicide, the times when it became absolutely critical that I choke the life out of this man, were when he would come over to me and tell me something about the hi-hat.”  


	The combat dragged on until Summers added his arpeggio riff. “I didn't stand there and crow about it,” he told Guitar World in 2022. “It was more about keeping those other bastards happy.” As he sees it, he rescued the song from oblivion. “That song was going to be thrown out. Sting and Stewart could not agree on how the bass and drums were going to go. We were in the middle of Synchronicity and Sting says, ‘Well, go on then, go in there and make it your own.' And I did it in one take. They all stood up and clapped. And, of course, the fucking thing went right round the world, straight to Number One in America. And the riff has become a kind of immortal guitar part that all guitar players have to learn.” Sting told the same basic story. As he recalled in 1983, “Musically, I wrote the song and the guitar parts and then turned to Andy and said, ‘Make it your own.'” 


	They argued over songwriting all the time, even in the early days. Copeland and Summers always got a credit or two per album. “The main problem was the songwriting,” Sting said later. “I was giving a portion of my publishing away to the band just to keep it together and everybody wanted to be a songwriter.” Wasn't it obvious he was the writer in this band? “I can't really answer that but I was the person writing all the hits. I thought it was beyond argument. But we still had numerous fights about it.” 

	











	Sumner and Copeland did get to contribute tunes to Synchronicity, so the fact must be faced: these tracks make a real shaky case for their songwriting chops circa 1983. Summers wrote the insultingly awful “Mother,” which was an easy Number One on Rolling Stone's recent list of Terrible Songs on Great Albums. (It beat “Maxwell's Silver Hammer.”) The best you can say for Copeland's “Miss Gradenko” is that it isn't “Mother.” It was scandalous to stick these piss-poor efforts on the same album as “Every Breath You Take,” “King of Pain,” and “Wrapped Around Your Finger,” and having this evidence on the record is no boost to their cause. Compared to them, “De Doo Doo Doo, De Da Da Da” is a masterpiece on par with any book by Nabokov.


	But in the plus column for Summers, he wrote “Omegaman,” the best song on Ghost in the Machine. He also came up with “Behind My Camel,” which won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental of 1980. Sting hated it so much he buried the tape in the yard behind the studio, until Andy dug it up. Copeland penned keepers on 1979's Reggatta de Blanc, like the gem “Does Everyone Stare.” But he found his outlet composing film soundtracks like Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish. “My compositions go pretty much to outside projects,” he said. “Because in the band, there's a kind of unity of sound that we've arrived at, on Sting's material, and I know what to do with it.” 


	The Police broke up soon after “Every Breath You Take,” at the end of their Synchronicity stadium tour, for no reason except mutual loathing. They reconvened very briefly in 1986 for a lousy remake of “Don't Stand So Close to Me,” then again in 1992 at Sting's wedding, then finally in 2007 for their long and lucrative reunion tour. They played Al Gore's Live Earth benefit concert, with John Mayer adding guitar and Kanye West rapping, “Sting, you the only Police good in the hood.” The closest they've come to working together since then? This week, actually, when jazzman Christian McBride dropped his new album. It has his version of “Murder by Numbers,” the song Sting and Summers wrote as a Synchronicity B-side. In a comically ironic bit of timing, they both play on the McBride version — hopefully in separate rooms, to avoid killing each other. 


	It's ironic that such a universally popular wedding ballad has such a fractious origin story — and with this lawsuit, it gets more fractious than ever. But there's no end of weird details about the saga of “Every Breath You Take.” For one thing, there's this: “More Than I Can Say,” by the U.K. pop smoothie Leo Sayer, a long-forgotten Top Ten hit from 1981. The first time I heard “Every Breath You Take” on the radio, I wondered, “How can they get away with this?” Spoiler: they got away with it, since nobody noticed or cared, but it's basically the same song. Sayer was covering a Fifties oldie, but his Eighties version is the one that sounds like “Every Breath You Take,” even though the Police probably never heard it. As for Diddy's remake, Sting told Rolling Stone, “I put a couple of my kids through college with the proceeds.” Last fall, he said the rap mogul's trial didn't “taint” it for him, since “it's still my song.”

	Until now, the most notorious songwriting dispute was The Band. For years, drummer Levon Helm railed against Robbie Robertson over the credits. (Helm's claims were complicated by the fact that he had a long and prolific solo career, yet did not write songs for his albums.) “I wrote songs before I ever met Levon,” Robertson told Rolling Stone in 2000. “I'm sorry, I just worked harder than anybody else. Somebody has to lead the charge, somebody has to draw the map. The guys were responsible for the arrangements, but that's what being a band is, that's your fucking job.” 


	But for Sting, this song was always personal. “It's ostensibly a love song, a very seductive romantic love song,” Sting told Rolling Stone. “But it's about controlling somebody to the nth degree and monitoring their movements.” Many fans missed the sinister subtext. “It's not like ‘Stand by Me,' which is this wonderful noble song that means just one thing. ‘Every Breath You Take' is very ambiguous and quite wicked.” Sting later wrote an answer song, his 1985 solo hit “If You Love Someone, Set Them Free.” “I had to write the antidote,” he said, “after I'd poisoned people with this horrible thing.” Maybe that's why the conflict around this song never ends. It's a timeless classic with a long, twisted history. But 42 years after it topped the charts, the tale of “Every Breath You Take” just keeps on getting stranger.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Why mass UFO sightings are rare: perception, psychology, and the reporting gap","https://cybernews.com/tech/mass-ufo-sightings-stephenville-pheonix-lights/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 13:55:30 GMT","

© 2025 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis.

Why do most UFO sightings disappear from view? Even the most witnessed events fade fast because of perception stigma and reporting gaps.

On March 13th, 1997, in the southwestern states of Nevada and Arizona, a flurry of sightings of what appeared to be a large carpenter square occurred between 7.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. in the mountain time zone.

Thousands of people saw a row of brilliant lights blinking in the sky, but only a few stepped forward because they feared they might be ridiculed by other members of the community – and the media.

UFO skeptic Robert Sheaffer has even labelled it ""perhaps the most widely witnessed UFO event in history.""

What is it about collective consciousness that seems to make group sightings so unreliable?

The Phoenix Lights mystery remains a memorable event of collective curiosity, yet it doesn't have the same mass hysteria as an Orson Welles hoax, for example.

And, the mixed responses you'd get differ from person to person. 

Different levels of interest, varying levels of belief, and diverse vantage points (caused by weather or landscape) can cause wavering accounts – as can mass hysteria.

On September 16th, 1994, near Ruwa, Zimbabwe, 62 pupils claimed to have seen a silver craft in the sky land in a field nearby. 

Various students reported that they'd been in telepathic conversations with aliens dressed in black.

Although this sounds far-fetched, what's interesting is how the accounts of the event were recorded.

A local researcher called Cynthia Hind interviewed the children in groups of four to six. What took place next was a cross-contamination of stories.

Whether or not the students embellished the story together is a different matter. It's the fact that it gets written off so easily that's more important than its fragmentation. 

In Stephenville, Texas (2008), dozens of locals – including a pilot and a police officer – claimed to see a huge silent craft, with radar backing some of their accounts, yet the story barely made national headlines.

Even though 40 people claimed to have seen the same thing, it's often seen through the eyes of the most credible witnesses, in this case, a pilot and a police officer who had the courage to step forward.

According to an NPR source, military officials easily discredited the individuals in question because “their imaginations were running wild.”

Stigma, skepticism, and lack of media interest often mute even the strongest testimonies.

When collective consciousness is shut down so easily, undulating fear creeps into society, regardless of who controls the narrative.

That's why when individual whistleblowers come forward, they might well signify something greater than a whacko individual whose imagination has gone cuckoo.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Jensen Ackles' Best TV Character Will Never Be Dethroned","https://screenrant.com/jensen-ackles-supernatural-dean-winchester-never-dethroned/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 00:25:00 GMT","

Jensen Ackles is having a moment, with his roles in The Boys universe, Prime Video's Countdown, and CBS series Tracker all giving him a boost over the last couple of years — but none of these projects will ever dethrone his best role. Ackles has played a range of TV characters, but the one that put him on the map is still his greatest accomplishment. 

Even with all his new projects and characters, Ackles is most often associated with Dean Winchester. Given that Supernatural ran for 15 seasons and became a beloved and iconic addition to network television, that's probably no surprise. However, Dean being Ackles' best character goes beyond Supernatural's legacy. It stems from how well he brings the elder Winchester brother to life.

Supernatural may have ended back in 2020, but Dean Winchester remains Ackles' best TV character, and that's unlikely to change any time soon. Ackles plays a number of great roles, from Soldier Boy in The Boys to Russell Shaw in Tracker and Mark Meachum in Countdown. 

He brings depth to every single role, and he has done so since his early days in series like Smallville and Dawson's Creek. But Dean Winchester has more layers than his other characters, particularly his other most noteworthy role: Soldier Boy. 

Soldier Boy's spinoff show has the potential to tap into deeper parts of the character, but The Boys presents him as a humorous villain more than anything else. It's hard to feel for him, as he's so clearly on the wrong side of things and always has been. Just being better than Homelander doesn't make us feel for him.

Tracker's Russell Shaw is beloved because Ackles portrays him, but the role hasn't given the actor many opportunities to deliver emotional performances. With Ackles returning in Tracker season 3, it's possible this will change. But Russell has a long way to go before making anything close to Dean's impact. 

Countdown's Mark Meachum is perhaps the closest to Dean, as he has the ability to be vulnerable but hides his best qualities beneath a seemingly carefree demeanor. He hasn't been given enough of a runway to match Dean, though, and it's difficult to imagine him becoming nearly as iconic.

Ackles' success as Dean Winchester may go beyond Supernatural's lengthy run, but the show's many seasons ensure that topping this character will be almost impossible. Dean receives more than 300 episodes of development, and that's something few characters get.

The fact that Supernatural's writing makes Dean's journey one of its most interesting only makes reaching his level that much harder. Dean becomes more vulnerable and selfless over the course of the show, and Ackles masterfully showcases this. It bleeds into his relationships with characters like Sam and Castiel too, making Dean's time on-screen so incredibly memorable.

A Canadian heiress from one of the world's richest families is taking her former best friend to court after a cryptocurrency gamble — recommended by a psychic and later confirmed by an astrologer — went disastrously wrong, wiping out $80 million.

Taylor Thomson, 66, the middle daughter of Canada's billionaire Thomson family, forged a close friendship with Ashley Richardson, 47, after meeting at a Malibu party in 2009. For over a decade, the pair shared a lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles, but their bond shattered in 2022 following the crypto market crash.

According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Richardson pushed Thomson to invest in Persistence (XPRT), a little-known digital token, after consulting celebrity psychic Michelle Whitedove. The idea was later validated by Thomson's personal astrologer, Robert Sabella. At its height, Thomson had more than $140 million tied up in the token, with Richardson managing the funds.

When the market collapsed, Thomson accused Richardson of misusing her money by executing hundreds of thousands of speculative trades without approval. Richardson has denied the allegations, insisting she always acted with Thomson's consent and even put in her own savings.

By mid-2022, amid repeated disputes, Thomson brought in consulting firm Guidepost to investigate. “In the first half of that year, while Richardson had control of Thomson's digital assets, there were more than 450,000 trades with the billionaire's funds, many of which she didn't authorize and were extremely risky,” said Bradley Dizik, president of Guidepost's technology practice, told The Journal.

Dizik estimated Thomson's losses at over $80 million tied to Richardson's management of her assets. A Thomson spokesperson confirmed Guidepost was still working “to recoup the tens of millions of dollars of Ms. Thomson's money lost under Ms. Richardson's control.”

Taylor Thomson, 66, is one of six billionaire heirs of the Thomson family, whose fortune originates from the media and publishing empire founded by her grandfather, Roy Thomson, in the 1930s.

The Thomson family was named Canada's richest by Maclean's in 2024, with an estimated net worth of $98.15 billion. Bloomberg also ranked them as the 10th richest family globally. The family's investment firm, Woodbridge, owns around 70% of Thomson Reuters, including more than 310 million shares.

Before embracing her role in the family empire, Thomson trained at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She acted in Shakespearean productions in Massachusetts and Los Angeles, and appeared in the US TV show Matrix and the Canadian drama Forever Knight.

Taylor herself owns about 14% of the business through Woodbridge. According to Bloomberg's billionaire index, Taylor Thomson has a personal fortune exceeding $13 billion.

She also owns a number of properties and has invested heavily in artwork and real estate.

Speaking to The Journal, her former friend Richardson said, “We would go somewhere for a few days and she'd be buying houses like other people buy mugs… She had so many properties, so much art, so many things. There was this endless swirl of chaos.”

Taylor is the only daughter and middle child in the Thomson family. Control of the empire traditionally passed down the male line, leading to tension as she pushed for equal access to family wealth, sometimes straining ties with her brothers.

In 1999, she had a daughter. According to The Journal, Taylor has often been wary of people exploiting her wealth, going so far as to require assistants, friends, and even her daughter's ex-boyfriend to sign nondisclosure agreements.

During a custody battle, she hired notorious Hollywood private investigator Anthony Pellicano to spy on a former nanny, fearing she was leaking personal information.

She once even accused an employee of embezzling her money and of selling her daughter's designer dresses, which were later found.

Rudy Giuliani's car accident, hot on the heels of US President Donald Trump's ‘disappearance', has set off a storm of conspiracy theories on social media.

Trump went missing from the public eye for four days last week, fueling rumours about his death. On Sunday, however, he was spotted leaving the White House, reported The New York Post.

The US president later shared a photograph on Truth Social that shows him posing with Jon Gruden. It is unclear whether the photograph was taken on Sunday. Internet sleuths pointed out that the photo was most likely taken on August 23 – noting that Gruden had last week shared a photo that showed Trump in the same golfing gear.

Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized late Saturday evening after a car crash near Manchester, New Hampshire, a spokesman said.

Giuliani, 81, has worked as an attorney for President Donald Trump in his failed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Giuliani was being driven in a rented Ford Bronco by his spokesperson Ted Goodman when their vehicle was struck from behind by a Honda HR-V driven by a 19-year-old woman late Saturday evening, New Hampshire State Police said in a statement.

Prior to the accident, Giuliani had been “flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident"" and contacted police assistance on her behalf, his head of security Michael Ragusa said. After police arrived, Giuliani continued on his way and his vehicle was hit shortly after pulling onto the highway in a crash that was “entirely unrelated” to the domestic violence incident, Ragusa told The Associated Press in an emailed statement.

 

The two incidents, while seemingly unrelated, have set off a storm of conspiracy theories online.

“Something very fishy about this. According to his spokesman the disgraced former mayor stopped his car to “help a domestic violence victim” Bulls**t. Rudy Giuliani has never helped a single individual in life. Except for Donald Trump,” wrote one person.

“Credit where it's due: Rudy dying to distract from Trump dying is some next level lawyering,” another joked.

https://x.com/ajbauer/status/1962262873473741150

Some wondered whether Giuliani's accident was being used as a ‘distraction'.



“Could Rudy's accident be a distraction from Trump's disappearance which is a distraction from the Epstein files and Wednesday's hearings?” asked one X user.

“MAGA sacrificed Rudy yet again to distract from Trump,” another posted.

“Wonder if Trump administration set up the accident because Rudy was going to tell what he knows about Epstein,” an X user wondered.

            Officials in Chicago are bracing for a major federal immigration enforcement operation that could begin as soon as this week, with the city's mayor signing an order over the weekend aimed at resisting the Trump administration's planned crackdown.
    


            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday such a move would be an “invasion” and that he has had no communication with the Trump administration about reported plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago.
    


            “No one in the administration – the president or anybody under him – has called anyone in my administration, or me. So, it's clear that in secret they're planning this – well, it's an invasion with US troops, if they in fact do that,” Pritzker said Sunday.
    


            The operation is expected to kick off in Chicago by this Friday and could involve agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and potentially be backed by guard forces in a peacekeeping role, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning.
    


            “We've already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on CBS News' “Face the Nation” on Sunday.
    


            An immigration operation in the city would further escalate a clash between the White House and Democratic-led cities and comes as President Donald Trump and his aides have repeatedly slammed Chicago over policies that limit cooperation between local authorities and federal immigration enforcement.
    


            Asked about expanding these operations beyond Chicago, Noem said that the Trump administration has “not taken anything off the table,” and specifically named San Francisco and Boston in addition to Chicago. She suggested that Republican-led cities with crime problems were “absolutely” also being evaluated.
    


            Chicago has been preparing to try to resist Trump's planned immigration crackdown with Mayor Brandon Johnson signing an executive order Saturday providing guidance and directives to the city's agencies and law enforcement “in the midst of escalating threats from the federal government.”
    


            The mayor's order “affirms” that Chicago police will not “collaborate with federal agents on joint law enforcement patrols, arrest operations, or other law enforcement duties including civil immigration enforcement.” It also “urges” federal law enforcement officers to use body cameras and refrain from wearing masks.
    


            “We may see militarized immigration enforcement. We may also see National Guard troops. We may even see active duty military and armed vehicles in our streets. We have not called for this. Our people have not asked for this, but nevertheless, we find ourselves having to respond to this,” Johnson said before signing the executive order on Saturday.
    


            White House officials have made clear that these immigration enforcement plans are distinct from the idea the president has floated over the past week to use federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to carry out a broader crime crackdown in Chicago, similar to the current surge in Washington, DC.
    


            Trump took to social media Monday morning with a post celebrating what he called a massive victory over crime in the nation's capital and taking sharp aim at Democratic leaders across the country for refusing his floated plans for an aggressive federal anti-crime strategy in their states as well.
    


            He contrasted politicians who are resisting his plans with what he sees as a more welcoming stance from Washington DC's leadership. In the Truth Social post, Trump said DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's “statements and actions were positive, instead of others like Pritzker, Wes Moore, Newscum, and the 5% approval rated Mayor of Chicago, who spend all of their time trying to justify violent Crime, instead of working with us to completely ELIMINATE it.”
    


            Trump officials have been quick to criticize the Illinois governor and defend potential federal policing in the state by pointing to crime statistics.
    


            Noem pointed to homicide statistics in Chicago on Sunday in a dig to the governor, saying Pritzker “can talk about what a great job he's doing as governor, but he's failing these families. …This seems like it's more about Gov. Pritzker's ego now rather than actually protecting his people.”
    


            In a warning to Pritzker on Saturday, Trump told the governor to quickly “straighten” out crime in Chicago or the federal government will intervene.
    


            “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn't need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            At least 52 people were shot – seven of them fatally – in Chicago over the holiday weekend. Roughly 30 shootings have been reported since Friday at 10:32 p.m., with victims ranging in age from 14 to 46, according to incident notifications published by the Chicago Police Department.
    


            Meanwhile, the Chicago mayor's office last week touted a 21.6% decrease in overall violent crime and a 32.3% decrease in homicides so far this year.

Christine Lagarde issues warning about risks of undermining central bank's independence

Donald Trump's attempt to influence the US Federal Reserve could pose a “very serious danger” for the world economy, the head of the European Central Bank has warned.

Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, said Trump undermining the independence of the world's most powerful central bank would have an impact for the US and other countries.

Steps by the US president to remove the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, or the governor Lisa Cook would be a “very serious danger for the US economy and the world economy”, Lagarde told the French broadcaster Radio Classique.

“If US monetary policy were no longer independent and instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person, then I believe that the effect on the balance of the American economy could, as a result of the effects this would have around the world, be very worrying, because it is the largest economy in the world,” she said, according to remarks reported by Reuters.

Trump has repeatedly criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates and has threatened to fire him. He is also attempting to remove Cook, who is appealing against the decision in a case that could reach the US supreme court.

In court on Friday, lawyers for Cook argued that she could not be fired without the notice or “cause” required to remove a Fed governor. She learned of her attempted removal via a post on social media, they said.

Sacking Cook, whose term is not due to expire until 2038, would enable Trump to nominate a replacement. However, Cook has argued that the president has “no authority” to remove her.

Lagarde said it would be “very difficult” for Trump to take control of Fed decision-making on interest rates. “The US supreme court, which is largely respected in the country and therefore I hope will be respected by [Trump] as well, has clearly indicated that a Fed governor can only be dismissed in the case of gross misconduct.”

Trump received backing for his assault on the Fed last week from Liz Truss, the shortest-serving British prime minister in history, who was ousted after a meltdown in the financial markets.

Leading investors and economists have said political interference damages the credibility of central banks to keep inflation under control. US government borrowing costs have risen in recent months amid concern about the impact Trump's tariff policies could have and questions about Fed independence.

Borrowing costs have also risen across other advanced economies. The rise is linked to the uncertainty in the US, alongside investor worries about elevated debt levels in several nations and the return of inflation after the Covid pandemic, and Russia's war in Ukraine.

Long-term borrowing costs for the UK government have risen close to the highest levels in 30 years, while the yield – in effect the interest rate – on French government debt has also risen amid a political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron.

Lagarde, who was France's finance minister until 2011 before leaving to run the International Monetary Fund, said the risk of collapse facing the French government was a concern for the eurozone economy.

“Political developments and moments of political risk have an obvious impact on the economy,” she said.

Facing difficulty in getting his budget passed, the prime minister, François Bayrou, is expected to lose a confidence vote in the national assembly on 8 September after announcing a “back me or sack me” election last week.

The ECB president said the central bank was carefully monitoring developments in financial markets. However, she signalled that Paris was unlikely to need emergency support from the IMF, playing down a suggestion made by the country's finance minister, Eric Lombard, late last month.

Lagarde said the French banking system was better placed now than it was during the 2008 financial crisis. “Countries request IMF intervention in circumstances of serious budgetary deficit or when a country cannot meet its financial obligations … I do not believe that the banking system itself is in any way the source of the current risk – but markets, in all circumstances of this nature, assess the risk.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            Nestle has dismissed its CEO, Laurent Freixe, after a code of conduct breach, the company said on Monday, appointing Philipp Navratil as his successor.
    


            Nestle said Freixe's departure follows an investigation overseen by Chairman Paul Bulcke and Lead Independent Director Pablo Isla into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached the company's code of business conduct.
    


            “This was a necessary decision,” said Bulcke in a statement. “Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.”
    


            Company veteran Freixe took over the CEO role in September last year after Nestle ousted his predecessor, Mark Schneider.
    


            Navratil began his career with Nestle in 2001 as an internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America, he was appointed country manager for Nestle Honduras in 2009.
    


            He assumed leadership of the coffee and beverage business in Mexico in 2013, and transitioned to Nestle's Coffee strategic business unit in 2020.
    


            He moved to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined the Nestle executive board on January 1 this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","The old world order was buried in China. Here's why it matters","https://www.rt.com/news/623872-old-world-order-buried/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 16:09:00 GMT","

The latest gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Tianjin looks at first like another summit – handshakes, family portraits, scripted statements. But the meeting on August 31–September 1 is more than diplomatic theater: it is another marker of the end of the unipolar era dominated by the United States, and the rise of a multipolar system centered on Asia, Eurasia, and the Global South.

At the table were Chinese President Xi Jinping, his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – together representing more than a third of humanity and 3 of largest countries on Earth.

Xi unveiled a broad Global Governance Initiative, including a proposed SCO development bank, cooperation on artificial intelligence, and financial support for developing nations. Putin described the SCO as “a vehicle for genuine multilateralism” and called for a Eurasian security model beyond Western control. Modi's presence – his first visit to China in years – and the powerful optics around his meeting with Putin, signaled that India is willing to be seen as part of this emerging order.



The pitch: Xi is promoting an order that “democratizes” global governance and reduces dependence on US-centric finance (think: less dollar gravity, more regional institutions). Putin called the SCO a vehicle for “genuine multilateralism” and Eurasian security. By calling China a partner rather than a rival, Modi signaled New Delhi won't be locked into Washington's anti-China agenda.

The audience: More than 20 non-Western leaders were in the room, with United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres endorsing the event organisation – not a club meeting in the shadows, but a UN-centered frame at a China-led forum.



Beijing's line is blunt: reject Cold War blocs and restore the UN system as the only universal legal baseline. That's a direct rebuke to the post-1991 “rules-based international order”, drafted in Washington or Brussels and enforced selectively.

Examples are not hard to find. The 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia went ahead without a UN mandate, justified under the “responsibility to protect.” The 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq was launched despite the absence of Security Council approval – a war later admitted even by Western officials to have been based on false premises. In 2011, a UN resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya was used by NATO to pursue outright regime change, leaving behind a failed state and opening a corridor of misery into the heart of Western Europe.

For China, Russia and many Global South states, these episodes proved that the “rules-based order” was never about universal law but about Western discretion. The insistence in Tianjin that the UN Charter be restored as the only legitimate framework is meant to flip the script: to argue that the SCO, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and new members Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, plus Indonesia), and their partners are defending the actual rules of international law, while the West substitutes ad hoc coalitions and shifting standards for its own convenience.

Both Xi and Putin drove the point home, but in different registers.

Xi's line: He denounced “hegemonism and bullying behavior” and called for a “democratization of global governance,” stressing that the SCO should serve as a model of true multilateralism anchored in the UN and the World Trade Organization (WTO), not in ad hoc “rules” devised by a few Western capitals.

Putin's line: He went further, charging that the United States and its allies were directly responsible for the conflict escalation in Ukraine, and arguing that the SCO offers a framework for a genuine Eurasian security order – one not dictated by NATO or Western-imposed standards.



Security spine: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization brings together Russia, China, India and Central Asian states to coordinate security, counterterrorism and intelligence – the hard-power framework that makes the rest possible.Economic boardrooms: BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) expanded in 2024 to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, followed by Indonesia in 2025.

With its New Development Bank and a drive for trade in national currencies, it now acts as a counterweight to the Group of Seven (G7).

Regional weight: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – a ten-member bloc shaping Asian trade and standards – increasingly aligns with SCO and BRICS projects.

Energy leverage: The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), six Arab monarchies, coordinate policy through the wider Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (OPEC+), giving them control over key oil flows.

Taken together, these bodies already function as a parallel governance system that doesn't need Western sponsorship or veto power.



The European Union (EU) is absent from Tianjin – and that absence speaks volumes. Once promoted as the second global pole, Europe is now tied to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for defense, dependent on outside energy, and fractured internally. Even its flagship Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) has soured relations with India and other Global South economies. In Tianjin, Europe was not a participant in decisions – only a spectator.



The SCO summit precedes China's Victory Day military parade in Beijing on September 3, commemorating 80 years since Japan's surrender in World War II. Xi, Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with whom Moscow has a bilateral security pact, will stand together as Beijing showcases intercontinental missiles, long-range strike systems and drone formations.

The spectacle will likely demonstrate that multipolarity is not just a form of diplomatic language, but that it backed by the hard power on display.



A rival rule-set with institutions: From a Shanghai Cooperation Organization bank to BRICS financing and potential ASEAN–GCC coordination, there is now a procedural path to act without Western oversight.

UN-first framing: By anchoring legitimacy in the UN Charter, the bloc positions Western “rules-based” frameworks as partisan.

India's calculus: Modi's public handshakes with Xi and Putin have normalized a Eurasian triangle that Washington and Brussels cannot easily fracture.

Europe's shrinking veto: EU regulations such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism no longer set the agenda in Eurasia, where energy, trade and security are coordinated elsewhere.



The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin was less about formal speeches than about symbolism. It signalled that the unipolar world has ended. From development banks to energy corridors to parades of missiles, a new multipolar order is taking shape – and it no longer asks for Western permission.

China's president urged leaders at the summit to reject the ""Cold War mentality,"" in an apparent reference to US policies. Meanwhile, Russia's Vladimir Putin has used the forum to defend his war in Ukraine.

It was a roundup of all the news, analyses and videos related to the SCO 2025 summit. This blog is now closed.

Kyiv has lambasted the closing statement of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit hosted by China for failing to mention Russia's war in Ukraine.

In a statement on Monday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said this omission in the 20-page declaration was ""telling.""

""It is surprising that the largest war of aggression in Europe since the Second World War is not reflected in such an important, fundamental document, while it mentions a number of other wars, terrorist attacks and events in the world,"" the statement read.

Kyiv stressed that sustainable global development, international peace and security, adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, or the stable and equal development of trade relations between regions of the world, all issues touched upon in the SCO declaration, could not be addressed properly without ""a just end to Russia's aggression.""

It also described the omission as Moscow's failed attempt to ""portray the world as divided in its assessment of Russia's aggression against Ukraine,"" by showing that sympathy for Ukraine did not extend beyond the West.

""Given China's significant geopolitical role, we welcome Beijing's more active role in bringing peace to Ukraine based on respect for the UN Charter,"" Kyiv said.

A joint statement wrapping the two-day SCO summit seemingly condemned US President Donald Trump's tariff policy, as well as all recent attacks against the organization's member states.

SCO members stressed in the statement their rejection of unilateral coercive measures, including ""economic"" measures, in a seeming reference to Trump's tariffs, which have hit member states China and India most heavily.

The statement also condemned the Israeli and US attacks on nuclear facilities in member state Iran in June.

The member states also strongly condemned ""acts causing civilian casualties and humanitarian disasters in Gaza,"" according to a statement published by Xinhua news agency, adding that they called for a ""comprehensive, lasting ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian aid."" 

Another clause also condemned the Pahalgam attack in the India-administered Kashmir in April, which left dozens killed, mostly Indian tourists. The attack sparked a short but significant military confrontation between nuclear powers and SCO member states India and Pakistan.

News reports suggested a passage in the SCO statement addressing the conflict triggered India's ire.  

Russia's war on Ukraine was not addressed in the statement.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin discussed how to ""deepen bilateral cooperation in all sectors"" on Monday.

The two leaders met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

Their meeting came with India facing mounting pressure from the United States over its continued and growing reliance on Russian oil.

As part of his efforts to bring about a peace agreement in Ukraine, US President Donald Trump has ramped up pressure on India to stop buying Russian crude which helps Moscow fund its war effort in Ukraine.

But instead of distancing itself from Moscow, New Delhi has doubled down. After their talks in Tianjin on Monday, Modi said he had an ""excellent meeting"" with Putin, in which they looked at furthering cooperation ""in all sectors, including trade, fertilisers, space, security and culture.""  

""Our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership remains a vital pillar of regional and global stability,"" Modi said in a post on Facebook.

Putin, for his part, called Modi a ""dear friend,"" highlighting the close relationship their two countries have enjoyed since the Cold War 

""Russia and India have maintained special relations for decades. Friendly, trusting. This is the foundation for the development of our relations in the future,"" the Russian leader said. 

Putin is due to visit India in December for an annual bilateral summit.

For more on India's ties with Russia amid Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, take a look at DW's Ukraine updates.

Vladimir Putin praised Turkey as a ""strategic"" partner in bilateral cooperation, particularly in energy,  during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

""Our focus is also on topics of common interest, such as the Middle East, North Africa, and Transcaucasia. Russian-Turkish cooperation in all these areas is well-established, concrete, useful, and, I would say, trusting,"" Putin said, according to Russian state media.

Russia's leader also hailed Turkey's role as a mediator in talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Erdogan, meanwhile, stressed that Ankara sought a ""fair and lasting peace"" in Ukraine.

The Russian president highlighted their nations' growing bilateral trade and investment.

While Russia has faced increasingly tough sanctions from Western nations over its war in Ukraine, Turkey has continued to do business with Moscow despite being a member of the NATO military alliance.

Russia is one of Turkey's key energy suppliers, according to Turkish state media Anadolu Agency. 

Ankara buys natural gas from Russia, which is delivered via two parallel pipelines that run through the Black Sea.

At their meeting, Erdogan confirmed that his invitation for Putin to visit Turkey ""remains valid.""

""We look forward to welcoming you to our country as soon as possible. We have sincere relations based on trust. Our relations are developing without being affected by current circumstances,"" the Turkish president said.

For more on what Putin said on the war in Ukraine, follow DW's Ukraine updates.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also held bilateral talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the SCO summit on Monday.

The talks come after US President Trump has imposed additional tariffs on India over purchases of Russian oil. 

Both China and India are the biggest buyers of crude oil from Russia and have refused to succumb to unrelenting pressure from Trump to stop the purchases. 

Putin on Monday gave Modi a lift in this armoured limousine, calling the Indian Prime Minister his ""dear friend"".

Modi shared a picture on X of him and Putin inside the Russian Aurus limousine.

""Even in the most difficult situations, India and Russia have always walked shoulder to shoulder,"" Modi told the Russian leader.

""Our close cooperation is important not only for the people of both countries but also for global peace, stability and prosperity.""

Putin said during the meeting that Moscow and New Delhi have maintained ""special relations for decades"" which are ""friendly and trusting"" and that this was the foundation for the development of future ties between the two nations.

India's Prime Minister delivered his country's statement in an address at the plenary session of the SCO summit on Monday. 

He said that New Delhi's vision and policy towards the SCO are built on three key pillars of  ""Security, Connectivity and Opportunity"". 

Modi used the platform to rally countries to oppose terrorism, saying that India had borne the brunt of it in the last four decades.

The SCO member states also signed a declaration condemning an April attack by Islamist militants in Indian-administered Kashmir's Pahalgam town, which had triggered a military conflict between India and Pakistan. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin defended his invasion of Ukraine at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit.

During his address in Tianjin, the Russian leader reiterated his unfounded claim that the war in Ukraine was triggered by a ""coup d'etat"" in Kyiv that was ""supported and provoked by the West.""

""The second reason for the crisis is the West's constant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO,"" Putin said.

He also made a mention of the August summit in Alaska with US President Donald Trump.

While the war in Ukraine has carried on in the weeks since that meeting, Putin told the SCO leaders that ""understandings"" that could pave the way to peace had been reached in Alaska.

China's President Xi Jinping denounced what he called ""bullying behavior"" in the world order as he gathered regional leaders for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit on Monday.

He called on the leaders of the security-focused bloc to ""adhere to fairness and justice... oppose Cold War mentality, camp confrontation, and bullying behavior.""

Xi said that the present international situation is ""becoming chaotic and intertwined"" and the security and development tasks for the member states of the SCO have become ""even more challenging"".

""Looking back, despite tumultuous times, we have achieved success by practicing the Shanghai spirit,"" the Chinese President said as he referred to the the SCO group.

""Looking to the future, with the world undergoing turbulence and transformation, we must continue to follow the Shanghai spirit, keep our feet on the ground, forge ahead, and better perform the functions of the organization.""

 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a picture of him hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin on social media platform X ahead of the proceedings of the second leg of the SCO summit being held in Tianjin, China.

""Always a delight to meet President Putin!"" Modi wrote. 

All eyes are set on the two leaders as they are expected to hold bilateral talks on Monday in the shadow of intense US pressure on India over its purchase of crude oil from Russia.  

Modi and Putin are meeting in-person for the first time during Donald Trump's second stint as US president.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit has entered a busy day two in China's Tianjin on Monday.

A plenary session of the summit is underway. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his opening remarks that Beijing will work with all parties in the SCO to take regional security to the next level.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also set to address the plenary session. Modi is expected to hold bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the summit amid US pressure over New Delhi's Russian purchasing of Russian oil. 

The SCO includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus, along with 16 more countries affiliated as observers or ""dialogue partners"".

 

All eyes were on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping's bilateral meeting at the latest summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Tianjin.

Modi is visiting China for the first time since relations between the two countries deteriorated after Chinese and Indian soldiers engaged in deadly border clashes in 2020.

Modi addressed the situation in his opening remarks, saying that relations between the countries were moving in a ""meaningful direction"" and there was a ""peaceful environment"" at the borders.

According to state broadcaster CCTV, Xi said they should ""not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,"" adding that economic development should be their main focus.

Meanwhile, Xi also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian state media published a video of the two leaders warmly greeting each other. But details of their conversation were not immediately available.

Putin is also scheduled to meet with Narendra Modi, at a time when their relations are under the global spotlight following US tariffs of 50% on goods from India.

Putin and others are expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on September 3 to mark the end of World War II. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, is also expected to attend. 

During a banquet at the SCO summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed attendees, telling them that the SCO is ""shouldering greater responsibilites for safeguarding regional peace and stability,"" according to the Chinese state-run Xinhua news outlet. 

Jinping told attendees that the ""SCO is certain to play an even bigger role and achieve more progress, making greater contribution to boosting the unity and cooperation among member states, pooling the strength of the Global South and pushing for more progress of human civilization."" 

According to Xinhua, the SCO summit is the ""largest-ever summit of the group.""

The summit is occuring as US President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on countries around the world, raising global trade tensions. Some countries are looking for new trade partners amid uncertainty due to US economic policy. 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the SCO summit in Tianjin.

 According to a post on X from the Turkish presidency, the two leaders emphasized their bilateral economic ties and trade. The post said that ""increasing coordination on Chinese companies investing in Türkiye would be beneficial."" 

The statement said the two leaders discussed Gaza, the war in Ukraine and ""joint steps that can be taken towards the development of Syria.""

Both China and Turkey are seeking new economic investments in Syria after the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad last year, with the country now trying to rebuild under a new Islamist-led interim government.

According to an article in English from Chinese state-run outlet Xinhua, Xi told Erdogan that ""China and Türkiye are both emerging major countries with a spirit of independence.""

Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with Azerbaijani President Ilhan Aliyev in what seemed to be friendly meeting between the two sides.

An Azerbaijani readout of the meeting said that Xi addressed Aliyev as ""my dear friend."" 

""President Xi Jinping emphasized that successful cooperative relations have been established between Azerbaijan and China over the past 30 years, and that these relations are currently developing at the level of a comprehensive stretegic partnership,"" the Azerbaijani statement said. 

The Chinese readout of the meeting noted that ""China and Azerbaijan are good friends and good partners.""

It highlighted the close economic ties between the two countries, and the ""efficacy of the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route,"" which is used to transport Chinese goods via Azerbaijan. The two sides have close cooperation in the field of energy, with Azerbaijan being rich in natural gas. 

China also supports Azerbaijan's membership in the SCO and noted that Azerbaijan ""firmly abides by the one-China principle.""

It's tomato season and Lidia is harvesting on farms in California's Central Valley.

She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager. 

“The worry is they'll pull you over when you're driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. “We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.”

As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump's stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation's labor force.

More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents. 

Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.

“It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.”




Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.

Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.

“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”

Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.

Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.

“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said. 

In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).

Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.

Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.

“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.

Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.

“I don't know if I'll be able to bring my kids,” said Lidia. “I'm also very concerned I'd have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”

Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.

“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We've seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.”

The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.

“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.”

Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.

The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.

“What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?” De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops? Who's going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?” ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

NEW YORK (AP) — Naomi Osaka has taken the first set against Coco Gauff by a 6-3 score in their much-anticipated matchup in the U.S. Open's fourth round on Monday.

Gauff made 16 unforced errors in that set, while a consistent and confident Osaka made just five.

Gauff, a 21-year-old from Florida, is the Grand Slam tournament's No. 3 seed. Osaka, a 27-year-old who was born in Japan and moved to the U.S. with her family at age 3, is the No. 23 seed.

They have won a combined three titles at Flushing Meadows.

Monday's winner will make it to this year's quarterfinals and face No. 11 Karolina Muchova or No. 27 Marta Kostyuk.

The match is being held in Arthur Ashe Stadium. It began after Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada beat Andrey Rublev of Russia there in the fourth round of the men's bracket.

ESPN is showing the U.S. Open in the United States. Other countries' broadcasters are listed here.

This is the sixth matchup between Gauff and Osaka as pros — and the second at Flushing Meadows.

Back in 2019, also in Ashe, Osaka defeated a 15-year-old Gauff in straight sets, then consoled the teary American afterward and invited her to speak to the spectators.

Gauff has won three of the four matches they have played against each other since then, so she led the head-to-head series 3-2 entering Monday.




Osaka owns four Grand Slam singles championships, including at the U.S. Open in 2018 and 2020. The other two came at the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021.

Gauff, who has been working with a new coach on her serve to try to overcome double-faulting problems, has collected two major trophies in singles — at the U.S. Open in 2023 and the French Open this year — and one in doubles.

Police revealed the cause of death for former U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber on Monday, months after she died in her sleep at home in March.

The medical examiner's office in Alexandria, Virginia says the former official died from a ""sudden unexpected death in epilepsy,"" according to the Virginian-Pilot. Police had said earlier this year that they had ""found no evidence suggesting that her death was caused by anything other than natural causes.""

Aber's family had released a statement to the press shortly after her death noting that she had suffered from epilepsy and related seizures ""for many years.""

Aber, 43, worked as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia from 2021 to 2025 before stepping down on Jan. 20, the same day that President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

In her resignation letter, she called her role ""an honor beyond measure.""

""I am deeply grateful to senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and to President Biden for the opportunity to lead this office and to Attorney General Garland for his steadfast leadership,"" she wrote at the time, referring to the two senators representing Virginia. ""I am proud of the work we have done with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners to enforce the law and build community trust.""

One of her biggest legal victories came last year, shortly before her resignation, when ex-CIA analyst Asif Rahman pleaded guilty to leaking top-secret documents about an Israeli plan to strike Iran.

Rahman was accused of posting documents about Israel's strike last year on Telegram, leading the country's military to hold off on its initial plans.

Aber criticized Rahman's actions as a ""violation of his oath, his responsibility, and the law"" and said the leak ""placed lives at risk, undermined U.S. foreign relations, and compromised our ability to collect vital intelligence in the future.""

In 2019, Aber received the Department of Justice's Assistant Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service.

The ‘Outnumbered' panel reacts to a Democrat-backed bill that would block federal agencies from clearing homeless encampments on public lands.

An executive order signed by President Donald Trump is aiming to combat crime involving homelessness throughout the country, with cities such as Las Vegas seeing a crisis surrounding encampments overtaking communities and crippling the local area. 

Sin City has seen an uptick in homelessness throughout the community, with a 20% increase within Clark County in 2024, according to the most recent data from the Southern Nevada Homeless Continuum of Care. 

""It's progressively gotten worse and worse and worse,"" Robert Marbut, the former federal homelessness czar under Trump's first administration, told Fox News Digital. ""And there was sort of an idea that they tried a lot of gimmicks in the beginning.""

The increase comes as Clark County officials are looking to combat homelessness, but have reportedly hit roadblocks while acknowledging the city possesses the funding, yet lacks a concrete plan.

""I mean, we have the resources but we do not have a specific plan,"" Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom said, according to News 3 Las Vegas.

""We have lots of resources. But we are not proactive, we really respond. So, unless somebody calls and tells us what is going on, a lot of times we have so much going on in the county that we do not have the ability to be there.""

Segerblom did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The concept of a city having resources, but no concrete way of executing an effective plan, is not new, according to Marbut. 

""I only lost one project [in two decades] because of money,"" Marbut told Fox News Digital. ""Every other city that decides not to do something, it's the lack of political will of the leadership.""

Marbut pointed to two key groups within the city's homeless population serving as the cause of concern for local officials: individuals who remain unhoused on the streets, and those who are often in and out of hospitals. 

""They'll move from the street to jail, to the emergency room, back to the street, under a river, into a rescue mission, back to the street, back to jail,"" Marbut said. ""And that group has a lot of people trying to say, ‘We just need more housing, we need affordable housing.' This is a group [that], even with affordable housing, can't keep their house.""

The issue of maintaining a rental is reflected in the numbers, with Clark County accounting for over 26,000 evictions since the start of this year, according to data from Eviction Lab. The county currently has about 371,000 rental households, the organization reported. 

Marbut looked to his own experience addressing homelessness throughout the area within the last four years. 

""They were saying, ‘We just want to keep building more affordable housing and we want to keep giving away free housing to people who are experiencing homelessness,'"" Marbut said. ""But it didn't work.""

According to Marbut, street-level homelessness within Las Vegas continues to rise on an annual basis, with local leaders putting the bulk of their efforts into combating the crisis within the city's highly-trafficked tourism areas. 

""They are putting money into the street-level because of their self-interest,"" Marbut said. ""That's what's motivating them, and if that's what it takes to get funding – to fund a good model – OK, go for it."" 

The city reportedly pivoted to offering vouchers for free food and housing in past attempts to fight homelessness – an attempt that Marbut believes proved futile. 

HOMELESS PEOPLE CAN BE REMOVED FROM STREETS BY CITIES, STATES IN NEW TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER

""Clark County and Las Vegas kept doubling down on a program that wouldn't work,"" Marbut said. ""They kept doubling down, they kept putting more money in. They kept, from my understanding, counting on the federal government money and some of their local money – there was somewhere between two and a half to four times more funding, depending on how you measure it, and it didn't make a dent. In fact, homelessness went up. And sometimes when you have a bad program and you fund it with more money, it actually makes things worse.""

The issue has been exacerbated in recent weeks, with a local neighborhood on edge after a previously removed homeless encampment located in an empty parking lot across the street reportedly returned within days. 

""Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas,"" a neighbor living at Casa Bonita Apartments said, according to KLAS. ""We are filled with trash, garbage and homeless people sleeping in the streets. We're so fabulous. Honestly, it wouldn't hurt the state to fix this problem.""

TRUMP VOWS TO MAKE DC 'SAFER' AND 'BEAUTIFUL' AS CAPITAL BATTLES CRIME AND HOMELESSNESS

The apartment complex's tenants are reportedly fed up with the encampment, pointing to instances of fires being lit, trash being left out and even confrontations between homeless individuals and residents. 

""There was a dumpster fire at 3 a.m,"" Briana Talbot, property manager for Casa Bonita Apartments, told the outlet. ""Someone was walking through the parking lot, lit something on fire in the trash and the whole dumpster caught on fire."" 

Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley and Talbot did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

In light of the crisis sweeping the nation, Trump issued an executive order titled ""Ending Crime and Disorder on America's Streets,"" in an effort to cut down on instances of violence involving homeless individuals.

""Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order,"" the order states. 

The order authorizes the federal government to work with local and state offices throughout the country to implement treatment for homeless individuals, while targeting specific issues – such as squatting and illegal drug use – within communities. 

Trump's administration is also looking to ensure federal funding does not enable ""safe consumption"" policies, which allow homeless individuals to consume illegal drugs while supervised.

The move is celebrated by Marbut, who believes it is a step in the right direction toward a federal policy on combating and treating homelessness. 

""What the president's order – and I applaud him for doing this – is saying, we're going to take a zero-tolerance approach to encampments,"" Marbut said.

""So what the executive order is trying to do is stop these encampments under bridges, rivers, out in the open, downtown, back alleys, and get people in the real world. Real programs that really work and not doing gimmicks.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","RFK Jr. Is Repeating Michelle Obama's Mistakes","https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/09/maha-lets-move-kennedy-michelle-obama/684067/","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

MAHA is “Let's Move!” 2.0.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In February 2010, Michelle Obama launched “Let's Move!” with a wide-ranging plan to curb childhood obesity. The campaign took aim at processed foods, flagged concerns about sugary drinks, and called for children to spend more time playing outside and less time staring at screens. The campaign was roundly skewered by conservatives. Fox News pundits such as Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity portrayed Let's Move as a nanny-state plot to control the American diet, a slippery slope to the criminalization of french fries.

Those ideas might sound familiar. Today, conservatives have embraced the same goals as Let's Move as part of the Trump administration's “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is essentially rerunning Obama's playbook—and, in one key way, has taken it a step further. “They did something we were hesitant to do, which is to identify the food industry as the root cause of the problem,” Jerold Mande, a health official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Obama administration, told me. But the strategy that Kennedy's HHS is using to address the problem so far—pressuring food companies to alter their products instead of introducing new regulations—is the same one that Obama relied on, and will likely fall short for the same reason hers did a decade ago.

The problem that Let's Move meant to solve—approximately one in three children was overweight or obese—was serious, but the vibe was cool-mom fun. In a video that launched the campaign, the first lady admitted that, along with lots of other busy parents, she sometimes defaulted to less-healthy options such as pizza when feeding her two daughters. Her mission was twofold: encourage Americans to think a little more about their diets while pushing the food industry to make the task somewhat less onerous. To that end, Obama leaned on the power of celebrity. She slow danced with Big Bird in a grocery store, ate an apple with LeBron James at the White House, and enlisted Beyoncé to lead a cafeteria full of kids in the Dougie.

Her approach to food companies was friendly, and they promised to do their part. In 2011, Walmart, the nation's largest grocer, committed to removing 10 percent of sugar and 25 percent of sodium from its store brands—and to working with other brands they carried to reach those levels—by 2015. Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, among other chains, pledged to reduce calories and sodium in its restaurants by 20 percent over the following decade. The first lady showed up at an Olive Garden to praise Darden, and the company put out a press release touting its “comprehensive health and wellness commitment.” The announcements seemed to signal that, thanks to Let's Move, major companies were taking seriously the role they play in public health rather than merely engineering their offerings to be ever more irresistible. Maybe a gentle nudge was all America needed to shift its food environment for the better.

But as the architects of Let's Move learned, handshake deals don't carry the same weight as regulatory oversight. Today, for example, Olive Garden's signature “Tour of Italy” dish has 3,200 milligrams of sodium—more than double what the American Heart Association considers an optimal daily amount for adults. When I got in touch with Darden Restaurants recently and asked about the 20 percent pledge, a spokesperson couldn't locate any details about whether progress had been made and said in an email that the officials who were involved with the pledge are no longer with the company. (Michelle Obama didn't respond to interview requests made via the Obama Foundation.)

Other commitments were at least partially met. A spokesperson for Walmart told me in an email that, according to its most recent analysis, done in 2017, the company had reduced sugar by more than 10 percent and sodium by 18 percent—though only in its store brands. A consortium of 16 food companies including ConAgra, Coca-Cola, and Unilever fulfilled a pledge to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the food they sell, according to a 2014 post from the Let's Move executive director.

Even these relative successes did not make much difference. For one, total-calorie sales can be a misleading metric; when ConAgra and its peers made their pledge, the industry's total-calorie sales were trending down anyway, likely due in part to the Great Recession and shrinkflation. The companies also treated all calories as if they were equal, whether they came from Pringles or peas. The consortium's pledge “provided the appearance of progress when there wasn't any,” Kelly Brownell, a director emeritus of the World Food Policy Center at Duke University, told me. As for Let's Move, he said it “didn't address the heart of what is driving the poor diet in America, which is food-industry actions.” Today, Americans consume roughly the same amount of sodium as they did in 2013. Debra Eschmeyer, the former executive director of Let's Move, maintains that the campaign made progress, such as successfully prompting McDonald's to include apple slices in every Happy Meal. But she also acknowledges that the marketplace tends to determine what's on shelves and menus. “What's going to change corporations the most is what consumers are buying,” she told me.

Eschmeyer said that she's been heartened by MAHA's momentum. In fact, Kennedy has arguably already had more success than Obama in shifting consumer demand. As my colleague Yasmin Tayag has written, corporations have been MAHA-washing their products to highlight those free of artificial dyes, high-fructose corn syrup, and seed oils. General Mills and Kraft Heinz have said they will remove synthetic dyes from all of their products, and Mars Wrigley announced it will offer some dye-free alternatives. The companies' press releases point to “evolving consumer needs” and continuing an “innovation journey” as motivation for the changes, but these moves were clearly a win for Kennedy, who considers the dyes “poisonous.”

If Let's Move was defined by the gentle nudges of a cool mom, the MAHA approach, on its surface, takes the stance of a stern dad. Kennedy has portrayed the food industry as callous and predatory, saying that companies “mass poison American children” and “could care less about the health of the American people.” He's condemned the “attack on whole milk and cheese and yogurt” and insisted that ultra-processed food is a “genocide on the American Indian.” Compared with Let's Move's easygoing recommendations—children should get at least one hour of physical activity each day, and everyone should drink one more glass of water—MAHA is also considerably more macho. The Obama administration replaced the Presidential Fitness Test with the less competitive Presidential Youth Fitness Program; today, the White House is bringing the fitness test back, and Kennedy and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently rolled out the “Pete and Bobby Challenge,” in which you try to do 100 push-ups and 50 pull-ups in less than 10 minutes. The 71-year-old Kennedy—who takes testosterone as part of what he calls an “anti-aging protocol” and has been known to peel off his shirt while working out in public—noted in an interview that he was able to reach that mark in fewer than six minutes.

This display exposes the campaign's braggadocio. Finishing the Pete and Bobby Challenge would be next to impossible for all but the most dedicated gym rats, whereas the health department's own physical-activity guidelines suggest that everyday tasks, such as carrying groceries upstairs and shoveling snow, can qualify as vigorous exercise, and they don't require a timer or a gym membership. Asking ordinary Americans to perform grueling feats of strength is unlikely to make a dent in the obesity rate, no matter how tough the talk.

Similarly, most of MAHA's flashiest food initiatives aren't supported by good science, and would do little to improve health. Kennedy and his allies have demonized seed oils and fluoride (despite a dearth of evidence of their harms), insisted that cane sugar is healthier than high-fructose corn syrup (a claim that nutrition experts generally reject), and promoted raw milk (which the FDA has long warned can contain disease-causing bacteria). The evidence connecting excess salt and sugar to poor health is much stronger than that regarding food dyes. Kennedy, Eschmeyer told me, would do well to “stay evidence-based and not to get distracted by an overly simplistic focus on individual ingredients.”

Read: The giant asterisk to MAHA's food-dye crackdown

Ezekiel Emanuel, who was a health-care adviser to Barack Obama, has been critical of Kennedy's anti-vaccine views and worries that the movement's fondness for supplements of dubious merit could be a distraction. Still, Emanuel believes MAHA's focus on chronic illness that's caused by obesity is “100 percent right” and that, so far, “we haven't approached the problem as if it were a major national threat.” Both Emanuel and Mande, the former USDA official, told me that they're withholding judgment until MAHA manages to secure more significant concessions from the food industry. Rhetoric, as they've learned from experience, doesn't necessarily translate into meaningful reform.

Despite that rhetoric, Kennedy, like Michelle Obama was, can be friendly with food companies that please him. He has treated handshake promises as genuine advances and firms that make gestures toward his preferences as real allies. After Steak 'n Shake switched to cooking with beef tallow, announcing on X that the company's fries would now be “RFK'd,” the secretary nibbled on fries with Hannity at one of its Florida locations. Perhaps Kennedy's fondness for fries will allay worries that they'll be banned this time around.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","He once earned 6 figures at Microsoft. Now he's unemployed, burning through savings, and at risk of losing his home.","https://www.businessinsider.com/former-microsoft-worker-job-hunt-money-struggles-2025-9","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 07:46:00 GMT","

Before he was fired last December, Mody Khan was earning a six-figure salary as a cloud solution architect at Microsoft. Nine months into his job search, he's at risk of losing his home.

""I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it,"" said Khan, who's in his 50s and based in Texas. ""I'm in a very tight spot.""

A new job could stabilize his finances — but despite a five-year run at Microsoft and his prior experience in the tech industry, even landing interviews has been challenging.

""It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman,"" he said.

Khan is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've lost their jobs over the past year. In recent years, Big Tech firms — including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon — have revamped their performance review and compensation systems to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams.

Then there are the layoffs. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also affected many individual contributor roles.

Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the ""Great Flattening.""

While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the beginning of this year, global tech companies have laid off more than 80,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have come amid a white-collar hiring slowdown.

""I've been constantly applying, and I've had interviews, but I've been turned down everywhere,"" Khan said.

Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

After immigrating to the US from Pakistan in 2007, Khan said he struggled to find high-paying work during the 2008 recession. But over time, his job prospects improved — and he held various tech roles before joining Microsoft in July 2019 as a contract support engineer.

He became a full-time employee in May 2020, working as a support escalation engineer. In December 2021, he was promoted to cloud solution architect — a fully remote role he held until his termination in December 2024.

Khan's final years at the company were very difficult. He said multiple managers raised concerns about his performance over the years and eventually warned him that his job was in jeopardy.

While he made efforts to improve, he said it didn't seem to make a difference — and that he believes his managers didn't give him the support he needed to succeed. He said he often lacked clear guidance on expectations and would have benefited from more constructive feedback and coaching. At times, he said, it felt like his managers were more focused on ""building a case"" against him than helping him improve.

At one point, he told his wife that if he ever won even a small lottery jackpot, he'd walk away. The pressure had become too much.

""I hated going from the bedroom to my home office,"" he said. ""I was under so much stress.""

Last December, Khan learned he was being fired for performance reasons and wouldn't be receiving severance pay. He was told he could still apply for other roles at Microsoft — and said he later applied to as many as 30 internal positions — but never received an offer.

Khan said he sold some of his Microsoft stock holdings but now has only about $10,000 in ""survival money"" left in his bank account — enough to last him and his wife about two more months. If that runs out, they'd be forced to tap into his remaining investments or 401(k).

To make matters worse, they fell behind on their mortgage payments — and if they can't resume payments once their forbearance plan ends in November, they could face foreclosure. The financial toll has also caused his credit score to drop from the high 600s into the 500s in just a few months.

Since expanding his search outside Microsoft, Khan said he's managed to land some interviews, but no matter how well they seem to go, none have led to offers.

""I've had so many good interviews where I'm ready for them to say, 'Mody, let's rock 'n' roll' — and then they don't move forward,"" he said.

He added that it's particularly frustrating when seemingly promising conversations with recruiters don't end in a clear rejection — but in silence, leaving him unsure whether he was ever truly considered.

""Recruiters contact me, take my résumé, and they ghost me,"" he said.

Khan believes a few factors may be hindering his job search. He's concerned that some employers assume, because of his age, that he's not up to date on the latest technologies. To push back on that perception, he said he completed an AI certification through the University of Texas. He added that many of his interviewers appeared to be looking for candidates with startup backgrounds, which made him feel like his experience at a tech giant like Microsoft was almost a strike against him.

Additionally, he said he believes his Pakistani background has, at times, been an obstacle. He believes some Indian recruiters or interviewers may carry biases that surface during the hiring process, particularly given long-standing regional and political tensions between India and Pakistan.

Khan said he continues to apply to roles every week, hoping that one will finally come through. But with the financial pressure mounting and his savings running low, he said the stakes are getting higher.

""It's a very, very dangerous situation,"" he said.

In this article

Nestle has abruptly dismissed its CEO Laurent Freixe for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a subordinate, the Swiss food giant said on Monday, a dramatic removal a year after he took the reins.

The maker of products ranging from KitKat to Nesquik said that it had appointed veteran insider Philipp Navratil, who had headed the Nespresso coffee unit, as Freixe's successor with immediate effect.

The shock departure threatens more volatility for Nestle amid a tough consumer environment and the global threat of trade tariffs. The firm announced in June that long-standing Chairman Paul Bulcke would stand down next year.

Nestle said Freixe's departure follows an investigation overseen by Bulcke and Lead Independent Director Pablo Isla into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached the company's code of business conduct.

""This was a necessary decision,"" said Bulcke in a statement. ""Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.""

""We are not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance.""

Company veteran Freixe took over the CEO role exactly one year ago after Nestle ousted his predecessor Mark Schneider.

The sudden exit is the latest management reshuffle at a global consumer goods and food company this year, including Nestle rival Unilever, Diageo and Hershey.

Kohl's fired CEO Ashley Buchanan in May after an investigation found he had pushed for deals with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, after little more than 100 days in the position.

Navratil began his career with Nestle in 2001 as an internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America, he was appointed country manager for Nestle Honduras in 2009.

He assumed leadership of the coffee and beverage business in Mexico in 2013, and transitioned to Nestle's Coffee strategic business unit in 2020.

He moved to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined the Nestle executive board on January 1 this year.

From citrus farms in the Central Valley to construction sites where homes and businesses are being rebuilt after devastating wildfires in Pacific Palisades, California relies heavily on immigrant workers and entrepreneurs.

As the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, industries key to the state's $4 trillion economy like agriculture, construction and hospitality could be among those hardest hit by the loss of California's immigrant workforce, according to new research. 

At stake are billions of dollars that fuel businesses large and small across the state, whose standalone economy is the fourth largest in the world after the United States, China and Germany.

Approximately one-fifth of the state's 10.6 million immigrants are undocumented, according to a June study from the nonpartisan Bay Area Economic Institute and the University of California, Merced.

If mass deportations were to be combined with the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants and stricter border policies, the joint study estimated that California would be at risk of losing as much as $278 billion from its gross domestic product.

Immigrant workers have been essential in bolstering the state's economy given declining birthrates and an aging population, said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Economic Institute.

""These are the workers that are keeping our economy afloat. They're keeping businesses open,"" Raisz told CNBC.

One of the places that is most evident is in the fields where food is grown and harvested, researchers and advocates say.

Agriculture, a $49 billion industry for the state, has the highest concentration of immigrant and undocumented immigrant workers in California, with 63% of them immigrants and 24% of farm workers undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.

""Without them, we wouldn't have any food available,"" said Joe Garcia, president of the California Farmworker Association and CEO of Jaguar Labor Contracting, which connects farmworkers to growers.

""The lettuce, the strawberries, all the wine we drink on a daily basis, fruit juices– everything that a farmworker picks, packs, pre-harvest– they do the jobs all year round that put food on your table,"" he said.

Garcia added that automation isn't an option for many of these positions, and American-born workers are not interested in taking on these jobs, which are often strenuous, low-paid and outdoors.

The Trump administration insists that the domestic labor market can withstand a shortage of immigrant labor, and says its focus is on creating jobs for U.S. citizens.

""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training,"" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in response to an inquiry from CNBC about the potential impact of mass deportations on California and its key industries.

""There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.""

In downtown Los Angeles, businesses have felt waves of impact in June and beyond due to high-profile ICE raids, accompanying protests and National Guard Deployment, owners and advocates said, exacerbating a public perception issue that downtown Los Angeles is not safe.

The Independent Hospitality Coalition, which represents some 900 local businesses and workers in the Los Angeles Area, said the raids struck fear into the immigrant workforce and created a challenging atmosphere for businesses that were already faced with several years of uphill battles.

""COVID, it was an international emergency that we were all dealing with. Here in California, especially here in Los Angeles, with the recent Palisades and Altadena fires… now it's immigration situation that we're dealing with. It's more like a localized COVID all over again,"" said Eddie Navarette, executive director of the hospitality commission.

Courtney Kaplan owns three Los Angeles restaurants, including Camelia in the downtown Arts District. She saw a 70 percent drop in sales in June alone, she told CNBC, due to closures and curfews, even though she is not in close proximity to where protests or the National Guard deployments took place.

Her staff continue to come to work, but the uncertainty around both immigration and trade policy, as she relies on imported wines and sake, weigh on her. Data from OpenTable show a drop in dining reservations for all of Los Angeles were down from June 7th through the 21st by 3% year on year. 

""The biggest challenge for us, aside from the lost revenue and the decrease in business, has been the uncertainty of every day. It's been so unpredictable. It's been chaotic,"" Kaplan told CNBC in July.

""We're still in the very early days of these changes to immigration policy, so it's hard to even predict what's coming. It just is a cause of concern that perhaps that down the line, the situation for us will change with our team members' comfort levels.""

Sectors like construction and farming are staring down worker shortages that predate any change to immigration policy. In California, more than sixty percent of construction workers are immigrants and a quarter of them are undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.

""There are profound skill shortages in these production industries, construction, manufacturing, because culturally, we have not created enough of these workers,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group.

""The way we've dealt with this over time has been immigration. Other cultures, cultures associated with other countries have different characteristics. Many more people there have been willing and wanting to be in the skilled trades, and we import that talent to improve our built environment.""

Contractors largely fall into two camps, he told CNBC. Some of them express confidence and support for Trump, believing the president's strategy will spur domestic manufacturing, investment and hiring. Others are pessimistic, as costs and uncertainty have risen.

Regardless of contractors' outlooks, said Basu, the nature of California's economy and its longstanding housing shortage mean that the state is constantly in need of construction workers.

""Even during tough economic times, it's in the midst of transformation,"" he said.

抱歉，發生錯誤

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts a 100x ETH rally over time as the second-largest cryptocurrency emerges as Wall Street's preferred token in the transition from TradFi to DeFi.

In an August 30 X post, the Ethereum co-founder, who is also the founder of OG blockchain software company Consensys, said that ETH will likely 100x from here and “probably much more,” with potential to flip Bitcoin's monetary base.

Lubin boldly opined that Wall Street will stake Ether because they currently pay for their infrastructure, and Ethereum will “replace much of the many siloed stacks they operate on.”

Lubin revealed that Ethereum will need to operate as a more or less traditional finance company that runs on decentralized rails.

This means staking, running validators, operating L2s/L3s, participating in DeFi, and writing smart contract software for agreements and financial instruments.

Lubin said he was also “100% aligned” with Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner Tom Lee, who said in August that Wall Street would stake and use Ethereum, and that ETH could flip Bitcoin in terms of network value.

In his post responding to Lee's bullish Ethereum projections, Lubin commented that he and Lee are friends who get on calls intermittently to discuss elements of Lee's broader Ethereum strategy.

Lubin doubled down on his 100x ETH rally stance in alignment with Lee, saying, “I keep telling Tom this: he is not nearly bullish enough.”

He explained why Ethereum is the best macro trade in the next decade, stating that nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow.

“Trust is a new kind of virtual commodity. And ETH, the highest octane decentralized trust commodity, will eventually flip all the other commodities on the planet,” Lubin added.

In an August 25 CNBC live appearance, Lubin's friend Tom Lee shared a similar sentiment, agreeing that ETH will secure the next layer of the internet.

According to Lee, Ethereum's smart contracts will provide that layer.

Aside from the long-term 100x ETH rally projection, Lee recently predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500, with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000.

Ethereum remains the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $160 billion in stablecoin supply.

This has put stablecoin supply on Ethereum at a new all-time high, with issuance more than doubling since January 2024, according to Token Terminal.

The increase in stablecoin supply typically implies demand for the underlying token (ETH), which the market can price in as it enters a new trading week.

Ether began the weekend by gaining 1.6% to approach the $4,500 level, but failed to break through resistance, instead returning to $4,400 during early trading on Monday morning.

Source: TradingView

Eneko Knorr, founder and CEO of Stabolut, shared with Cryptonews that, while Ethereum's momentum remains strong, the market may pause before the next move.

“I wouldn't be surprised to see it cool off a bit or trade sideways for a while to catch its breath. The real battleground for September is the $4,000 mark.“

According to Knorr, if ETH can break through and hold the $4,000 level, the path to its previous all-time high near $4,900 looks wide open.

If it gets rejected there, he's watching the $3,550–$3,600 area as the first line of defense.

On the technical front, the Ethereum 4H chart reveals a bullish structure forming after the price respected the trendline support and rebounded from the fair value gap zone around $4,300–$4,350.

Clear resistance remains around $4,700 and a critical level at the all-time high of $4,867, which is marked as the main upside target.

Source: TradingView/realtiger11

Currently, price is consolidating above the support box, and the upward projection indicates a strong probability of ETH making another attempt to reclaim the $4,700 region before extending toward the all-time high.

If momentum holds, clearing $4,867 could pave the way for new highs beyond $5,000.

However, a failure to sustain above the support zone could invalidate the bullish case and drag ETH back toward $4,100.

 Bitcoin bulls are trying to push the price back above $110,530, but bears continue to sell breakouts and the range highs. Will altcoins catch a bounce? 

Key points:

Bitcoin bulls will have to quickly push the price back above the 20-day EMA to prevent a collapse to $105,000. 

The shallow pullback in select altcoins suggests that the investors are not hurrying to sell them as they anticipate the up move to continue. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to rise above $110,000, but the bears are defending the level. Crypto market sentiment platform Santiment said in a report that “buy the dip” mentions have increased on social media, signaling further downside. Santiment said that a true bottom would form when there is “widespread fear and a lack of interest in buying.”

Another negative for the bulls is that September has largely been negative for BTC. According to CoinGlass data, BTC has closed September in the red on eight occasions since 2013, with an average slide of 3.80%.

Despite the seasonal weakness and the pullback in BTC and major altcoins, institutional investors continued their purchases. Digital asset investment products witnessed $2.48 billion in inflows last week, reversing $1.4 billion in outflows in the prior week, according to CoinShares data.

Could BTC climb back above $110,530, pulling ETH and altcoins higher? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. 

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) remains in an uptrend, but the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) suggests the bullish momentum is weakening.

The bears will try to pull the price below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA (6,418). If they can pull it off, the index could plummet to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) (6,316) and then to the breakout level of 6,147.

Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and 6,147 because a break below it signals a short-term top. The correction could then deepen to 5,950.

Buyers pushed the US Dollar Index (DXY) above the moving averages on Aug. 25 but could not sustain the higher levels.

The index turned down and closed below the moving averages on Thursday, signaling that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. There is minor support at 97.55, but if the level cracks, the next stop could be 97.10 and then 96.37.

The bulls will have to swiftly kick the price above the 99 level to prevent the downside. If they manage to do that, the index could reach the 100.50 level. Sellers will try to defend the 100.50 level, but if the bulls prevail, the rally could reach the 102 resistance.

BTC plunged below the $110,530 support on Friday, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge.

The bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to make a comeback. They will attempt to push the price back above the 20-day EMA ($112,566) but are expected to face significant resistance from the bears.

If the BTC/USDT pair turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it signals a negative sentiment. That increases the possibility of a drop to $105,000 and then to $100,000.

Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests that selling dries up at lower levels. The Bitcoin price may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($115,918).

ETH (ETH) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the 20-day EMA ($4,378).

The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair could slump to $4,094. This is a critical level for the bulls to defend because a break below it opens the doors for a fall to $3,745 and then to $3,350.

On the upside, buyers will have to thrust the Ether price above the $4,957 resistance to signal the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then skyrocket toward $5,500.

XRP (XRP) continued its slide to reach the crucial support of $2.73, where the buyers are expected to step in.

Any recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($2.94). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair risks falling below the $2.73 support. The XRP price will then complete a bearish descending triangle pattern, clearing the path for a collapse to $2.33.

Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them. They will have to push and maintain the XRP price above the downtrend line to signal a comeback. The pair may then climb to $3.40.

Buyers are trying to maintain BNB (BNB) above the 20-day EMA ($847), but the bears are unlikely to give up easily.

The negative divergence on the RSI suggests the 20-day EMA is at risk of breaking down. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could plummet toward the 50-day SMA ($804).

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $881, it signals that the bulls remain in control. That enhances the prospects of a break above $900. The BNB price may then start the next leg of the uptrend toward the psychological level of $1,000.

Solana (SOL) turned down and broke below the breakout level of $210 on Friday, indicating that the bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls.

The SOL/USDT pair is likely to find support in the zone between the 20-day EMA (195) and the uptrend line. If the price rebounds off the uptrend line with force, the bulls will try to drive the pair above $218. If they manage to do that, Solana's price could surge to $240 and later to $260.

Contrarily, a break and close below the uptrend line invalidates the bullish ascending triangle pattern. That could intensify selling, pulling the pair to $175 and then to $155.

Related: Will XRP price drop toward $2 or reverse course?

Dogecoin (DOGE) has again dropped to the $0.21 support, indicating that the bears are selling on minor rallies.

The 20-day EMA ($0.22) has started to turn down gradually, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating that the bears have a slight edge. That increases the risk of a break below $0.21. The DOGE/USDT pair may then slump to $0.19.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up sharply from $0.21 and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.22). That suggests the Dogecoin price may swing between $0.21 and $0.26 for a few more days.

Buyers attempted to stall Cardano's (ADA) pullback at the 50-day SMA ($0.82), but the bears maintained their selling pressure.

The ADA/USDT pair closed below the 50-day SMA on Sunday, starting the move toward the support line of the descending channel pattern. Buyers will try to defend the support line, but the relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.84). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.68 increases.

Buyers will have to propel Cardano's price above the downtrend line to signal a comeback. The pair could then rally to $1.02.

Chainlink (LINK) slipped below the 20-day EMA ($23.45) on Saturday, and the bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price back above the level on Sunday.

Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the Chainlink price to $21.36 and then to the 50-day SMA ($20.69). Buyers are expected to defend the 50-day SMA because a break below it may sink the LINK/USDT pair to the uptrend line. The greater the pullback, the longer it is likely to take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.

The first sign of strength will be a close above the 20-day EMA. That suggests solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will have to clear the $27 overhead resistance to resume the uptrend.

- Japan Post Bank will launch DCJPY, a yen-backed digital currency on a permissioned blockchain, in FY 2026, leveraging its ¥190 trillion deposit base.

- The initiative aims to modernize financial infrastructure by enabling instant asset settlements, NFT transactions, and public subsidy distributions while complying with Japan's strict FSA regulations.

- Major institutions like MUFG and SMBC are testing DCJPY for cross-border payments, contrasting with JPYC's public blockchain model, which allows partial JGB collateral but faces interoperability challenges.

- Retail users will access DCJPY via a mobile app, democratizing digital asset participation for 120 million account holders and unlocking ¥190 trillion in liquidity for tokenized investments.

- Japan's regulated approach prioritizes stability over speed, differentiating from U.S. stablecoins, and positions DCJPY as a blueprint for balancing innovation with financial system integrity.

Japan Post Bank's upcoming launch of DCJPY, a yen-backed digital currency, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of blockchain-driven financial infrastructure. Scheduled for fiscal year 2026, DCJPY will function as a tokenized deposit, pegged 1:1 to the yen and fully backed by the bank's ¥190 trillion ($1.3 trillion) deposit base [1]. This initiative, built on a permissioned blockchain developed by DeCurret DCP, is not merely a technological experiment but a strategic reimagining of Japan's financial ecosystem. By leveraging its 120 million account holders and institutional partnerships, Japan Post Bank aims to unlock liquidity in digital assets while addressing systemic inefficiencies in asset settlement and public financial services [2].  

DCJPY's institutional adoption is underpinned by its alignment with Japan's stringent regulatory framework. Unlike private stablecoins such as JPYC, which operate on public blockchains and face scrutiny over collateral transparency, DCJPY's permissioned structure ensures compliance with the Financial Services Agency's (FSA) requirements for deposit insurance and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols [3]. This regulatory clarity has attracted major financial institutions, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), which are already testing the platform for cross-border settlements and corporate treasury management [4].  

The currency's utility extends beyond traditional banking. For instance, DCJPY will enable instant settlement of tokenized securities and NFTs, reducing operational costs for asset managers and enhancing market efficiency [5]. Local governments are also exploring its use for distributing subsidies and disaster relief payments, a move that could digitize public administration and create a new utility for the token [6]. These applications position DCJPY as a bridge between legacy financial systems and blockchain innovation, offering institutions a low-risk entry point into digital asset markets.  

Japan Post Bank's retail strategy hinges on its vast customer base and user-friendly infrastructure. By allowing account holders to convert savings into DCJPY via a mobile app, the bank is democratizing access to digital assets such as securities and NFTs [7]. This approach addresses a critical barrier to adoption: the complexity of blockchain technology for non-technical users. With 120 million accounts already in place, the bank can rapidly scale DCJPY's usage, potentially unlocking ¥190 trillion in liquidity for the digital asset market [8].  

The implications for retail liquidity are profound. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, DCJPY's 1:1 peg to the yen and deposit-backed structure provide stability, making it an attractive option for everyday transactions and investments. For example, small businesses could use DCJPY for instant cross-border payments, while individuals might tokenize real estate holdings for fractional ownership [9]. This dual focus on security and accessibility could catalyze Japan's transition to a tokenized economy, where digital assets coexist with traditional financial instruments.  

While DCJPY's regulated framework minimizes counterparty risk, its permissioned blockchain design limits interoperability with public networks, a challenge that JPYC—a public blockchain-based stablecoin—does not face [10]. JPYC, Japan's first licensed stablecoin, allows up to 50% of its reserves to be held in Japanese government bonds (JGBs) starting in 2025, offering institutional investors flexibility in yield strategies [11]. However, DCJPY's deposit-backed model provides greater transparency and stability, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where liquidity management is critical [12].  

The FSA's cautious approach to digital assets further differentiates Japan from the U.S., where stablecoins like USDT and USDC gained traction before regulatory frameworks were established [13]. By requiring 100% reserve backing for JPYC and subjecting DCJPY to rigorous compliance checks, Japan is prioritizing financial stability over rapid innovation. This strategy may slow adoption but ensures that digital currencies remain a trusted component of the financial system.  

Japan Post Bank's DCJPY initiative exemplifies how regulated digital currencies can modernize financial infrastructure while balancing innovation with stability. For institutions, it offers a secure, scalable platform for asset settlement and cross-border transactions. For retail users, it provides a low-risk gateway to digital assets, fostering broader participation in the tokenized economy. As Japan navigates the complexities of blockchain integration, DCJPY's success could serve as a blueprint for other nations seeking to harness digital finance without compromising regulatory integrity.

 According to some Republican lawmakers, the first crypto-related priority in the Senate will be to pass legislation for market structure. 

After a monthlong break, the US Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to return to conducting government business, which includes key policies affecting the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.

Both chambers of the 119th session of the US Congress went on recess weeks ago as part of their schedule established in January. The move effectively paused any work toward passage of a bill to establish digital asset market structure, consider the nomination of Brian Quintenz to become chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and legislation containing a provision for restricting a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

One of the first legislative items on Republicans' agenda upon their return will be to pass a bill establishing crypto market structure out of a committee and for a floor vote.

In July, Republicans in the House passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act with the support of 78 Democrats, moving the bill to the Senate for additional amendments and debate. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the most outspoken voices in Congress advovating for less restrictive and clearer crypto regulations, has been one of the lead Republicans calling for market structure.

During an August blockchain conference, Lummis speculated that the Senate Banking Committee would pass its version of market structure building on the CLARITY Act by the end of September, followed by consideration in the Senate Agriculture Committee in October. The Wyoming senator predicted the bill would end up on US President Donald Trump's desk “before the end of the year.”

At time of publication, neither the Senate Agriculture Committee nor Senate Banking Committee had announced hearings to consider the bill. 

Starting on Wednesday, Caroline Pham, a Republican, will be the sole remaining commissioner, and acting chair of the CFTC following the departure of Kristin Johnson, a Democratic member. Johnson announced in May that she planned to resign before 2026, and Pham said she would move “to the private sector” if the Senate were to confirm Quintenz.

Even with Johnson's impending departure and the CFTC running without many in leadership positions, Quintenz's confirmation did not appear to be a guarantee at time of publication. Before the Senate went on recess, the agriculture committee delayed a vote on the prospective chair's nomination at the request of the White House.

Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both Trump supporters and donors, reportedly pressured the president to reconsider Quintenz's nomination. Though both brothers initially supported the nomination after Trump announced it in February, they later claimed he would not fully enact the president's crypto agenda.

As of Monday, the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to consider five of Trump's nominations on Wednesday, but the Senate Agriculture Committee had not set up a time for Quintenz.

The House managed to pass the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act in July with the slimmest of Democratic support. However, it appears that Republicans are looking for alternatives to the bill, which was sent to the Senate for consideration.

In August, the House Rules Committee shared a revision to HR 3838, a bill implementing the National Defense Authorization Act. The revised legislation included a provision to ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar — one of the tenets of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.

It's unclear which bill, if any, will have enough support to pass through Congress  without amendments or modifications.

Share this article

Binance has established a new entity in Mexico, Medá, which will operate independently as an Electronic Payment Funds Institution (IFPE) and focus on advancing financial technology services across Latin America.

Medá, authorized and supervised by Mexican financial authorities, will facilitate deposits and withdrawals in Mexican pesos within the Binance ecosystem, which currently serves over 285 million users around the world.

Medá is part of Binance's push to make Mexico a financial technology hub for Latin America. The company is committed to investing over one billion Mexican pesos ($53 million) in the project over the next four years.

Guilherme Nazar, Binance's Regional Vice President for Latin America, said in a statement that with Medá, the team seeks to expand competition in Mexico's financial technology market and provide users with a more efficient and cost-effective solution.

“Recognizing that increased competition benefits consumers, Medá will provide the Mexican population with access to higher-quality financial technology services at more affordable costs,” Nazar stated.

With Medá, Binance has achieved an important regulatory milestone, expanding its licensed operations to Mexico. The company has already established a strong regulatory presence in multiple countries, including France, Italy, Spain, Dubai, Japan, Brazil, and Argentina.

“With a population exceeding 125 million, Mexico is a key market for expanding access to financial inclusion,” Nazar added. “We believe in the importance of fostering safe and sustainable ecosystems that create broader opportunities for all Mexicans in terms of social and economic development.”

Binance's educational initiative, Binance Academy, educated more than 44 million students worldwide in 2024 through courses, workshops, and partnerships with institutions including the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Monterrey Institute of Technology, and Panamerican University.

 Bitcoin's MVRV metric signals weaker momentum as BTC price shows signs of exhaustion and a potential cycle top, yet not all indicators are bearish. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's MVRV death cross signals bearish momentum, historically preceding big price corrections.

However, the MVRV Z-Score remains well below historical peak levels.

Bitcoin (BTC) could be set for an extended correction in the coming weeks as an overvaluation metric sends a bearish signal. The cryptocurrency market might be experiencing a “macro reversal,” according to crypto analysts.

Bitcoin's Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, an indicator that measures whether the asset is overvalued, recently printed a “death cross,” indicating waning momentum, according to CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei_dent. 

The “MVRV momentum is showing signs of exhaustion with a clear dead cross between the 30DMA and the 365DMA,” the analyst said in a QuickTake analysis on Sunday. 

The last time the indicator produced this bearish crossover was at the 2021 cycle top, preceding a 77% drop to $15,500 from $69,000 during the 2022 bear market.

Despite a 13% BTC price rise to $124,500 all-time highs from $109,000 between January and August, the MVRV declined, “indicating weakening capital inflow,” Yonsei_dent said, adding:

The MVRV death cross “signals a macro momentum reversal from positive to negative, analyst Ali Martinez said in a Friday post on X.

If history repeats itself, Bitcoin price could embark on a prolonged downtrend, with analysts projecting short-term targets around $105,000 and even as low as $60,000 if the bear market takes hold.

Despite this possible bearish scenario, several other onchain indicators suggest that Bitcoin's $124,500 all-time high is unlikely to be the top. For example, all 30 CoinGlass' bull market peak signals still show no signs of overheating.

Similarly, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-Score remains far below levels historically associated with market tops. That divergence suggests the current rally may still recover from current levels to new all-time highs.

Historically, when market value vastly exceeds realized value, the score enters the red zone (see chart below), signaling overvaluation and often preceding major tops.

“When it's high (red zone), people are sitting on massive profits and usually sell. When it's low (green zone), people are underwater and smart money buys,” said popular analyst Stockmoney Lizards in a Tuesday post on X. 

Historical patterns suggest that every macro top coincided with an MVRV Z-score between 7 and 9. In 2017, it surged above 9 before the crash and in 2021, it rose above 7 before reversing. 

In 2025, the metric is “sitting at around 2,” the analyst said, adding:

This indicates that, from an onchain perspective, Bitcoin is not yet overheated and may continue climbing before topping, potentially around the bullish megaphone's $260,000 price target.

And it's not the first batch they've discovered in the area.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Most of us have skeletons in our closets, but they can also lurk in much less familiar places. Literally.

Hundreds of skeletons were recently unearthed at the site of an abandoned Debenhams department store in the UK. The remains of 317 individuals from medieval and post-medieval burial grounds were discovered by archaeologists from Cotswold Archaeology in Kings Square, Gloucester, as the site was being redeveloped into the University of Gloucester's City Campus. The university actually commissioned Cotswold Archaeology to excavate at the site because artifacts have continued to crop up in the area.

“Every time we work in Gloucester, we make new discoveries,” Cliff Bateman, Cotswold Archaeology Senior Project Officer, said in a press release. “It's a massively important place.”

Among the skeletons were artifacts such as a tobacco pipe and fragments of a wine bottle. Many earlier artifacts from the Roman period also surfaced, which makes sense, considering that what is now King's Square is thought to have once been the northeast quadrant of an ancient Roman town. Since the project began in 2023, archaeologists have found many vestiges of the Roman period, including pottery, 83 brick burial vaults (which were cleared in the mid-1950s), the foundations of a wall from a townhouse, and what appears to be a road dating back to the 2nd Century A.D.

Other recent finds include brick burial vaults and a crypt from St. Aldate's Church—the external wall and porch of which appeared when remodeling efforts started. It was built in 1750 to replace a church of the same name, whose origins traced back to before the Norman Conquest in 1066 (it was meant to honor a fallen bishop of Gloucester, who died in battle in 577). That church ended up so damaged from the English Civil War that it was finally torn down in the mid-1700s. The later St. Aldate's stood until 1960, but has long since been demolished. Evidence of its medieval predecessor has not yet appeared, but is thought to be in the area. 

Burials associated with the vanished medieval church were also found when the site was first being remodeled. The bones of twelve individuals were only exhumed for research before being reinterred in their original graves.  

Bateman also said that he is just about positive “there will be Roman buildings in situ” beneath the post-medieval necropolis. This isn't surprising to archaeologists, who first started finding mosaics and ruins of Roman buildings in the basement of the empty Debenham's.

Preliminary studies on the teeth of skeletons have found that the people they came from likely consumed a diet high in sugar. While there is little else known about the remains—except that about half of them were not in burial vaults like some of the other skeletons found nearby—Gloucester is apparently one of those places where pieces of the ancient past are literally inches beneath your feet. Excavations in another part of the city previously revealed even more skeletons, this time from the Late Roman period, which were buried both on their backs and facedown. Some of them were even decapitated, then laid to rest with their heads between their feet. 

While human remains will not be on display at the university, the Roman, medieval, and post-medieval artifacts found at the site will eventually have their own shrine.

“These objects have been retained on site, following archaeological recording, and will be displayed on site for students, staff and visitors to City Campus to appreciate once the site is fully operational,” Steve Sheldon, Acting Principal Manager of Cotswold Archaeology, said in a more recent press release.

The campus in progress will be opening in September. There could be no more epic way to kick off an ancient history class.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Dark matter could be turning giant planets into black holes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831112452.htm","Mon, 01 Sep 2025 08:50:39 GMT","

More than 5,000 planets have been discovered beyond our solar system, allowing scientists to explore planetary evolution and consider the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Now, a UC Riverside study published in Physical Review D suggests that these ""exoplanets"" could also serve as tools to investigate dark matter.

The researchers examined how dark matter, which makes up 85% of the universe's matter, might affect Jupiter-sized exoplanets over long periods of time. Their theoretical calculations suggest dark matter particles could gradually collect in the cores of these planets. Although dark matter has never been detected in laboratories, physicists are confident it exists.

""If the dark matter particles are heavy enough and don't annihilate, they may eventually collapse into a tiny black hole,"" said paper first author Mehrdad Phoroutan-Mehr, a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy who works with Hai-Bo Yu, a professor of physics and astronomy. ""This black hole could then grow and consume the entire planet, turning it into a black hole with the same mass as the original planet. This outcome is only possible under the superheavy non-annihilating dark matter model.""

According to the superheavy non-annihilating dark matter model, dark matter particles are extremely massive and do not destroy each other when they interact. The researchers focused on this model to show how superheavy dark matter particles are captured by exoplanets, lose energy, and drift toward their cores. There, they accumulate and collapse into black holes.

""In gaseous exoplanets of various sizes, temperatures, and densities, black holes could form on observable timescales, potentially even generating multiple black holes in a single exoplanet's lifetime,"" Phoroutan-Mehr said. ""These results show how exoplanet surveys could be used to hunt for superheavy dark matter particles, especially in regions hypothesized to be rich in dark matter like our Milky Way's galactic center.""

Phoroutan-Mehr was joined in the study by Tara Fetherolf, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.

Phoroutan-Mehr explained that, so far, astronomers have only detected black holes with masses greater than our sun. He said most existing theories suggest that black holes must be at least that massive.

""Discovering a black hole with the mass of a planet would be a major breakthrough,"" he added. ""It would support the thesis of our paper and offer an alternative to the commonly accepted theory that planet-sized black holes could only form in the early universe.""

According to Phoroutan-Mehr, exoplanets have not been used much in dark matter research largely because scientists did not have enough data about them.

""But in recent years, our knowledge of exoplanets has expanded dramatically, and several upcoming space missions will provide even more detailed observations,"" he said. ""With this growing body of data, exoplanets can be used to test and challenge different dark matter models.""

Phoroutan-Mehr said in the past scientists investigated dark matter by observing objects like the sun, neutron stars, and white dwarfs, since different models of dark matter can affect these objects in different ways. For example, some models suggest that dark matter can heat up neutron stars.

""So, if we were to observe an old and cold neutron star, it could rule out certain properties of dark matter, since dark matter is theoretically expected to heat them up,"" he said.

He added that many exoplanets (and Jupiter in our solar system) not having collapsed into black holes can help scientists rule out or refine dark matter models such as the superheavy non-annihilating dark matter model.

""If astronomers were to discover a population of planet-sized black holes, it could offer strong evidence in favor of the superheavy non-annihilating dark matter model,"" Phoroutan-Mehr said. ""As we continue to collect more data and examine individual planets in more detail, exoplanets may offer crucial insights into the nature of dark matter.""

Phoroutan-Mehr noted that another possible effect of dark matter on exoplanets -- and possibly on planets in our solar system -- is that it could heat them or cause them to emit high-energy radiation.

""Today's instruments aren't sensitive enough to detect these signals,"" he said. ""Future telescopes and space missions may be able to pick them up.""

The title of the paper is ""Probing Superheavy Dark Matter With Exoplanets.""

Precision in site-selective functionalization of molecules bearing multiple potentially reactive positions is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. Although migratory difunctionalization offers a powerful strategy for programmed functional group installation along carbon chains, its implementation with multisubstituted alkenes has been impeded by the increased complexity of site-selectivity. Here we report a head–tail carboboration of multisubstituted alkenes with exceptional site-selectivity, enabled by ligand steric exclusion in a nickel-catalysed chain-walking system. This catalytic system enables selective migratory transformations of tertiary alkyl–metal intermediates across a range of thermodynamically and kinetically accessible reaction site combinations. The importance of this study is evident in not only its capacity to efficiently couple structurally diverse carbon electrophiles with complex substrates, including natural terpenes, but also its contribution to streamlining the synthesis of natural products and materials.

Lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery and gene editing have the potential to transform the current therapeutic landscape. Nonetheless, a major bottleneck using this technology is the difficulty in achieving cell- and tissue-specific delivery and avoiding liver accumulation. Here we report the rational design of peptide ionizable lipids to assemble lipid nanoparticles with organ-selective mRNA delivery. Structure–activity and structure–selectivity relationship analyses enable us to obtain a general and predictable strategy for peptide ionizable lipid design. By incorporating artificial ionizable and natural amino acids and/or functional molecules into peptide ionizable lipids, we create lipid nanoparticles with tissue-specific targeting, including the lungs, liver, spleen, thymus and bone. In particular, lipid nanoparticles containing peptide lipids targeting the liver show comparable efficacy and safety compared with FDA-approved formulations. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticles with peptide lipids achieve the efficient co-delivery of PEmax mRNA and engineered prime editing guide RNA for prime editing of the liver and lungs. Overall, our platform offers a predictable methodology for the rational design of tissue-targeting lipid nanoparticles that might aid the development of improved mRNA-based gene editing therapeutics.

“Since 2012, I've worked with the Tonkawa Foundation, in Nuevo Casas Grandes, Mexico, on the recovery of the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi), a grey-wolf subspecies that had been hunted to near-extinction by the 1980s.

Reintroducing wolves to the Chihuahua region will restore ecological balance and help to regulate other wildlife populations. The Mexican wolf's return not only helps to conserve biodiversity but also represents an act of reconciliation with a species that humans persecuted for decades.

One of the main challenges has been obtaining accurate data in areas with complex terrain to understand how the wolves are adapting. Using camera traps, radio collars, direct observations and track and scat analyses, I collect information about their movements and behaviours.

We estimate that 25–30 Mexican wolves now live in the region. It's early days but their presence is already affecting the distribution of other predators such as pumas, hinting at an ecological rebalance.

Public perception remains another challenge. Wolves are not always welcome, especially in areas with livestock farms, so we work closely with landowners to monitor the wolves without generating conflict.

Plan aims to streamline approval by bringing regulators in at the beginning, potentially shaving years off the lab-to-market timeline.

China has just drawn its battle lines in a new frontier of computing. In August, the government published a sweeping policy document (“Implementation Plan for Promoting Innovation and Development of the brain-computer interface (BCI) Industry”) laying out its ambition to build an internationally competitive BCI industry within five years.

The blueprint — which illustrates that Beijing hopes to do more than play catch-up with U.S. outfits like Neuralink and Synchron — is unusually aggressive by global standards. Jointly authored by seven ministries, it integrates industrial planning, medical regulation, and research oversight into a single, coordinated playbook. The goal is to push BCIs beyond the lab and into clinical use by 2027, with full-fledged domestic champions in place by 2030.

This coordination will be an integral component of the success of China's plans. In the U.S., companies face a gauntlet of FDA trials and compliance requirements. In contrast, China's model writes the regulators in from day one, streamlining approval and potentially shaving years off the lab-to-market timeline.

“We know that China is strong at translating basic research into practical uses and commercialization. We've seen that in other industries, such as photovoltaics and electric cars. Now BCI is another area where that's going to be critical,” said Max Riesenhuber, a professor of neuroscience and codirector of the Center for Neuroengineering at Georgetown University Medical Center, speaking to reporters from WIRED.

The roadmap is unusually detailed, laying out 17 specific measures that range from core R&D to commercialization. Priorities include developing ultralow-power implantable chips, refining electrode materials to minimize scarring, creating algorithms for real-time decoding of thought into commands, and scaling up manufacturing lines for non-invasive wearables.

State media describe plans for “significant progress in the development of BCI chips” and high-performance communications silicon designed to filter and transmit neural signals in real time. These chips are intended to reduce reliance on foreign semiconductors while giving domestic firms control over the most sensitive layer of the BCI stack.

Meanwhile, Xinhua has recently reported that Chinese teams have developed independently designed cortical electrodes with 128 simultaneous channels, designed to remain stable when implanted, which ultimately minimizes scarring and extends the useful life of implants.

While consumer applications grab headlines, the blueprint estimates that one to two million Chinese patients could benefit from BCIs as assistive technology. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that there's serious momentum behind China's plans: Patients implanted with these cortical arrays have navigated smartphone apps and played chess with neural inputs.

Naturally, China's BCI blueprint also looks beyond medical applications toward the consumer markets. The policy explicitly backs non-invasive wearables that could monitor driver alertness or detect workplace hazards in energy and mining.

Combined with early demonstrations of patients playing video games through thought control, Beijing is positioning BCI as both a medical revolution and a consumer electronics platform. “I think noninvasive BCI products will get a huge market boost in China, because China is the biggest consumer electronics manufacturing country,” said Phoenix Peng, co-founder of BCI leader NeuroXess, speaking to WIRED.

The U.S. might still lead in high-profile BCI start-ups, but China now has a coordinated national plan, backed by its industrial machine and strong semiconductor ambitions. Silicon Valley, take note.

Penicillin V was as effective as amoxicillin for treating pneumonia in primary care, with similar rates of hospitalisation for lower respiratory tract infection or all-cause mortality within 28 days of starting antibiotic therapy, making it a viable alternative in primary care settings with similar resistance patterns.

""Considering the goal of combating antimicrobial resistance, countries with resistance patterns similar to those in Sweden may consider adding narrow-spectrum PcV [penicillin V] as a treatment option for pneumonia in primary care,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Olof Cronberg, Växjöhälsan Primary Healthcare Centre, Växjö, Sweden. It was published online on August 23, 2025, in Clinical Microbiology and Infection.

This study lacked data on symptom duration and other clinical indicators, as well as chest radiography and microbiological findings. Information on socioeconomic status was also unavailable, and residual confounding could not be ruled out.

This study was supported by the Region Kronoberg, Sweden; the Swedish Society of Medicine; the Southern Regional Health Care Committee; and Futurum, Region Jönköping County, Sweden. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a focal dilation of the abdominal aorta with a diameter of 3 cm or greater. European screening studies report current prevalence of 1.3% to 3.3% in men over 65 years of age, and consistently lower rates in women (approximately 0.5%-1.7%). Key risk factors include male sex, advanced age (especially over 65), smoking (the most important modifiable factor), family history of AAA, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

The natural course of AAA involves progressive growth and an increasing risk for rupture, which rises with aneurysm diameter. Elective repair, whether endovascular or open surgery, drastically reduces AAA-related mortality compared with treatment after rupture. Accordingly, population screening and elective repair remain central strategies to reduce mortality.

Pharmacologic options to slow AAA growth have been limited. Metformin and statins have been suggested, and a recent study revisited their potential benefits.

A 5-year prospective follow-up analyzed longitudinal cohort data from two large population-based Danish randomized clinical trials under standardized surveillance: the Viborg Vascular Screening and Danish Cardiovascular Screening trials. The cohort included 998 men with AAA detected by screening, with diameters ranging from 30 mm to 55 mm. Median age at baseline was approximately 70 years. Among participants, 11% were non-users of statins, 24% used low-intensity therapy, 48% used moderate-intensity therapy, and 17% used high-intensity therapy.

The primary outcome was AAA growth rate. Secondary outcomes included the need for AAA repair and a composite of repair, rupture, and all-cause mortality. Findings showed a strong association between high-dose statin use and slower AAA growth. Daily doses equivalent to 80 mg of atorvastatin or 40 mg of rosuvastatin were linked to a reduction of 0.88 mm per year in growth rate — roughly half the overall growth rate. Statin use was also independently associated with a reduced risk for AAA repair, starting after 2.5 years of therapy and resulting in a lower 5-year risk of needing repair (hazard ratio, 0.82).

Notably, additional analyses suggested that metformin, previously identified as a potential treatment for AAA, also showed favorable effects on growth rate and clinical events.

These results suggest that high-dose statins may directly protect against AAA progression, in addition to their established cardiovascular benefits, because AAA is a manifestation of atherosclerosis. High-dose statin therapy should be considered for patients with small AAAs, particularly those without contraindications. To confirm these findings and inform clinical guideline recommendations, high-quality observational studies in other populations are warranted, as randomized trials face ethical limitations, particularly regarding placebo use.

For me, this is a particularly interesting development. How do you see it affecting clinical practice?

As European countries grapple with how best to serve the health needs of transgender and gender-diverse people, fresh momentum is on the horizon. In the coming months, the World Health Organization (WHO) is set to release a new guideline on the health of trans and gender-diverse adults — potentially setting a new benchmark for care, policy, and legal recognition worldwide.

Against this backdrop, Europe's progress on gender-affirming care remains uneven. While some countries have pioneered reforms that recognize self-determined gender identity by adults and reduce psychiatric gatekeeping, others continue to require psychiatric diagnoses and retain significant barriers to care.

The forthcoming WHO guideline — expected to address access to gender-affirming care, health worker training, the provision of healthcare to those who have suffered interpersonal violence, the institution of supportive policies, and the establishment of legal recognition for self-determined gender identity — could be instrumental in shaping more inclusive health systems and setting minimum standards for countries across the region.

The WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has provided a foundation for disease classification and statistical tracking for over a century. The system underpins decisions that help policymakers align health strategies and support data-driven improvements within and across countries.

Recent progress for transgender health came with ICD-11, adopted in 2019 and implemented from January 2022. This edition eliminated the diagnosis of “transsexualism” as a mental disorder, instead introducing “gender incongruence” in a chapter on sexual health, a move intended to support depathologizing trans-specific healthcare and reduce stigma. 

For Cianán Russell, PhD, senior policy officer at International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association-Europe, an organization working for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people's safety, equality, and freedom across Europe and Central Asia, the removal of transsexualism from the mental health disorders chapter was pivotal. It marked an important shift away from the gatekeeping role long played by mental health professionals towards a more supportive role through a primary care health pathway.

“The use of the word transsexualism as a diagnosis implies being trans is a mental illness. There's historic stigma associated with this terminology,” Russell explained to Medscape Medical News. They added, “The psychiatrist owning trans health was part of the problem — they [transgender people] don't need their point of access to be psychiatric care. The change creates opportunity for a general practitioner to be the point of contact for diagnosis and access to first-line care — whether that's for a referral to a psychologist if needed or supporting access to hormone therapy.”

Implementation of these new definitions, however, rests with individual Member States. Deekshitha Ganesan, LLM, policy and advocacy manager at Trans Europe and Central Asia, noted that the organization's research shows 12 countries in the European Union still use a formal diagnosis of transsexualism and that, currently, Malta, Denmark, and parts of Spain are the only countries in the region that don't require a psychiatric diagnosis to access healthcare.

“The problem with still using a psychiatric diagnosis is that it sees trans identities as a disorder and opens up the door to all types of indignities in terms of accessing healthcare,” Ganesan told Medscape Medical News. “It allows gender identity to be seen as a mental health issue when it's not necessarily one, and it also ties up a lot of resources on mental health, which we know is already difficult to access.”

She added, “Our biggest ask is the implementation of ICD-11 at the national level and to also prioritize an informed consent model and make sure the wishes and needs of an individual are prioritized and met. This requires adopting a more holistic model of care: Recognizing that trans people accessing healthcare around their identity has an impact on almost every aspect of their lives because of the minority stress and very concrete realities they face, such as what does it means to access reproductive care.” Still, she said, “This is not to say there can never be a need for a psychiatrist, but I think the main need is for better psychosocial support rather than seeing a psychiatrist.”

Russell said they are not surprised by the slow rollout of ICD-11, observing that implementation is a very long and expensive process that can take many years. But implementation is not the only path to change, they said, stressing that ICD-11 is a data collection system, not a diagnostic guide or a guide on treatment.

Even where countries have not implemented ICD-11, individual practitioners are using the guidance to decide how they provide services. “We particularly see this in countries that have community-led clinics, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, and among individual practitioners across certain countries that are using informed consent models.” 

Russell explained that a practitioner's job is to make sure the person understands their treatment options and the likely effects and ultimately lets the individual decide. Being trans is for the person to define — not for doctors or psychiatrists.

Denmark offers an example of what change can look like. Dorte Glintborg, MD, PhD, professor of gender-affirming hormone treatment at the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark, described the country's transition away from psychiatric gatekeeping in 2017, making it the first globally to declassify transgender identity as a mental illness.

Now, three multidisciplinary public centers provide care, with costs covered by the national health service. Psychological support remains central but is offered as part of a broader continuum rather than a mandatory hurdle. Ideally, Glintborg said, they would like to offer even more support to transgender people who don't wish to pursue hormone therapy. And, while efforts had been made to shorten wait times, Glintborg acknowledged that capacity is still limited in the public system.

Ganesan highlighted the significance of the upcoming WHO guideline, stating, “We have Member States releasing their own guidelines at the national level — some good, others not so good. The upcoming WHO guideline will provide an aspirational standard that Member States can slowly implement.” She added, “It's also expected to answer two important issues: the provision of hormones and trauma-informed provision of care.”

Russell is one of 21 members of the WHO's guideline development group. Although they could not share specifics or a timeline, they said the guideline will reiterate that “when trans people exist, they should have access to care.” Russell hopes the guideline will encourage more countries to make care accessible and integrated in insurance coverage and create mechanisms for funding clinics and increasing large-scale research on trans healthcare.

Russell, Ganesan, and Glintborg reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Less than half of US women with infertility receive treatment, while just 1 in 10 have a live birth, a study has found. In addition, the study's authors said the disparities across the spectrum of fertility care are “striking.”

“Black, Hispanic, and socioeconomically disadvantaged women face the greatest barriers to successful [fertility] outcomes,” Theresa Boyer, MS, MSPH, and colleagues wrote. “These inequities may worsen as more restrictive fertility legislation emerges, highlighting the need for health systems and policymakers to prioritize equitable access to fertility care.”

Boyer is a PhD candidate in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

Boyer and her colleagues applied a “cascade of care” framework to US population data on women aged between 20 and 44 years to determine the timeline of their infertility awareness, treatment access, and live birth outcomes. Race, ethnicity, education, insurance, and age were evaluated to determine disparities in care.

“The cascade of care framework offers a useful approach for quantifying burden and identifying critical points of attrition in health services delivery and has been widely applied to chronic conditions such as HIV, diabetes, and hypertension,” Boyer and her colleagues wrote.

For their cross-sectional investigation, Boyer and colleagues used datasets from the 1991-2020 World Health Organization's (WHO's) lifetime infertility prevalence, self-reported infertility and treatment access from the 2013-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; unweighted N = 444), and 355,289 US birth certificates for live births conceived by women aged 20-44 years after fertility treatment. These data were reported in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) between 2016 and 2021.

“Since this is weighted survey data, the weighted estimates represent all US women aged 20-44 years,” Boyer told Medscape Medical News.

In a meta-analysis of 30 different studies, including 11 from the US, Boyer and colleagues found that the WHO's pooled lifetime infertility prevalence in high-income countries was estimated as 17.8% from 1991 to 2021. “This is the starting estimate used to calculate awareness, access to treatment, and live birth outcomes,” Boyer said.

Infertility awareness was estimated by dividing the proportion of US women aged 20-44 years who reported a history of infertility (NHANES) by the pooled lifetime infertility prevalence among women in high-income countries (WHO). Treatment access was calculated by multiplying the proportion of women with self-reported infertility who reported seeking medical care (NHANES) by the infertility awareness estimate.

To estimate live births following fertility treatment, the investigators divided the proportion of live births conceived using fertility treatment (NVSS) by the product of infertility prevalence and treatment access. This was then multiplied by the access-to-care value. The final stage of the cascade was live births among all women with infertility.

Also using NHANES data, the investigators examined differences in the fertility care cascade according to race and ethnicity, highest level of education obtained, health insurance, and age.

The overall prevalence of infertility among women aged 20-44 years was 11.9% in women with a mean age of 34 years, with no differences based on race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance status, or income. Of this group, 13.1% self-identified as Black and 19.7% as Hispanic. However, the investigators found that higher education and private insurance were associated with increased treatment access and live birth.

Infertility awareness in these women was high at 70%, while only 39% had access to fertility treatment, with the number of live births around 10%. White women were 58.5% of those with infertility but had 72.5% of live births conceived using fertility treatments.

They also had a live birth rate of 13% post-fertility treatment.

Of Asian women, 17% had live births after fertility treatments. In Hispanic women, the live birth rate after fertility treatment was 4%, and for Black women, it was the lowest at 3%.

Women with an associate's degree (42%) or a 4-year degree or more (49%) were much more likely to have accessed a medical professional than those with only a high school degree (22%). This disparity persisted with women with a college degree or more (20%) being far more likely to have a live birth than women with less than a high school education (1%).

“These differences are further compounded by delays in care, with Black, Hispanic, and Asian women waiting, on average, 2 years longer to seek treatment. Delayed access to care may contribute to diminished ovarian reserve, impairing the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes,” Boyer and colleagues wrote.

Consistent with prior data indicating infertility diagnosis and treatment increases with age, Boyer and colleagues' study showed that infertility awareness and treatment use were lowest in women aged 20-29 years and highest in women aged 40-44 years. In the latter group, nearly 40% achieved a live birth using fertility treatment.

There are only 21 states that mandate third-party coverage for infertility services, and eligibility criteria for these services vary widely, the authors wrote. Further, they claimed, “The lack of insurance coverage for IVF [in vitro fertilization] has created an environment where approximately 30% of assisted reproductive technology cycles in the US occur at private equity-affiliated practices. Uncertainty remains regarding how this pattern of acquisition and ownership will impact the cost and outcomes of these procedures.”

“Our findings reveal substantial disparities across the fertility care cascade by race, ethnicity, educational attainment, and insurance status,” the investigators wrote.

“I do not think that the results of the study [will] generally change the approach that reproductive endocrinology physicians take in providing access to care,” Amanda Adeleye, MD, a reproductive endocrinology physician and the medical director of CCRM Fertility Clinic in Chicago, told Medscape Medical News. “However, increasing awareness of these issues in a specialist ob/gyn community may help physicians and other providers more carefully identify and refer patients with infertility.”

She also said that the study is not likely to help clinicians improve access to fertility treatments for their patients “unless they become aware of their own implicit biases and improve their referral practices.”

In addition, Adeleye found the metrics of the study problematic. “The [researchers] aimed to assess awareness using a denominator of the prevalence of infertility globally. However, the incidence of infertility changes with age. I suspect that the number of younger people (20-29 years) with infertility is lower than the 15%-18% number, and to some extent, if people in this age group aren't ready to conceive yet, their lack of awareness about infertility isn't as relevant,” Adeleye wrote.

“This would mean the denominator of affected individuals in this group is lower and the proportion of people in this age group who are aware is higher than what was presented. The converse is true for the 40 and over group. There are likely more than 15%-18% of people who are affected by infertility. The number may be closer to 25%-50% of women who are trying to have a baby. In this case, the denominator of affected women is larger, and the proportion of people that are aware of their infertility is lower. I'm not convinced that using the same baseline infertility rates for all groups will average out the awareness metric.”

Meanwhile, another expert, Sigal Klipstein, MD, said, “Physicians are acutely aware of these disparities.” Klipstein is a reproductive endocrinologist, also in Chicago.

“The solutions cannot be realized solely or predominantly at the level of the individual physician. Systemic approaches are critical to decreasing disparities,” Klipstein said. “The greatest benefits will be derived from financial approaches to improve access to insurance coverage, geographic approaches such as increasing the number of physicians in underserved areas, many of which are less populated, and social approaches such as encouraging minority populations to access care by decreasing stigma and providing education regarding the high chance of achieving a pregnancy with fertility treatment, particularly at younger ages.”

Klipstein also encouraged physicians to include discussions of fertility with their reproductive-aged patients during wellness checks.

The authors and Klipstein reported having no conflicts of interest. Adeleye disclosed being a medical advisor for Carrot (fertility benefits company), Frame (fertility care navigation), and Kompass Diagnostics (hormone testing), and a strategic advisor for Roon (patient education).

Beta-blocker therapy significantly reduced a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, new myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF) compared with no beta-blocker therapy in the subgroup of patients with MI and mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), according to an individual patient data meta-analysis presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025. The results have been simultaneously published in The Lancet.

""Patients post-MI with mildly reduced LVEF (40−49%) but without HF represent a sizeable population. While it is intuitive to argue that these patients benefit from beta-blockers in a similar way as patients with reduced LVEF (<40%), there have been no specific randomised trials. Four recent randomised trials tested assessed beta-blockers after a recent MI in patients with LVEF ≥40%; however, none was individually powered to assess effects in the mildly reduced LVEF 40−49% subgroup,"" explained Doctor Xavier Rosselló from the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC), Madrid, Spain and the Son Espases University Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain, speaking on behalf of the researches from the four trials.

A systematic review was conducted of randomized controlled trials with beta-blockers performed in the reperfusion era (from 2000 onwards) with a median follow-up of more than 1 year in patients with a recent (within 14 days) MI (both ST-elevation MI or non-ST-elevation MI), mildly reduced LVEF and no history or clinical signs of HF. Four trials were identified: REBOOT conducted in Spain and Italy, BETAMI in Norway, DANBLOCK in Denmark and CAPITAL-RCT in Japan. Results from the REBOOT trial and a combined analysis of the BETAMI and DANBLOCK trials were presented in the same Hot Line session today, while CAPITAL-RCT was published in 2018. In a prespecified, individual patient level meta-analysis across the four trials, a one-stage, fixed-effects approach was used to assess the effect of beta-blockers on the pre-defined primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, new MI or HF. All endpoints were independently adjudicated in all four trials.

Overall, 1,885 patients with mildly reduced LVEF were analysed from the four trials (979 patients from REBOOT, 422 from BETAMI, 430 from DANBLOCK and 54 from CAPITAL-RCT), making up 13.1% of the study populations from the main trials.

The primary endpoint occurred in 10.7% of patients in the beta-blocker group and 14.4% of patients in the no beta-blocker group, representing a significant 25% relative reduction with beta-blockers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.97; p=0.031). There was no apparent heterogeneity in the effect on the primary endpoint between the four trials or between the countries of enrolment (Spain, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Japan).

The three individual components of the primary endpoint followed the same direction as the composite endpoint. All-cause death occurred in 5.9% and 7.7% of patients in the beta-blocker and no beta-blocker groups, respectively (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.11). New MI occurred in 3.9% and 5.2% of patients, respectively (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.11), while HF occurred in 3.0% and 4.4% of patients, respectively (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.14). In addition, cardiac death was found to occur in 1.8% of patients on beta-blockers and 3.3% of patients with no beta-blockers (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.06).

Our findings extend the known benefits of these agents in MI patients with reduced LVEF to the subgroup with mildly reduced LVEF. Further research should now focus on patients with preserved LVEF (>50%).""

Routine coronary computed tomography (CCT)-based follow-up after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left main coronary artery did not reduce death, myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina or stent thrombosis compared with symptom-based follow-up, according to late-breaking research presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025.

The left main coronary artery supplies a large proportion of the heart muscle and significant left main coronary artery disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The introduction of coronary stents along with the improvements in technology and pharmacological management has increased the use of PCI in these high-risk patients with similar results achieved compared with coronary artery bypass grafting.

Detrimental complications, such as stent restenosis, and recurrent ischemic events can occur after left main PCI; however, the optimal surveillance strategy remains a subject of debate. In recent years, CCT has emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosis and monitoring, providing accuracy comparable to invasive angiography, while minimising procedural risks and reducing healthcare costs. We conducted the first randomized trial to evaluate the potential benefit of routine CCT-based follow-up at 6 months compared with standard symptom- and ischemia-driven management in patients after PCI for left main disease.""

Doctor Ovidio De Filippo, trial presenter, from Hospital Citta Della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy

PULSE was an open-label, blinded-endpoint, investigator-initiated, randomized trial conducted at 15 sites in Europe and South America.

Participants were consecutive patients with critical stenosis undergoing PCI for left main coronary artery disease. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either a CCT-guided follow-up at 6 months (experimental arm) or standard symptom and ischemia-driven management (control arm). Participants were followed for an additional 12 months (total follow-up 18 months).

In the CCT arm, if significant left main in-stent restenosis was detected, patients underwent invasive coronary angiography followed by target lesion revascularisation if in-stent restenosis was confirmed. If any significant stenosis was detected in a different site, management was conducted according to the current guidelines. In the standard-of-care arm, patients were managed per clinical guidelines and according to each centre's standard practice. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, spontaneous MI, unstable angina or definite/probable stent thrombosis at 18 months.

A total of 606 patients were randomized who had a mean age of 69 years and 18% were female. CCT was performed in 89.8% of patients in the experimental arm at a median of 200 days.

A primary-endpoint event occurred in 11.9% of patients in the CCT arm and 12.5% of patients in the control arm at 18 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.23; p=0.80).

There was a reduced risk of spontaneous MI in the CCT arm vs. the control arm (0.9% vs. 4.9%; HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.91; p=0.004). An increase in imaging-triggered target-lesion revascularisation was observed in the CCT arm compared with the control arm (4.9% vs. 0.3%; HR 7.7; 95% CI 1.70 to 33.7; p=0.001); however, the incidence of clinically driven target-lesion revascularisation was similar between the arms (5.3% vs. 7.2%; HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; p=0.32).

Summing up the main findings, Principal Investigator, Professor Fabrizio D'Ascenzo, also from Hospital Citta Della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, said: ""Systematic 6-month CCT-based follow-up did not result in a reduction in 18-month all-cause death, spontaneous MI, unstable angina and stent thrombosis. While universal CCT-based follow-up may not be useful, the marked reduction in spontaneous MI and identification of obstructive lesions requiring repeat PCI suggest this approach may be worth investigating further in selected patients with complex anatomies and over longer follow-up.""

United States international Yunus Musah joined Atalanta on loan from AC Milan shortly before the transfer window shut on Monday.

Neither Serie A team gave financial details of the deal, but Italian media reports said Atalanta paid four million euros ($4.7 million) for the loan to the end of the season, when it will then have the right to buy the midfielder for 24 million euros ($28 million).

Musah, who was born in New York but grew up in Italy and England, has featured in the majority of Milan's matches since joining from Valencia two years ago.

The 22-year-old has also made nearly 50 appearances for the U.S. since his debut in 2020. He was also eligible to play for England, Italy and Ghana.

Atalanta finished third last season but is struggling since coach Gian Piero Gasperini left for Roma after nine years in charge. It has drawn both of its league matches against promoted Pisa and at Parma.

Atalanta hosts Lecce in Serie A on Sept. 14, after the international break, before opening its Champions League campaign against holder Paris Saint-Germain.

Can you name all 19 World Cup winners to play in MLS?

When Rodrigo De Paul put pen to paper and signed with Inter Miami, it marked the third current FIFA World Cup champion from Argentina to play in MLS both past and present. Lionel Messi of course is also with Inter Miami, and Thiago Almada was with Atlanta United before making a move to Botafogo and Atletico Madrid.

MLS has had an up-and-down history with World Cup winners. Just ask the New York Red Bulls, who have had four World Cup winners suit up for them with zero MLS Cups to show for it. In 1997, the then-MetroStars not only had one current World Cup champion at the time, but also the World Cup-winning coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, and a World Cup runner-up in Roberto Donadoni. The results? Dead last in the Eastern Conference.

Another shocking stat: of the 19 World Cup winners to have played in the league, none ever played for the Los Angeles Galaxy, the league's all-time winningest team, nor DC United, the shining star of MLS's early years.

Here is a review of 17 of the 19 World Cup winners. We are omitting De Paul, who has just started his MLS career, and Germany's Thomas Müller, who has also just arrived in MLS with the Vancouver Whitecaps.

1994 World Cup winner Branco came to the ailing MetroStars near the end of a disappointing 1997 season. The Brazilian defender brought with him his blazing free kicks, scoring one goal and adding two assists. He was also red-carded for spitting at an opponent and, off the field, was a chain smoker.

When the MetroStars were eliminated from playoff contention, all three individuals associated with the 1994 World Cup final were gone. Branco left to end his career at Fluminense, Donadoni returned to AC Milan, and Parreira dropped the Metros in favor of a international job, coaching Saudi Arabia at the 1998 World Cup. He'd be fired between the team's second and third game of the group stage.

We have already covered the horrific stint of 1990 World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus with the MetroStars, but to sum it up in a nutshell: Matthäus played 16 regular season games for the MetroStars, scoring zero goals. When out “injured,” he was on a beach with his young model girlfriend. It seemed like the former Bayern Munich star had zero interest in playing in MLS.

Despite all of that, the MetroStars were having the best season in their MLS history during that time, eventually being one win away from the MLS Cup but losing to the Chicago Fire. Matthäus, with all of his awards and accolades, is also one of the worst signings in MLS history.

The third time was the charm for the Red Bulls when they signed 1998 World Cup winner Youri Djorkaeff. The former Inter Milan great brought a lot of wisdom and professionalism to MLS in a time when the league was in its dark ages, two years before David Beckham would save it from certain oblivion.

Still, Djorkaeff was there, playing 48 games and scoring 13 goals. In a time when there was a lot of dead weight and empty stadiums around MLS, the French midfielder was one of the few players in the league that resembled an actual professional.

His one smear was leaving during the summer months of MLS to watch France during the 2006 World Cup.

At the dawn of the Designated Player era, FC Dallas went all in on a player who, on the Brazilian national team, was a human highlight reel, but at the club level always failed to meet expectations: 2002 World Cup winner Denílson.

Denílson is another flop signing: one goal in nine games and nothing much to show in MLS.

Italy's 2006 World Cup winner Alessandro Nesta's time in MLS may have been brief — just 34 games across one-and-a-half seasons — but he was elegant and decisive in his role. Nesta played with class and gave composure to the Impact's backline.

Kléberson was part of Brazil's 2002 World Cup-winning squad but was on a downward spiral by the time he got to the Union. One goal in 11 matches was all the mercurial midfielder would contribute in Philly, but he'd stay in the United States, playing with NASL sides Indy Eleven and Fort Lauderdale Strikers before retiring in 2016. Kléberson is currently an assistant coach with New York City FC.

The Red Bulls and MLS finally got the complete package with Thierry Henry. One of the best players to ever grace an MLS field, the 1998 World Cup winner scored 52 goals in 135 games, including a handful of highlight-reel strikes.

Henry may have slowed down a bit from his Arsenal days, but his quality was world-class. Even in his mid-30s, Henry was too much player for most in MLS. He won a Supporters' Shield with the Red Bulls in 2013.

2002 World Cup winner Kaká was the face of the new MLS franchise Orlando City, and the former Real Madrid and AC Milan star delivered, scoring 25 goals in 78 games. Kaká brought instant credibility and talent to his new team. An excellent passer and dribbler, he lived up to his megastar hype.

Well past his prime, 2006 World Cup winner Andrea Pirlo was not the second coming of Donadoni when it came to high-quality Italians in MLS. Statistically, he scored just one goal in 62 games, and while there were flashes of elegance, Pirlo never really seemed comfortable in MLS.

Still the best player to ever play for NYCFC, David Villa was pure class in MLS. The 2010 World Cup winner is still the club's all-time leading scorer with 80 goals, was MLS MVP in 2016, and an MLS All-Star four times in a row.

2014 World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger was a great ambassador for the club and the league. While not flashy, Schweinsteiger brought intelligence and class to an often ailing Chicago Fire side.

The former Bayern Munich star played 92 games and scored eight goals. He was also infamously asked by a journalist at his unveiling if the Fire could win the World Cup. Schweinsteiger, bewildered, didn't know what to say before a Fire official reminded everyone that the Fire don't actually play in the World Cup.

French World Cup winner in 2018, Blaise Matuidi is better known for his situation off the field than on. On the field, Matuidi was a mute presence for a poor Inter Miami side. Off the field, his contract — illegally reported as a non-DP deal — caused the club to be fined $2 million, with more than $2 million in allocation funds cut for two seasons.

Thiago Almada is the eternal answer to a trivia question: the only active MLS player to win the World Cup while playing in the league. All of the other 18 World Cup winners came to MLS after they had won it. Almada won it as a midfielder for Atlanta United.

At the MLS level, Almada was a fantastic talent on a horrific Atlanta side that only went downhill after he left. He had highlight-reel moments with 26 goals in 83 games, but Atlanta couldn't hold its own.

Almada's $21 million move to Brazilian club Botafogo — run by John Textor, whose ownership style has raised more than a few eyebrows — quickly turned into a legal headache. MLS and Atlanta United took the case to FIFA after Botafogo allegedly missed payment deadlines, leading to a ruling against the club and financial penalties.

Instead of paying up, Botafogo shipped Almada off on a free loan to Lyon in early 2025, a move that conveniently bypassed the French side's transfer ban.

By July 2025, the Argentine playmaker finally secured a permanent transfer to Atlético Madrid for a hefty fee. Atlanta, however, is still waiting on its full payment. Even so, Almada remains etched in MLS history as the first player to win a FIFA World Cup while still active in the league.

While some misguided pundits call Olivier Giroud's time in MLS a flop, the 2018 World Cup winner was a major missed opportunity for LAFC. The reality is the former AC Milan striker was signed more for his notoriety than his player profile, and Steve Cherundolo's coaching style didn't fit a target striker at all.

Cherundolo stuck to his guns, refusing to adjust his style for his star player, and Giroud suffered greatly, scoring just five goals in 38 games: Shockingly poor numbers for a player who only a year before was scoring at will for AC Milan with Christian Pulisic and Rafael Leão on the wings. Case in point — since returning to France with Lille, Giroud has scored twice in two matches.

A lot of questions were never asked of LAFC as to how John Thorrington allowed something like this to happen and why Cherundolo did not adjust to get the most out of a proven striker. Lesson learned: LAFC has now signed Son Heung-min, a player much more suited to the club's style of play.

The 2010 World Cup winner is well past his prime and has never had a truly memorable performance in an Inter Miami kit. While that might be harsh — there have been a few classy passes here and there — Sergio Busquets clearly looks his age on the field. In due time, his MLS stint will be seen as largely forgettable.

The 2018 World Cup winner is still going strong with LAFC. One of the best goalkeepers in MLS, Hugo Lloris continues his rock-solid form and could easily play for any team in the world if he wanted. A luxury to have his class and talent in MLS.

The GOAT. Lionel Messi won the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina and shocked the world by signing with Inter Miami after a miserable stint at PSG.

Messi has been everything and more on the field: Selling out stadiums, causing the adidas website to sell out Inter Miami kits worldwide, and scoring 61 goals in 73 games as of this writing.

Messi has slowed down over the last few years, but when inspired and determined, no player on earth can change a game in seconds like he can. Sure, he never speaks to the U.S. media or does the interview rounds, but that has never been his style.

Messi took a ragtag Inter Miami to win the Leagues Cup his first season in MLS, but the feel-good story quickly changed to villain territory. Miami's spending habits are dubious, Messi's influence over the team is clear, and there are few holdovers from when he first arrived — along with some questionable moves, like shipping out Robert Taylor and DeAndre Yedlin.

How the Messi era will end remains one of the great MLS storylines.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Creating new perspectives since 2009

September 1, 2025 at 7:10 pm

Morocco, one of the six host nations of the 2030 FIFA World Cup, is preparing Tangier's Grand Stade de Tanger for the global tournament.

Preparations are moving at full speed in Morocco, which has been working diligently since securing World Cup hosting rights last year. Among the venues is the Ibn Battuta Stadium, one of the country's largest, named after the famed explorer and opened in 2011 with a capacity of 45,000 spectators.

Following its redesign, the Tangier venue has also undergone a name change, now officially called the Grand Stade de Tanger instead of Ibn Battuta Stadium.

Morocco, which began modernizing the stadium ahead of the 2030 World Cup, has invested $360 million in renovations that were 95% complete as of early September. The project was designed not only to enhance the stadium's performance but also to increase spectator capacity.

Led by architect Anouar Amaoui, who created the original design, the work included removing the athletics track to improve visibility from the stands and adding new VIP areas inspired by the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Atlanta, USA.

With these upgrades, the stadium's capacity has risen to 75,000, and it now serves as the home ground of Moroccan First Division side Ittihad Tanger.

A stadium full of innovations

The stadium, which will be ready by the end of next September and redesigned to host only football matches, has had its stands moved closer to the pitch for a better experience.

The playing field is covered with a 105×68 meter natural grass surface that meets FIFA standards. The stadium has also been equipped with a new large-scale roof, featuring a 55,000 m² white tensile fabric structure supported by giant steel rings.

With its modern design, the roof is regarded as one of the most advanced in Africa and is only the second of its kind on the continent.

In addition to standard football amenities such as natural grass, four dressing rooms, high-quality lighting, and a large main screen, the stadium is also designed as a venue for ceremonies and concerts, with meeting rooms, workshop areas, and ample parking.

2030 World Cup will be held in 6 countries across 3 continents

Morocco is set to host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations and will co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal.

The event is planned to be held in the capital, Rabat, as well as Casablanca, Tangier, Fez, Marrakesh, and Agadir.

The 2030 World Cup will also feature one match each in Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay.

The first matches of the tournament will be played in South America to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the World Cup. The remaining matches will be played in Spain, Morocco, and Portugal.

Instead of experiencing a dip in form after the 2022 World Cup, Argentina have maintained their status as CONMEBOL's top-performing national team in the qualifiers. With only two games remaining, Lionel Scaloni‘s team remains firmly in first place, holding a commanding 10-point advantage over second-place Ecuador. Despite its impressive form, the head coach has expressed serious concerns about the 2026 World Cup, issuing a direct message to FIFA.

“I think the heat is going to be terribly hard. We already saw it at the Club World Cup… the schedules are going to be similar, at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, because they have to be shown in other countries, so it's not too late, and that has a huge impact. The players are tired, exhausted after a whole season, and no thought is given to what's best for them, which is to play at a time when the heat doesn't have such an impact,” Lionel Scaloni said, via TNT Sports Argentina.

Throughout the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, players frequently expressed concerns over the sweltering heat during both matches and training sessions. Despite scheduled cooling breaks, the physical toll was evident. The Argentine national team, however, is well-acquainted with such conditions. In the 2024 Copa America, they faced equally intense heat across all venues but showcased remarkable resilience, ultimately clinching the championship title.

FIFPRO, the global players' organization, has openly criticized the scheduling of certain Club World Cup matches. The association argues that any game played in conditions exceeding a Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) of 82.4°F should be postponed to ensure player safety. In contrast, FIFA has established a higher threshold of 89.6°F, a decision FIFPRO disputes, especially with the 2026 World Cup on the horizon.

Following the considerable heat issues at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, many anticipated changes to the match schedules due to games played under direct sunlight. While the scheduling will remain unchanged as per Lionel Scaloni, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced a new measure for the 2026 World Cup that could significantly impact the tournament.

“Every criticism we receive is a source for us to study and analyse what can do better… Cooling breaks are very important and we will see what we can do, but we have stadiums with roofs and we will definitely use these stadiums during the day next year,” Infantino said in July of 2025, as reported by ESPN.

This adjustment seems logical, yet Chelsea and Fluminense faced off in the semifinals of the 2025 Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in sweltering 96°F heat—a venue without a roof. Consequently, this shift could result in venues like Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver hosting more matches, as FIFA prioritizes stadiums with roofs for the 2026 World Cup.

The official period for doing business might be over, but there is still the opportunity to pull off a shrewd move in the free agent market

Another frenzied transfer window has come to an end, with the market once again dominated by the Premier League in a record-breaking summer of spending by top-flight English sides. But despite the deadline passing, there are still deals to be done.

Away from the big bucks shelled out on the likes of Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko, those who like to do things on the cheap - or are perhaps prone to leaving things until the very last minute and beyond - will now be scouring the free agent market for potential opportunities. In the Premier League, unattached players can be signed at any time and can play immediately, provided there is space in a club's registered squad.

And just like that, the first international break of the season is upon us. Just as the Premier League is properly getting going, teams will be able to step back and take stock over the next fortnight as managers consider how they can improve things following the first three rounds of action.

The standout fixture on paper from the past week, and in fact the whole of August, came on Sunday as Liverpool hosted Arsenal in an early-season showdown between the top two teams from 2024-25.

The Red Devils were much improved but needed a last-gasp spot-kick from their usual talisman to take the points after more goalkeeping woes

Lightning rarely strikes twice and Bruno Fernandes doesn't miss from the penalty spot two weeks in a row. So when the Manchester United captain took the ball in front of the Scoreboard End six days after ballooning a kick over the bar against Fulham, you knew he was going to score. 

This time Fernandes buried the ball in the bottom corner and gave United an angst-ridden 3-2 win over Burnley, giving them their first victory of the season. They were actually more than deserving of the three points but they had to sweat to get them. An own goal from Josh Cullen put United in front after sustained pressure but Lyle Foster equalised in the second half, after the hosts had lost Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount to injuries.

Burnley's joy lasted no time at all as Bryan Mbeumo restored United's lead after a driving run from Diogo Dalot. But the Red Devils never make it easy for themselves and yet another mishap from Altay Bayindir gave the visitors a second equaliser, Jaidon Anthony pouncing after the goalkeeper had failed to catch or punch away a strike.

United threw everything at Burnley, including a wasteful Benjamin Sesko who missed two headers. But they got what they wanted when a VAR review gave them an added-time penalty, having been denied one in the first half. Fernandes made no mistake but more mistakes are almost guaranteed unless they sign a new goalkeeper.

Only one American man remains in the US Open, but he shows no signs of being ready to go home.

Fourth seed Taylor Fritz earned a statement 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory in just one hour and 38 minutes against 21st seed Tomas Machac Sunday evening to reach the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows. He will next take on 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic.

It has been a difficult few days for American men, with Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul all exiting the tournament. But Fritz, who needed four sets in both the second and third rounds, produced a flawless performance inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, triumphing without facing a break point.

“It's been a tough week for the guys. I guess I wasn't expecting everything to happen,” Fritz said. “I felt really, really good about our chances this week, but I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be the last one standing at least and hopefully since I'm the last one the crowd will really get behind me and will me through it.”



One year ago at the US Open, Fritz fell just one victory short of becoming the first American man to win a major singles title since Andy Roddick at Flushing Meadows in 2003. He looks intent on making another charge towards Slam glory.

Fritz hit 30 winners — including 14 aces — compared to just 18 unforced errors against Machac and won 91 per cent of his first-serve points. The last time he played Machac, at this year's United Cup, the Czech was the better player for most of their clash before retiring.

On this occasion, Fritz left no doubt by consistently putting pressure on his opponent without giving him any opportunities to break through. The American now leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 3-0.

“I had some battles the past couple matches, but just felt very dialed in, ready to go tonight,” Fritz said. “Thought I played just really solid, put a lot of balls in the court, was aggressive at the right times and backed it up well with good serving.”

Djokovic will take a 10-0 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series into their quarter-final.

After letting eight match points slip away against Barbora Krejcikova in the fourth round of the US Open, a disappointed-yet-energized Taylor Townsend is excited about where her game is and what the future holds.

She was so painfully close.

In one of the most memorable weeks of her career, Taylor Townsend was on the brink of reaching her first career Grand Slam singles quarterfinal.

How close was she? After pummeling Barbora Krejcikova 6-1 in the first set of their fourth-round match in Louis Armstrong Stadium, the American had eight match points in the second set -- seven of which came in one of the most thrilling, edge-of-your-seat tiebreaks in recent memory.

Over the course of over 25 minutes, with the 14,000-strong crowd in Armstrong rallying fiercely behind Townsend -- and watching the incredibly tense rallies with bated breath -- the two-time Grand Slam champion saved seven match points before closing it out 15-13.

She then took the next set 6-3 to move into the quarters in New York for the second time in her career.

Townsend burst into tears after the excruciatingly painful defeat, but after the match -- after she'd had a bit of time to process it -- she seemed grateful, motivated and ready to build on her momentum.

""I'm exactly where I need to be,"" the 29-year-old told reporters. ""I said it in D.C. -- I was kind of inching there -- but I'm exactly where I need to be. I'm playing the tennis I need to play to be inside the top 20, top 10, to win a Grand Slam. She's a two-time Grand Slam champion. I have beaten a Grand Slam champion this tournament.

""So I have everything that I need, and it's just about getting the reps, keep putting myself in these types of positions. This hurts, but it's part of competition, it's part of sports. But I'm right where I need to be.""

The Grand Slam champion that Townsend is referring to is Jelena Ostapenko, who she upset in the second round. There was a heated exchange at the net after the match, and Townsend handled herself with grace and confidence, earning the support of fellow players and fans. She followed that up with an even bigger upset, a straight sets win over fifth-seeded Mirra Andreeva, and tore the house down with a cool-as-can-be post-match interview in Arthur Ashe Stadium that cemented her as the darling of the tournament.

In Armstrong on Sunday, it was one of the most electric environments we've seen all tournament, and you could feel that something special was brewing. It wasn't meant to be for Townsend, but she knows she's not done.

""It just stings, because I literally gave everything,"" the doubles World No. 1 said. ""She came up with some really, really great tennis in moments where she was down, and I thought I had it. But it's a part of sports. For me, I'm like, 'Damn, when is the next time I'm going to play a singles match?' I'm ready to go back again.

""I'm not done here. I have doubles tomorrow. I'm going to do everything that I can to hoist the trophy here. With that, I know I can do it, me and my partner have done it before. This is just motivating me to keep doing the things that I know I can do to be a champion. ... I'm going to use what happened today to just fuel me.""

A two-time Grand Slam doubles champion, Townsend made the doubles final of the US Open with Caty McNally in 2022. (Interesting, they lost that final to Krejcikova and her countrywoman, Katerina Siniakova.)

Townsend, now partnering with Siniakova, will take on Yue Yuan and Camila Osorio in the Round of 16 on Monday.

 

After letting eight match points slip away against Barbora Krejcikova in the fourth round of the US Open, a disappointed-yet-energized Taylor Townsend is excited about where her game is and what the future holds.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Marketa Vondrousova prevailed in a battle of former Wimbledon champions, defeating No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 in 1 hour and 51 minutes to advance to the US Open quarterfinals for the second time in her career.

One way or another, a former Wimbledon champion was bound for the US Open quarterfinals.

Marketa Vondrousova made sure it was her, outlasting No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 in a late-night showdown Sunday at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

The match lasted 1 hour and 51 minutes, marking Vondrousova's second career trip to the quarterfinals in New York.

“After everything I've been through, it's amazing to be standing here again,” Vondrousova said after the match. “It's been an amazing week so far and I'm just incredibly happy to be here. I have a great team here and great people around me and we are having so much fun off the court as well.”

On this night, the fun extended onto the court.

Vondrousova broke Rybakina in the opening game and jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first set. Rybakina responded by winning the next three games to go up 3-2, but Vondrousova broke again at 4-all, sealing it with a forehand volley winner. She served out the set in the next game.

The momentum shifted in the second set, with Rybakina breaking twice. Vondrousova fought back to level the set but was broken again while serving to force a tiebreak.

In the final set, it was all Vondrousova. Rybakina had two break points while Vondrousova served for the match at 5-2, but the Czech fired three straight aces to save both and seal the win.

Here are some notable stats from Vondrousova's hard-fought victory:

1: Vondrousova is the first unseeded player to record multiple WTA Top 10 wins en route to a Grand Slam quarterfinal since Garbiñe Muguruza at the 2020 Australian Open. She's also the first to do so at the US Open since Caroline Wozniacki in 2016.

2: Vondrousova now holds a 2-1 career record against Rybakina at the WTA level, winning both of their hard-court meetings.

5: With the win, Vondrousova has reached her fifth career Grand Slam quarterfinal, her first since the 2024 French Open and her second at the US Open after 2023.

13: Vondrousova hit 13 aces Sunday – nearly matching the 14 she totaled across her first three matches this week.

29: Vondrousova struck 29 winners against just 15 unforced errors. Rybakina hit 40 winners but was undone by 38 unforced errors.

Vondrousova will face world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Tuesday's quarterfinal, their ninth career meeting. Sabalenka leads the head-to-head 5-3, including a 7-5, 6-1 win in the second round in Cincinnati a few weeks ago.

A win would send Vondrousova to her first career US Open semifinal.

The final also drew the presence of Rafa Nadal himself, who joined the crowd to watch the Academy graduate secure the biggest title of his career. Tournament director Joan Suasi hailed both the atmosphere and the significance of Rincón's breakthrough: “It's wonderful to see this crowd and this energy. Having Dani win here, after so many years of trying, is a fantastic success for the Academy and for the tournament.”With this triumph, Rincón adds his name to a winners' list that includes Duje Ajdukovic (2024), Hamad Medjedovic (2023), Luca Nardi (2022), Lukas Lacko (2021), Emil Ruusuvuori (2019), and Bernard Tomic (2018). Already a symbolic victory on home soil, it may prove the launching pad for an even brighter career ahead.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Lewis Hamilton's Dutch Grand Prix came to an early end with a mid-race accident at Zandvoort.

Lewis Hamilton only made it a third of the way into Sunday's Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, with the seven-time World Champion dramatically crashing out.

Hamilton was negotiating the Turn 3 banking on Lap 23 of 72 when he put a wheel on the slippery white line – amid light drops of rain – and lost control of his Ferrari.

After sliding into the wall at the exit and causing significant front-end damage, Hamilton parked up, apologised over the radio and headed back to the paddock with his helmet still on.

“It's a driver error, but when there are drops of rain you do find painted surfaces become slippery first,” commented ex-F1 driver Jolyon Palmer during F1 TV's coverage.

When he made it to the media pen, Hamilton himself said: “I generally felt like it was going okay. I had good pace compared to Charles [Leclerc] ahead of me and my tyres were still okay.

“The rear was getting a bit twitchy… I got to Turn 3 and had a snap and I couldn't recover it.”

“It's not a normal sort of thing for me to have, [to] crash out of a race. I can't really say too much more about it.”

Ferrari went on to suffer a double DNF when Leclerc dropped out of proceedings following a clash with Mercedes rival Kimi Antonelli through the same Turn 3 section.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Charles Leclerc and Kimi Antonelli have each given their take on the collision that occurred between them at the Dutch Grand Prix, an incident that ultimately put Leclerc out of the race.

Charles Leclerc believes that Kimi Antonelli was “overly optimistic” in their collision at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Monegasque admitting that the incident “cost a lot” after he retired from the running on a day in which Ferrari recorded two non-finishes.

As the race headed towards its final phase, both Leclerc and Antonelli made a pit stop and the two cars emerged next to each other on track. Antonelli then tried to overtake the SF-25 approaching the banking at Turn 3, but in the process made contact that sent Leclerc into the barriers and out of the race.

While the Mercedes managed to limp back to the pits and continue in the Grand Prix after some repairs, Antonelli was handed a 10-second time penalty for causing the collision as well as receiving an additional five-second penalty for speeding in the pit lane, all of which dropped him down to a final position of P16.

At the time, Leclerc had appeared to suggest over the radio that his pit stop just prior to the incident had been “unnecessary”. When quizzed on this later on, the 27-year-old explained: “I don't think this should be the story of the day.

“The strategy, we can discuss about it and I just let the team know, but that's not what created the incident. What created the incident is Kimi being overly optimistic on the inside of Turn 3, which is fine – you've got to be aggressive and mistakes happen.

“But it hurts, because it cost a lot to the team after what was a good race. I think the pace was good. I had to be very aggressive to make up the places that we had lost because of being unlucky during the first Safety Car. We did kind of everything right, so it was a shame.”

Having earlier gained positions during the race – which saw him make a bold move on George Russell during a close battle with the Mercedes – Leclerc was asked whether this had been an encouraging sign that there is more performance in Ferrari's car.

“Yeah. It's been a very difficult weekend,” said Leclerc. “Apart from the race, it's been an uphill weekend, so I hope we can start on a better foot in Monza and have a better weekend overall.”

Antonelli also gave his take on the incident, with the Silver Arrows driver feeling that he had been enjoying a good Grand Prix up until that point.

“It's a shame because the race was looking good, the pace was very strong and we were coming back and, yeah, I tried,” conceded Antonelli.

“It didn't feel like I overshot massively, it was a bit unfortunate because, while I was trying to keep it tight, it came a bit down from the banking and that was the moment when the contact happened.

“It was a shame, I feel sorry because obviously it's not nice to take someone out. At least [there were] some positives today, and we move forward.”

Looking forward, Antonelli is hopeful that he can continue to build on those positives from the event as he looks to work on his Saturday performances in particular.

“I think race pace has always been strong this year, and it's nice that this is developing and it's getting stronger and stronger,” the 19-year-old said. “It's now more about nailing Qualifying in order to start more at the front, because then it's completely another story.”

Radio Rewind: 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Oscar Piastri has extended his championship lead following an eventful Dutch Grand Prix, in which McLaren team mate Lando Norris retired during the closing stages.

Oscar Piastri has taken victory in a hugely dramatic Dutch Grand Prix that saw McLaren team mate Lando Norris retire from the race due to a mechanical failure in the closing stages, marking a potentially seismic moment in the championship battle.

Piastri had made a good start from pole when the race got underway, the Australian going on to build a lead from Max Verstappen after the Red Bull had overtaken Norris early on in Lap 1. Norris, however, went on to retake the position and the pair settled into a 1-2 formation.

The race then faced a potential turn when the Safety Car was deployed after Lewis Hamilton hit the barriers on Lap 23, leading to a flurry of action in the pits. McLaren double-stacked their drivers and, despite a slight delay for Norris, both cars maintained position.

Norris continued his chase of his team mate from there and – despite a second Safety Car after a collision between Charles Leclerc and Kimi Antonelli that put the Ferrari out of the race – the fight looked to still be open as the race entered into its final stages.

However, everything changed when smoke started to emerge from Norris' McLaren with just a few laps to go, forcing him to retire at the side of the track. As the Briton cut a dejected figure, a final Safety Car phase played out which saw Piastri hold onto P1 from Verstappen and seal his seventh Grand Prix win of the season and in the process stretch his championship lead to 34 points.

Verstappen followed in second, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar converted an impressive P4 on the grid to third place, marking a maiden F1 podium for the rookie. George Russell took fourth for Mercedes, while Williams' Alex Albon claimed fifth after starting down in P15.

Race results

FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN DUTCH GRAND PRIX 2025

Haas' Ollie Bearman – who started from the pit lane – crossed the line in sixth after the American outfit made a one-stop strategy work under the Safety Car, with Aston Martin scoring a double points finish as Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso grabbed seventh and eighth respectively.

Yuki Tsunoda took two points for Red Bull in P9, while Haas' Esteban Ocon added to his team's points haul by rounding out the top 10. Alpine's Franco Colapinto just missed out in P11, as did Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in P12.

Behind Lawson was Williams' Carlos Sainz, who was earlier handed a 10-second time penalty for a collision with the New Zealander, and Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto were just behind in 14th and 15th.

Antonelli ended a tough day down in P16, the Italian having received two penalties during the latter stages following his collision with Leclerc, while Alpine's Pierre Gasly was the final classified driver down in P17.

Norris led the list of high-profile retirees after his late-race car failure, with the two Ferraris being the other two cars not to make the finish on a difficult day for the Scuderia.

After an exciting end to Saturday's Qualifying session saw Piastri just edge out Norris to take pole position, the paddock reconvened on Sunday for the first race of the second half of the 2025 season, the 72-lap Dutch Grand Prix.

It was confirmed in the build-up to the event that one change had been made to the starting order, with Bearman – who had qualified down in P19 – set to start from the pit lane after the Haas team changed power unit elements in his car under parc ferme conditions.

While rainfall had been forecast entering into the weekend at Zandvoort, the showers had mostly stayed away throughout the event so far – and this again looked to be the case as the race start approached, with the drivers greeted by dry albeit cloudy weather on Sunday. The risk of rain during the Grand Prix, however, stood at 60 per cent.

Meanwhile it was confirmed that Hamilton would be investigated after the race for a potential yellow flag infringement in a pit entry incident.

When the cars had assembled on the grid and the tyres blankets were removed ahead of the event – anticipated to be a one-stop race for many, though a two-stop could also not be ruled out – it was revealed that the majority of the pack would be starting on the medium compound, with the exception of Verstappen, Tsunoda, Colapinto and Hulkenberg running the soft while the Haas pair had bolted on the hard rubber.

Once the formation lap had been completed and the lights went out – under increasingly dark skies – Piastri made a strong start to hold the lead, while Norris soon came under pressure from Verstappen.

The Dutchman then had a wobble into Turn 3 after going around the outside of Norris, but managed to hold position and remain ahead of the Briton. Elsewhere Leclerc had gained a place on Russell to move up to fifth – with Hadjar leading a train of cars in fourth – while Albon had also made an impressive start to climb from P15 to P10.

Just as Piastri had extended his lead to more than two seconds by Lap 4, the McLaren driver was warned that “class one rain” was on the way in a matter of minutes. And as the next few laps ticked down, Verstappen's soft tyres looked to potentially be falling away, with Piastri's advantage growing to nearly four seconds as of Lap 8.

Norris, meanwhile, had closed in on Verstappen – the gap now within DRS range – and ultimately made a move around the outside of the reigning World Champion at Turn 1 on Lap 9, the British driver then given some encouragement by his race engineer to chase down Piastri.

Over in the pit lane, Stroll – who had earlier been noted for a collision with Bortoleto before the stewards deemed that no investigation was necessary – was the first to pit, the Canadian surprisingly emerging with the hard tyre bolted on despite the forecast suggesting incoming rain.

By Lap 12 Norris had pumped in another fastest lap as he continued to eat into Piastri's advantage, while Verstappen had dropped back to more than five seconds adrift of the Briton. Bearman, meanwhile, reported his concerns about Bortoleto's front wing, which had seemingly been damaged during his earlier incident with Stroll.

Shortly afterwards, replays showed Stroll appearing to run over a piece of debris on the track, suggesting that the endplate from the Kick Sauber had fallen off. Elsewhere Antonelli was hot on the tail of Tsunoda in a battle for 11th, while Alpine swapped their cars to put Gasly ahead as Colapinto's soft tyres looked to be fading.

Piastri radioed in about drops of rain on his visor at Lap 15 – and within a couple of laps, McLaren CEO Zak Brown was seen holding out his hand from his position at the pit wall to assess whether the rainfall had indeed arrived. The gap between the papaya cars now stood at three seconds.

Race control announced that Bortoleto was under investigation for driving his car in an unsafe condition, while his manager, Alonso, became the next car to pit for a set of hard tyres as his team mate had done earlier.

Others soon started to follow, with the likes of Tsunoda, Colapinto and Hulkenberg diving into the pit lane – all bolting on the hard compound – just as Norris was asked if he could get closer to the car ahead. “Maybe a touch,” the driver in P2 responded.

As he followed Russell up ahead, Hamilton suggested that an undercut might be necessary to get ahead – but on Lap 23 the Ferrari driver hit the barriers after going wide through the banking at Turn 3, putting him out of the race and sparking yellow flags which then became a Safety Car.

This triggered a flurry of action in the pit lane as most of the pack took the opportunity to make their stop, with McLaren double-stacking Piastri and Norris. All worked out smoothly for Piastri – who re-emerged as the leader – while Norris had a slight delay after being held up by the front jack but remained in second.

While the majority of the field had gone for the hard compound, Verstappen had put on a set of medium tyres and stayed in third, with Hadjar still in fourth from Russell, Leclerc, Lawson, Sainz, Ocon and Albon. The only drivers not to pit were the Haas cars.

All eyes were on how Piastri would handle the restart as the Safety Car phase came to an end on Lap 26 – and the Australian seemed to time it well, maintaining the lead from his team mate. Further back there was trouble for Lawson and Sainz, with contact between the pair seeing both drop backwards.

“He's just so stupid,” Sainz said of his rival as each car pitted due to damage on their respective cars. While these two were now down in P18 and P19, Piastri had built up a gap from Norris at the front to 1.7s by Lap 31 while Russell was trying to find a way past Hadjar in the scrap for fourth. “Moving under braking,” Russell commented as he fought with the Racing Bulls machine.

The Virtual Safety Car was soon deployed owing to a piece of debris on the main straight, with the crowd cheering when said piece of bodywork was recovered by a marshal. Meanwhile Norris was being told “we would try and go to the end on this” in terms of his strategy – and, behind him, a feisty Leclerc snatched P5 from Russell in a close duel.

Russell voiced his unhappiness about the manoeuvre over the radio, while Leclerc suggested that the Mercedes driver had not given him room earlier in the lap. Elsewhere Sainz's tricky day had gotten worse when he was handed a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision with Lawson.

The stewards were being kept busy at Zandvoort, with it then being confirmed that the incident between Leclerc and Russell would be investigated after the race. Up ahead, Norris – 1.7s adrift of his team mate – was told that his best chance to beat Piastri was to do so on track rather than via strategy.

There was also plenty going on further back. Alonso cut a frustrated figure in P13, the Aston Martin driver asking if an undercut was possible as he found himself in a train of cars led by Bearman in P11, with Tsunoda trying to find a way past the Haas.

Over at Mercedes, Russell – seemingly carrying some damage from his earlier altercation with Leclerc – was asked to let Antonelli through, moving the Italian up to P6 as he tried to chase down Leclerc with just over 30 laps to go.

By Lap 48, Piastri was continuing to lead Norris by 1.2s, with Verstappen still making his medium tyres last in third while Hadjar had kept his Racing Bulls in fourth. Sainz, meanwhile, was unhappy to be informed about his penalty for the Lawson incident, the Spaniard commenting: “Who? Who gets a penalty? Me? You are joking.”

With the final portion of the race still to go, there were plenty of questions remaining regarding strategy. If the Safety Car was deployed again, would McLaren pit their drivers or leave them out? Should that scenario not arise, though, Norris had around 20 laps to catch Piastri on track.

Elsewhere, Alonso had pitted earlier on following his frustrations and had found a way past Bortoleto to move up to 15th, while Antonelli and Leclerc each pitted – only for Leclerc to then hit the barriers after being hit by the Mercedes, putting the Ferrari out of the race just out of the Turn 3 banking.

Those earlier questions about a second Safety Car then came to fruition as the vehicle was sent out again, with McLaren carrying out another double-stack for the hard tyres while the majority of the pack also took the opportunity to put on another set of tyres.

Antonelli limped back to the pits, having sustained damage in that clash with Leclerc – and to make matters worse for the Italian, he was subsequently handed a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision, as well as being noted for speeding in the pit lane. Elsewhere, the two Haas cars both made a long-awaited stop, while Tsunoda was told that he needed to manage a throttle issue.

As Lap 57 ticked down, the Safety Car peeled into the pits and Piastri again executed the restart well – and while Norris initially faced pressure from Verstappen, the Dutchman looking racy on a fresh set of soft tyres, the McLaren pair were able to break away.

The intra-team battle was still very much alive, though, with Norris remaining on the tail of Piastri with just over 10 laps to go. Behind them, Antonelli was given a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pit lane, meaning that the rookie – running in seventh – would need to maintain a decent gap from the chasing Bearman in eighth to keep that position.

“Possibly a few very light drops,” Piastri was warned of potential impending rain with a few laps to go – but the race then took a dramatic turn when Norris reported a strange smell from his car just as smoke started to emerge from the back of the McLaren, forcing the Briton to pull over and retire from the Grand Prix.

As the Safety Car appeared for a third time, Norris was seen perching on the grass near to his stricken car, with the retirement marking a potentially pivotal moment in the championship battle. Also still sat in the sand dunes in another section of the track was Leclerc, both drivers cutting pensive figures.

While those watching on tried to digest what had happened, the race was still not over – and the Safety Car again returned to the pits on Lap 70, with Piastri holding off any potential challenge from Verstappen while Hadjar was now looking at a potential debut podium in third.

After a drama-packed 72 laps, Piastri ultimately crossed the line by 1.271s from Verstappen to seal a seventh Grand Prix triumph of the season and extend his championship lead to 34 points over Norris following the Briton's retirement.

Behind them was Hadjar in P3, the Racing Bulls driver marking an impressive afternoon at Zandvoort with his debut appearance on the rostrum. Russell – who will visit the stewards after the race following that earlier battle with Leclerc – claimed fourth, ahead of Albon in fifth.

Bearman grabbed a career-best P6, with Stroll, Alonso, Tsunoda and Ocon rounding out the top 10. Colapinto again missed out on points in P11, as did Lawson (P12), Sainz (P13), Hulkenberg (P14) and Bortoleto (P15).

Antonelli dropped to 16th following his penalties, bringing a tough day for the Italian to an end, while Gasly completed the order in 17th place.

Norris, Leclerc and Hamilton were the three retires from the race, with Ferrari's non-score meaning that Mercedes are now 12 points away from the Scuderia in the fight for P2 of the Teams' Championship.

""It feels good obviously,"" said Piastri. ""I feel like it's a pretty hard act to follow Isack standing up here so I'll try my best. I controlled the race when I needed to and obviously incredibly unfortunate for Lando at the end, but I felt like I was in control of that one and just used the pace when I needed to. It was a bit of a different race to 12 months ago, so [I'm] very happy with all the work we've done to try and improve around here. Very satisfied to come out on top.""

F1 will travel directly from Zandvoort to Monza for the Italian Grand Prix over the weekend of September 5-7. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Ferrari enter their home race at Monza on the back foot after a double retirement last weekend at Zandvoort.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur admits that a double retirement for the team in the Dutch Grand Prix was ""a very tough outcome"", but that the Scuderia ""don't need to have extra motivation for Monza"" this weekend.

Both Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc's races at the Zandvoort Circuit on Sunday came to an abrupt end at the banked Turn 3 following crashes, leaving Ferrari point-less in the first race back after the summer break.

Hamilton retired after losing control of his car over the painted advertising as light rain fell before hitting the barrier on the outside of the circuit.

""I think he was just a bit wider than the previous lap and probably with the drizzle that we had at this stage the track was a bit damp. He lost the car,"" said Vasseur on Hamilton's incident.

The Briton was also handed a five-place grid penalty for the Italian Grand Prix this weekend after a yellow flag infringement on reconnaissance laps to the grid at Zandvoort.

Leclerc's race ended after contact from behind by Kimi Antonelli, the Mercedes rookie handed a 10-second penalty for the incident on Lap 52.

Leclerc had also been placed under investigation for contact with the second Mercedes of George Russell earlier in the race after an audacious overtake at Turn 11/12, with the stewards eventually deeming that no further action would be taken.

Vasseur agreed that it was a racing incident and was encouraged by the team's pace despite the overall outcome, especially after a difficult Friday where both cars were off the pace.

""The race pace today was good, we overtook two times George on track, we were catching up on Max [Verstappen in third] and score zero at the end,"" he said.

""It's a very tough outcome for the team because for the championship and even for the approach of Monza it's not the best one. But for sure if we want to do better a job, we have to do a much better Friday.

""For sure it's not the best preparation but on the other hand we don't need to have extra motivation for Monza.

""Everybody will push. What we have to do for sure is a much better Friday to put us in a better shape for the Quali and for the race because when you start behind you have to overtake, you have to take risk.""

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Max Verstappen put in another strong display at the Dutch Grand Prix to finish in second place, but admitted Red Bull's limitations were on full display at Zandvoort.

Max Verstappen had “hoped for a little bit more” from the Dutch Grand Prix and conceded that Red Bull's limitations were “very obvious” despite finishing second at Zandvoort.

Verstappen continued his streak of always finishing inside the top two positions at his home race after a late reliability problem for championship-chasing Lando Norris promoted the Dutchman onto the second step of the podium.

Although satisfied with the outcome, Verstappen reflected that the flow of the race highlighted areas of weakness with the RB21.

“We take it,” said Verstappen. “Qualifying on Saturday was good. I hoped for a little bit more in the race, but quite quickly I realised that the pace was not there. It always seems like in the race, we just seem to struggle more than over one lap, just with the tyre behaviour with the car, and that was very obvious again.

“I just tried to manage my pace, but that basically meant that it was more of a fight with the cars behind me than whatever was happening in front of me.”

Verstappen had made a strong start to the race, running side-by-side with Norris around the first two corners, before managing to recover a wild slide into Turn 3 to gain the position.

“There is always a lot of sand in that corner from the middle of the track to the edge, but with the softer compound, I pushed the entry,” he said. “Then I went a bit sideways heading into Turn 3, but it was all okay.”

Asked how confident he had been of keeping McLaren driver Norris behind, Verstappen added: “Not at all, but I still want to have a bit of fun out there.

“When I got ahead, I just followed my pace, and that meant that at one point, Lando got ahead again. You could see that [the McLaren] was a different league, so there is no point ruining your own race trying to defend really hard or trying to lose two or three laps defending for your life. There is, unfortunately, no point in that.”

Meanwhile, in positive news for Red Bull, Verstappen's team mate Tsunoda returned to the points for this first time since Imola, with a P9 finish at Zandvoort.

Unruly, undigital, and fiercely communal — the Gallagher Bros.' U.S. swing is everything our techno-entertainment world isn't. Which is exactly why we need them.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	In September 1996, early in a misbegotten youth — though not nearly as misbegotten, I should say for the record, as Liam Gallagher‘s — my friend Gary and I attended an Oasis concert at Jones Beach, on Long Island.


	We didn't know it at the time, but the now-iconic “What's The Story (Morning Glory)?” tour, which had just arrived in the U.S. after record-breaking crowds in the U.K., was about to come to a crashing halt when Liam would leave the band a few days later in a(nother) fit of petulance. That night we just blissfully rocked out to live renditions of the record that had been playing everywhere the previous year —  everywhere we went, anyway. Years ahead of Google — and decades before TikTok — we basked in the discovery of this strange, snarling British rock that wasn't much on the radio but lived in every scratch of our CDs, and minds.

					Oasis Fan Dies After Falling During Concert at London's Wembley Stadium		
			









	Gary passed away in a paddleboarding accident exactly two decades later, some 10 miles west of Jones Beach. And while I'm hardly a woo woo reincarnation type, I found myself looking up into the Eastern Seaboard sky Sunday night as I listened to Oasis playing those songs with an almost impeccable similarity to that evening 29 years ago. I imagined that Gary's spirit was up there, and that, with his trademark giant goofy grin and booming voice, he was bopping along to “Wonderwall,” “Champagne Supernova,” “Some Might Say” — and, during a number that brought me a smile more faithful than ironic, “Live Forever.” In fact, I was sure of it. If the Gallagher Bros. had somehow bent every rule of nature to join hands and perform on the same stage after all their epochal fights, was it really so crazy to think that Gary and the others we lost along the way had pulled a supernatural trick of their own to tune in to the bad boys of Britpop one more time?

	But it wasn't just the thought of an afterlife that filled me — and, dare I say, the 60,000 other people who packed Met Life Stadium Sunday — with a jolt of spiritual energy. (The band gives another performance there Monday, then closes out its three-city U.S. run with a pair of gigs at the Rose Bowl next weekend.) It was the sheer messy humanity of every distorted guitar, soaring falsetto, driving drum and swaggering piece of banter — the simple idea that the Gallagher Bros. had even gotten here to do this, coupled with what they were doing and how it seemed to be making every person in that stadium feel.


	If you read any music press, you've already seen the Oasis Live '25 reviews, from Cardiff and Wembley and Toronto and Chicago. You don't need one more wide-eyed entertainment journalist to give you one more rave about how tightly they performed, how timeless they sounded, how terminally weird Liam was. (But seriously, he was weird. He yelled New Jersey for no apparent reason several times between numbers and at another point mid-song tried to balance a tambourine and maraca on his head simultaneously while the rest of the band ground away. Crucially, though, he never disappeared — in fact he kept re-appearing, popping up from out of nowhere after the few seconds the lights went dark following a Noel song.)


	What may not have come up as often in those reviews is what the band is doing beneath the surface —  what was coming across subtextually even in lesser-known hits like “Little By Little” and “Acquiesce” and “Whatever” — and, more important, the sense of possibility that subtext was evoking. This was a deeply human experience at a time, with its seething algorithmic outrage and a dawning AI, when we seem in danger of losing that humanity.

	











	A handful of lyrics sung Sunday preach a kind of get-along connection — “Don't Look Back In Anger,” most prominently, but also “Because we need each other, we believe in one another” from “Acquiesce,” “All my people right here right now,” from “D' You Know What I Mean”  and “Two of a kind, we'll find a way,” from “Slide Away.”  But it wasn't what the artists were saying as much as how they were saying it. The Gallaghers are known for what has affectionately been called the largest pub singalong in the world, and that seemed true in spades Sunday, as the whole crowd often seemed to be taking the stage with them, howling and playing along with every note. And what could be more analogue-ishly human than people singing in a pub?


	Even the fact that Oasis had chosen to play pretty much the exact same 23-song setlist on every tour stop so far in its five U.K. cities and now apparently five North American ones seemed like a distinctly human choice; an AI surely would have been trained to shuffle them up. (Everyone knowing what came next also helped the singalong part.)


	Oasis first arrived at a mid-'90s moment not long before tech changed everything. We were still discovering songs because human radio programmers (or just human friends) wanted us to, not a streaming algorithm served them to us. We connected with fellow music lovers by hanging out in venue parking lots or ragtag Web message boards, not because a digital hyperloop had kept sending us to people who liked the same bands. (Try explaining social media to fans at a show in 1995.) And it was actually possible for acts affiliated only with small independent labels to change the culture; Oasis, after all, was on one of them.

	











	At least publicly, the Gallaghers have often been dormant on these issues throughout much of the past quarter-century — not out of apathy but for the same reasons as many of us, too caught in their own personal drama to take much notice how technology was redefining everything around them. But the change has been drastic. It would have been weird back in Oasis' heyday to talk about a big stadium-rock show being uniquely “human” — what the hell else could it be? But after decades of music chosen by algorithm, of the spirit of listen-together radio fracturing into a million personalized streams, of social media and the politics that fuel it ordering acts into groups of the allowed and prohibited, of autotuning and overdubbing washing out raw instruments, of our current cultural era's spell of phone-zombification, of the communal spaces of record stores disbanded as a mainstream notion of gathering, well, it's not such a given anymore. Thousands of people convening under the sky to hear a few talented fellow humans break their backs with a bunch of instruments, that oldest of entertainment constructs, now also feels like a radical one. 


	And so the band that once represented all that was lost was coming back at exactly the moment we needed them, like a superhero responding to a Bat Signal, complete with the same dark clothing and unfussy scowls. Music now is about to change again, generated by AI, personalized by machines, owned by hedge funds and optimized for marketing power. The Gallaghers seemed to be coming just in time, to remind us of what it was like before — to issue a gentle caveat, by the power of positive suggestion, that we should think twice before plunging further into the abyss. To warn that human-made art is fragile and too easily undone — in fact in their case for 16 years it was undone — by its embodiments acting too much like petty, well, humans. And the true feat, the band was saying triumphantly Sunday, is that there is a way to hold it together.

	











	The show was nostalgic, but not for its own sake. We were going back to all they did in the 1990's precisely because Oasis had always understood better than many stadium acts what we really wanted from a modern show of that British type and scale — none of the polish of Coldplay, the pro forma hit-churning of The Stones or even the calculated gloom of The Cure, just the genuine working-class rawness and plain-old unpredictability that the Gallaghers brought. Half the fun of Oasis shows have been not just not knowing what Liam would do next but realizing that he didn't know what he was going to do next either, and does it get any more beautifully, unpredictably, messily human than that?


	A family of four from Baltimore was sitting in front of me — 40-ish parents, son and daughter both under 12 — and the kids came to life especially during “Live Forever,” the girl's blond ponytail bobbing to every groove as she mouthed the words to that anthemic hook of a chorus. That clinched it: the experience of this organic human connection was enough for even a kid, born not only in an era of very different music from Oasis but from a whole different way of experiencing and discovering music, to spot and seek out. Oasis didn't invent the modern large-scale stadium show, but they sure seem to be perfecting it. And if it was so clear to a young girl with a minimum of parental prodding that this experience beat the hell out of sitting in a lonely room staring at a screen, why wasn't it clearer to the conglomerate machine that keeps thrashing us with it?

	











	Most stadium shows and summer festivals of course contain heavy doses of this — the Eras Tour, for all its social-media facilitation and Ticketmaster chaos, was at heart the same wonderfully elemental human experience — and Oasis is continuing this rich tradition while perhaps offering, given both how the band came up and how tenuous and unlikely getting to this moment even was, an especially non-algorithmic example of it.


	The band itself seemed aware of what their presence meant too. Oasis has always worn their grassroots anti-system stances lightly but not without consciousness. As Liam recalled from the stage Sunday night, Big-Label executives had kept telling the brothers, “'You gotta play the game or you're chopped liver.'” Then Liam added, with no small amount of glee, “But we're standing in front of you beautiful people in this magnificent stadium. So you don't have to play the game.”


	My companion at the show, upon hearing my proposition about Oasis returning at just right the right moment, wondered if it's just a blip — how many other bands can position themselves against the machine and also evince such humanity, and even if they could, could they stop the tide of automation and atomization and hologramization that I fear is about to engulf so much of our entertainment business? I said I genuinely wasn't sure.


	I'd like to think that, after a summer of people getting together in movie theaters to laugh their heads silly at The Naked Gun, dance their butts off in bars to the wry raunch of “Manchild” and grab their seatmate in shrieking delight at the latest crazy turn in “Weapons,” this was not an anomaly — that Oasis '25 is just the largest-scale demonstration this season of what Americans have been consistently telling entertainment companies for a while now: We like feeling wildly human emotions, and we like feeling them together.

	











	That while there's a place for streaming shows algorithmically chosen just for us, and maybe even for the more individualized custom content made by AI that is about to sweep over us, it is not, Wall Street expectations and Big Tech machinations aside, the only driver of our entertainment interest, and perhaps not even the main one.


	Sure, it was the summer of The Velvet Sundown, that ridiculous expression of (or meta-comment on) music's automated future. But we were also, it seems to me, talking about streaming shows a little less and leaning in to communal experiences a little more, resisting the algorithms with just a tad extra vigor and opening our minds with small amounts of added gusto. With its on-the-edge moments that thrillingly always seemed in danger of going awry but miraculously never did, the Oasis show reflected these machine-agnostic impulses most explicitly — and reassuringly. As the maverick Severance actress Britt Lower told THR several weeks ago, “Whenever I think about the way I feel watching someone walk across a tightrope, I don't feel nervous about AI.”


	As Oasis ended the performance with (what else) “Champagne Supernova,” the night came to a head not just musically but ideologically. “You and I will live and die, the world still spinning 'round, we don't know why,” Liam yawped, in a lyric that carries just a little extra freight amid the apocalyptic vibes of 2025 than it did among the end-of-history bliss of 1995.


	Oasis didn't have many answers; they never do. But they asked questions that only people who had lived as hard and felt as deep as they did could — asked questions that a machine that had done none of those things never would. As the band sent a bunch of fireworks upward in an old-school finish, the sky in its own supernova somewhere between July 4 and The Natural, everyone in the stadium looked at each other, re-emerging from the musical hypnosis of the previous two hours in a state of ecstasy, with motive to chase the feeling anew. The spirit of your late friend doesn't hover over a Netflix show.

Noah Baumbach, Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Patrick Wilson and Nicholas Britell discussed their film, which had its North American premiere in the Rockies, with The Hollywood Reporter's Scott Feinberg.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	Due to illness, George Clooney couldn't make it to this year's Telluride Film Festival for the North American premiere of Jay Kelly, a film that centers on a movie star (Clooney) who experiences an existential crisis that prompts him to take a spur-of-the-moment trip to Europe to see his daughter and accept a career tribute from a film festival, and his “team,” who are expected to drop everything to support him. But a large coterie of Clooney's collaborators on the film were in town — among them co-writer/director Noah Baumbach, actors Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson, and composer Nicholas Britell — and basked in the warm reception and awards chatter that greeted the Netflix title at its four festival screenings, two of which followed career tributes to Baumbach.

	On Sunday, following one of those screenings, I sat down with the aforementioned group for a wide-ranging Q&A. We discussed why Baumbach and Emily Mortimer wrote the part of Kelly with Clooney in mind, and why it was a gutsy decision for the A-lister to agree to take it on; what Sandler drew upon to formulate his portrayal of Kelly's manager, Ron, for which the Sand-man is receiving some of the best reviews of his career and looks like a strong bet to land his first Oscar nom; how Crudup, who plays a former acting school classmate of Kelly's, Timothy, prepared for his brief but complex scene in the film, which elicited mid-movie applause at every screening; plus more.

	A transcript of the conversation, lightly edited for clarity and brevity, appears below.


	* * *


Noah, what was the root of the idea for this film, which you co-wrote with Emily Mortimer? Also, some might wonder: why center it on a famous movie star rather than, say, a famous writer-director who also occasionally receives career tributes of his own?


BAUMBACH Well, we needed some barrier. [laughs] I don't know, I found it compelling, this notion of a movie star who has some kind of crisis and goes on a journey — an actual journey into the world, and also a journey into himself. I had a bunch of ideas, and I didn't know quite what to do with all of them, and I was talking to Emily about it. She asked all the right questions, and then, just on a whim, I was like, “Do you want to do this with me? If it goes south, we can always just stop.” But it was such a great collaboration. It was a year or so that we really just worked on and shaped the movie.


My understanding is that you two wrote it with George in mind for the title role, which begs the question: what would you have done if George had said no? I can understand why he might have: Jay Kelly, like George, is an actor from Kentucky, often described as the last “real” movie star, and shares a number of other things in common with him — but Jay also has some attributes that aren't great, and some people might assume that Jay is George.


BAUMBACH Well, not to mention what he would have to do in the movie. I mean, it's a character who's running from himself, and he's very good at deflecting and hiding, but as we see in the movie, these memories come at him. We described the memories as “headwinds.” The actor who was playing Jay Kelly had to then start to reveal more of himself, which requires vulnerability. But George said yes within 24 hours, and I knew immediately, when he said yes, that he was going to be amazing, because he knew what was in front of him and what he was going to have to do. To answer your other question, I don't know [what we would have done if George had said no]. I think we wouldn't have made the movie. The audience needed to have a history with the actor playing Jay Kelly, the same way the people in the movie have a relationship with Jay Kelly. What George does, as he starts to reveal more and more, is just beautiful to watch.

	











There's another actor in this film who we've known and loved for decades — actually several — and not all of this guy's movies have gotten the critical respect that Jay Kelly is getting, but he's brought a lot of people a lot of joy over a lot of years—


SANDLER Patrick Wilson! [laughs]


But I'm not sure that he has gotten the credit that he deserves for stretching himself as much as he has in films like Punch-Drunk Love, Spanglish, Reign Over Me, Noah's film The Meyerowitz Stories, Uncut Gems and Hustle. Noah, for the part of Ron, why did you go back to Adam Sandler?


BAUMBACH Adam and I fell in love with each other on The Meyerowitz Stories — we became very close; our families are close and love each other; and my son, Rohmer, who's here, basically lives at Adam's house half the year. The character of Ron, I wrote for Adam — even though you might think that Adam is more like Jay Kelly [because he's a movie star] — because of the way Adam is in the world, with his heart and his generosity and his loyalty. The people who work with him have been with him since the beginning, and the way he is with his family is so beautiful. I felt like, “Well, that's what Ron is like, and Adam, in a way, could play something that is close to him, but in disguise.” That was really exciting to me, and also a way to pay tribute to the Adam I know and love.


SANDLER That's beautiful. Thank you.


Adam, I'd love to hear what your reaction was when you saw what Noah had written for you. But also, having been in the business for as long as you have, you've had an up-close view of the actor/manager relationship, with all of its friend/employee complexities, and I wondered if that particularly informed the way you approached this guy?












SANDLER First of all, thank you to Noah for this part — Noah, you're a great man, and all of us thank you. What a guy he is. He writes the most beautiful lines, and we get to say them, so thank you. Yes, over the years I've had a team, similar to Jay Kelly. I have a manager; I have a publicist; I have an agent; I have my makeup girl, Anne — she's not here tonight, but imagine being her! Imagine every morning going, “What the fuck can I do?!” But I really loved being this guy who just loves his client and feels that they're in it together — he feels the same successes, and when something goes wrong he feels the same pain. My team feels that way also. When things go wrong, they are definitely shook up. When we have a nice moment, they're as excited as I am. So I connected with my guy, absolutely.


Adam, as Noah alluded to, you've been exceptionally the opposite of Jay Kelly, in terms of casting people that you've known forever in your films and being very present with your family — I think your whole family was in Happy Gilmore 2 earlier this year! But even with that being the case, has being part of this movie, watching it and thinking about it, made you look at your role as a movie star, or movie stardom in general, any differently than you had before?


SANDLER I think what the movie is saying is that not just movie stars, but anybody who wants to do their best, has to put time in to their work, and when you do that, you are away from your family, and you know your family's still going on, and you want to get to them. I definitely have schlepped my family all over the world wherever I go, but there are times when they can't come. Jay Kelly not getting to be with his family, and looking back and knowing how painful it was for them, is crushing. Even though I'm with my family a lot, I still have moments where it kills me being away. We all do.

	











Another person who has some history with Noah — namely, the movie Marriage Story, for which she won an Academy Award — is Laura Dern. Laura, similar to Adam, you've been at the highest levels of this business for so many years. Has this film made you think differently about stardom?


DERN What I love — and Adam spoke so eloquently to it — is the question of the cost of any of our journeys in life, what we might miss. So before Jay Kelly can get to, “I want another one,” there's the cost for Ron, what he's lost in life by being of service to Jay. And so my character [Kelly's publicist] is helping Ron's journey of getting to the place where he's also willing to get off the train. And getting to stare into the eyes and work with the face that Anne gets to make up every day was the dream of my life!


SANDLER We had fun.


DERN And being back with Noah was a dream because he creates a home, makes you feel the safest you've ever been, and gifts you with these people you get to dive right into, even if they're the very people you've been surrounded by your whole life. I, too, have had the good fortune of being surrounded by publicists.


Billy, it seems to me like your assignment must have fet very daunting: you have to come in and, in a relatively short amount of time, provide the motivation for Jay's existential crisis. You crushed the Method acting scene. Can you share how you prepared for it, and if that process was any different from the process that you use when, as is often the case, you are the guy who's at the center of a project?












CRUDUP Well, thank you. What a gift it was to have Noah come to me with this composition. You have to understand, I've been in New York for over 30 years now, and Noah is a fixture of the independent cinema scene there, and every one of my friends has worked with him at some point or another. I was desperate to be in one of Noah's movies — I was ready for anything — and then I read this and I was like, “Dude, that's a very hard thing to do! Something I'm not exactly sure how to do. And it seems like the rest of your movie is predicated on that being successful.” [laughs] So, “Are you sure?” was really my question to him, and we had a lot of conversations. Most of my friends are actors, and result-oriented acting — where you just think, “Oh, this is the scene where my character cries” — is anathema to everything that we do. I thought, “That's going to be a problem.” Noah was very considerate and understanding that I was desperate to work with him, but that I really did not know how to pull this off. I had a whole other version that I had written down to try, and Noah entertained me. Then, about two or three weeks before we were going to shoot this scene, I noticed that the scene hadn't changed at all, and that I was going to have to figure out some solution. So I started doing research on Method acting, and sure enough, Noah had constructed this scene in such a way that the scene actually plays itself, it leads you in the right direction. That's a great writer. I don't know how many takes we did, but it was probably over 50 on both sides — and there wasn't a second of it that I wasn't in absolute heaven.

	











Patrick, your character, Ben Alcock, another movie star and client of Ron's, is the antithesis of Jay Kelly in a number of ways. I wonder if you can talk about that, and specifically about the very memorable scene that you shared with Mr. Sandler.


WILSON I only have two scenes, and I knew nothing about the rest of the script — I mean nothing — until I saw the movie this morning. And Ben didn't know anything, nor did he need to know anything, so that was an interesting exercise for me, but a glorious one, because the words that I had been given said everything that I needed to know. The scene with George on the side of the road said so much about Ben's family, his values and how he views his own career. And the scene with Adam? Just working with Adam has been this crazy dream of mine, because I don't live in the comedy space. It was a double-whammy for me to work with Adam and Noah, two people that I revere so much. It can make you feel uncomfortable when you're only coming in for a couple of days, but I was given such support by Noah and the crew. And then Adam, you were just so glorious on that day, and made me feel so comfortable. We did 30 different versions with shit flying off the table, and I was looking across the table at this guy who was wiped out every single take. I knew I just had to react and be open. I've never had a scene like that. I did have to fire an agent once years ago, but it wasn't like that! [laughs] Anyway, I just love your [Adam's] work, and I love your work in this movie. 

	











We are going to close with the great composer Nicholas Britell, who everyone knows from the theme of Succession, the scores of Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk and Don't Look Up, and so much else. Nick, I was fascinated to learn that on this project, perhaps unlike any other on which you've worked, your music was in place before some of the scenes were even shot.


BRITELL It's true. This was something that I'd never done before, getting involved in a project so early. Noah and I met over two years ago, and from the script stage he and I had amazing conversations, and I started trying to imagine the feeling that the movie might have. Then I wrote three of the four main themes of the movie, and Noah invited me to come to Tuscany, and we actually played the music on set for everybody. It was such a special thing for me to sort of absorb the atmosphere. And it was important, I think, for everybody, sort of like osmosis — you feel the world that you're going to be a part of creating. I just had a blast from start to finish.

The ""Mandy"" singer played 15 sold-out farewell dates at London's Palladium in 2024.


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



	Little over a year since his farewell concerts in the U.K. in June 2024, Barry Manilow has performed a u-turn and announced a new run of Last Last run of concerts for 2026.


	The “Copacabana” singer will return to U.K. for a six-night tour that takes in arenas in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Cardiff, Birmingham and London (June 9-17, 2026). Tickets go on sale on Sep. 5 at 10 a.m. local time. See the full run of dates below.


	Manilow played 15 sold-out concerts at the London Palladium in May and June 2024, and has performed a number of “final” concerts in U.S. cities throughout 2025 including Boston, Philadelphia, Oakland and Sacramento. He hosts a regular residency in Las Vegas, which continues through 2026.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Speaking on the news of his return to the U.K., Manilow shared a statement outlining his decision to return to the U.K.


	He wrote, “I swear, I SWEAR I really meant it when I said goodbye to everyone in the UK on the last night of our fantastic run at the great London Palladium. The audiences there were fantastic as usual and that last night was very moving, knowing that I wouldn't be seeing my U.K. friends anymore.”




	The 82-year-old continued, “It was odd flying home because I wasn't tired, my voice had held up for the entire run and each show was more exciting than the last. I wasn't even out of breath at the end of each show. But I guess ‘leave ‘em wanting more' was a good rule to follow. After all, I'm 100-years-old and any day now I'm probably going to lose my hair, gain a big pot belly and need a cane to dance around to ‘Copacabana.'”


	“But, as of now I can still run around the stage, I can still hit the high F Natural at the end of ‘Even Now' and I still look fabulous! But I said goodbye and I meant it. Sort of. There was just one thing. I don't wanna say goodbye! So we're coming back. We're going to have a great, big Barry Manilow concert! Hope you all come. We'll have a ball! Love, Barry”


	During his extensive career, Manilow has earned 13 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, including “I Write the Songs,” “Looks Like We Made It” and “Mandy.” All three of those songs also topped the Hot 100. He released his most recent studio album Night Songs II in February 2020.

The pop group sparked reunion rumors earlier in the day on social media.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Fifth Harmony is officially back.


	On Sunday (Aug. 31), the girl group — now made up of Ally Brooke, Normani, Lauren Jauregui and Dinah Jane, following Camila Cabello's 2016 exit — reunited on stage for the first time in seven years. The surprise moment happened during the Jonas Brothers' JONAS20: Greetings from Your Hometown tour stop at the Dos Equis Pavilion in Dallas.


	Dressed in all-black outfits, the four-piece performed their 2015 hit “Worth It,” which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The performance was streamed live on Samsung TV Plus.


	“Y'all remember Fifth Harmony,” Normani told the crowd.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The group later posted a video of the reunion on Instagram, writing, “Where were you on August 31, 2025? Thank you @jonasbrothers for having us. Felt amazing to be back.”


	“That was special!” Brooke wrote in the comments. Cabello, who left the group in late 2016, also showed her support in the comments by appropriately sharing four red heart emojis.


	The Jonas Brothers also showed love, sharing a clip on Instagram of the performance and writing, “An honor to have our friends @fifthharmony up on stage tonight in Dallas on the Greetings From Your Hometown Tour.”




	Fans had already been speculating something big was coming after Fifth Harmony's official X account posted for the first time in seven years earlier that day.


	“#FifthHarmonyFollowSpree,” the group wrote, marking their first post on the platform since July 2018.


	Reunion rumors have been floating around for months. Back in March, Brooke and Jane teased the idea during an interview at the 2024 Billboard Women in Music event.


	“We'll see… we're not sure,” Brooke said when asked about a reunion. Jane added, “I love that our fans can reminisce on such good times and I love that we're getting the credit again. Our music was very impactful at the time and I feel like it was kind of overlooked, to be honest. So now that it's reviving again on its own it just shows our music speaks for itself.”


	Fifth Harmony first came together on the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor in 2012 and found success with their debut album, Reflection, and hits like “Worth It” and “Work From Home” (featuring Ty Dolla $ign), the latter of which hit No. 4 on the Hot 100 in 2016.


	Fifth Harmony eventually went on hiatus in 2018 to focus on solo projects. Since then, each member has explored their own path, but as Brooke hinted in a 2023 interview with Billboard, the door to a reunion has always been open.


	“We're women now and we have grown so much and we have done our own thing, gone our own ways and gone our own path. And now we're together in a different light,” the singer said. “I'm trying to reunite with them, so I think some sort of reunion may happen.”

Not sure if I am going to watch this, but it does remind me to start drinking Guinness again, so I guess, Mission Accomplished?

Very creative and original! I've yet to see any dramas about families with dark secrets recently so this takes the cake!

Monica Barbaro brought effortless charm to the Venice International Film Festival. Even with all eyes on her, she maintained calm composure under the spotlight when an unexpected gust of wind briefly ruffled her Dior gown. On Friday, August 29, the Oscar-nominated actress, 35, arrived at the premiere of her boyfriend Andrew Garfield's new film, “After the Hunt,” when a sudden gust of wind caused her Dior gown to billow.

When a sudden gust lifted the pleated overlay of her black Christian Dior gown, the fabric ballooned dramatically before Barbaro swiftly pressed it back into place. Thanks to the slip she wore underneath, she remained fully covered, though the moment briefly caught her off guard.

A post shared by CinemaBlend (@cinemablend)

She quickly laughed it off, brushing her hair from her face and striking new poses for photographers as if nothing had happened. Cinema Blend later shared footage of the lighthearted mishap.

Despite the windy mishap, Barbaro's Dior gown still turned heads on the Venice red carpet. The elegant black dress featured a high neckline, drop waist, and two chic bow accents, including one that draped across her back. She kept the styling classic with minimal glam, sparkling earrings, and a single ring.

Barbaro walked the carpet solo, giving Garfield his moment in the spotlight as the star of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt”.

The wardrobe mishap wasn't the only moment fans were buzzing about. The actress was also photographed holding hands with Garfield upon their arrival in Venice earlier that day, further fueling buzz around their relationship.

Barbaro, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Joan Baez in “A Complete Unknown,” has been linked to Garfield since February. The couple has been spotted at several events, including Wimbledon in July, though they have not publicly confirmed their romance.

Her Venice appearance adds to a streak of memorable fashion moments, including her Met Gala debut earlier this year, where she wore a Dior recreation of a 1947 New Look design, paired with black gloves and a boater hat.

Barbaro, 35, and Garfield, 42, have been linked since February 2025, when a source told People magazine the couple was “spending time together quietly” after fans spotted them at a London play.

Although the two have not publicly confirmed their romance, Garfield said in a 2024 Esquire interview that he “won't ever speak about or confirm or deny anything about my personal life with anyone, ever”, they have continued to be photographed together at events throughout the year.

Congressman Drew Cain is constantly lurking in some of Port Charles‘ finest establishments, figuring out which resident to manipulate next. Nearly every single bad thing that has happened within the last year can be directly attributed to Drew's machinations. At any given point in time, “General Hospital” will have at least a few villains on the canvas, but for some reason, Drew Cain feels like the most evil of all. That is likely because he directly uses children both to accomplish his goals and as disposable collateral damage.

No one knows this better than Willow Tait, who dumped him at the altar after realizing that he is the reason she has lost so much. Her children, her ex-husband, Michael, her friends, and her home are all gone because Willow trusted Drew. For a hot second, it seemed as though Willow had learned her lesson, but her twisted logic is back again. Now, Willow believes that Drew can get her custody of Wylie and Amelia.

Elizabeth helped to literally pick Willow up off her face when she refused to marry Drew. When Willow realized that she no longer had a home, Liz took her in. When Willow screwed up at work, Liz, as her boss, made sure she would be okay. She has been one of the few people to show Willow any empathy, and she has tried to guide her towards stability. After all, Willow will need to be rock-solid to secure any visitation with her kids.

Instead of staying the course for a few months and proving that Drew guided every misstep she had made, Willow has decided to take a detour. She told Liz that she is getting back together with Drew because he is so powerful. Liz had the same reaction as GH's viewers. If he were so powerful, he wouldn't have cost you your kids in the first place! If he could have made good on all of his original promises, he would have, because winning Willow was the ultimate spite move against Michael.

Willow's rationale in believing that Drew will help her now is more than a little off base. She explained to Liz that when she traveled to see Michael in the German clinic, it was actually Drew who prevented their visit. He had bribed the woman at the front desk to tell her that Michael didn't want to see her. In Willow's mind, Drew's ability to manipulate an older woman on the other side of an ocean equals power. 

Liz pointed out that this single event may be the absolute worst thing that Drew has done, because it prevented Willow and Michael's reconciliation, but it was lost on Willow. She believes that she is smarter now because if she chooses to deal with Drew, she knows exactly who he is. That may be true, but Willow still seems blind to the fact that the congressman really doesn't seem to get what he is usually after. That is a big part of why he has become so dangerous.

Check out the “General Hospital” clip with Willow and Liz's conversation about Drew below!

Fifth Harmony reunited last night to make a surprise guest appearance at a Jonas Brothers concert, validating longstanding rumors that the group was set to make a return. Camila Cabello, who left the band in 2016, was, as expected, not part of the reunion, but Normani, Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke, and Dinah Jane linked up to play “Worth It” and “Work From Home.” Watch fan footage of the whole appearance below, as well as a clip on Fifth Harmony's social media.

Fifth Harmony went on hiatus in 2018, a few months after releasing their self-titled album. Normani, of course, embarked on what seemed to be a promising solo career—her debut album, Dopamine, arrived last year—and her bandmates Brooke and Jane sparked reunion hopes by collaborating on a cover of “Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas” in 2023. The band apparently made progress on reunion talks this year, with dates mooted for 2026. Though that remains unconfirmed, the band has released merch reading “Where were you on August 31, 2025?” with a new Fifth Harmony logo, suggesting more activity may be imminent.

	We finally have our first glimpse of Lady Gaga in Wednesday. Netflix shared an image of the pop star as Rosaline Rotwood, teasing it with the caption “A vision in venom.”


	The photograph shows Gaga dressed in an ethereal white gown with long white-blonde hair and eyebrows. She's joined in the image by Thing, seated on her shoulder. Netflix previously described Rosaline as “a legendary Nevermore teacher who crosses paths with Wednesday.”


	Lady Gaga's mysterious character will appear in the second half of Tim Burton‘s Wednesday, which premieres Sept. 3. The singer will debut a new song, “The Dead Dance,” alongside the new episodes. During an event promoting the show with star Jenna Ortega, she told the crowd, “I had a wonderful time working on Wednesday Season Two, even just being a small part of the show. I loved working with Tim Burton and Jenna and everyone here, it's so incredible. Thank you. I'm also here to confirm my song ‘The Dead Dance' is coming.”

Wednesday Season Two, Part Two will also feature the return of Gwendoline Christie's Principal Weems, who died in Season One. A teaser for the episodes showcases Weems as Wednesday's new “spirit guide.” A synopsis of Part Two notes, “Desperate to avert her prophecy and save Enid's life, Wednesday reopens a dark chapter in her family's history — with direct ties to Tyler.”

New cast members include Steve Buscemi, Billie Piper, Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, and Noah Taylor.

	











Variety originally reported last year that Lady Gaga would make a cameo appearance when the series made its return. It was reported that producers were aiming for Gaga to join the show in a larger capacity, but ultimately settled for a more limited appearance.

	Those still feeling the void of Succession may find solace in forthcoming Netflix series House of Guinness. The show, created and written by Steven Knight, centers on the legacy of the Guinness family in the 19th century.


	A trailer for the series teases the battle for power amongst the four children of beer magnate Sir Benjamin Guinness after his death. It stars Disclaimer actor (and famed Olivia Rodrigo boyfriend) Louis Partridge as Edward Guinness, Anthony Boyle as Arthur Guinness, Emily Fairn as Anne Plunket (née Guinness), and Fionn O'Shea as Benjamin Guinness.


	A synopsis notes, “Set in 19th-century Dublin and New York, the story begins immediately after the death of Sir Benjamin Guinness, the man responsible for the extraordinary success of the Guinness brewery, and the far-reaching impact of his will on the fate of his four adult children, Arthur, Edward, Anne, and Ben, as well as on a group of Dublin characters who work and interact with the phenomenon that is Guinness.”

	











House of Guinness was directed by Tom Shankland and Mounia Akl, and also stars James Norton, Jack Gleeson, Dervla Kirwan, and Niamh McCormack. The eight-episode series premieres on Netflix on Sept. 25.

	Knight was recently announced as the screenwriter of the next James Bond film. The spy flick, to be helmed by director Denis Villeneuve, will be the first in the franchise for Amazon MGM Studios. “It has always been on my bucket list, and it's fantastic to be invited to do it,” Knight said of the opportunity in a statement. “I can't wait to get started.”

	











	The screenwriter is also working on a new film that is being made in conjunction with Oasis' ongoing reunion tour. The film is being created and produced by Knight and directed by Dylan Southern and Will Lovelace, who were responsible for LCD Soundsystem's 2012 concert film Shut Up and Play the Hits. The Oasis Live ‘25 movie does not currently have a title or a release date, and no specifics have been confirmed about its format or whether it's even considered a documentary. A press release in March noted, “No further details regarding the content of the film will be released at this moment in time.”

‘We hear footsteps going round my bed'

Most Haunted is a TV show that used to scare me when I saw it in the TV guide magazines, until you grow up and realise that Derek Acorah is comedy gold and Yvette Fielding is a TV presenter who was good at scaring Girls Aloud around Welsh castles than she was at doing anything actually paranormal. It's pretty widely accepted by anyone with a crumb of common sense that the show exaggerated a lot of its supposed paranormal phenomena, but now in a new interview the show's resident historian confessed that Most Haunted was fake a lot of the time. But Most Haunted historian Richard Felix, who worked on the show for its first six seasons, confessed that one occurrence in particular was not faked and it still haunts him to this day.

Richard Felix was interviewed in a TikTok recently in Derby jail – and was asked about his scariest experience on Most Haunted. Felix said “It's got to be cabin 340.” This is referring to cabin B340 on the Queen Mary ship – which now lies as a hotel and museum in Los Angeles permanently docked. It's frequently spoken about by believers as one of the most haunted ships in the world.

Felix continues “We're on Queen Mary for three weeks, and there's a very haunted cabin. Both David Wells and Derek [Acorah] came up with the same account that some child was smashed against the wall by the father and murdered in cabin 340. It's so haunted that they've stopped using it as a room, it's a hotel. They're losing money by not having people stay in 340.

“We've been on there for over two weeks, and I'm thinking ‘come on guys, you're supposed to know this ghost business, surely someone should be staying the night in cabin 340′”. Richard Felix then explains how it was he himself who was the one to stay in the room.

“They sorted it out, they got a rickety old bed made up. No carpet. Rickety old table. Toilet and bathroom didn't work. It took me til about half one before the security guy come and let me in, and by that time I'd had considerable numbers of quite large glasses of whiskey.

“About half past four in the morning there's this crescendo of noise in the cabin. It was metallic, it was as if someone had got a huge bundle of metal coat hangers and bounced them from wall to wall. The noise… bloody hell. It was in the cabin. It woke me up. I should have got up and gone back to my own cabin where my wife was, but I didn't.

“Ciaran O'Keeffe got his laptop filming me in bed, so I stayed there and went back to sleep. Everyone was told about it, because we've got it on film. We get back to England and we're watching footage in the edit room and we get all this footage of the noise – great stuff. But then, we hear footsteps going around my bed. And a voice that twice goes ‘mummy'. You ought to have heard Yvette scream.”

The lore of the Queen Mary has long rumoured various happenings in cabin B340 – but none have been substantiated and the records maintain that no murder occurred in there. Including another urban legend of a man who murdered two women in the cabin, and when police entered the room they found his violently dismembered body.

Felix then admits “I know that everything that happened on Most Haunted wasn't real. It was an entertainment programme. When the show started it was terrible impressive, but I know full well they needed to keep the public entertained. They believed you needed a ghost every five minutes. For me, there was not enough investigation into what was happening. The crew apart from Derek and Ciaran none of the crew knew anything about ghosts.

“Every time they screamed, fell over, felt sick or got a headache… Have you ever heard anyone screaming before you faint? Well, if you didn't scream before you fainted the camera wouldn't get to you in time.”

Swiss multinational finds Laurent Freixe breached code of conduct as it names Philipp Navratil as his replacement

Nestlé has dismissed its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after an investigation into an “undisclosed romantic relationship” with a subordinate that was found to have breached its code of business conduct.

The Swiss-headquartered multinational named Philipp Navratil as his replacement.

Nestlé said Freixe's departure after 40 years at the company followed an investigation overseen by its chair, Paul Bulcke, and lead independent director, Pablo Isla, with the support of outside counsel, into the relationship with a direct subordinate in breach of company's conduct code.

“This was a necessary decision,” said Bulcke in a statement. “Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.”

Freixe took over the chief executive role in September last year after Nestlé, which owns consumer goods brands including KitKat chocolate, Häagen-Dazs ice-cream and Nespresso coffee capsules, ousted his predecessor, Mark Schneider.

Bulcke, who Nestlé announced in June is set to step down as chair next year, said Navratil was “recognised for his impressive track record of achieving results in challenging environments”.

He said Freixe's successor was “renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style. The board is confident that he will drive our growth plans forward and accelerate efficiency efforts. We are not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance.”

Navratil began his career with Nestlé in 2001 as an internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America, he was appointed country manager for Nestlé Honduras in 2009.

He assumed leadership of the coffee and beverage business in Mexico in 2013, and transitioned to Nestlé's coffee strategic business division in 2020. He moved to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined Nestlé's executive board on 1 January this year.

In September 2023, the chief executive of the oil multinational BP resigned after failing to reveal relationships with colleagues.

Bernard Looney was subsequently formally dismissed from his one-year notice period for serious misconduct after an investigation by the BP board and its advisers found he had knowingly misled his fellow directors when they sought assurances regarding his disclosure of past relationships and his future behaviour.

The decision meant he was denied more than £32m in pay and share awards. Looney was replaced as CEO by Murray Auchincloss.

BP subsequently introduced a policy under which employees have to disclose intimate relationships with colleagues or risk losing their jobs.

A top political reporter dumped by ABC News for spewing hate toward President Donald Trump and deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller on X is doubling down on his rant.

Instead of shushing after the embarrassing episode, Terry Moran stepped up his attack on Trump, telling a podcaster last week that Trump “is the man that we were warned about by the founders, that democracies fall when a man who can captivate the populace wants to exercise the power that's there in the government.”

What makes Moran our Liberal Media Scream of the week isn't just his continued hate toward Trump but his embrace of the Founding Fathers, whom the liberal media have recently attacked as racist slave-holders not worthy of memorializing.

An ABC journalist @TerryMoran posted this absolutely vile smear of Stephen Miller. It's dripping with hatred. Remember that every time you watch ABC's coverage of the Trump administration. As it happens, I know Stephen quite well. And he's motivated by love of country. He's… pic.twitter.com/hX93zKTWjy

Moran was dumped in June when he went after Miller on X. “He eats his hate,” Moran wrote of the president's chief policy aide. “Trump is a world-class hater. … That's his spiritual nourishment.”

Moran on In Good Faith With Philip DeFranco:

“What we're seeing is, no question, what other countries have seen a lot, what our Founding Fathers predicted would happen, that a great strongman would, would, all right, not great in the good sense, but great in the power sense, right?

“Trump is the most dominant figure of our age around the world. Don't underestimate him. He is a world historical figure, and he is the man that we were warned about by the Founders, that democracies fall when a man who can captivate the populace wants to exercise the power that's there in the government, and that is what we're watching.”

Brent Baker, the Steven P.J. Wood senior fellow and vice president for research and publications at the Media Research Center, explained our pick: “Legacy media figures keep reaching back in history to find different historic figures to use to condemn President Trump. The go-to has been Hitler, but now Moran is ridiculously invoking the Founding Fathers, a sudden respect for the supposed foresight of the founders, whom liberals normally condemn as immoral figures for condoning slavery, but now find so wise.”

Nestlé says it has dismissed its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after uncovering that he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate in a violation of corporate policy.

Freixe will be succeeded by Philipp Navratil, who was previously chief executive of Nestlé Nespresso.

Freixe, a four-decade fixture of the Swiss food and beverage giant, was tapped for the role one year ago to revive growth after a period of sluggish performance under his predecessor, Mark Schneider.

Nestlé said board chairman Paul Bulcke and Pablo Isla, an independent board member and the former Zara chief executive, oversaw the investigation with the support of outside counsel. Bulcke framed the dismissal as both necessary and symbolic of Nestlé's standards, while expressing gratitude for Freixe's tenure.

""This was a necessary decision,"" Bulcke said in a statement. ""Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestlé.""

Business Insider has reached out to Freixe for comment.

The boardroom drama arrives during a critical period for Nestlé. The company enjoyed a pandemic-era boom as consumers stocked up on staples to eat and drink at home, but that momentum has vanished. In July, Nestlé reported a 1.8% drop in half-year group sales, to 44.2 billion Swiss francs, roughly $55 billion, reflecting softening consumer demand.

Shares of the stock have slid nearly 40% from its high-water mark in early 2022.

When Freixe took over as the Nestlé chief last August, he made clear that his mandate was to refocus the company on its core strengths — coffee, petcare, and food — rather than chasing diversification. In an interview with The Financial Times in May, he criticized his predecessor Schnieder's expansion into health supplements and other new categories, arguing that it had ""weakened the fabric of the organisation.""

Schneider was only the second outsider to run Nestlé in its 159-year history. Freixe cast himself as the consummate insider — a nearly 40-year veteran who climbed the ranks through posts in Hungary, Spain, and Latin America.

Freixe told the FT that what set him apart was his ""intimate"" knowledge of Nestlé's inner workings. ""Because of that, and maybe my style, I'm very close to the people, so it's a big advantage,"" he said.

Nestlé has tapped another longtime employee as Freixe's replacement. In a statement, the board chairman recognized Navratil for his aptitude for getting results and his ""collaborative"" style.

""We are not changing course on strategy,"" Bulcke wrote, ""and we will not lose pace on performance.""

Ethereum investors are shifting focus toward BlockSack, a new crypto token presale, as ETH slows its momentum. Learn how BSACK positions itself among the hottest crypto presale to buy right now.

Ethereum (ETH) has staged a dramatic return this year. From April lows of $1,386, ETH surged to retest the $4,700 zone in August—a staggering 239% rally.

Sponsored

This powerful rebound has reignited investor confidence, supported by major network upgrades boosting scalability, security, and staking efficiency. ETH is now up over 60% year-to-date, with bullish sentiment across the crypto community fueling optimism.

However, Ethereum faces difficulty holding above key resistance levels. As volatility grows, investors are diversifying into presale crypto tokens, searching for the best crypto presale to buy right now for stronger upside potential.



Blocksack is a revolutionary meme cryptocurrency and decentralized ecosystem built on the BASE blockchain. Known by its ticker BSACK, Blocksack represents the ultimate fusion of meme culture, blockchain innovation, and real-world use cases.

Unlike standard meme tokens, Blocksack introduces a utility-first approach with staking rewards, play-to-earn gaming features, an NFT marketplace, DeFi protocols, and an advanced trading bot. These additions give presale crypto tokens like BSACK functional depth while maintaining the humor and community spirit meme coins thrive on.

At the center of this project stands Sacktoshi, a mythical creator figure tied to the origins of decentralization. This unique storytelling has elevated Blocksack's position on the crypto presale list, drawing attention from both retail and whale investors.

With its integration on the fast-growing BASE blockchain, Blocksack offers low fees, rapid transactions, and Ethereum compatibility. For investors searching for the best crypto presale to buy right now, BSACK combines community-driven branding with practical blockchain applications.

Ethereum holders are gradually moving funds into the Blocksack presale crypto, reflecting a shift in strategy. As ETH struggles with consolidation near its highs, presale coin opportunities present earlier entry advantages.

This rotation highlights a growing pattern among crypto presale projects, where investors seek both community appeal and technological promise. With presale stages filling quickly, BSACK continues to gain traction in token presales, drawing attention as one of the top crypto presales in 2025.

The move underscores how even established ETH holders see value in spreading capital across new crypto token presale opportunities while maintaining exposure to legacy assets.



Ethereum's recovery shows the resilience of established blockchains, but its resistance zones slow immediate growth. In contrast, Blocksack taps into the momentum of cryptocurrency presales, offering entry before wider market adoption.

The intersection of ETH and BSACK demonstrates how investors balance established assets with presale crypto tokens that capture culture and utility together. Among new crypto presale projects, Blocksack is earning visibility for its unique positioning.

As crypto presales evolve, both Ethereum and Blocksack stand as reminders that growth comes not only from past performance but from innovation, narrative, and community trust within token presales.

A mail-based atrial fibrillation (AF) screening programme with ECG-patch monitoring led to a modest long-term increase in AF diagnosis and anticoagulation exposure in older patients at moderate-to-high stroke risk, according to a late-breaking trial presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025 and simultaneously published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association).

Explaining the rationale, AMALFI Chief Investigator, Professor Louise Bowman, from Oxford Population Health, United Kingdom, said: ""AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, but AF can be difficult to detect as it often occurs without symptoms and/or infrequently. Screening for AF has been proposed as a way to prevent strokes but many short or infrequent asymptomatic AF episodes may be missed. The advent of new monitoring technology has enabled longer-duration screening. The AMALFI trial was designed to assess the long-term efficacy of remote screening for asymptomatic AF in older individuals at increased risk of stroke using a 14-day continuous ECG monitoring patch.""

In the investigator-initiated, parallel-arm unblinded randomized controlled AMALFI trial, eligible individuals were identified from 27 primary care practices in the UK via automated electronic health record searches. Participants were aged ≥65 years with a CHA2DS2VASc stroke risk score ≥3 for men or ≥4 for women. The key exclusion criterion was a previous diagnosis of AF or atrial flutter.

Participants were randomized 1:1 either to receive and return by postal mail an ECG patch monitor or to usual care (control). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with the presence of AF in primary care records within 2.5 years after randomization, which was analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.

A total of 5,040 individuals were randomized. At baseline, participants had a mean age of 78 years, 47% were female and 19% had a prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

There was a modest increase in AF diagnosis at 2.5 years with the ECG patch. A post-randomization primary care record of AF was present in 6.8% of individuals in the intervention arm and 5.4% in the control arm (ratio of proportions 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.57; p=0.03). Patch-detected AF burden was bimodally distributed, with 33% of cases having 100% burden (the entire monitoring period was spent in AF), while 55% had an AF burden <10%.

At 2.5 years, mean exposure to oral anticoagulation was 1.63 months in the intervention arm and 1.14 months in the control arm (difference 0.50 months; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.75; p<0.0001). Stroke occurred in 2.7% of participants in the intervention arm and 2.5% in the control arm (event rate ratio 1.08; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.53).

Our trial shows that remote AF screening with an ECG patch monitor in older patients at moderate-to-high stroke risk leads to a modest increase in AF diagnosis and anticoagulation exposure. However, AF diagnosis unrelated to the patch occurred more commonly than anticipated and over half of the patch-detected AF burden was low burden (below 10%). This suggests that AF screening in this setting may have limited impact on stroke events; longer-term and cost-effectiveness analyses of AMALFI are planned and will provide more insight in due course.""

Serie A

Deadline Day

LIVE

1m ago

Atalanta have completed the signing of United States international Yunus Musah from AC Milan.

Musah, 22, has joined Atalanta on loan with an option to buy.

The Athletic reported on August 10 that Nottingham Forest entered talks over a potential move for Musah, with personal terms not expected to be an issue. A move never materialised, and Forest further bolstered their midfield with the signings of James McAtee from Manchester City and Douglas Luiz on loan from Juventus.

Musah joins Atalanta in their first season under head coach Ivan Juric, after Gian Piero Gasperini departed for Roma in the summer.

Musah joined Milan from Valencia in August 2023, where he made his senior professional debut after a spell in the reserve team. He has made 80 appearances for the Italian side and registered five assists. 

Last season, the midfielder made 40 appearances, 29 of which were in Serie A and seven in the Champions League, as Milan finished eighth and failed to qualify for a continental competition in 2025-26.

“I consider Musah an excellent player,” Milan's new sporting director Igli Tare said this summer. “But we are looking for profiles with characteristics that fit the project we have with (head) coach (Massimiliano) Allegri.”

The midfielder was omitted from Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan. He played the full 90 minutes in Milan's 2-0 win over Lecce on Friday, his first start of the season.

Musah came through Arsenal's academy and had represented England up to under-18 level. He has since switched allegiances to the U.S. and has made 47 appearances for the national team since his senior debut at 17 years old. 

Atalanta qualified for this season's Champions League via their third-place finish in the Serie A last season. They have drawn their opening two matches of the 2025-26 season against Pisa and Parma.

After the international break, Musah's new side face Lecce in the league before travelling to Paris Saint-Germain on September 17.

Analysis by senior soccer writer Greg O'Keefe

Musah heads to Atalanta hoping to get more first-team football in a crucial season ahead of next summer's World Cup.

He has not been a peripheral figure at San Siro, in fact he made 29 Serie A appearances last season, even if there were only 19 starts.

There have been previous links with a move to the Premier League and Nottingham Forest this summer, but the American will now make the relatively short trip from Milan to Bergamo, aiming to become a more consistent starter under new Atalanta boss Juric.

The news that Milan coach Allegri was also targeting another midfielder, in France international Adrien Rabiot, will only have strengthened Musah's resolve to head out, especially after he was not selected in Mauricio Pochettino's roster for this month's friendlies with South Korea and Japan.

Why the new FIFA competition is an unnecessary burden on player health

By Felix Hughes — Published September 1, 2025

Earlier this year, Real Madrid and England national football team star Jude Bellingham turned 22. At an age when he can still barely drink in the US, he will have played 277 career club games and made 44 international appearances for England. 

Since the age of 16, Bellingham has been playing week in and week out at the highest level of football. His case is one of many that demonstrates the increasing level of physical exertion that players have undergone. For context, at the same age, Cristiano Ronaldo had played 242 games for club and country and Lionel Messi 200 games, while David Beckham, a player known for his work ethic, had played just 100 games, or five times less minutes of playtime than Bellingham.

Repercussions of heavier minutes

All this is to say that soccer players are playing more minutes and more games than ever before, and they are doing so from a much younger age. While even the greats of the game, like Messi or Ronaldo, didn't experience heavy minutes before their mid-20s, it's now commonplace for wonderkids to be shoved straight into starting lineups and told to deal with it. 

Barcelona midfielder Pedri made his debut for the club at just 18 years old before playing 52 games that season. With appearances for Spain during and after the season, he played 73 total games in just one season, all while missing any chance of recuperating for the new season over the summer break. It was therefore unsurprising when Pedri missed much of the next season due to injury. 

For all the money footballers are paid, they are human and they need rest. A recent study by FIFPRO, the FIFA players' union, stated that players need a minimum of a four-week break during the offseason to recharge, before then easing back into preseason so that they are physically and mentally ready for a new season. Otherwise, they risk fatigue, burnout and injuries that not only wreck careers, but weaken the quality of the football played. 

Players find themselves unable to keep up with the frantic pace demanded of them, particularly in an age where almost every manager demands offensive, possession-based soccer that requires constant sprinting.

Club World Cup and player fatigue

Typically, this kind of summer, where no major international tournaments fill up the schedule, would be the perfect time for the likes of Bellingham to recharge, with one eye on next summer's World Cup with some games in Toronto. And yet, he and his Real Madrid teammates find themselves competing in the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup. 

The Club World Cup, despite the best efforts of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, is a tournament largely muted in terms of fanfare. Fan attendance has been low to the point of tickets being given away in buy-one-get-four free deals in the opening days of the tournament. The hype around the tournament has been cringe-inducing at best; one of the tournament's opening games descended into farce as Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich demolished semi-pro New Zealand team Auckland City FC 10–0. 

When a tournament that bills itself as containing the best teams in the world has a result like this, it's a sign that the tournament is not fit for purpose. But ultimately, the competition is unnecessary, or even dangerous, for the added burden it will place on footballers going forward.

The Club World Cup ended in mid-July, and the La Liga season started on August 17, while pre-season started on August 3. This gives players little rest before being thrown back into the fire of constant games, and with a World Cup next summer, many won't get a proper rest until the summer of 2027. 

Bellingham makes an especially strong case study for the importance of rest, given that following the conclusion of the tournament, he will be undergoing shoulder surgery that will see him miss the first six weeks of next season. Had it not been for this tournament, he could've had this surgery at the start of June, giving him more time to recover before the regular season. Instead, he'll miss a sizable chunk of the season, while risking even more serious injury by playing through the recovery process. 

Athlete burnout

The Club World Cup is ultimately indicative of a footballing calendar that has pushed player workload to the limits. The Champions League and Europa League added two more games to their group stage format last season, bringing little sporting benefit with it. 

However, top players continue to play 50-plus games a season, and such a volume of games has come at a cost. In the 2023–2024 Premier League season, there was a 15 per cent increase in injuries from the previous season, while there was a 187 per cent injury increase amongst players under the age of 21 in 2023–2024 compared with the 2020–2021 season.

On top of these injuries, anyone watching the games can see burnout start to affect top players. Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden admitted to feeling “burnout” and suffering from injury throughout the 2024–2025 season. 

This was after two gruelling campaigns in which he was at the forefront of a Manchester City team, being pushed to the line in the Premier League title race, while also making deep cup runs in the Champions League and FA Cup, which takes an inevitable physical and mental toll that is not easy to recover from, even if you do win. On top of this, the summer of 2024 saw him experience the heartbreak of losing the Euros final with England, a run that once more robbed him of a proper offseason break. When the 2024–2025 season saw him score his lowest number of goals in 5 seasons, it was plain to see why.

With the Club World Cup adding unnecessary wear and tear to footballers, the 2025–2026 season is a step into the unknown for teams competing in this tournament. Already, many have suggested that the Premier League teams in the tournament, Chelsea and Manchester City, will be at a disadvantage to their better-rested rivals. For players like Bellingham, further injuries await.

	For the second time this year, CBS' freshman sudser Beyond the Gates is in repeats for a holiday week.


	Beginning today, the soap will air episodes 45 through 49 before returning to originals on September 8. The last time CBS put BTS on repeats was during the July 4 holiday week.


	Before CBS Prods and Procter & Gamble developed BTS, week-long breaks weren't common for daytime dramas. Typically, the sudsers only break for a day.


	But BTG is different. Besides the fact that it's the first soap to be launched since Passions in 1999, it also premiered in February and is on a different production and air cycle. As fans have noted, it got a shorter episodic order than The Young & the Restless and The Bold & The Beautiful.












	Ardent fans have tried to remind others of the circumstances, but that hasn't stopped some from worrying about the future of the drama from Michele Val Jean. As a reminder, the sudser has been ordered for a second season and the access to the series continues to grow: Crave, a streaming platform in Canada, will become the home for BTS starting Sept. 1.

FYI #BeyondTheGates #BTG https://t.co/nNAId3Cl3S

This makes so much sense 🤔 #BeyondTheGates pic.twitter.com/GyC8tF7IJF

Only 200 episodes were ordered for #BeyondTheGates' first season, while other soaps air about 240 eps/year. This is typical for a first season! But, make sure you support so we get that FULL season 2 order. 👀Check out the new #TGKPod where we talk this! https://t.co/4zL3W1tDdb https://t.co/hnS2ZpvPTT
