Attorney General Pam Bondi, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discuss why animal cruelty is so important to end on 'My View with Lara Trump.' Senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration say they are cracking down on animal cruelty, rolling out coordinated actions across the Justice Department, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to target dogfighting, puppy mills and animal testing. "We are forming a strike force... and we're going to have designated U.S. attorneys in every state to prosecute these [animal abuse] cases," said Attorney General Pam Bondi on "My View with Lara Trump" on Saturday. Bondi appeared with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to discuss their interagency animal welfare initiative. Members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet are coordinating an animal welfare initiative across the Departments of Justice, Agriculture and Health and Human Services. Bondi said her department would work with the USDA to conduct special training for prosecutors and law enforcement agents on executing search warrants in animal abuse cases. "We just last week convicted someone, for the first time ever, of using a firearm in a violent crime, and the violent crime was dogfighting," Bondi said. In another example that shows "no one is above the law," Bondi told host Lara Trump that 190 dogs were seized from former NFL player LeShon Johnson. "That was the most seized from one single defendant. So we're coming after you if you're going after these babies," she said, holding a small black puppy named Guru in her lap. Rollins said the USDA is taking a tougher approach to shutting down abusive puppy mills, moving away from issuing warnings and toward stricter enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act. She described the poor conditions dogs can face in these mass-breeding operations. "No more puppy mills where you have puppies stacked on top of each other, where, if you don't sell them, then you drown them in a barrel because it's the cheapest way to do it." He said new studies on animal testing show "that the predictivity of animal models is very, very poor for human health outcomes. There are much more efficient ways of predicting human health outcomes. We are using, even in their nascent stages, computational modeling and AI," which he said provides much better results. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that the Justice Department will train prosecutors to combat dogfighting cases and execute search warrants as part of an interagency animal welfare initiative. In September, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) changed its rules to ensure funding could be used to "retire their primates to sanctuaries after the experimentation is done." "Until now, there was no option like that, no alternative, except the researcher euthanized that animal after they were through. Now we're developing sanctuaries across the country," he said. Kennedy framed animal welfare as a measure of the country's character. "The badge of a really humane nation is the way that it takes care of its animals," he said.

KISS star Gene Simmons told CNN on Sunday that Americans should stop worrying about politics and said it didn't matter who their neighbors support because, "It's their America too." KISS frontman Gene Simmons downplayed politics during an interview with CNN on Sunday, and urged Americans to stop worrying about their neighbors' political beliefs. "It's nobody's business who you support," Simmons told Manu Raju on CNN's "Inside Politics." "Nowadays, people engage in, 'So are you pro or,' and my first question is, ‘Who the f--- are you? "Some of it makes sense and some not," Simmons replied, questioning why anyone cared about his political views. "But literally, have a sense of humor. Take a pill, shut up and stop worrying what your next-door neighbor believes or doesn't believe.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Simmons also said he spoke with President Donald Trump after receiving a Kennedy Center Honor earlier this year. But the telling moment was after we all got our Kennedy Center awards, as I had some face time alone with the president," he said. And the conversation was what human beings do. It‘s not always about politics," Simmons continued. Gene Simmons, Peter Criss and Paul Stanley of KISS attend the 48th Kennedy Center Honors at The Kennedy Center on Dec. 7, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Paul Morigi) Simmons was on Capitol Hill this month to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the American Music Fairness Act. In what could mark a major shake-up for the music industry, the legislation would require AM and FM radio stations to pay recording artists and performers when they broadcast their songs, ending a decades-old exemption in U.S. copyright law. The bipartisan bill would align traditional radio with digital and streaming platforms that already pay artists royalties, while offering low, flat fees to protect small local stations. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., introduced this version of the bill in January, while Sens. More than a dozen conservative groups urged House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to support the bill.

New York winemaker Nova Cadamatre reveals which signature whites and reds best introduce first-time drinkers to the upstate region, pointing to bottles available through the Fox News American Wine Club subscription. Nova Cadamatre, together with her husband, Brian, opened Trestle Thirty One winery in 2015 in the Finger Lakes. She splits her time between the emerging powerhouse region and California's globally recognized Napa Valley. Unlike California, where summers are reliably dry and conditions stable, the Finger Lakes see "precipitation of some sort throughout the year — and it includes us having rain during the growing season," Cadamatre told Fox News Digital. Kathy Hochul's office said "recognizes the region's world-class winemaking, sustainable practices and collaborative community that have helped define New York State as a leader in American viticulture." Nova Cadamatre, the first female Master of Wine in the United States, opened Trestle Thirty One winery in New York's Finger Lakes region with her husband in 2015. Her office's note added, "It's a win for our state's economy and our reputation as a global wine destination." In bestowing the honor, Wine Enthusiast said, "New York's largest wine-growing region has come a mighty long way in a few decades. Where wine lovers once had to search for quality, these days it's the norm." "Making wine in New York really forces you to be creative and very resourceful because the industry is not as well established as it is in California," said Cadamatre. Since her very first Finger Lakes harvest, Cadamatre said she's watched the area shift from underdog to emerging powerhouse. Climate change, while destabilizing in many wine regions, has had a paradoxical benefit in the Finger Lakes, Cadamatre said. Trestle Thirty One's Engine Riesling is featured in the Fox News American Wine Club. Cadamatre founded Trestle Thirty One winery in New York's Finger Lakes region. "We're able to grow different varieties than we did 20 years ago and ripen them more consistently," she said. She likens the region's trajectory to Napa's early ascent. Cadamatre views Trestle Thirty One's Engine Riesling, featured in the Fox News American Wine Club, and Cabernet Franc, available through the Fox News Wine Shop, as ambassadors for a region still creating its identity. Cadamatre splits her time between New York's Finger Lakes region and California's Napa Valley. The Engine Riesling is "great as just an apéritif or a sipper or with a cheese plate and charcuterie, hanging around with friends," she said. For a winemaker who has built her career on both coasts, Cadamatre is bullish about the future of viticulture in the Finger Lakes. "I think it's just a real testament to all the work that the community's done here to get the word out about our beautiful wine region," Cadamatre said. "Right now, there are about 432 of us in the world." As she also recently told SUNY Morrisville, where she earned her degree in horticulture, "I've been working my butt off for a long time. I've made a lot of wine over 20 years." Learn more about the Fox News Wine Shop here. Peter Burke is a lifestyle editor with Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Kablooey!” That's the word U.S. Geological Survey volcanic experts used to describe a muddy eruption at Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone National Park on Saturday morning. Video shared by the USGS on social media shows mud spraying up and out from the pool just before 9:23 a.m. in Biscuit Basin about midway between park favorites Old Faithful and Grand Prismatic. This image made from video provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) shows a muddy eruption at Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone National Park on Saturday, Dec. 20, 2025. That's the word U.S. Geological Survey volcanic experts used to describe a muddy eruption at Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone National Park on Saturday morning. Video shared by the USGS on social media shows mud spraying up and out from the pool just before 9:23 a.m. in Biscuit Basin about midway between park favorites Old Faithful and Grand Prismatic. Other recent eruptions have mostly been audible and not visible, because they happened either at night or when the camera was obscured by ice. The agency said the Black Diamond Pool was previously the site of a hydrothermal explosion, in July 2024, that sent rocks and mud flying hundreds of feet high and damaged a boardwalk. So-called dirty eruptions reaching up to 40 feet (about 12 meters) have occurred sporadically since then. Researchers installed a new camera and a seismic and acoustic monitoring station this summer, and they say the instruments, along with temperature sensors maintained by the Yellowstone National Park Geology Program, can better detect and characterize the eruptions. The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory webcam at Black Diamond Pool didn't disappoint Saturday. “We got a nice clear view of one of these dirty eruptions under bright blue skies with the surroundings covered in snow (ah, winter in Yellowstone! ),” USGS Volcanoes said on social media, noting that it was a great example of the kind of activity that has been happening at the spot over the past 19 months. Park officials say Yellowstone preserves the most extraordinary collection of hot springs, geysers, mud pots and fumaroles on Earth. More than 10,000 hydrothermal features are found within the park, over 500 of them geysers.</p>

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reflects on the energy Charlie Kirk had and says she is ‘in awe of' Erika Kirk's strength in the face of ‘the toughest times' at TPUSA's AmericaFest 2025 (Credit: Turning Point USA). Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered a blunt warning about "Islamist ideology" at a high-profile conservative gathering Saturday, casting the threat as fundamentally incompatible with Western freedom. "The threats from this Islamist ideology come in many forms," Gabbard told an audience at Turning Point USA's (TPUSA) annual AmericaFest conference. "As we approach Christmas, right now in Germany they are canceling Christmas markets because of this threat." "When we talk about the threat of Islamism, this political ideology, there is no such thing as individual freedom or liberty," she said. Gabbard's remarks were notable given her role overseeing the nation's intelligence community, a position that traditionally avoids overt ideological framing in public remarks, particularly at partisan political events. AmericaFest 2025, hosted by Turning Point USA, is taking place in Phoenix, Arizona. Turning Point USA's AmericaFest has become a marquee gathering for conservative activists, lawmakers and influencers, where national security, immigration and cultural issues are increasingly framed as part of a broader ideological struggle. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying whether Gabbard's remarks reflected official U.S. intelligence assessments or her personal views. TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk positioned the organization as a hub for conservative youth activism, frequently hosting high-profile figures who frame political and security debates in ideological terms. Charlie Kirk, who founded Turning Point USA, was killed on Sept. 10 while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk carried that influence onto college campuses nationwide, drawing large crowds for live, unscripted debates on religion, Islamism, free speech, immigration and American culture. The charged nature of modern political activism has also raised alarms about political violence, with authorities increasingly warning of threats tied to large public gatherings. European security officials have raised security alerts around holiday events in recent years following a series of Islamist-inspired attacks, including deadly incidents in Germany, France and Belgium, prompting heightened police presence or temporary cancellations at some Christmas markets.

Jared Kushner speaks during a news conference following a military briefing with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Civilian Military Coordination Center in southern Israel, Oct. 21, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — As the dawn rose on President Donald Trump's second term, one key figure from his first administration stood back, content to focus on his personal business interests and not retake a formal government role. Now, nearly a year into Trump 2.0, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been drawn back into the foreign policy fold and is taking a greater role in delicate peace negotiations. The shift reflects a sense among Trump's inner circle that Kushner, who has diplomatic experience, complements Witkoff's negotiating style and can bridge seemingly intractable differences to close a deal, according to several current and former administration officials who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations. That role was on display this weekend as Kushner and Witkoff hosted Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev in Miami for talks on the latest proposals to end Russia's war in Ukraine and they also met with Turkish and Qatari officials to discuss the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza as they look to implement the second phase of Trump's ceasefire plan. Kushner has his own complicated business interests in the Middle East and a sometimes transactional outlook to diplomacy that has distressed some officials in European capitals, a Western diplomat said. Still, Kushner is seen as a more credible negotiator than Witkoff, who is viewed by many Ukrainian and European officials as overly deferential to Russian interests during the war that began with Moscow's invasion in February 2022, the diplomat said. Kelly stressed, however, that the jury is still out on Kushner's intervention. Trump views Kushner as a “trusted family member and talented adviser” who has played a pivotal role in some of his biggest foreign policy successes, said White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly. Trump and Witkoff “often seek Mr. Kushner's input given his experience with complex negotiations, and Mr. Kushner has been generous in lending his valuable expertise when asked,” Kelly added. State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott called Kushner “a world-class negotiator.” Pigott noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is grateful for Kushner's “willingness to serve our country and help President Trump solve some of the world's most complex challenges.” “I was trained in foreign policy really in President Trump's first term by seeing an outsider president come into Washington with a different school of foreign policy than had been brought in place for the 20 or 30 years prior,” he said. But some Democrats and government oversight groups have expressed skepticism about Kushner's role in shaping the administration policies in the Middle East while he manages billions of dollars in investments, including from Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds through his firm, Affinity Partners. “What people call conflicts of interests, Steve and I call experience and trusted relationships that we have throughout the world,” said Kushner, who is not drawing a salary from the White House for his advisory role. Kushner has agreed to do so in his capacity as a private citizen.” Kelly and other veterans of U.S. diplomatic encounters with the Russians over many years are also skeptical about Kushner's ability to secure a Russia-Ukraine deal because Witkoff technically remains in the lead. “I don't see that the Witkoff approach is going to work,” Kelly said. “They seem to have this idea that the magic key is money: investment and development,” Kelly said. “But these guys don't care about that, they are not real estate guys except in the sense that they want the land, period.” Kushner had told Trump and others that while he would not be joining the second-term White House, he stood ready to offer his counsel if it was desired. Although Kushner remained an informal sounding board for Trump and top advisers, he resisted getting directly involved, even as the president expanded his peacemaking pursuits, until it became clear to him and others that the job might be too much for Witkoff to seal on his own, the officials said. Agreed to in late September after frantic talks surrounding the annual U.N. General Assembly, the 20-point plan is still a work in progress, but its implementation is being coordinated by Kushner and numerous members of his Abraham Accords team. As soon as the Gaza plan was finalized, Kushner said he was returning to his family and day job in Miami, where he heads a multibillion-dollar private equity firm. His involvement in high-stakes peacemaking was only temporary, Kushner said, joking that his wife, Ivanka, might change the locks if he did not get home soon. “I'm gonna try to help set it up, and then I'm gonna hopefully go back to my normal life,” Kushner said in October. They had been deadlocked for months despite persistent efforts by the White House to lure both Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy into an agreement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband. With his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war. But in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base. For last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute. But this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away. He joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks. On what began as a peaceful Sunday, December 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin's band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue. He went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn't know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.” He scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an antiaircraft gun above. His ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an antiaircraft gun. After the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon. Schab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander. Speaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor. Remember and honor those that are left. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”</p>

Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker breaks down Miami peace talks between the U.S. and Russia and President Trump's push for a breakthrough. Kremlin envoy Kirill Dimitriev told reporters in the U.S. that peace talks with Ukraine are proceeding "constructively," even as Russian forces launched a deadly missile strike on Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow," Dimitriev told press gathered Saturday for a meeting in Florida. That meeting came after the U.S. side completed separate meetings with Ukrainian representatives. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sounded apprehensive about where peace talks stood when speaking to the press on Saturday. At this point, I honestly don't know, but I will know later today," he said. Russia's campaign against Ukraine has continued unabated despite the peace talks. A Saturday strike on Odesa killed eight people and injured 27 others. Russian President Vladimir Putin noted on Friday that the nation's "troops are advancing," and expressed confidence that Russia would achieve its goals by military force if Ukraine does not accept its peace terms.

(Alexander Kazakov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) "Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors," Putin declared Friday during his annual news conference. We would prefer to accomplish this and address the root causes of the conflict through diplomatic means," he continued. Ukrainian military members carry the coffin of Vasyl Ratushnyi, a Ukrainian serviceman who served as a drone operator in "Madyar's Birds" unit and who was killed fighting Russian troops at the front, during his funeral ceremony outside St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv. "However, if the opposing side and its foreign patrons refuse to engage in substantive dialogue, Russia will achieve the liberation of its historical lands by military means," Putin declared. Russia's peace terms have so far required Ukraine to give up vast swathes of territory, including some territory not already under Russian occupation. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard denied U.S. intelligence that reportedly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to capture all of Ukraine and parts of Europe that were formerly under Soviet control. Reuters reported on Saturday that intelligence shows not only is Putin still looking to take all of Ukraine, but his war goals extend to Europe, citing six anonymous sources. One of the sources said the most recent intelligence report from that batch was from September, months before President Donald Trump unveiled a sweeping peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war. That peace plan includes only some land concessions with Ukraine, while Putin also recently dismissed claims of potential Russian attacks on Europe as “nonsense.” “The truth is that ‘US intelligence' assesses that Russia does not even have the capability to conquer and occupy Ukraine, what to speak of ‘invading and occupying' Europe.” Her rebuttal was met with praise from Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who leveled similar attacks against the intelligence. Voices of reason matter — restore sanity, peace, and security,” Dmitriev posted on X. The fierce denial of any expansionary goals of Putin's comes as the Trump administration is desperate to get its 28-point peace plan over the line after months of negotiations. Talks have resumed this weekend in Miami, with Dmitriev meeting with Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner on Saturday. Dmitriev had told reporters those discussions were “proceeding constructively,” but that the two sides will continue to hash out key sticking points on Sunday.</p>

EDS NOTE: NUDITY - This photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows a collection of art in Jeffrey Epstein's home, July 6, 2019, in New York. This undated photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows Jeffrey Epstein. NEW YORK (AP) — At least 16 files disappeared from the Justice Department's public webpage for documents related to Jeffrey Epstein — including a photograph showing President Donald Trump — less than a day after they were posted, with no explanation from the government and no notice to the public. In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Trump, alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The Justice Department didn't answer questions Saturday about why the files disappeared but said in a post on X that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.” Democrats on the House Oversight Committee pointed to the missing image featuring a Trump photo in a post on X, writing: “What else is being covered up? The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein's crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions. Missing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions — records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge. The records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain's former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability Among the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department's decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children. The releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein's homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him. Despite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis. The department has not given any notice when more records might arrive. “I feel like again the DOJ, the justice system is failing us,” said Marina Lacerda, who alleges Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York City mansion when she was 14. In one example, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Manhattan federal prosecutors had more than 3.6 million records from sex trafficking investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, though many duplicated material already turned over by the FBI. Many of the records released so far had been made public in court filings, congressional releases or freedom of information requests, though, for the first time, they were all in one place and available for the public to search for free. A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY,” likely from one of the federal sex trafficking investigations that led to the charges against Epstein in 2019 or Maxwell in 2021, was entirely blacked out. There were also photos of Epstein with actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, and even Epstein with TV newscaster Walter Cronkite. The meatiest records released so far showed that federal prosecutors had what appeared to be a strong case against Epstein in 2007 yet never charged him. Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, released publicly for the first time, included testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who described being paid to perform sex acts for Epstein. One had told investigators about being sexually assaulted by Epstein when she initially resisted his advances during a massage. Another, then 21, testified before the grand jury about how Epstein had hired her when she was 16 to perform a sexual massage and how she had gone on to recruit other girls to do the same. “For every girl that I brought to the table he would give me $200,” she said. The documents also contain a transcript of an interview Justice Department lawyers did more than a decade later with the U.S. attorney who oversaw the case, Alexander Acosta, about his ultimate decision not to bring federal charges. Acosta, who was labor secretary during Trump's first term, cited concerns about whether a jury would believe Epstein's accusers. He also said the Justice Department might have been more reluctant to make a federal prosecution out of a case that straddled the legal border between sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, something more commonly handled by state prosecutors. “I'm not saying it was the right view,” Acosta added. “There's been a lot of changes in victim shaming,” Acosta said. Jennifer Freeman, an attorney representing Epstein accuser Maria Farmer and other survivors, said Saturday that her client feels vindicated after the document release. Farmer sought for years documents backing up her claim that Epstein and Maxwell were in possession of child sexual abuse images. Associated Press journalists Ali Swenson, Christopher L. Keller, Kristin M. Hall, Aaron Kessler and Mike Catalini contributed to this report.</p>
