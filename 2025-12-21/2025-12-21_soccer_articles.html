                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United saw festive cheer sapped by an injury to Bruno Fernandes during their visit to Aston Villa, with a Morgan Rogers brace firing the hosts to a 2-1 win and 10th consecutive victory in all competitions. Ruben Amorim tinkered with his 3-4-3 tactical blueprint again, in a bid to get more bodies in midfield, and saw United hold their own against in-form opposition. Cunha came close to forcing an early breakthrough, while Ollie Watkins and John McGinn passed up decent opportunities at the other end of the field. Matty Cash was caught in possession three minutes into stoppage-time, with Cunha making him pay as he crashed an impressive finish across Emi Martinez from a tight angle. He was able to complete the opening 45 minutes, but had been grabbing at his hamstring and will hope to have suffered no lasting damage. Once again he was afforded far too much space in which to dig out a shot and find the back of the net. Cunha should have grabbed a brace himself in the 67th minute, but the Brazilian forward somehow managed to head wide after being picked out unmarked five yards from goal. The Red Devils have now won just two of their last eight Premier League fixtures. Spread himself really well to repel an early effort from McGinn and displayed safe hands when called upon. At fault for Villa's first as he took far too long to address the threat posed by Rogers. Failed to block Villa's star man again for the home side's second. Put in two brave first-half blocks and stood up to the challenge of Watkins. Could have been the one pushed into midfield when Fernandes had to be replaced, but was left at the back. Frustrated by those around him as Rogers was allowed far too much space in which to work his magic. Should have done better for Villa's second, with the Portuguese failing to prevent Youri Tielemans from digging out a cross. Handed United an injury scare when grabbing at his hamstring midway through the first-half. Was initially able to play on, but was replaced at the break with no risks being taken on his fitness. Still lacks confidence and takes too long on the ball at times. Did deliver a pinpoint cross for Cunha, which was wasted. Dragged a shot wide early in the second period. Hit the net in first-half stoppage-time when being gifted the ball by Cash and making no mistake as he crashed across Martinez. Missed a second-half sitter when heading Dorgu's delivery wide from close range. Asked to lead the line and should have made more of a clear sight of goal that saw him go through one-on-one. He fired at Martinez, instead of dinking over him. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Replaced Fernandes at the break, meaning that he was asked to step into an unfamiliar midfield role when United had the ball. Involved in some neat build-up play, but was unable to find a way through. United were unable to conjure him up a sight of goal. Handed his Premier League debut with United chasing the game. An exciting talent with more to give in the future. Will have been encouraged by a lot of what he saw from United, but was ultimately left empty-handed. Will be sweating on medical updates when it comes to Fernandes, as the Red Devils cannot afford to lose their skipper for long.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Isak was introduced as a substitute at the start of the second half in place of Conor Bradley, with Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemingly keen to add more firepower to his side with the scores locked at 0-0 but with Tottenham a man light after Xavi Simons was sent off for a late challenge on Virgil van Dijk. Within ten minutes of his introduction, Isak's name was on the scoresheet, but instead of running off to celebrate his goal, he writhed in pain on the floor and immediately called for medical assistance. After several minutes of treatment, he hobbled off and was replaced by Jeremie Frimpong. The striker is yet to undergo an MRI scan which will reveal how long he may be sidelined for, but initial signs are not promising. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Slot was asked about Isak at his post-match press conference, to which he replied: "I don't have any news on him. But if a player scores and then gets injured, and doesn't come back on the pitch, doesn't try to come back - which is what Conor Bradley tried to do for example but I had to take him off as well because he couldn't go on. But I cannot say anything more than that, it is just a gut feeling. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Isak's goal at Tottenham was just his second in the Premier League since his £125 million ($166m) move from Newcastle on deadline day of the summer transfer window, with his only other strike coming in a 1-0 win at West Ham on November 30. Unlike Isak, Ekitike has proven a hit at Anfield so far, scoring 10 times for Liverpool in all competitions already. He scored the Reds' second against Spurs, rising above Cristian Romero to head home a deflected cross from Frimpong. Star forward Mohamed Salah is currently at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt, while there is increasing speculation that Harvey Elliott could return to the club in January having failed to make an impact on loan at Aston Villa.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the full match schedule for the 2026 FIFA World Cup now set, we're preparing for millions of visitors, a global spotlight, and an economic opening unlike anything our state has ever seen. We now know who is playing here and when. What we still need to answer is simple: Are we ready to make sure that New Jersey's small businesses benefit from this moment? They power local economies and shape the neighborhoods visitors will experience. With any major event, businesses often can feel the earliest and most meaningful economic lift – but only when we prepare early, coordinate well, and give communities the support they need. This is where state, county, municipal, and business leadership need to engage. The toolkit lays out viewing license options, programming ideas, timelines, and practical ways to shape local experiences that meet the moment. It also offers guidance for businesses – from marketing considerations to adjusting hours and staffing to handle higher traffic. These are meaningful resources, and they give us a head start. But tools only matter if people put them to use. And as the Host Committee has emphasized, they cannot do this alone. The Host Committee plans to roll out a small-business initiative early next year to expand opportunities across the region. They've also created and introduced Welcome World, the shared regional brand for 2026, specifically for communities to use to connect their own events and programming to the World Cup. But we shouldn't wait for the next announcement to get moving. The tools we need to get started are already in front of us. Every mayor, councilmember, chamber of commerce, business improvement district, educational institution, cultural institution, and local economic development office should be planning now. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. The World Cup will move people through our hotels, restaurants, downtowns, cultural spaces, and transportation corridors. Visitors won't only go to MetLife Stadium – they'll explore our cities, discover new neighborhoods, and spend time experiencing the best of our state. If we prepare small businesses to shine, the economic impact will extend far beyond the eight matches we are hosting. Preparation must be intentional, coordinated, and underway long before fans arrive. New Jersey has the talent, infrastructure, and resilience to deliver an exceptional experience. Now we need a unified push among state agencies, local leaders, business groups, and the private sector to make sure small businesses are ready to seize this opportunity. The Chamber will continue to partner with the Host Committee, advocate for small businesses, and serve as a steady voice for the needs of our statewide business community. New Jersey's business community has everything to gain, but we only reach that potential if we work together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I witnessed perhaps one of the most sublime moments in the history of football,” he says, retelling a story that has become a pillar of his life. Zamora, a Mexican football fan, does not remember how his father, Antonio, got tickets to the 1986 World Cup quarter-final between Argentina and England at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. But he does clearly remember the goals: first when Diego Maradona used his “hand of God” to push the ball past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. “I have very vivid memories and others that are a little blurry. Zamora, who has a master's degree in petrochemical engineering and works at a company that provides services to the state oil firm, knew the tickets would be expensive but was undeterred. For the past four months he has been trying – and failing – to purchase seats. Through the Fifa website, he unsuccessfully entered three online ballots for the chance to win an opportunity to buy tickets and has no idea how he will be able to attend the 2026 World Cup in his home country. “I'd like to think it's just bad luck on my part, but the reality is that it increasingly feels like there isn't actually a World Cup in Mexico,” he says. His disappointment is echoed widely among Mexican fans, arguably the most ardent of aficionados in the three host nations. The event, which is supposed to convey an international feeling of solidarity through sport, is taking place in an increasingly tense geopolitical environment as the second term of President Donald Trump has confronted the US's two close neighbours, levying tariffs and ramping up an anti-immigrant agenda. According to the governing body, 2m tickets have already been sold across the first two early sales phases, leaving fewer than 5m still available. Zamora says he doesn't know anyone who has secured a ticket. “Right now there's a lot of confusion. In the Sunday football team I play on, at least 20 people have gone through the same process as me, and I don't know anyone who has got anything,” he says. Zamora was seeking tickets for the opening match between Mexico and South Africa at the Azteca Stadium on 11 June, which in the final ballot phase cost between $1,290 (£964) and $1,825 (£1,364) for a regular seat, with no guarantee that even putting down that money will secure a ticket. Hospitality options are available, with prices about $10,000 (£7,474). The prices are astronomical in a country where an average professional is paid about 7,500 pesos ($416/£311) per month and far outstrips prices in previous World Cups. A ticket for a Liga MX match at the same stadium costs about $15 to $50, before the major renovation that started last year. A luxury box seat at the 2024 Clausura final between América and Cruz Azul reached $2,000. “The prices are not for an average Mexican,” says the Mexican writer Rodrigo Márquez Tizano, author of A Brief History of Almost There, a collection of essays that looks at El Tri's participation in the World Cups. “Today, before even going to the stadium, we're in a virtual line. “Reality is unfortunately inferior to what we dreamed it would be,” he says, “because there is a feeling that nobody has tickets.” He too has applied to the Fifa ballots without any luck. Jorge García, a 40-year-old advertising executive in Mexico City, connected promptly at 10am on Thursday using his Fifa ID to join the virtual queue to participate in the latest tickets ballot. He had his credit card out and was ready to pay for a pair of tickets costing about 5,000 pesos ($265) each, hoping to take his son, León, to the stadium in Houston to see Cristiano Ronaldo in action against Uzbekistan on 26 June. García waited for two hours to make his application. He also applied for seven games in Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara, and now has to wait until February to know if he was successful or not. There's little communication and clarity here in Mexico regarding the tickets. It seems like this mess is intentional so that you give up and look for tickets on the resale market. This opening match at the Azteca Stadium seems like a rehearsal for what the World Cup will be like,” says a despondent García. Fifa said last week it would be releasing a small number of low-price tickets costing $60. García was only a toddler during the 1986 World Cup but has been avidly following the tournaments on TV since 1994. But with these prices, it seems even further away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Toronto Argonauts may be playing 12 road games next season, but that doesn't scare Jim Barker. “Mike O'Shea, I know when he was looking at this job (as Argonauts head coach), that was one thing that didn't bother him at all because everything ends up being exactly as it needs to be.” Toronto is set to host six matches at the facility, including a round of 32 elimination game, forcing the Argonauts out of town. The team has elected to play three of their “home” games in their opponent's venue during that stretch, with stops in Hamilton, Winnipeg, and Saskatchewan. They will also run operations out of the University of Guelph until the international soccer tournament concludes, which Barker chooses to view in a positive light. While the Argonauts will host a preseason game in Guelph, as they have in years past, the team elected not to play regular-season games there or at any other alternative venue. The franchise and its owners, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, have been roundly criticized for that decision, which is in stark contrast to the B.C. Lions, who will also be unable to play at BC Place during the World Cup. That organization is playing two games at a temporary facility in Kelowna, exposing its product to a different section of the fanbase. Barker doesn't get caught up in those discussions and learned long ago that success comes from controlling what you can control. No team's ever done what we're going to do. We're going to be on the road till August. Franchise quarterback Chad Kelly was unable to play all season due to a fractured leg he suffered in the East Final the previous year, giving way to Nick Arbuckle, who threw for 4,370 yards, 26 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions to be named the team's candidate for Most Outstanding Player. Toronto ranked ninth in attendance with average crowds of 15,109, which was a 0.1 percent decrease from the previous year.

Danish Barcelona defender Andres Christensen will be out for an extended period after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury during training. The injury could also rule him out of the World Cup should Denmark qualify. 

Andreas Christensen has been haunted by injuries in recent years, and now another chapter has been added to the history of injuries for the unfortunate Danish international defender from FC Barcelona 

"AC' has been injured in training and scans have now shown that he has partially torn his cruciate ligament", says FC Barcelona on their website. 

FC Barcelona writes that Andreas Christensen twisted his knee during Saturday's training and that he will not undergo surgery in the first place, as they have chosen a 'conservative treatment'.

This means that he will be out for several months and thus miss the upcoming highly important matches for Denmark in the World Cup playoff qualification. </p>

The organizers of the FIFA World Cup games in Seattle have either never learned about effective sports diplomacy or are too arrogant to care. And so, the group has taken it upon itself to unofficially brand the sporting event with messages, and artwork, of LGBT inclusion. Both Iran and Egypt have lodged complaints about SeattleFWC26's actions with FIFA. That's unlikely, because the Seattle group has gone full bore on connecting soccer and sexual orientation.

But not at the hands of professional soccer players. Its rules prohibit discrimination on all the usual grounds, from race to gender, religion, opinion, sexual orientation and more. The Iranian state's violent and murderous homophobia is abhorrent. The Iranian people, however, are not the Iranian regime — and most (around 80 per cent, according to a June 2024 survey) reject their political leaders. Iranians are acutely aware of what happens to the country's dissidents. The state may well publicly hang them from a crane. “Crimes” as minuscule as insulting the Prophet or criticizing the government regularly land young men and women in prison, often with death sentences. Laws prohibiting “debauchery” are used to oppress gays and lesbians, even if homosexuality isn't explicitly outlawed. Iran and Egypt are places where challenging state orthodoxy, on sexual orientation or anything else, won't just get you “cancelled” or criticized on the internet — it might very well get you killed. A “Pride” soccer match in Seattle is not going to change any of this. It is pure hubris for these activists to taint the apolitical nature of sports. It is these Seattle activists who are the ones in need of education, both about why the non-partisanship of sports is sacred and about what real struggle looks like. A hint: it does not look like privileged westerners with a saviour complex attempting to bait and provoke repressive regimes at the expense of athletes who've trained their entire lives for the glory of competing in the World Cup.

Former Manchester United boss, Sir Alex Ferguson, has named Brazil as the country to beat in the FIFA World Cup 2026.

But he believes that Cristiano Ronaldo-led Portugal is the country that could beat Brazil to win the World Cup.

Ferguson sees Brazil, now managed by former Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as one of the favourites for the title.

He believes the South American football powerhouse has all it takes to win the World Cup.

Ferguson, who dominated the Premier League for many years, told Press Box PR how he worked with Brazilian twin, Rafael and Fabio at Manchester United.

“Portugal have got good players. I always think of Brazil at the World Cup. The Brazilian players—I had the two young lads, twins, Rafael and Fabio,” he said.

“I think whoever beats Brazil will win the World Cup.”

Argentina defeated France to win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar with the focus being on two superstars from Paris Saint-Germain, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.
