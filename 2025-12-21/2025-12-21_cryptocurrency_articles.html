                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's price may still dominate headlines, but among analysts and institutional strategists, attention is quietly shifting elsewhere. Instead of debating whether Bitcoin can reclaim upside momentum in the near term, market observers are increasingly focused on a deeper question: whether the structural signals that once reliably guided Bitcoin's four-year cycle are beginning to fracture. On the one hand, some believe Bitcoin is entering a traditional post-peak correction. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades argues that recent price behavior has already challenged one of Bitcoin's most dependable seasonal assumptions. “BTC Looking ahead, Q1 is generally a good quarter for Bitcoin, but so was Q4, and that one didn't quite work out this time. Q1 2026 is where Bitcoin has a chance to show whether the 4-year cycle persists or not,” he wrote. Rather than signaling a definitive breakdown, the underperformance suggests friction. That structural tension is also visible in US spot market data. On-chain data highlights the need for cautious interpretation, as Bitcoin exchange inflows surge to levels historically associated with late-cycle behavior. “Monthly exchange flows have surged to $10.9 billion, the highest since May 2021. High exchange flows like this signify increased selling pressure, as investors move assets onto exchanges to liquidate positions, take profits, or hedge against downturns. Historically, similar spikes have coincided with profit-taking phases rather than early accumulation periods. On-chain analyst Ali Charts argues that despite structural changes, Bitcoin's timing symmetry remains striking. “Bitcoin's price cycles have followed a strikingly consistent pattern, both in timing and magnitude. Fundstrat's Head of Crypto Strategy Sean Farrell acknowledged near-term pressures while maintaining a longer-term bullish framework. “Bitcoin is currently in a valuation ‘no man's land',” Farrell said, citing ETF redemptions, selling by original holders, miner pressure, and macro uncertainty. According to Lark Davis, Timmer believes Bitcoin's October peak marked both a price and time top, with “2026… a down year” and support forming in the $65,000–$75,000 range. Together, these perspectives show why analysts are no longer fixated solely on Bitcoin price. The pioneer crypto's next move may not decide who was bullish or bearish, but whether the framework that has defined its market for over a decade still applies at all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin may be down for the year, but it could still be headed to a price of $1 million. Bullish Bitcoin (BTC +0.22%) price targets are nothing new for Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of Strategy (MSTR +4.23%), the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. But it's another to be doing so when the price of Bitcoin is trading more than 30% below its all-time high from October. That's what makes his latest price predictions so stunning. There are a number of key assumptions that Saylor is making in his $1 million price prediction. Most importantly, Saylor is assuming that the pace of Bitcoin institutional adoption will continue to accelerate in coming years. The first big step came back in 2023, when Wall Street started to buy into the idea of Bitcoin as a stand-alone asset class with its own unique risk-reward characteristics. That's setting up nicely for Bitcoin heading into 2026. As Saylor sees it, new products from Wall Street are making it easier than ever to hedge away the volatility of Bitcoin. At the same time, banks and financial institutions are increasingly looking to create new Bitcoin-based financial products, such as new credit products collateralized by Bitcoin. That should help to create even more demand for Bitcoin over time. Another key assumption is that Bitcoin will continue to rival gold as a potential store of value. The moniker "digital gold" is already commonplace, and Bitcoin has at times acted as a safe-haven asset during times of extreme macroeconomic uncertainty. Earlier this year, the fear of higher global tariffs had traders and investors moving their money into gold and Bitcoin. Over time, Saylor sees the market cap of Bitcoin rivaling the market cap of physical gold. The market cap of gold right now is approximately $30 trillion, while the current market cap of Bitcoin is $1.75 trillion. If Saylor is right, this implies a potential 15x to 20x upward move in the valuation of Bitcoin. That easily leads to a price of greater than $1 million for Bitcoin, based on a current price of $87,000. Given Bitcoin's historical track record, it's easy to buy into many of Saylor's core assumptions. If that's true, shouldn't it be performing like physical gold? By way of comparison, gold is up more than 65% for the year. Simply stated, this just shouldn't be happening. Historically, Bitcoin has been prone to four-year cycles of boom and bust. In 2014, 2018, and 2022, the value of Bitcoin plummeted. However, due to the wave of buying from large institutional buyers and the arrival of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, some are now arguing that Bitcoin is headed into an economic supercycle. But is it really possible that Bitcoin's price only goes up from here? The one good sign -- at least, for now -- is that massive Bitcoin treasury companies have not yet started selling their Bitcoin. If they do, it could be time to head for the exits. While Bitcoin could eventually hit a price of $1 million by the end of 2029, the most likely scenario is that it will take much longer. I'm expecting the price of Bitcoin to move higher over the next few years, but I'm also preparing for future volatility ahead, including a possible drawdown in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's no secret that Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack has staked out a spot as perhaps the most hawkish member of the U.S. Federal Reserve since her appointment in 2024 after a career at Goldman Sachs. Next year, however, she will be in a more prominent position to advance those views. The Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets interest rate policy. Among its twelve voting members are four of the Fed's eleven district presidents who serve rotating one-year terms. "My base case is that we can stay here [with rates] for some period of time, until we get clearer evidence that either inflation is coming back down to target or the employment side is weakening more materially," Hammack told the WSJ over the weekend. All things being equal, easier central bank monetary policy is assumed to be good for risk assets like stocks, commodities and bitcoin BTC$88,334.07. While that's surely been the case this year for stocks and commodities like gold and silver — all of whom are at or near record highs — bitcoin has struggled, beginning a tumble from its own all-time record not long after the Fed's first rate cut in September. That's a massively wide delta between two of 2026's key policy-setters. Wherever rates go in 2026, there are sure to be dissents on what is typically a unanimous or near-unanimous vote. ‘DeFi is dead': Maple Finance's CEO says onchain markets will swallow Wall Street Disclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Volatility is nothing new for crypto investors, and 2025 has been a wild ride, with bitcoin climbing above $125,000 in October before experiencing several sharp drops — peak to trough, a decline of over $40,000 from its record high. "Crypto is a volatile asset class, and in some sense, there is no avoiding that volatility," said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management company which runs one of the largest bitcoin ETFs, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). "It's an alternative asset class, and we are seeking its particular return characteristics," he said. Bitcoin is now trading near $88,000, and whether the next move is up or down, investors in the crypto space need to have what it takes to stomach the volatility. There may be some help — in the form of new market ideas and classic diversification concepts — to cushion portfolios from at least some of crypto's risk-on nature. These are some of the ideas to consider. Some financial advisors are going out on a limb and telling investors to hold as much as 40% in crypto. This can vary by an individual's age, income, risk profile and other factors, but a good rule of thumb is to allocate no more than 5% of a well-balanced portfolio to crypto. Even so, many investors opt for a smaller allocation, often in the 1% to 3% range. Consider dialing down the risk level in your other holdings. David Siemer, co-founder and chief executive of Wave Digital Assets, an investment advisory firm specializing in digital asset management, emphasized the importance of ensuring the rest of an investor's portfolio is aligned to help maintain volatility at a comfortable level. "Because [crypto's] going to give you either rocket fuel or the opposite, you probably want to be a little heavier on value stocks or bonds, for example," he said. Bitcoin is the largest digital asset by market capitalization, but there are many others with valuable use cases, Pandl said. Adding exposure within a crypto portfolio to ether and the solana cryptocurrency, for instance, "can be a way to make sure you're capturing all of these trends in your portfolio," he said. This approach may improve risk-adjusted returns in the same way diversification improves risk-adjusted returns in other asset classes, Pandl added. Still, investors need to recognize that other types of crypto are highly correlated to bitcoin, so there's only so much diversification within crypto itself that's possible, Siemer said. Other advisors caution that many of the non-bitcoin digital assets becoming popular still trade more like tech stocks than stores of value. It is too soon to know how their trading will evolve, investment advisor Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, told CNBC's "ETF Edge" earlier this year, and they may remain more closely hitched to the risk-on market trade than bitcoin itself does over time. It takes time for advisors and investors to get comfortable with where it fits in a diversified portfolio. The crypto ETF landscape has significantly expanded since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024. Investors should expect many more ETFs to launch in the next year, which will provide additional options for consumers and opportunities for diversification, Pandl said. Investors can also now take an index-based approach within ETFs, which is a convenient way to gain diversification in crypto, while managing volatility. Grayscale has an index fund, the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC) that became available as an ETF in September and holds a basket of the top five crypto assets weighted by market capitalization. Seventy-five percent of the assets were bitcoin as of Dec. 8, but that automatically rebalances based on market capitalization, Pandl said. The recently launched Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (BITW) holds 10 crypto assets including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana, chainlink and litecoin. But as with the Grayscale crypto index fund, it is important for investors to understand that holdings remain heavily weighted to the more established cryptocurrencies. BITW allocates 90% of its holdings to bitcoin and ether. Use a financial advisor who is crypto friendly. One of the ways to encourage diversification — and shield against big portfolio swings — is to work with a financial advisor who can help you craft an appropriately diversified portfolio that includes crypto. Not all advisors incorporate crypto into their model portfolios, but that's starting to change as digital assets gain traction. Thryve Wealth Management, for example, uses bitcoin as a hedge against the U.S. dollar. Randol W. Curtis, chief investment officer, said if inflation continues at 2.5% to 3%, that's a significant erosion of the U.S. dollar's purchasing power. "Every bitcoin will be worth more and more dollars every year that the dollar inflates away," Curtis said. Ric Edelman, who runs the Digital Assets Council of Financial Advisors, told CNBC earlier this year that crypto's mainstream adoption phase is occurring at a time when investors need to hold equities later in life than ever before to achieve retirement income security, and bonds are not able to serve in the same role as they did throughout the 20th century. As the asset allocation model shifts away from the classic 60% stock/40% bond approach, crypto needs to play a bigger role in investing, he says. There are now crypto ETFs offering an income component to perform some of the functions that bonds once did within a portfolio, including Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI) and a planned bitcoin income fund from the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock. Dollar cost average and rebalance in the crypto market. Another way to reduce crypto's volatility is dollar cost averaging, which involves systematic weekly or monthly purchases of crypto. That way, whether it's going up or going down, you're buying in at various prices, which will reduce the volatility, said Steve Larsen, president of Columbia Advisory Group and co-founder of the Certified Digital Asset Advisor designation. He gives the hypothetical example of an investor who holds 5% of his portfolio in bitcoin, which rises to 7% based on market appreciation. Advisors have professional tools to automatically rebalance portfolios. "The reason people get stunned with bitcoin is they don't treat it like anything else," said Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management. Treat crypto like any other asset class," he said. Johnson points to previous market cycles where investors made risky bets based on unbridled optimism. "There are people who lost their entire savings because they thought there was no way General Motors could go bankrupt." Some investors who want to dabble in crypto, but who prefer downside protection, might consider a principal protected note, a financial instrument that returns the principal amount invested at maturity regardless of the underlying asset's price movement. Calamos Investments, for example, launched the first "downside protection" crypto ETF in January, the Calamos Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOJ). The fund company offers multiple ETFs using this strategic approach with different levels of downside protection — 100%, 90% or 80%. But some investors prefer to use professional managers versus investing on their own directly, Siemer said. "For some people, doing it in a simple product that's easy to buy has value," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a recent evaluation, the Bitcoin price structure suggests that a deeper correction looks to be on the horizon for the market leader. According to the market analyst, the price outlook of BTC is tilting towards a bearish scenario, especially as selling pressure remains evident on the chart. CryptoOnchain said that the price of Bitcoin is hovering around the key Point of Control (POC) level. For context, the point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest volume of trading activity within a given period, thereby serving as a significant support or resistance zone. CryptoOnchain identified this region, which was the last cycle's peak, as a critical “support flip,” where buyers might look to step in aggressively. However, the market pundit warned that holding the $70,000 – $73,000 zone might be critical in preventing an even deeper correction and an extended bear market for the Bitcoin price. In essence, this “support flip” is crucial for BTC to resume its long-term bullish structure and preserve the macro trend. Hence, a return to this price level might be a tad familiar to investors, albeit it would also represent an almost 20% decline from the current price point. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $88,330, reflecting no significant price change in the past 24 hours. Select reference data provided by FactSet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Legislative measures proposing the use of blockchain in managing the Philippine national budget have been filed in both chambers of Congress, led by Senator Paolo Benigno A. Aquino IV in the Senate and Representative Javier Miguel L. Benitez of Negros Occidental's Third District in the House of Representatives. • Aligned with the theme of Trust, Transformation, and Transparency, the 4th SGV Tax Symposium held in October featured a presentation on blockchain, highlighting recent developments and practical government use cases aimed at improving transparency and efficiency in public-sector operations. Blockchain technology, a decentralized digital ledger that enables secure, immutable record-keeping, has gained global prominence across multiple industries. Industries such as finance, supply chain management, healthcare and public administration increasingly rely on blockchain to automate operations, ensure data integrity, and strengthen trust. Pilot initiatives and consultations are underway to assess how blockchain technology can enhance government services, ensure accountability, and build public trust through tamper-resistant digital records. These developments were highlighted during SGV's 4th Tax Symposium, where Armand N. Cajayon, SGV Principal under Technology Consulting, discussed the role of blockchain in public financial management, particularly in relation to the national budget. His discussion covered blockchain fundamentals, public-sector-use cases, and global examples demonstrating its impact. The measure seeks to enhance transparency, accountability, and public trust by making government spending traceable and auditable in near real time through a public portal. Access would be extended to citizens, journalists, and watchdog organizations. 1506, otherwise known as the Citizen Access and Disclosure of Expenditures for National Accountability or CADENA Bill. The revised bill calls for the creation of a digital budget portal to serve as the official and publicly accessible portal for all public budget data, which should be in an open-source, interoperable, tamper-resistant and structured digital format. 4380, has also been filed by Representative Javier Miguel L. Benitez of Negros Occidental's Third District. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology in which all participants maintain synchronized copies of transaction records. Transactions are encrypted and validated through consensus mechanisms, making alterations extremely difficult. Unlike centralized systems, no single entity controls the ledger. Smart contracts, such as self-executing code embedded in the blockchain, enable automated, rules-based transactions that further reduce human intervention and operational risk. Applied to public financial management, and as discussed during the Tax Symposium, blockchain offers several advantages: • Trust: Multiple validation points reduce reliance on single authorities. • Modernization: Integration with digital payment systems improves fund disbursement and control. However, Mr. Cajayon pointed out that blockchain is not universally applicable as it does not always operate in real time, particularly in large networks where validation may take longer. Implementing blockchain also requires substantial investment, making careful evaluation essential. As a framework for evaluating suitability, he outlined a five-point test focused on key conditions: the involvement of multiple parties; the importance of trust among participants; the management of finite resources; reliance on shared and complex business logic; and processes that operate across an extended business network. Blockchain delivers clear value only when all these conditions are present. Even if enabling legislation is passed, nationwide implementation would be gradual. Mr. Cajayon outlined a phased roadmap beginning with a feasibility and alignment stage during which high-value cases would be identified and key stakeholders aligned, followed by a pilot development phase focused on building permissioned pilots with key agencies. The initiative would then move into expanding participation and adding smart contract pilots. An inter-agency working committee led by the DICT would manage technical standards, security protocols and overall project execution. To illustrate blockchain's practical benefits, Mr. Cajayon cited the case of Toronto, which processed over two million interdivisional transactions in 2018, requiring extensive manual reconciliation, and delaying financial reporting. The city implemented a pilot blockchain proof of concept, which consolidated data from multiple systems, digitized asset tracking, classified expenditures and automated reporting. Manual reconciliation time dropped from approximately 160 hours to nearly zero. Improved expenditure tracking increased forecast accuracy, enhanced transparency, and provided timely insights into asset utilization. While Mr. Cajayon concluded that blockchain is not a silver bullet that cannot, by itself, guarantee good governance, its effectiveness ultimately depends on how it is implemented and how citizens engage with it. Technology can enable transparency, but accountability requires informed and vigilant stakeholders. For blockchain to meaningfully improve public financial management in the Philippines, it must be paired with active citizen participation, institutional discipline and sustained political will.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum trades near $2,977 as Binance staking wallets move ETH and liquidation heatmaps show pressure above $3,000. Ethereum hovered near $2,977 as traders tracked big Binance staking wallet moves, repeated support retests, and liquidation pressure building above spot. Together, the charts frame a market watching whether ETH can hold key levels and challenge nearby resistance. Arkham's transfer page shows multiple large Ethereum outflows between two Binance labeled wallets, “Binance: Eth2 Staking (0xF17)” and “Binance: Eth2 Staking (0xBdD).” The log includes recent transfers of 80,000 ETH marked “1 day ago” and another 80,000 ETH marked “5 days ago,” alongside older moves such as 20,000 ETH and 70,000 ETH around three months ago. A social media post circulating with the screenshot claimed Binance “staked $500 million worth of ETH this week” and called the activity “bullish for Ethereum.” However, the screenshot itself shows wallet to wallet movements between Binance staking labeled addresses, so it does not, on its own, prove new staking demand from external users or net new ETH entering Binance staking. The same post also included a promotional line asking readers not to forget to “drop your sol wallet address.” Meanwhile, the on chain view shown in the image focuses on Ethereum transfers and does not reference Solana wallets or any giveaway mechanics. Meanwhile, Ethereum traded near $2,977 on the ETH USDT 2 hour Binance chart after returning above a highlighted support zone, according to a TradingView screenshot shared by DonnieBTC on X. The chart shows ETH rebounding from a sharp mid week drop and then revisiting the same price band several times. Price action also remains capped by a descending trendline that links earlier highs, while several shaded bands above current levels mark nearby resistance areas on the chart. DonnieBTC wrote that Ethereum has moved back above the highlighted zone “for a few times now.” He added that he is watching whether ETH can reclaim the area and hold it, and he said the outlook improves if price sustains above that band. In this type of heatmap, brighter colors usually mark larger pools of leveraged positions that could be forced closed if price trades into that zone, because liquidations tend to trigger around common leverage entry points and stop levels. CW wrote that “high leverage short positions on ETH will be liquidated soon.” Liquidations only occur if price moves into those levels, so the heatmap shows where pressure may appear, not a guarantee that ETH will reach it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In today's interview with Josip Heit, Senior Strategy Advisor at Apertum Blockchain, we explore how Layer 1 took its first real steps from vision to a living, breathing ecosystem. Over the past year, Apertum has reached remarkable heights, connecting ordinary users, entrepreneurs, and developers to next generation blockchain infrastructure. We look back at how Bitcoin and Ethereum started, especially their first mining years, and recall the defamations, insults, and arrogance of the big guys back then versus what they are doing today. Finally, we examine Apertum's place in this story and the bold path it is charting for the future. In its latest security audit conducted by CertiK, the largest Web3 security services provider, Apertum achieved an extraordinarily rare result with zero vulnerabilities identified — a feat seldom seen for any Layer-1 blockchain. The first year of Bitcoin mining looked like this: • Block reward: 50 BTC per block • Block time: about 10 minutes • So roughly 7,200 Bitcoin per day being mined, almost all by a tiny group of early adopters. People were mining digital coins that the world considered a joke. • Gas fees were low at first, but nobody had any idea that one day people would pay $50 just to move a token during peak mania. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum had something in common in their early mining years: They were for the few. We asked a totally different question: “What if the first years of a blockchain are not reserved for the elite miners, but are intentionally designed to onboard normal people, businesses, and communities — through tools they can actually understand?” So instead of: • “Download this weird software, open ports, join shady mining pools…” we said: • Connect to Apertum through platforms people already use. • Make staking, yield strategies, DeFi, and automation available through a clean, transparent environment. • Partner with third-party platforms, but keep our own chain as the transparent settlement and accountability layer. Bitcoin's first year belonged to a tiny group of early miners. Apertum's first years are designed to belong to builders, affiliates, entrepreneurs, and ordinary users — not just hardware farms. Now let's talk about the fun part: How the world's biggest voices tried to kill this entire industry. The defamation era: When Bitcoin was “fraud”, “rat poison”, and “money laundering index” In 2017, the CEO of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, publicly called Bitcoin a “fraud” and said it would “blow up” and “won't end well.” He even said he would fire any trader at his bank who dared to trade Bitcoin, calling them “stupid.” Let's be clear: These are not anonymous Twitter trolls. These are the people who move trillions of dollars. That is defamation level rhetoric — public humiliation of an entire emerging technology and everyone who believed in it. • BlackRock has one of the most successful Bitcoin ETFs on the planet, positioning Bitcoin as a kind of “digital gold” and an “alternative asset.” Larry Fink now openly says he had to “relook at his assumptions” and that crypto has a role similar to gold. • JPMorgan — after years of its CEO calling Bitcoin “worthless”, “a fraud”, a “pet rock” — now allows clients to buy Bitcoin through the bank and see it in their statements. • In 2018, it was “rat poison squared.” • In 2025, the same institutions are taking fees to sell it to their clients. They went from: “Stay away, it's a fraud.” to “Here is our premium Bitcoin exposure product, sir, would you like the gold package or the platinum one?” Ethereum had a different kind of defamation. It was called: • “A bubble of useless tokens,” • “a playground for speculation,” • “expensive and slow,” • “a chain you can't seriously build finance on because gas can explode.” And… a lot of that criticism had some truth in it. • There were projects with no real business model. But out of that chaos came: • Stablecoins, • DeFi primitives, • NFTs, • and the idea that anything — not just money — can live on a blockchain. The Ethereum story taught us something important: Raw innovation without structure creates huge opportunity and huge confusion. Apertum exists in the generation after that. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel. If Bitcoin showed the world that money can be digital, scarce, and borderless, and Ethereum showed that logic and assets can live on-chain, then Apertum is about something else: Connecting people to this world without needing them to become full-time quants, coders, or day traders. • An ecosystem that integrates with third-party platforms — like exchanges, OTC desks, staking pools, and automated strategies — while keeping all the accounting and proof on-chain. • An environment where membership systems, affiliate structures, bots, and DeFi tools can plug in — but where the rules are visible, not hidden. Where Bitcoin's first miners printed coins on CPUs, Apertum's early participants validate, stake, contribute, and build: • They might run nodes, • participate in staking pools, • use automated strategies connected to Apertum, • or join memberships that give them access to tools – with all flows tracked transparently on-chain. The idea is simple: Make sophisticated strategies and infrastructure accessible to people who do not have the time or knowledge to build everything themselves — but who still want sovereignty and transparency. Let's compare the models in simple terms. Bitcoin – First Year • Mining = run software + have hardware + almost no competition. • Distribution = concentrated in the hands of those who understood very early. Ethereum – First Year • Mining again = hardware, GPUs, technical knowledge. • Distribution = still technical heavy, plus early whales from the ICO. Both networks slowly moved toward: • More institutional dominance, • Larger players running more of the infrastructure, • And professional miners / validators taking the majority share. Apertum – Early Years Apertum's approach is different by design: 1 Accessibility over hardware dominance 2 Hybrid ecosystem 3 Incentives aligned with contribution 4 Proof-of-Transparency culture We are learning from 15+ years of crypto history — and refusing to repeat the same mistakes. I want you to notice a pattern: • When Bitcoin was young and weak, it was easy to attack. But we now have a playbook: 1 Document everything on-chain. 2 Work with partners, but keep the ledger of truth on Apertum. The same way Bitcoin outlived being called a “fraud”, our job is to outlive whatever label people try to stick on Apertum. You can insert your exact numbers here, but I'll phrase it conceptually: • We went from an idea to a functioning ecosystem. • We connected real users to on-chain infrastructure via partners, memberships, bots, and DeFi components. In 2025, Bitcoin became a respectable asset on Wall Street. In 2025, Apertum started becoming a respectable infrastructure for people outside of Wall Street. Here's how I see the next years: 1 From tools to standards 2 From early adopters to mainstream users 3 From defensive posture to confident leadership 4 Interoperability and being the backbone We are not competing with Bitcoin as “money”. We are not competing with Ethereum as “developer playground”. If in 2009 I told you: “One day the CEO BlackRock of the world's biggest asset manager will promote Bitcoin as an alternative to gold, and the biggest banks will sell Bitcoin products to their richest clients…” …you would have laughed. Apertum is still in its early chapters. We haven't written our full story yet. So as we finish 2025, I want to say this to every builder, every early adopter, every partner in this ecosystem: • Don't be surprised when they attack. • Don't be shocked when they call it names. Instead: • Know your history — Bitcoin and Ethereum went through the same fire. • Know your mission — Apertum is here to make advanced infrastructure accessible and transparent. Only hard work, clear rules, and on-chain truth. One day, if we do this right, the same people who laugh today will quietly adopt our standards tomorrow. And when that day arrives, you will be able to look back at these early calls and say: “I was there when Apertum was a vision. I didn't wait for the banks to approve it. Thank you for being part of this journey. Thank you for building, even when it would be easier to just consume. It's just Block 1 of something much bigger. Now, it stands ready to shape the next chapter of blockchain infrastructure. Every participant, every builder, and every partner contributes to a future where sophisticated strategies are accessible to everyone, trust is anchored in on-chain transparency rather than empty promises, and technology empowers rather than intimidates. Apertum is poised to set new standards for what a modern, inclusive, and resilient blockchain ecosystem can achieve, and the coming years promise innovation, growth, and impact on a global scale.

Billionaire crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes just initiated a new crypto purchase.

Analysts at Lookonchain say Hayes moved $3.53 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) in just over 24 hours.

Approximately $1.5 million of the ETH was sent to the institutional crypto asset firm Galaxy, suggesting Hayes may be looking to sell.

Meanwhile, Hayes used a portion of the $2.03 million in ETH that was not sent to Galaxy to purchase 1.22 million Ethena (ENA) tokens worth about $257,000 at time of publishing.

Amid the shuffle, Hayes noted he's executing a rotation out of ETH on X.

“We are rotating out of ETH and into high-quality DeFi names, which we believe can outperform as fiat liquidity improves.”

Ethena's ENA is the governance token for the Ethena protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native synthetic dollar called USDe.

Hayes has since been an investor in and promoter of the protocol since 2023, when he became a founding advisor through his family office Maelstrom and received ENA tokens in exchange.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Blockchain Association led a broad industry push this week, asking Senate Banking leaders to resist efforts that would widen a ban on stablecoin yields beyond what Congress wrote into law. According to the association, the letter was signed by more than 125 crypto and fintech groups and companies and was sent to lawmakers to warn against reinterpreting the new rules in a way that would also bar exchanges and apps from offering rewards tied to stablecoin holdings. The coalition's argument rests on the text of the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law earlier this year by US President Donald Trump and explicitly bars permitted stablecoin issuers from paying interest or yield directly to holders. Reports have disclosed that the statute nevertheless leaves room for third-party platforms to provide incentives, a distinction industry groups say is intentional and important for competition. A coalition led by the American Bankers Association and other banking trade groups asked Congress to clarify that the prohibition should extend to partners and affiliates, arguing that third-party rewards could circumvent the law and drain deposits from traditional banks. According to recent coverage, Treasury analyses cited by bank advocates estimate that stablecoins could, in some scenarios, pull over $6 trillion from bank deposits — a figure that has become central to the banks' case for tightening the rules. Industry spokespeople say expanding the ban would chill new services that rely on stablecoins and would tilt the market toward larger, incumbent financial firms that already control many payment rails. Supporters of stronger limits say the aim is consumer protection — to stop stablecoin arrangements from becoming de-facto interest accounts that could undermine the banking system and reduce loans to households and businesses. Other observers point out the issue could also shape which firms win in payments going forward, since restrictions on rewards would affect the commercial incentives of exchanges and fintechs. Senate Banking staff are weighing letters from both sides as they consider potential fixes or clarifying language during upcoming hearings. Regulators who must implement the GENIUS Act have been urged to issue rules that prevent evasion of the ban, and lawmakers may face pressure to either leave the law as written or to craft narrow changes aimed at banks' concerns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine a single government decision rippling through the tech world, sending stock prices soaring and reshaping the future of industries as diverse as cryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence. Stick with me as we unpack what's driving this surge, what it signals for the future, and how you can position yourself in a rapidly evolving landscape. Announced earlier this month, this evaluation focuses on whether the high-performance chip—crucial for AI applications and cryptocurrency mining—should face stricter export controls due to national security concerns. Nvidia, a titan in the GPU space, has seen its stock (NVDA) surge by over 5% in recent trading sessions, reflecting investor optimism despite the uncertainty, as reported by Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin, the bellwether of digital assets, is holding steady at $87,920 as of today, though it's down slightly by 0.18% over the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Ethereum, a key player in decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi, dipped 0.35% to $2,966.54. On the flip side, privacy-focused Monero (XMR) has spiked by an impressive 4.95% to $459.88, possibly reflecting heightened interest in secure transactions amid regulatory noise. The total crypto market cap stands at a robust $3.07 trillion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $56.46 billion, underscoring the market's resilience even as the Fear & Greed Index lingers at a cautious “Extreme Fear” level of 20, according to Alternative.me. The H200 chip is a powerhouse for GPU-intensive mining operations, especially for coins like Ethereum (before its full transition to Proof-of-Stake) and other altcoins. Any restriction on its availability could send shockwaves through mining communities, potentially driving up costs and reshaping network dynamics. For now, the market is watching—and NVDA investors are betting big. Start trading with a trusted platform to stay ahead of the curve. A favorable outcome could cement Nvidia's dominance in AI and blockchain tech, pushing stock prices even higher. Conversely, stringent controls might limit international sales, denting revenue and shaking investor confidence. According to Bloomberg, analysts are split, with some projecting a short-term dip if restrictions tighten, while others see Nvidia's diversified portfolio as a buffer. For crypto investors, the stakes are just as high. This might lead to reduced network security for some blockchains due to lower hashrates—a concern for anyone invested in altcoins reliant on GPU mining. On the flip side, larger mining firms might consolidate power, potentially driving innovation in efficiency. This is a moment for strategic vigilance, not knee-jerk reactions. Nvidia has long been a linchpin in the tech ecosystem, dominating the market for GPUs used in everything from gaming to data centers. The US government's scrutiny isn't coming out of nowhere. Chips like the H200 aren't just tools—they're strategic assets in a global tech race. For the crypto world, this hits close to home. Mining operations, especially for Proof-of-Work coins, rely heavily on GPU technology. While Ethereum's shift to Proof-of-Stake has reduced some of this dependency, other networks still lean on Nvidia's hardware. A restriction on H200 exports could create a supply crunch, driving up prices for existing chips and forcing miners to explore less efficient alternatives. The question is: will Nvidia's market strength and innovation pipeline outweigh these risks? On the bullish side, analysts like Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives argue that Nvidia's leadership in AI and high-performance computing provides a robust safety net. “Even if export controls tighten, the demand for AI-driven solutions across sectors will keep Nvidia at the forefront,” Ives noted in a recent commentary. This view is bolstered by Nvidia's strategic pivot toward AI, which now accounts for a significant chunk of its revenue, per company filings. Some analysts warn that geopolitical risks could weigh heavily on Nvidia's international growth. Mining expert Chris Burniske, a well-known figure in blockchain analysis, tweeted recently that “hardware bottlenecks could accelerate centralization in mining, which isn't great for network security or decentralization ideals.” Companies relying on Nvidia's GPUs for AI development—from autonomous vehicles to healthcare analytics—could face delays if supply chains are disrupted. Meanwhile, crypto projects leveraging AI might need to rethink timelines. Want to stay informed and act on these insights? But beyond the headlines, there are deeper financial currents at play. For one, Nvidia's role in the tech ecosystem means its fortunes ripple across markets. A hit to its revenue from export restrictions could dampen sentiment in the broader semiconductor sector, potentially dragging down related stocks. For crypto investors, the financial stakes are tied to mining economics. If H200 chips become scarce or pricier due to export controls, operational costs for miners could spike. This might push smaller players out of the game, consolidating power among larger firms with deeper pockets. According to CoinGecko data, mining profitability for GPU-dependent coins has already been under pressure in 2025 due to energy costs and market volatility. A hardware crunch could exacerbate this trend, impacting token prices and network stability. For savvy investors, this volatility spells opportunity—whether it's buying NVDA on a dip or exploring undervalued altcoins poised to benefit from mining shifts. Here's a snapshot of key crypto metrics to contextualize the market: Diving into the charts, NVDA stock's recent rally shows no immediate signs of slowing, though caution is warranted. This suggests potential for a pullback if momentum wanes. On the crypto side, Bitcoin's price action at $87,920 reflects consolidation after a volatile year. Support levels around $85,000 have held firm, per CoinGecko historical data, while resistance near $90,000 looms large. Ethereum, at $2,966.54, shows similar sideways movement, with its 50-day moving average acting as a key pivot point. Monero's 4.95% jump stands out, potentially driven by breakout volume as privacy coins gain traction amid regulatory scrutiny. In crypto, Bitcoin's stability suggests it's a safer bet during uncertainty, while Monero's surge might appeal to risk-takers. If you're looking to act on these technical signals, start trading now with a platform designed for precision and speed. In a bullish scenario, regulators opt for minimal restrictions, allowing Nvidia to expand its GPU market share and deepen AI integration across industries. This could propel NVDA stock to new highs, with some analysts projecting a 15-20% upside over the next 12 months, per Wedbush Securities forecasts. For crypto, accessible hardware would support mining efficiency and spur blockchain innovation. In a bearish outcome, tight export controls could limit Nvidia's reach, reducing market access and pressuring revenue. This might cap NVDA stock growth in the short term, though its AI focus could mitigate long-term damage. Crypto miners, however, would face higher costs and potential network vulnerabilities if hardware becomes scarce. According to a recent JPMorgan analysis, this could accelerate centralization in mining—a trend worth monitoring. Nvidia's diversified portfolio and innovation track record lean toward resilience, even under regulatory pressure. The interplay between tech policy and market dynamics will shape 2026—stay tuned. The Nvidia H200 is a high-performance GPU designed for tasks like AI model training and cryptocurrency mining. How could export restrictions on the H200 impact cryptocurrency mining? This might reduce profitability, lower network hashrates, and potentially centralize mining power among larger players with alternative resources, per industry analysis. NVDA stock has rallied over 5% recently, reflecting optimism, per Yahoo Finance data. Analysts are split—some see upside due to Nvidia's AI focus, while others caution against geopolitical headwinds. How are Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies affected by this news? Bitcoin remains stable at $87,920 with a slight 0.18% dip, while Ethereum is down 0.35% to $2,966.54, based on CoinGecko data. Monitor regulatory updates closely, diversify investments across sectors, and avoid overexposure to any single asset. Technical indicators can guide short-term moves, while long-term strategies should focus on resilience. For actionable steps, open an account to stay agile in volatile markets. Nvidia's GPUs power AI across industries like healthcare, automotive, and finance. Export restrictions could delay projects reliant on H200 chips, slowing innovation timelines and affecting companies partnered with Nvidia, as noted in recent industry commentary.
