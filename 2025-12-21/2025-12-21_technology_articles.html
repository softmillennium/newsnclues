When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. IMEC has successfully demonstrated the full wafer-scale fabrication of nanopores using ASML's state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. Described by ASML's communications chief as an “unexpectedly awesome biomedical application,” of his firm's machinery, this could be an important advance due to the molecular sensing possibilities nanopores open up. As you might have determined from the etymology, nanopores are essentially tiny holes, just a few nanometers wide. In more relatable language, perhaps, these pores have diameters that make them roughly 10,000 times finer than a human hair. Nanopores can be used by biomedical sensors due to the way molecules interact with them. In this way, these EUV fabricated nanopores can act like molecular checkpoints for biomedical sensing. They can detect and determine individual molecules like a virus, protein, or DNA etc. Furthermore, adjusting the solid state nanopore size can also be useful for filtration and molecular data storage applications, indicates IMEC. IMEC's paper describes how it successfully fabricated “highly uniform nanopores with diameters down to ~10nm across full 300mm wafers.” This breakthrough – encompassing mass production, precision, and reproducibility - should put an end to the delays in adoption of nanopore-based sensors. While we applaud the research, and the idea of making precision nanopores more accessible to medical equipment makers, we also understand that ASML EUV equipment isn't that easy to acquire. However, we are slightly reassured by the researchers highlighting that this is a step towards “cost-effective (mass) production,” as surely they will have assessed the costs of getting a 300mm wafer full of nanopores produced at this time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waymo suspended its robotaxi service in San Francisco on Saturday evening after a massive blackout appeared to leave many of its vehicles stalled on city streets. Numerous photos and videos posted to social media captured Waymo robotaxis stalled at roads and intersections as human drivers either passed them by or were stuck behind them. Spokesperson Suzanne Philion provided a similar statement to TechCrunch on Sunday morning. “We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage,” Philion said. “Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon. (In fact, with the blackout affecting both lights and Muni mass transit, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warned residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel.) Others theorized that Waymo might have been affected by an interruption in cell service or traffic data. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E's website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time. You can contact or verify outreach from Anthony by emailing anthony.ha@techcrunch.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a power outage in San Francisco on Saturday, initially leaving 124,000 of 414,000 customers—about 30%—in the dark. It also caused a widespread Waymo meltdown, with apparently all active Waymo robotaxis in the affected parts of the city stuck in robotic comas, blocking intersections and choking traffic on some streets. Power outage took out the waymos RIP pic.twitter.com/DPte8oOGku— Vincent Woo (@fulligin) December 21, 2025 Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion issued a statement at approximately 7:00 p.m., saying service had been “temporarily suspended” due to the outage. “We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work,” Philion said. 6 Waymo's parked at a broken traffic light blocking the roads.

The actual footage of Kit Kat's fatal injury shows one such example. Driverless scenic coastal road trips could soon be possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This change is part of a broader ‘Automotive Package‘ designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive. If the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors. “If Europe doesn't compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.” Douglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Their appeal wasn't enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for many years to come.” Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage. Issam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. To be fair, the Commission hasn't completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security. The plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe's battery industry.” Still, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU's commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed something called the Responsible AI Safety and Education (Raise) Act, meant to, on one hand, establish an AI safety regime, and on another, troll Silicon Valley Republicans like Marc Andreessen who have been trying to dictate tech policy during the second Trump Administration. This comes just days after President Trump sent out an executive order that ostensibly blocks states from regulating AI. According to the new state law, AI companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue must draft, publish, and follow formalized sets of safety procedures aimed at preventing “critical harm,” and will have to report safety issues within 72 hours or be hit with fines, which makes it stricter than California's SB 53, which gives companies 15 days to report safety issues.About a week ago on December 11, the Trump executive order called “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” framed AI as a federal priority and outlined something called an “AI Litigation Task Force” at the Department of Justice. This task force will ostensibly have the job of challenging state AI laws determined to be in violation of the federal program on AI (basically doing nothing) according to the attorney general. Even if the executive order turns out to lack a strong legal foundation, tying state laws up in legislation is still a dreary prospect, but New York State has rushed headlong into that eventuality with this law. In an explainer for Axios published Friday, legal experts talking to Maria Curi and Ashley Gold averred that Trump's executive order relies on a strange reading of parts of the Constitution, such as the Dormant Commerce Clause, which is usually interpreted as an attempt to prevent states from writing self-dealing laws that are unfair to other states—not laws that are simply meant to fill a legal vacuum left by the federal government Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

So, one would assume that the same company would be able to create a device that can do the same gunk removal on your face, right? That was my initial thought when I tested out the new Shark FacialPro Glow, which came out in early October. SharkNinja, the maker of Shark FacialPro Glow, claims it can improve the overall look of your skin, tighten pores, and boost hydration and circulation. In my head, I had images of running the device across my face as it suctioned all the grime out of my pores and left me feeling fresh like a professionally cleaned home. If you are serious about skincare and you don't want to pay for a professional facial, then give the Shark FacialPro Glow a shot. But before you go out and purchase a $400 FacialPro Glow, it's worth understanding how it works and what we actually know about what it is doing to your skin. So, it's worth first naming them and what they are meant to do. Power Hub: This connects and powers both attachments. It charges via a USB-C cable that's provided. And that only lasts for about the length of one facial session, give or take. Its two modes deliver hot and cold temperature to the skin from a smooth metal upper component that is meant to glide across your face. Contains a powered suction-like device similar to a pore vacuum that pulls oil, blackheads, dead skin, and debris from pores and can infuse water and other substances into the skin. It contains glycolic acid, a type of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), which helps exfoliate rough skin, retain moisture, and improve cell turnover. It also contains salicylic acid, which breaks up clogged pores and provides an overall anti-inflammatory effect. Hydro Infuse BHA Hydrator: A liquid that gets placed into the exfoliation tank. It mainly contains niacinamide, which strengthens the skin barrier and improves its overall texture. It also contains salicylic acid and a variety of other antioxidants. It doesn't stay together super well, even with the help of an included strap that fits, albeit loosely, around it. I've had periods of time, especially in my 20s, where I was more acne-prone and have used everything under the sun to try to fix it. However, in the past couple of years, my skin has calmed down quite a bit. Given my extremely minimal skin care routine prior to this, I was a bit overwhelmed by all the attachments and gels for the FacialPro Glow. Using it is a multistep process and each step takes a few minutes so the whole thing takes up at least 15 minutes of your time, especially when you have to remember the steps and which order they go in. I now understand why people pay to get facials and have someone else take care of everything. You are basically massaging your face with a heated smooth metal device. I wanted to just carry it around in my pocket with me and use it whenever I felt a pang of stress coming on. What this is designed to do, though, is to allow heat to open up your pores so that the other products that remove dead skin and gunk from your face work better. If you've never used these products before (that was me), this is going to feel a little tingly; apparently that is normal with any AHA products and you shouldn't panic. Add water to the fill tank and your desired tip (gentle or regular; I always went with gentle, but again, my skin is sensitive and fragile so listen to your skin). Choose whichever you prefer, but to me even the lowest level was pretty intense. Place it gently over your skin and turn it on, and you'll quickly feel like an octopus has just attached itself to your skin and is gliding along while simultaneously attempting to suction pieces of your epidermis off. And this is all while the motor is running loudly enough that you feel like you are at a car wash. You do get used to this after a while, but it's odd, to say the least. Once you've done this for three minutes, it's time for the part that I highly anticipated: the gunk check! After suctioning off all your dead skin cells, you can and should open up the gunk tank and see them for yourself. My gunk tank usually looked fairly white and cloudy, and after some research, including this dermatologist's review of the FacialPro Glow, I found that this was likely not all my dead skin cells floating, but perhaps mostly the rest of the Detox Gel that didn't rinse off initially—and maybe some dead skin cells mixed in. The actual science on this is a bit unclear. There are no studies that show infusing the product into the skin via the suction technology is actually any better than just massaging it gently into your face with your hands. The suction device acts almost like a less aggressive pore vacuum, which has a lot of mixed reviews from dermatologists and other skin experts. Many dermatologists actually recommend that you stay away from these types of products because they can be pretty aggressive and don't necessarily have any added benefit for the skin (again there's a lack of research on this topic in general, so it's hard to say). Worst case scenario is that you have very sensitive, delicate skin and they cause little broken blood vessels (this never happened to me), which promotes redness and can make skin conditions like rosacea flare up. Several Gizmodo editors and reporters also said my skin did look very glowing, so it wasn't all just in my head. The cold temperatures are meant to close pores (now that they are clean and glowy) and prevent dirt from getting in and also to reduce any fluid retention. You can use this setting for up to four minutes, according to the instructions, but honestly I think I would have felt pretty similar if I had just splashed some cold water on my face. My skin looked absolutely stunning, to be honest. It was soft and plump in a way that I only get if I'm on vacation on a precisely humidified tropical island. So I can't lie that my skin looked and felt far better than it did before I used Shark's FacialPro Glow. But it's hard to tell what actually made my face so healthy and glowy. This would make sense if there was research to back it up, but right now there just isn't outside of a small clinical trial that involved 60 subjects and was run by SharkNinja itself. On top of that, the two products—the Derm Detox and the Hydro Infuse—do contain ingredients that are proven (through numerous studies) to help improve the look and feel of skin. For $400, I would want to know for sure that it wasn't those products alone that were making my skin look and feel good. And if you were to continue using this on a regular basis, the Detox Gel and Hydro Infuser will eventually run out. Shark doesn't say how long they last, but I'd imagine at least a couple of months. It's unclear if other, similar products would work as well, either. The interesting thing about the FacialPro Glow is that there really isn't anything similar to it on the market, so it's hard to compare it to anything else. If this experiment has taught me anything, it's that I should try out other skincare products, at least a little bit. But whether I need to use heat and cold and suction in addition to that is unclear. And at $400 (plus the ongoing need to replace the Gel and Infuser), it would be a hard sell. But if you've tried it all, and you are still seeking that extra boost to give you healthy glowy skin, the FacialPro Glow + DePuffi is an incredibly good time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Years ago, when venture capitalist Jon Medved took an interest in backing various health tech startups, he had no idea that one day, he would need them to improve his own quality of life. Israel tight-knit startup community received a blow in October when Medved, one of its most famous VCs, announced he was retiring immediately. “This has come rather sudden,” he told TechCrunch in an audibly hoarse voice — a symptom of ALS — on what could be his last interview. “I had been feeling a little weird before and they didn't know what was ailing me,” he explained. “I was in the hospital for several weeks recovering, and that's when they tested me and said, ‘You've got ALS,' which is a horrible disease, the worst you can imagine.” ALS is a condition that degrades the brain's motor neurons, leading to loss of muscle control, eventually impairing walking, talking, eating, and breathing. But he knows that the condition will worsen, and there is no cure, only therapies. He helped usher it in, having moved from California to Israel in his 20s, then founding and selling several tech companies before turning to investing. While Israel has many powerful home-grown VC firms, as well as branches of global firms like Bessemer, OurCrowd essentially invented crowdsourced venture capital, where a limited partnership was open to any accredited investor. Many of them are doctors, lawyers, and ordinary people who not only help their investment companies, but would have otherwise been cut out of the wealth generation that VCs experience. OurCrowd has backed names like Anthropic, Beyond Meat and Lemonade. Medved describes OurCrowd as now a “significant player” backing about 500 portfolio companies with about 74 exits, including an exit a couple of weeks ago when its infrastructure planning startup Locusview sold for $525 million to Itron. Despite Israel's conflict with Gaza, which has impacted its citizens and put the nation in global crosshairs over the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, its startup ecosystem has remained strong. For instance, he's had an avatar made of himself that preserves his voice, face and mannerisms. OurCrowd AI portfolio company D-ID, maker of agents and avatars, partnered with voice AI startup ElevenLabs and other companies through the ALS-focused Scott-Morgan Foundation to create an avatar system designed for people with ALS. “We've made 60, 70 healthcare investments in good companies that help people. We've got a company called OncoHost, which uses AI to help select what kind of immunotherapy will actually work for you …  We have companies doing next-generation sequencing for the genome. “I tell you now as a once-healthy person [who took health for granted] I felt human pain and disease, but once you are actually engaged in one of these nasty diseases, it changes your perspective,” Medved shared. All of this means that, even though he's given up his position running the company and may be retiring from the public eye, “I'm far from over, ok? So I fully intend to not go off [quietly] into this good night.” And in the end, he says “I'm very proud that in a small way, even though all we are is investors, to be part of this movement.” A video featuring Medved's “digital twin” demonstrates just how realistic his avatar already is.

Previously, we reported on Ukraine-based prototypes being tested at up to 50km (~31 miles). Tethered FPV drones are hardened against electronic warfare and allow for deep, precise strikes into enemy territory. Obviously, having a longer reach (without other compromises) is an advantage. The Russians claim to have successfully tested a massive 65 km fiber optic FPV coil.What longer distances will be seen in 2026? The images and videos embedded above were shared by a widely followed Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) account on X. GrandpaRoy2's tweet is followed up by his Telegram source links (an app widely used in Russia). Based on our searches and review of prior reports, PGI Technology is a joint Chinese-Russian technology venture specializing in the development and manufacture of reinforced optical fiber spools for the military. Refinements such as Kevlar, improved windings, new adhesives, and more are touted by PGI Technology in its posts. In civilian life, wireless connectivity is often preferred or deemed necessary. But in war, with advanced electronic warfare (EW) effectively blocking the skies to swarms of deadly drones, simple, reliable tethering wins. Optical fiber enables fiber-optic-guided drones using FPV (first-person view) controls for precise, smart targeting. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Chinese GPU maker Moore Threads just held its MUSA Developer Conference, where it unveiled "Huagang," its next-gen architecture set to debut next year. Huagang will span gaming and AI, with significant performance gains promised for both. The event was light on details, so we don't actually have any specs; just claims of what to expect, and we have a lot to look forward to if these promises are true, such as a 15x uplift in "AAA" gaming and a whopping 50x boost in ray tracing performance. With Lushan, Moore Threads is claiming a 15x uplift in "AAA" gaming — whatever that means (raster?) Another vital improvement to Moore Threads' new GPUs is full support for modern APIs such as DirectX 12 Ultimate, which should alleviate compatibility concerns. There is a dedicated 2nd-gen hardware ray tracing engine, along with a new AI hardware block for the "UniTE" unified rendering architecture, which should bring the GPU's rendering pipeline to parity with offerings from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. Alongside Lushan, Moore Threads also teased the "Huashan" AI GPU, which consists of two chiplets and 8 HBM modules. In terms of connectivity, Moore Threads plans to scale these GPUs across AI factories, with over 100,000 GPUs interconnected at up to 1314 GB/s via the MTLink 4.0 interconnect. While we didn't see any gaming or AI benchmarks for these next-gen GPUs, Moore Threads demonstrated DeepSeek V3 performance on the MTT S5000 GPU, achieving 1000 tokens per second in Decode and 4000 tokens per second in Prefill. These results put it slightly ahead of Nvidia's Hopper lineup, which has historically been the cap for Green Team in China in terms of AI GPUs.

We should learn more about MT's Huagang GPUs in the coming months as the company takes industry giants like Nvidia, Intel, and AMD head-on with a state-backed Chinese alternative that should help fuel the region's self-reliance ambitions.
