      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, Redditors have shared a wealth of opinions and insights. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded cases:
    


      This incident is often cited as one of the most compelling due to the large number of child witnesses.
    


"The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out."

I went to [exec producer] Bob Singer and told him the visuals were coming off like cheesy B movies. In an older interview, Kripke cited "Hook Man," "Route 666," "No Exit," and "Red Sky at Morning" — all of which aired during the first three seasons — as other low points. "Sometimes, you try things that just don't work at all, and because of our time and budget, you don't have the time to go back and re-do them," he said. "You have no choice but to air them in their deformed state, and so you have to live with millions of people watching your mistakes." Like its showrunner, "Supernatural" itself isn't above self-deprecation. In the Season 11 episode "Don't Call Me Shurley," Chuck, aka God (Rob Benedict), describes a negative instant reaction to his autobiography: "Last time I saw that look on an editor's face, I just handed in 'Bugs.'"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SYNTH ANATOMY uses affiliation & partner programs (big red buttons) to finance a part of the activity. Psychic Modulation Phonec3 is a unique retro Lo-Fi inspired Synthesizer plugin that will return in an upgraded version in early 2026. Many virtual analog/analog modeling synthesizers attempt to imitate the sounds of vintage analog instruments, with varying degrees of success. Psychic Modulation took a different, “vintage” approach from the very beginning with its Phonec Synthesizer. A bit like Boards of Canada, or like running an analog modeling synth through an old VHS tape to get a very lush and wobbly lo-fi sound. Psychic Modulation has announced Phonec3 for January 2026, and you can pre-order it now at a special price. Like its predecessors, Phonec3 is a subtractive virtual-analog Synthesizer focused on retro lo-fi sounds. According to Psychic Modulation, they rebuilt Phonec3 from the ground up to make it compatible with newer systems, such as Apple Silicon chips. Phonec3 incorporates many familiar features from Phonec2, along with new additions. The core still consists of two oscillators, a sub-oscillator, and a noise source, including sync, PWM, X-wave, and more. I hope the unique logic mix parameter between OSC1 and OSC2 is still available, enabling per-voice distortion and audio-rate interactions. Then, Phonec3 features a revamped filter section with various modes and built-in overdrive. On the UI teaser, you can see three multi-wave LFOs, the beloved HFO (high-frequency oscillator), three advanced ADSR envelopes, and more. Several small details that are not yet fully known have been added, making the modulation more versatile. Like Phonec2, it also features an arpeggiator and pitch/mod sequencers. These also offer more features on the menu than the previous version, including scale locking for instant melodic harmony. The developer says it has received improvements and undergone rework. It's a unique feature that lets you lo-fi the sound engine with drifting, detuning, and malfunction artifacts. Important note: MPE, which is part of P2, will not be available in Phonec3 from version 1.0. Psychic Modulation does not yet offer a demo or sound demo of Phonec3 because the plugin is in the final phase of development. It's great to see that a new version of Phonec is coming soon, and we will be able to use it again on modern computers with added functionality and hopefully even more Lo-Fi goodness. Psychic Modulation Phonec3 will be available in January 2026. You can pre-order it now for $59 instead of $89 with the code PHONEC3PREORDER at checkout. Existing Phonec2 owners should receive an upgrade offer via email. If not, please get in touch with the developer. Phonec3 will run as a VST/AU plugin on macOS (native Apple Silicon + Intel) + Windows. Aqeel Aadam Outgrowth: a sample manipulation instrument with multiple engines (desktop/iOS) XILS-Lab has today released PolyKB III V3.5, a significant update for its RSF Polykobol II Synthesizer emulation. Talking to hardware synth friends about plugins often comes up with the same answers: just virtual, mouse-or controller-based operation facing a screen, no life in the instruments, etc. KINDZAudio DDZynth2 bundles 5 unusual synthesis types in an experimental Synthesizer plugin made to explore new sonic worlds. Whether free or payware, there are virtual instruments for every budget. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It is a positively ABSURD notion that you cannot critique a 150 million dollar organization because the CEO says they are like a family, and are grieving,” Owens railed on X. “It is the exact same emotional strategy deployed by BLM in the wake of George Floyd's death, when I called out their shady financial dealings.” Erika Kirk has been publicly pushing back for the first time on rampant conspiracy theories flying around the internet from conservative activists about her husband's assassination — among them Owens, once a close friend of Charlie's. In the weeks after Kirk was murdered, Owens suggested Kirk was “betrayed,” accused the federal government of lying about the investigation, and said that Israel may have been involved in Kirk's death. She's repeatedly gone after Erika, who was named CEO of Turning Point USA — the massive conservative activist organization co-founded by Charlie. But the good news is that she is now un-murking the water in terms of her intentions with this massive political organization,” Owens said. Owens shared a clip of Erika Kirk saying that she understands the conspiracy theories about her husband stem from people wanting to find an answer to “something that happened that was so evil.” Kirk said she wants justice but doesn't have time to address the theories. Owens said Kirk's comments are why “Turning Point USA looks so suspicious,” adding at one point: “You don't just get to be widowed into chairman and CEO.” “Don't try to, like, ‘mom' the organization and say, ‘Well, Mother's upset because people are coming after her kids and all of the multimillion-dollar subsidiaries,'” she groaned. And we never asked about whether she was a mother or wife.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday night wrapped up a series of paranormal experiences at the Mackay Mansion in Virginia City. A small business called "Vegas Afterlife" hosted four ticketed events at the historic house for its "Ghosts of Christmas Past" series. The company's founder, Danielle Nicole, said she's been involved with paranormal activity for quite some time. "I had my first paranormal experience at the age of eight," Nicole said. Nicole's parents owned a local community magazine, and she would write paranormal articles for the publication. "They asked if [my parents and I] wanted to go on a paranormal investigation," she said. Nicole said she made contact with a spirit in the lobby while we were there. "There are some people who come in as skeptics. Sometimes the spirits don't like to try to show activity when there are skeptics in the group," she said. Vegas Afterlife's next scheduled event is at Whiskey Pete's Hotel and Casino in Primm on December 27 & 28 and select Saturdays after that. Nicole said they're also planning tours at Benson Grist Mill near Salt Lake City and Mount Wilson Ranch in Pioche, NV.
