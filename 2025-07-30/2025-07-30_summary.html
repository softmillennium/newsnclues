Almost every U.S. president had a sense of the special bond with Canada. They would recoil at the treatment Canada is getting from the White House today.LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP/Getty Images

Louis St. Laurent, the prime minister of Canada from 1948 to 1957, said this about his dealings with American presidents: “Never have we been made to feel that we were obliged to agree to something because they were bigger and stronger than we were.”

Here was Dwight D. Eisenhower, who once stepped out of his presidential train car in pyjamas to wave to Canadians, giving advice to one of his trade negotiators: “When you're dealing with those Canadians, be so fair that you could move to their side of the table and feel comfortable.”

Way back in 1910, Canada's governor-general Lord Grey met with president William Howard Taft in Albany, in New York. Grey told him that “We are, so far as the real big things of the world are concerned, practically one people.” Taft, who had a cottage in Murray Bay, Que., agreed. Because of the bond, he said he was “profoundly convinced” that the two countries required special beneficial arrangements different from what the U.S. had with “countries beyond the seas.”

What is remarkable in the history of Canada-U.S. relations – in the era after Britain ran Canada's foreign affairs – is the degree of goodwill and respect shown to this country by American presidents. Of course there was at times neglect and conflict with Ottawa, and some hard measures have been taken, with the presidents acting in their own country's interests.

But there was an absence of coercion. There was no president even remotely like the one today, who is acting like an imperialist pig in trying to subjugate Canada – demanding that we kowtow, or else.

Opinion: In a Trump world without rules, what more can Carney do?

With their enormous power advantage, other presidents were certainly capable of doing so – of, for example, fabricating a national security crisis and using it as a sledgehammer against this country. They had the decency not to do it.

Winston Churchill once suggested during the war that Franklin Roosevelt take over Newfoundland, which was then en route to becoming a Canadian province, and turn it into a military base. FDR was not interested. His way was to extend open arms to Canada, meeting with Mackenzie King 22 times, carving out milestone bilateral agreements on the economy and on defence, and enhancing our security on both fronts.

Harry Truman was a straight-shooter who, when not preoccupied with other matters, accorded Canada great respect. Eisenhower was the same. In their book published last year, Building a Special Relationship, Asa McKercher and Michael Stevenson expertly chart how a consensus on cross-border ties between the two countries for the postwar period was fashioned by his administration.

Well-documented is the great rapport Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush shared with Brian Mulroney, leading to their agreements on trade and acid rain. I recall seeing Mr. Reagan facing catcalls and booing while addressing a crowd in front of our parliament in 1981, but he didn't let it deter him from his vision of a North American accord, a forerunner to free trade. He once scolded cabinet ministers for advocating a tougher treatment of Canada.

This friendly diplomacy continued with president Bill Clinton, a golfing buddy of Jean Chrétien's. Mr. Clinton gave a landmark speech in 1999 in Mont Tremblant, Que., intellectually destroying the case for Quebec separatism.

Opinion: Canada must avoid rushing into a trade shakedown

Gerald Ford brought Canada into the G7, and Jimmy Carter was a noted admirer. “I saw him once get teary-eyed recalling Canada's help in the Iranian hostage crisis,” recalled Arthur Milnes, an expert on presidents' relations with this country.

Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, though restrained by the protectionist ways of their Democratic Party, hardly had a cross word to say about this country.

Certainly, there were presidents with whom relations were thorny. Teddy Roosevelt clashed with Wilfrid Laurier over the Alaska boundary line; John F. Kennedy had smash-ups with John Diefenbaker; Lyndon B. Johnson lambasted Lester Pearson on Vietnam; Richard Nixon's 10-per-cent tariff angered Pierre Trudeau; George W. Bush was irate over Mr. Chrétien's refusal to join his war on Iraq.

But the ill will never persisted. Roosevelt came to be greatly admired by Canadians. Kennedy never got on with Dief, but he patched up bilateral relations with Pearson. LBJ and Pearson overcame their rift, as did Mr. Chrétien and Mr. Bush. 

Mr. Nixon thought Mr. Trudeau was a left-wing weirdo. Still, he travelled to Ottawa in 1972 and, instead of making demands, issued a pledge of allowing Canada greater independence from the U.S., which is just what Mr. Trudeau wanted.

Most every president had a sense of the special bond with Canada. They understood and appreciated the different standing that Taft referenced. They would recoil at the treatment Canada is getting from the White House today.

The White House has warned Sir Keir Starmer to stop threatening American tech companies amid mounting backlash over Britain's online safety law.

Members of Donald Trump's administration are monitoring the Online Safety Act with “great interest and concern” after key allies said it was censoring free speech and imposing unfair burdens on US businesses.

The law, which regulates online speech, allows the British government to levy massive fines on companies like Apple, Truth Social, and X if it finds that rules on hate speech have been broken.

Those in the president's inner circle see the potential penalties as an unwarranted foreign intervention into American free speech.

“President Trump has made it clear that free speech is one of our most cherished freedoms as Americans,” a senior US State Department official told The Telegraph.

“Accordingly, we have taken decisive action against foreign actors who have engaged in extraterritorial censorship affecting our companies and fellow citizens.“We will continue to monitor developments in the UK with great interest and concern.”

Since the law came into effect last week, Ofcom, the UK's online regulator, has written to several American firms ordering them to conform to the act, in letters seen by The Telegraph.

It has sparked outrage from US lawmakers and legal experts, who say the overreach is a threat by the UK to silence American companies and citizens.

Congressman Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary GOP committee, said the law was an attack on American companies.

“Ask Apple and they would view it as a $500 million attack,” he told The Telegraph.

“There's general concern... and then there's concern on how this impacts American citizens, American companies and infringes on our First Amendment.

“As long as foreign legislators, judges, and regulators continue their attempts to silence US citizens, we will not stop fighting back.”

Mr Jordan also raised concerns over the bill's overreach with Peter Kyle, the Science Secretary, on Wednesday.

Under the law, social media giants face fines of up to £18m ($24m), or 10 per cent of their annual revenue, if they fail to remove content deemed harmful from their platforms.

While the measures are designed to protect young people from dangerous content, critics argue that it pressures platforms into censoring users by removing their content if it is disliked by others, even though it is perfectly legal.

Social media apps such as X, Reddit and TikTok have been forced to introduce age verification checks since the bill came into effect last week.

The warning to Sir Keir is the latest sign of Donald Trump's willingness to intervene in domestic British affairs amid a growing transatlantic rift over the protection of freedom of speech.

During his meeting with the Prime Minister in Scotland, Mr Trump warned Sir Keir not to censor his social-media platform, Truth Social.

“Well, I don't think he's going to censor my site, because I say only good things,” Mr Trump said.

In May, The Telegraph revealed that the president sent US officials to meet British pro-life activists over censorship concerns.

The diplomats from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour (BDHL) travelled to London in March in an effort to “affirm the importance of freedom of expression in the UK and across Europe”.

Led by Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the state department, they met with officials from the Foreign Office and challenged Ofcom over the Online Safety Act.

Since then, the Trump administration has also raised questions about the conviction and sentencing of several high profile cases like that of Lucy Connolly.

Connolly, a former childminder and the wife of a Conservative councillor, is currently serving a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence over a social media post published in the wake of the killings of three girls in Southport.

After rumours spread online online that the killer was an illegal migrant, Connolly called for “deportation now” and added: “Set fire to all the... [asylum] hotels... for all I care”.

Three Court of Appeal judges rejected the 42-year-old's case application last week, meaning she will not be released before August.

And no case has raised concerns in Washington more than the prosecution of Livia Tossici-Bolt, an anti-abortion campaigner.

The 64-year-old was handed a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £20,026 ($26,624) in costs for breaching a buffer zone while praying outside an abortion clinic.

At the time, the case threatened to jeopardise Sir Keir's trade deal with the United States.

In a highly unusual intervention, the State Department's BDHL posted a statement on X saying: “We are monitoring [Ms Tossici-Bolt's] case. It is important that the UK respect and protect freedom of expression.”

Ms Tossici-Bolt, who could have been handed a prison sentence, thanked the Trump administration for its intervention.

Those closest to the president have long raised concerns about the erosion of free speech in Britain.

In a speech at the Munich security conference in February, JD Vance, the US vice-president, cited British pro-life campaigner Adam Smith-Connor, who too was convicted for breaching a buffer zone outside an abortion clinic.

“Free speech in Britain and across Europe [is] in retreat,” Mr Vance said.

Before his spectacular fallout with the president, Elon Musk was understood to be pushing Mr Trump to raise curbs on social media regulation in trade talks with the UK.

Mr Musk, who has described himself as a free speech absolutist, said Britain's online safety laws amount to “suppression of the people”.

Several American businesses are now poised to bring a federal lawsuit against Ofcom.

Preston Byrne, managing partner of Byrne & Storm, PC who is representing some of the US sites, said no foreign power should be allowed to “cross our waterline”.

“I am instructed by multiple American websites to bring a federal lawsuit against Ofcom,” he said.

“No matter who is the target, the US free speech bar will not allow any American to be censored by a foreign government. No foreign power will be allowed to cross our waterline with unconstitutional and illegal orders.”

Starmer announced he would only recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't agree to a ceasefire.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing widespread criticism after he announced on Tuesday that the U.K. is prepared to recognize a Palestinian state — but only if Israel's genocide in Gaza continues and Israel does not agree to a ceasefire.

Starmer said that the U.K. will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel ends its genocide and “commits to a long-term peace process” focused on a two-state solution. In a filmed statement, he speaks to the “humanitarian crisis” in Gaza, but does not name Israel as the perpetrator of the ongoing famine, despite Israel's systematic dismantling of the humanitarian aid system in Gaza over the past 22 months.

Announcing the decision to his cabinet, Starmer “reiterated that there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas and that our demands on Hamas remain, that they must release all the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, accept that they will play no role in the government of Gaza, and disarm,” a statement by the government said.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Palestinians and advocates for Palestinian rights have decried the announcement for using Palestinian statehood as a bargaining chip, telling Palestinians that the only way they can be granted a state is if their suffering continues.

“What a horrible, horrible statement! To The Hague, there he must be,” said Gaza journalist Abubaker Abed. 

“Not a single time he named the perpetrators Israel for the starving babies or the catastrophic humanitarian crisis,” Abed went on, saying that Starmer makes it sound like “aid was cut off arbitrarily, babies were starved naturally, and people suffered unintentionally.”

U.K. activist group Palestine Solidarity Campaign condemned the announcement, saying that it only gives Israel more power to make decisions on Palestinian statehood, while completely cutting Palestinians out of the equation.

“Keir Starmer, who refuses even to recognise that Israel is violating international law in Gaza, is offering to recognise a Palestinian state if, and only if, Israel's starvation and atrocities are still ongoing in two months' time,” the campaign said. “If not, what is now being presented as a step towards recognising the Palestinian people's right to self-determination will be rescinded. His grotesque message to Palestinians is that state recognition may come, but only if and when many, many more of you are dead.”

Left-wing U.K. politicians also criticized the announcement. 

“Palestinian statehood is not a bargaining chip. It is not a threat. It is an inalienable right of the Palestinian people,” said Member of Parliament Jeremy Corbyn. “Our demands on this shameful government remain the same: end all arms sales to Israel, impose widespread sanctions, and stop the genocide, now.”Starmer and other European leaders have faced scrutiny recently for putting out statements supposedly condemning Israel's violence in Gaza without taking action to stop it.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Vince McMahon, the former WWE chief executive, is accused of causing a multi-car pile-up on the day Hulk Hogan died, according to state police.

Mr McMahon destroyed his Bentley in the crash, which took place a few hours before TMZ reported the death of the wrestling star.

Hogan, who made his name in Mr McMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) company, died following a cardiac arrest last Thursday.

Mr McMahon, who is separated from his wife, Linda, President Donald Trump's education secretary, was cited for reckless driving and following too closely.

The crash took place last Thursday morning on the Merritt Parkway in Westport, Connecticut, state police said. No one was injured.

Mr McMahon was released on a $500 bond and ordered to appear in Stamford Superior Court on Aug 26.

Representatives for Mr McMahon are yet to comment.

Photos taken appear to show heavy damage to the front end of Mr McMahon's 2024 Bentley Continental GT Speed. 

The police report said Mr McMahon was driving northbound on the parkway, also known as Route 15, when he rear-ended the BMW and crashed into a wooden guardrail.

A car travelling in the southbound lanes struck debris from the crash that flew over the guardrail, state police said.

There were no passengers in the cars and all three drivers were wearing their seat belts, police said.

The air bags in Mr McMahon's car and the BMW deployed.

Mr McMahon stepped down as WWE's chief executive in 2022 amid a company investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him.

He also resigned as executive chairman of the board of directors of TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of WWE, last year, a day after a former employee filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against him.

Mr McMahon denies the allegations, the lawsuit is still pending.

Following Hogan's death, Mr McMahon said in a post on X: “The world lost a treasure today. Hulk Hogan was the greatest WWE Superstar of ALL TIME, someone who was loved and admired around the world.

“He was a trailblazer, the first performer who transitioned from being a wrestling star into a global phenomenon.”

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Samson Inocencio Jr. is national director for International Justice Mission (IJM) in the Philippines and the regional Vice President of IJM's OSEC Hub, working against the online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC). The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.



            On this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, I find myself holding two truths in tension: deep despair and profound hope. After more than two decades fighting human trafficking in the Philippines, I have witnessed both the unthinkable harm inflicted on children `– and the extraordinary progress made to stop it.
    


            Right now, at an alarming scale, sex offenders from around the world conspire online with traffickers in countries like the Philippines, paying to livestream the sexual abuse of children as directed by the offenders in real time. As part of International Justice Mission (IJM), I lead a team in the Philippines committed to protecting children from this horrific form of human trafficking, where young victims are trafficked to produce child sexual abuse material (CSAM), especially in live videos.
    


            At the same time, I am hopeful because we have seen incredible success in our partnership with the Philippine government to address this crime. Through IJM-supported cases since 2011, Philippine law enforcement has brought to safety over 1,470 victims (and at-risk individuals), arrested over 430 traffickers and convicted over 265 perpetrators. And in 2016, the US State Department recognized this progress by upgrading the Philippines to Tier 1 in its Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report — the first Southeast Asian country to reach that top ranking, which still held its place on the latest 2024 report. The message was clear: when justice systems are equipped and accountable, they can stop trafficking.

            But despite this progress and sustained commitment from governments, this particular form of technology-facilitated trafficking continues to ravage communities in the Philippines and around the world. It has become clear to me that we cannot rely solely on the efforts of individual governments or bilateral partnerships to adequately address the tidal wave of violence against children on the internet. It's simply not enough.
    


            “Technology companies play a pivotal role in protecting victims and vulnerable individuals from being exploited through the use of their online platforms and must be part of the solution to combat human trafficking,” according to the 2024 TIP Report. And because many of the world's largest and most influential technology companies are based in the United States, the US Congress must pass laws to appropriately incentivize this influential sector to be a part of the answer to this epidemic.
    


            Countries like the US where sex offenders driving the demand for this crime often live — and the online platforms, payment processors and money transfer services that inadvertently enable it — must take action. This comes at a timely moment for US policymakers, who have been increasingly attentive to the crisis of children being exploited online.
    


            It is time for US Congress to pass the STOP CSAM Act (H.R.3921 and S.1829). Momentum is building for this legislation, which was examined at a March hearing before the US Senate Judiciary Committee and advanced on a bipartisan basis by that committee on June 12 in a unanimous vote of 22-0. If enacted, this bill would allow victims to seek legal recourse against online platforms that promote or aid and abet their exploitation — a significant step toward the goal of protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation online.

            The STOP CSAM Act would also help improve the quality of reports submitted by online platforms to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline by requiring platforms to report specific details of child sexual exploitation. Online platforms are already required to report this form of child sex trafficking under the REPORT Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law in May 2024. The STOP CSAM Act strengthens existing reporting obligations and emphasizes the importance of including particular data points in CyberTipline reports that could help identify or locate a child who may be actively being exploited — including user and location information, content details and whether content was previously viewed.
    


            Stopping online sexual exploitation of children is a moral duty — and it should be enforced by increased legislative action in the US.
    


            The work is hard and long, marked by moments of deep exhaustion and despair, but hope still wins. I experienced a glimpse of this sustained hope as I was recognized by the US Department of State as a Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report Hero last year — the highest honor given by the US government for anti-trafficking leadership around the world. Reflecting on the last two decades of this work, I have undoubtedly witnessed humanity's darkest side. Yet, my team and I have also experienced deep generosity and care from those working to combat this crime — and we are fueled by our experience that change is possible.

Whistleblowers said Emil Bove told DOJ lawyers to ignore court orders that blocked Trump's mass deportation efforts.

Nearly every Senate Republican on Tuesday voted in favor of confirming Trump loyalist Emil Bove to a lifetime federal court seat, brushing aside whistleblowers who alleged that the Justice Department official expressed support for defying court orders and lied during his sworn judiciary committee testimony.

The final Senate vote on Bove's confirmation to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit was 50-49, with every member of the Democratic caucus voting no. Just two Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — opposed Bove's confirmation.

Maggie Jo Buchanan, interim executive director of the advocacy group Demand Justice, said the vote “represents some of the worst aspects of far too many elected to office in Washington — cowardice and political expediency over duty to constituents.”

“The American people want and deserve judges who are independent and fair, not ones who have done nothing to hide their political loyalties,” she added. “Bove, facing a wave of damning allegations that the overwhelming majority of Republican senators refused to take seriously, has been confirmed for one reason only: obedience to Trump.”

Tuesday's vote came hours after The Washington Post reported that a third whistleblower had shared evidence with senators suggesting that Bove “misled lawmakers about his handling of the dismissal of public corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.”

Democratic senators demanded an investigation into the allegations before the final vote to confirm Bove, but Republicans rushed ahead with the vote anyway.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement following Tuesday's vote that “this sham, hide-the-ball confirmation process is a new low for subservient Senate Republicans.”

“Even as the lawless Emil Bove appears to have misled the committee about multiple, credible, backstopped allegations of misconduct, this body has sunk to simply being a partisan rubber stamp for President Trump,” said Whitehouse. “Republicans have ignored whistleblower after whistleblower who bravely came forward to corroborate evidence of Bove's misconduct.”

Whistleblower Aid, a group representing one of the Bove whistleblowers, said prior to Tuesday's vote that Trump's Justice Department claimed to have lost a complaint “documenting Emil Bove's contempt for the rule of law” before finding it again on Monday.

The group noted that the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General “received an online copy of the complaint from Whistleblower Aid on May 2 and signed in a couriered copy three days later.” The complaint, according to Whistleblower Aid, “provided documentary evidence that Bove and other senior DOJ officials instructed department lawyers to violate a court order relating to the Trump administration's immigration deportation policies.”

“They also directed DOJ lawyers to commit perjury in federal court to cover up the violation, the evidence shows,” according to the group. “Yet the office now says the documents were lost and refound only after Whistleblower Aid presented proof of submission and receipt. Evidence relevant to the Senate's final vote on the Bove nomination has thus sat unacknowledged for almost three months, foreclosing the possibility of any meaningful investigation into a lifetime judicial appointment.”

Last month, The New York Times reported that one whistleblower — a DOJ lawyer who has since been fired — alleged that Bove said earlier this year that the Justice Department “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you'” if they ruled against the Trump administration's attempts to deport immigrants without due process.

Caroline Ciccone, president of the watchdog group Accountable.US, said Tuesday that Bove's confirmation “should send a chill down the spine of every American.”

“Bove has shown total loyalty to Trump above the American people; refused to commit to recusing himself on cases involving the president; and is the subject of multiple whistleblower complaints,” said Ciccone. “His extreme ideological record and ethical lapses have raised grave concerns about his integrity, but that didn't stop Republican senators from ramming his confirmation through, falling in line with Trump's scheme of hand-selecting judges who vow personal loyalty over the rule of law.”

“Bove's confirmation sets the stage for the president and his allies to seek out favorable rulings, no matter how unconstitutional their actions may be,” she warned. “And that is a threat to fundamental freedoms everywhere.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Experts say thawing of permafrost due to climate breakdown is causing increase in rock collapses across Alps

Hundreds of hikers and tourists were evacuated and dozens of trails closed after a series of rockfalls on the slopes of Cima Falkner in the Brenta Dolomites in the north of Italy, as experts warned of a sharp rise in landslides in the area linked to thawing permafrost.

In recent days, visitors reported hearing loud booms followed by rockfalls and thick clouds of dust rising from Monte Pelmo in the Val di Zoldo after rocky pinnacles broke away and crashed down into the valley below in the municipality of Selva di Cadore in Italy's Belluno province.

Another collapse was recorded on Cima Falkner, where experts say the entire area is undergoing a process of erosion linked to rising temperatures and the wider climate emergency. No one was injured and the falling debris came to a stop higher up the mountain.

“Multiple rockfalls have occurred on both the western and eastern slopes of Cima Falkner in the Brenta Group,” read a statement by authorities in the region of Trentino-Alto Adige. “As a result, all climbing routes and hiking trails directly affected by the area have been immediately closed.

“All hikers in the area have been evacuated. We urge everyone to pay maximum attention and strictly follow the ordinances to ensure their own safety.”

Following reports of rockfalls, a technical inspection was conducted on Tuesday by the geological service with the support of a helicopter unit, which confirmed that “the entire summit is affected by an ongoing geomorphological process, likely linked to permafrost degradation”.

Rockfalls have always occurred in the Dolomites, but experts this year warned of a striking rise in the number of collapses, driven by extreme heat and weather events intensified by the climate crisis.

“Never before have we seen such an incredible increase in rockfalls,” Piero Carlesi, president of the scientific committee of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), told la Repubblica. “Landslides are on the rise, and the main cause is the climate crisis. There's no doubt about it.”

He added: “Mountains, by definition, are destined to collapse – they won't remain as we know them for ever. What's different now is that we're seeing a clear acceleration of these processes, driven by heat and extreme weather events intensified by the climate crisis.”

Cold temperatures, causing water seeping into rock fractures to freeze, acted as a kind of glue, holding the rocks together. But now, Carlesi said, with rising temperatures, that glue was disappearing and fractured rock was increasingly breaking off and tumbling down gullies. “It's happening more and more often,” he said.

Last year, Italian scientists who took part in a campaign launched by the environmentalist group Legambiente said the Marmolada glacier – the largest and most symbolic in the Dolomites – could melt completely by 2040.

Their report said Marmolada was losing between 7cm and 10cm of depth a day and that over the past five years, 70 hectares (173 acres) of its surface had disappeared.

Since the beginning of scientific measurements in 1888, the Marmolada glacier has withdrawn by 1,200 metres in an “irreversible coma”.

In 2022, a collapse on the Marmolada mountain sent an avalanche of ice, snow and rock downslope and killed 11 people.

Erosion and rockfalls are on the rise not only in the Dolomites but across the entire Alpine range, according to mountaineers and experts. In late June 2025, Mont Blanc experienced a record-breaking heatwave with temperatures remaining above zero for an extended period at high altitudes, including the summit.

Bernard Vion, a 66-year-old mountain guide, has been walking and climbing in the French Alps around Pralognan-la-Vanoise since he was a child and accompanies visitors on climbs. He said rockfalls and other dangers caused by climate change had complicated work for him and his colleagues.

“We have never seen rock falls of such intensity and regularity before. The permafrost, which is like a kind of cement holding the rocks together, is melting, meaning they have no cohesion and they collapse,” he said.

Vion opened his phone to show a message from another guide with pictures of a large rockfall near a mountain refuge at about 2,800 metres above Pralognan-la-Vanoise on Monday. “He was really shocked. He said he never expected it to happen there,” Vion said.

“For several years now we have had to develop the ability to observe these phenomenon and spot the warning signs. In some cases we've had to totally modify our itineraries to reduce the risk to our clients. Even for us guides this is difficult and I worry about amateur climbers who don't have the same mountain culture.”

He said “of course” this was due to climate breakdown. “You'd have to be blind not to see it. Anyone who doubts this should come to the mountains.”

If carpooling is what comes to your mind, you might have heard of the travel app “BlaBlaCar.” This platform connects drivers with empty seats in their cars with passengers going the same way, allowing travel costs to be shared.
  BlaBlaCar's origins can be traced back to the Christmas season of 2003, when Frederic Mazzella was traveling from Paris to his family home in the French countryside. __1__ This observation gave rise to the idea of an online platform to connect drivers and

B:  There are more Japanese animated films this summer, including Doraemon: Nobita's Art World Tales, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba – Castillo and Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers.
A:  The four main characters of those franchises are children' s idols. 
B:  US animated films Elio and The Smurfs Movie have also gained popularity.

Tensions began rising between the Southeast Asian neighbors in May, following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a brief exchange of gunfire, and have steadily escalated since, triggering diplomatic spats and now, armed clashes.
WHERE DOES THE DISPUTE ORIGINATE?
Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at various undemarcated points along their 817km land border, which was first mapped by France in 1907 when Cambodia was                                    



                                                                                Continued from yesterday（延續自昨日）
__2__ Specifically, a driver posts their planned route on the platform, and a passenger finds them by searching for available trips to their desired destination. Once a match is made, the passenger books a seat and contributes to the driver's travel expenses, making the journey more economical for both parties. For safety reasons and ride preferences, both drivers and passengers can view each other's ratings and profiles before sending or accepting a ride request. __3__ The options range from “Bla” (quiet) to “BlaBla” (chatty) and “BlaBlaBla” (very talkative), which is why this app is named BlaBlaCar.

Russia's attempts to spread Kremlin propaganda in occupied areas of Ukraine by replacing home TV satellite dishes with ones that only receive Russian broadcasts, have been met with resistance from local residents, according to reports from the Ukrainian Resistance Center (URC).

Television, mass and social media are key instruments used to spread Russian propaganda and russify residents of temporarily occupied territories.

In just one week, over 1,000 pieces of equipment that enable access to Ukrainian television were taken away, the URC reported on July 21.

"The goal is to completely cleanse the information space," the URC report says, adding Ukraine's "Horynych" TV dishes are being replaced with Russian versions called "Russkiy mir" (Russian world).

The "Russkiy Mir" satellite project was launched in December 2022, aiming to provide "citizens of new territories" with access to Russian television. The project was implemented by Russian President Vladimir Putin's political coalition, All-Russia People's Front.

The project's official website says it was created specifically for Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporozhia oblasts, and Crimea. 

Russia occupied Crimea and partially occupied Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in 2014. After the full-scale war began, Russia also partially occupied the Kherson and Zaporozhia oblasts. Moscow illegally declared the annexation of the four regions in September 2022, despite not controlling them fully.

The "Russkiy Mir" channel package includes 20 Kremlin state  TV channels, 10 regional TV channels from the four occupied oblasts, and 11 "entertainment channels," including ones for children.

On May 7, 2024, the Institute for the Study of War said in a report that "the installation of 'Russkiy Mir' satellites in occupied Ukraine allows the Russian government to directly control what news and media residents are consuming, thereby consolidating control over the information space and platforming Kremlin propaganda as mainstream news."

But residents of the occupied territories have boycotted the replacement by refusing to voluntarily switch to "Russkiy Mir," the URC reported on July 27. 

According to the report, the resistance "irritates" the local occupation authorities, and Moscow is dissatisfied with the pace of the project.

The Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson, Volodymyr Saldo, said on June 23 that the Kherson Oblast residents can replace TV equipment for free from July 1 until Nov. 30.

Previously, on Feb. 11, Saldo issued a decree recognizing Ukrainian TV satellites as instruments of "enemy propaganda" and prohibited watching it.

On March 31, Yellow Ribbon resistance movement activists said that residents had been warned of systematic inspections in the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, with fines and forced confiscation imposed on those using satellite dishes capable of receiving Ukrainian broadcasts. Additionally, private homeowners would be required to dismantle any "suspicious" equipment.

Local authorities claimed 25,000 "Russkiy Mir" satellites were installed in Kherson Oblast during 2023 and 2024.

Resistance in Russian-occupied territories is dangerous — anyone deemed to be defying the occupying authorities faces the very real possibility of imprisonment and torture.

During peace negotiations, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 that Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia. 

As talks proved ineffective, the question of occupation has gradually faded into the background.

Ozzy Osbourne died last Tuesday at the age of 76 after playing his final show in front of 42,000 fans on July 5.Jacob King/The Associated Press

Ozzy Osbourne returned to the “home of metal” for the last time on Wednesday as an emotional Birmingham honoured one of its most cherished sons.

Thousands of Black Sabbath fans paid their respects to the band's frontman as his hearse made its way through the city centre followed by his tearful wife and children.

The hearse carrying Osbourne, who died last Tuesday at the age of 76, went down Broad Street, one of the city's major thoroughfare, to the Black Sabbath bench, which was unveiled on the Broad Street canal bridge in 2019.

“Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, oi, oi, oi,” fans screamed.

Six vehicles carrying the Osbourne family followed the hearse, accompanied by police motorcycle riders and a police car.

With Ozzy Osbourne's death, heavy metal loses its iron man

The family emerged briefly to inspect the array of tributes, with his wife of 43 years, Sharon, visibly moved and wiping away tears.

And long after the hearse had moved on for the private funeral, the city, which has embraced its reputation as the citadel of heavy metal, was pounding to the beat of Black Sabbath.

It was in Birmingham, where he grew up, that the world-conquering heavy metal band was formed in 1968.

Osbourne embraced the city in central England as much as it embraced him, as was evident on the streets.

Long-time fan Antony Hunt said it has been an “emotional” day and that he wanted to be in the city to pay his respects.

“What's amazing is there's so many, such a wide variety of age groups, from little, little children, teenagers to people in their 60s, 70s, so it's great to see that,” he said.

Katie Brazier, head of events at Birmingham City Council, said Osbourne meant “everything” to the city.

“He never forgot where he came from,” she said. “You could still hear that Brummie accent wherever he was, you know, I think some people have hidden away from the fact that they are from Birmingham and they've got that accent but he kept it all the way through.”

Osbourne and his Black Sabbath bandmates – Terence Butler, Tony Iommi and Bill Ward – were recently awarded the Freedom of the City in recognition of their services to Birmingham.

Black Sabbath's story began in Birmingham in 1968 when the four original members were looking to escape a life of factory work. Without doubt, the sound and fury of heavy metal had its roots in the city's manufacturing heritage. Osbourne never forgot his working-class roots.

The band has been widely credited with defining and popularizing the sound of heavy metal – aggressive, but full of melodies.

Osbourne was Black Sabbath's frontman during its peak period in the 1970s. His antics, on and offstage, were legendary, and often fuelled by drink and drugs. He was widely known as the “Prince of Darkness.”

The band's eponymous debut album in 1970 made the U.K. top 10 and paved the way for a string of hit albums, including 1971's “Master of Reality” and “Vol. 4” a year later. It went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide.

At the final show on July 5, 42,000 fans watched the band perform for the first time in 20 years at Villa Park, home of the city's biggest soccer club, Aston Villa, with Osbourne seated on a black throne. Osbourne had been in poor health in recent years, especially after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2019.

Osbourne, who also had a successful solo career, found a new legion of fans in the early 2000s reality show “The Osbournes” in which he starred alongside Sharon and two youngest children, Kelly and Jack.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on India starting on Aug. 1 as he rebuked New Delhi for its purchases of Russian energy and arms amid the war in Ukraine.

Criticizing India for its "trade barriers," Trump also said the country has "always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia's largest buyer of energy, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine."

"India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25%, plus a penalty for the above, starting on Aug. 1," Trump said on his Truth Social platform on July 30. He did not specify what the penalty would be.

The comments follow Trump's earlier warnings of imposing 100% secondary tariffs on Russian oil within 10 days unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a peace deal in Ukraine. 

Starting his second term in office with a pledge to broker a swift peace deal in Ukraine, Trump has become increasingly critical of Russia over its refusal to accept a ceasefire and escalating attacks against Ukrainian cities. 

India, long dependent on Middle Eastern oil, sharply increased imports from Russia after Moscow launched its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, taking advantage of deep discounts and falling European demand.

The South Asian country remains one of the leading buyers of Russian oil, second only to China.

Trump signaled earlier this week that India might face a tariff rate between 20% and 25% as the new administration seeks to overhaul Washington's trade relations around the world.

Upon taking office, Trump imposed short-lived "Liberation Day" tariffs in April, which he withdrew for 90 days due to market and economic concerns. The U.S. has now imposed various deadlines to reach deals with its many trading partners before tariffs may be reintroduced.

Earlier this week, Trump concluded a deal with the EU according to which Washington would slap a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., down from Trump's previously threatened 30% tariff.





Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers has once again failed to appoint anti-corruption investigator Oleksandr Tsyvinsky as director of the Bureau of Economic Security, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said.

"This is a welcome mobilization of European defense funding," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X. "Europe is on track to significantly strengthen its defense industry, and Ukraine is an essential element of this effort."







An 8.8 magnitude earthquake near the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka on July 30 triggered tsunami waves in Russia's Far East, prompting evacuations in Japan and Hawaii and warnings across the Pacific Ocean.

The unidentified drone entered Lithuanian airspace on the morning of July 28 and the search for it has now entered its third day.

India has "always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia's largest buyer of energy, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine," Trump said on his Truth Social platform on July 30.

The revision marks the steepest downgrade among major economies in the Fund's report.

The ruling represents a significant win for PrivatBank, which has pursued the case in English courts since 2017 following the bank's nationalization.

The US State Department said on Tuesday it ‘presumes' that the White House is factoring in the potential economic fallout as it considers imposing secondary sanctions on countries purchasing Russian energy.

President Donald Trump recently set out a 10-day ultimatum demanding a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, warning that failure to meet the deadline could result in penalties against nations doing business with Moscow.

At a press briefing, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce was asked whether these measures are “too blunt an instrument,” potentially harming US allies.

”I would presume, as we should, that all of the impact would be considered,” Bruce said. “The president is not someone who is making a decision on the fly... This has clearly been a consideration from the beginning. And we're prepared to do what's necessary.”

Russian officials have dismissed Trump's threat, calling it harmful to peace efforts in Ukraine. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said earlier this month that no additional pressure will derail Russia's pursuit of its national interests.

Trump has acknowledged there is no certainty that his latest pressure campaign will alter Moscow's approach to the Ukraine conflict.

Meanwhile, foreign policy hawks in Congress are pushing for legislation that would authorize tariffs of up to 500% on nations that continue to import Russian oil and gas. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the bill's sponsors, described it as a “sledgehammer” he intends to place in the president's hands.

Analysts have warned that these measures could backfire. China, India, and Türkiye – all major buyers of Russian energy – could face sanctions under the proposed policy.

”Such a move could cause global oil prices to skyrocket,” the New York Times warned on Tuesday, adding that secondary sanctions would likely escalate what it described as Trump's “global trade war.”

The newspaper added that earlier efforts by Western nations to limit Russian revenue through an oil price cap “largely faltered.”

Rarely used ‘rule of five' requires government agencies to provide relevant information if at least five members of the committee request it

At the Capitol, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is outlining his attempt to force attorney general Pam Bondi to release the files related to the investigation of disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

“We're invoking federal law and using our authority as a check on the executive to compel transparency,” Schumer said.

“Today's letter matters. It's not a stunt, it's not symbolic, it's a formal exercise of congressional power under federal law, and we expect an answer from DoJ by August the 15. That's what accountability looks like. This is what oversight looks like, and this is what keeping your promises to the American people look like.”

He noted that both Bondi and Donald Trump had previously said they want the case file's released:

This is not complicated. After promising full transparency for years, every single time Trump, his administration, Republican leaders have had a chance to be transparent about the Epstein files, they've chosen to hide. The evasions, the delays, the excuses, they are not just odd, they're alarming. It begs the question, if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?

Trump should stop hiding from the truth, he should stop hiding from the American people.

The Treasury Department announced sanctions today against Alexandre de Moraes – the high court judge overseeing the investigation into disgraced Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who is on trial for allegedly attempting to launch a coup after losing the 2022 Brazilian election.

Earlier this month Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media that he ordered a visa revocation for the judge De Moraes.

The US accuses De Moraes of “arbitrary pre-trial detentions and suppress freedom of expression.”

In a statement treasury secretary Scott Bessent added:

De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions—including against former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Today marks the first of three days of hearings investigating the plane collision in DC that killed 67 people in January.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is holding the hearings after an American Airlines passenger jet collided midair with a Black Hawk helicopter earlier this year. The crash killed all aboard both aircrafts. It is also the US's deadliest air disaster since November 2001.

NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the three days will be a “fact finding proceeding”, and today's hearing opened with a video animation of where both aircrafts were leading up to the collision.

At the press conference, when asked about whether Democratic senators would be comfortable with redactions, minority leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers “wouldn't force any agreements that have been broken”, but added that he believes “almost everything can come out”.

Schumer also said that he wants the files to be made available to the public and members of Congress, and that Democratic members are working to get some Republican colleagues on board to help make the files public. “It should be bipartisan,” he said. “But if not, there's recourse in the courts. This is the law.”

Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee, shared more about how the letter works, and what it demands.

“We are using very unique statutory authority that is granted only to our committee, to homeland security and government affairs. The statute that we are invoking requires the administration to hand over documents … requested by any five members of the Senate committee,” Peters said.

“This letter demands that the justice department produce documents that attorney general Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have publicly already confirmed they have in their possession. We all know in fact that the attorney general said, quote, she said they're sitting on her desk. It should be pretty easy to turn over documents that are sitting on the attorney general's desk.”

Trump should stop hiding from the truth, he should stop hiding from the American people.

California's Democratic governor Gavin Newsom has indicated he may push to redraw his state's congressional maps if Texas Republicans approve new maps that could net the GOP five more House seats.

Writing on X after Texas Republicans released their proposal for redistricting the state's House seats, Newsom said:

Donald Trump asks for 5 seats and Greg Abbott automatically bends the knee. The 2026 election is being rigged. California won't sit back and watch this happen.

If California Democrats want to redraw their congressional maps in the party's favor, they will first have to ask voters to cancel a constitutional amendment that created an independent redistricting commission – potentially a tall ask.

Top Senate Democrats will hold a press conference in a few minutes about their attempt to use a rarely-invoked law to force attorney general Pam Bondi to hand over the Epstein files.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is due to speak, as well as Gary Peters, the ranking member of the homeland security committee, and other Democrats on the panel. We will let you know what they have to say.

Here's a rundown of the news so far today:

We're preparing for an interest-rate decision from the Federal Reserve at 2pm, and a press conference with chair Jerome Powell 30 minutes after the announcement. It comes as Donald Trump continued to urge Powell to cut the rate on social media.

Trump also announced a 25% tariff on India, writing on Truth Social that the US has done “relatively little business” with the country. Trump also said that India would be subject to a further penalty for buying substantial amounts of Russian military equipment and energy.

Senate Democrats will at noon hold a press conference after writing a letter to attorney general Pam Bondi to release the full and unredacted Epstein files. They're invoking a rare and obscure law known as “rule of five”, which states that a government agency must provide information if five or more Senate committee members request it.

Beyond Washington, Texas Republicans released a proposed new congressional map for the state. This comes at the urging of Trump, and much earlier than usual. Typically, the state redraws their map every 10 years.

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries is talking with Democratic legislators in Texas amid the redistricting battle ensuing in the state. He's expected to hold a press conference tomorrow as Democrats try to stave off a rewritten map that would cost them a House majority.

Texas Republicans have released their new proposed congressional map today. It could add up to five Republican seats if passed.

Donald Trump has pressured lawmakers in the state to redraw the map in order to protect the slim majority that Republicans hold in the House as the 2026 midterms loom.

Currently, Republicans hold 25 of Texas's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats hold 12.

Democratic strongholds like California and Maryland have threatened to redraw their maps in response.

Democratic Texas congressman Greg Casar, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has responded to a proposed redistricting map published by Punchbowl News.

He issued the following statement:

Merging the 35th and the 37th districts is illegal voter suppression of Black and Latino Central Texans. By merging our Central Texas districts, Trump wants to commit yet another crime— this time, against Texas voters and against Martin Luther King's Voting Rights Act of 1965.
  United, we will fight back with everything we've got.

While Senate Democrats are on Capitol Hill and pressing for the Epstein files release, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is in Austin, Texas, for closed-door meetings with state Democrats, according to Politico.

This comes as Donald Trump pushes Republican legislators in Texas to redraw their congressional district map earlier than usual. Normally, Texas would reconfigure its map every 10 years – aligned with the census.

Per Politico, Jeffries will hold a press conference in Texas tomorrow, along with a number of media appearances across cable TV.

Later today we'll find out the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision, and we can also expect to hear from chair Jerome Powell shortly after.

Earlier today, Donald Trump pushed again for the Fed to lower the interest rate on Truth Social: “No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!”

Announcing the tariff on Truth Social today, Donald Trump said that “while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them.”

Trump added that India will also pay a “penalty” for their role as a substantial buyer of Russian military equipment and energy. “At a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE,” he wrote.

Transcripts of the grand jury proceedings that led to the sex trafficking indictments of the sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, include the testimony of just two law enforcement witnesses, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has said, as it argues for the documents' release.

Top DoJ officials disclosed in a filing late on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court that separate grand juries convened to consider the criminal investigations of Epstein and Maxwell, and had heard from only two witnesses.

The revelation was made in the course of court wrangling over whether the transcripts of the proceedings should be unsealed, amid the continuing furor over the Epstein scandal which has roiled Donald Trump's second term.

The Trump administration is urging the two federal judges who presided over the Epstein and Maxwell grand juries, Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer, to release the testimony, in an attempt to calm the uproar.

The Trump administration has come under intense pressure from the president's own base of supporters who were infuriated by the DoJ's decision not to release any additional Epstein files about the late, disgraced financier's crimes involving the sex trafficking of girls.

The decision jarred with the previous stance of senior administration figures, including Trump himself and the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who had hyped the expected release of more details of the New York financier's businesses, travels and associations, including a possible list of his financial clients, which all further stoked conspiracies around the well-connected Epstein.

Tuesday's submission states that the grand jury tasked with considering the criminal case against Epstein heard only from an FBI agent when it met in June and July, 2019. A similar grand jury for Maxwell heard from the same FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective when it met in June and July, 2020 and in March, 2021.

The memorandum was signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney for the southern district of New York, and included the names of Bondi and deputy attorney general Todd Blanche.

Epstein took his own life in a federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges, officials say, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories because of his and Maxwell's links to famous people, such as royals, presidents and billionaires, including Trump.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring with Epstein in the sexual trafficking of minors. She was convicted in December 2021 on charges that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.

Last week, she sat for two sets of interviews with Justice Department officials, including Blanche, in Florida, where she is serving her time in a federal prison, and answered questions “about 100 different people,” her attorney said.

Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and claimed he had cut off their relationship long ago. But he faces ongoing questions about the Epstein case.

On Tuesday Trump spoke about connections between Epstein and the president's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. He claimed he evicted the financier from the resort because Epstein “stole” young female staffers from him, including Virginia Giuffre who went on to be a key witness against Epstein and Maxwell. Giuffre died in April.

Maxwell has offered to testify before Congress but with conditions, including being granted immunity. Her lawyer has written to the House committee which has subpoenaed her saying that a deposition without immunity would be a “non-starter”.

The DoJ memorandum says unsealing the transcripts is “consistent with increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.”

Former Democratic presidential nominee's decision throws race to run blue state wide open

Kamala Harris announces she will not run for governor of California

Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, announced on Wednesday that she will not run for governor of California – a highly anticipated decision that leaves the contest to lead the country's largest blue state wide open.

In a statement Harris said:

For now, my leadership – and public service – will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.

The Jeffrey Epstein files weren't the only business of the day on Capitol Hill today. Legislation sponsored by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri gained approval from a key committee today.

The bill was initially named the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, which would bar elected members of Congress from buying, owning or selling individual stocks.

The bill's original name takes a pointed jab at Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi – who has been criticised for her stock holdings. Democrats have since negotiated for the legislation to be renamed as the “Honest Act”.

In a statement today, Pelosi said:

I welcome any serious effort to raise ethical standards in public service. The HONEST Act, as amended, rightly applies its stock trading ban not only to Members of Congress, but now to the President and Vice President as well. I strongly support this legislation and look forward to voting for it on the Floor of the House.

However, since the legislation stipulates that the law doesn't start until an elected official's new term in office, it exempts Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Donald Trump signed an executive order which adds a further 40% tariff to Brazilian imports – bringing the total to 50%.

The White House says that the tariffs are a penalty for the Government of Brazil's politically motivated persecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters. The administration maintains that these punitive tariffs are part of the President's plans to protect “the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States from a foreign threat.”

This comes after the earlier move from the Treasury Department to issue sanctions against the high court judge overseeing Bolsonaro's attempted coup trial.

Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, announced on Wednesday that she will not run for governor of California – a highly anticipated decision that leaves the contest to lead the country's largest blue state wide open.

In a statement Harris said:

For now, my leadership – and public service – will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.

Powell adds that today's Federal Reserve meeting was “quite good” but there were two dissenters at the meeting.

And on the impact of tariffs, Powell says there has been “substantial amount of tariff revenue collected” each month. But he adds that the process with “probably be slower than expected at the beginning, but we never expected it to be fast, and we think we have a long way to go.”

Powell underscores the Fed's reasoning:

The labor market looks solid. Inflation is above target. And even if you look through the tariff effects we think it's still a bit above target.

Jerome Powell said that while the interest rate will remain steady today, there will be two rounds of jobs and inflation data by the time of the next meeting in September.

He did add, however, that they have made “no decisions about September,” but they will be taking that interim information into consideration ahead of the next decision.

Jerome Powell is outlining the Federal Reserve's decision to keep the interest rate steady.

“Our obligation is to keep longer term inflation's inflation expectations well anchored, and to prevent a one time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem,” he said.

The US Federal Reserve has elected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at between 4.25 and 4.5%, a rate it has maintained since the end of 2024.

The divided Federal Reserve voted to keep the rate steady despite a barrage of criticism from Trump and dissents from two officials.

“Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated,” a press release following the decision states.

The decision was met with opposition from governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, with both advocating for the Fed to start easing in acknowledgement that inflation is under control and the labor market could weaken soon. This marks the first time since 1993 that multiple governors cast no votes on a rate decision.

Trump dismissed concerns that lowering interest rates could ultimately increase inflation. “Well, if that happens, you just raise them,” he said.

Trump is taking questions now, and is resolute that interest rates must drop.

“We're keeping the rates high, and we're hurting people from buying houses,” he says.

Taking another jab, in a long series of them, at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, Trump says “he's done a bad job.”

The president says that Powell is always “too late”, and adds that Powell probably won't cut the interest rate today for reasons that “nobody knows.”

President Trump is now in the Roosevelt Room signing a bill that provides relief to veterans and their families who have fallen behind on mortgage payments.

In response to the new congressional map released by Texas Republicans today, Democrats in the state and beyond have wasted no time rebuking it.

The Texas House Democrats said in a statement:

These maps are a corrupt, racially motivated gerrymander designed to steal the voices of Black and Latino Texans so Donald Trump can send five new hand-picked allies to Washington.

Similarly, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) said that it anticipates Texas will land itself a lawsuit, and believes “the map will get struck down”.

They added that they plan “to recruit aggressively to unseat every single newly vulnerable Republican who went along with this corrupt scheme”.

The treasury department announced sanctions today against Alexandre de Moraes – the high court judge overseeing the investigation into disgraced former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who is on trial for allegedly attempting to launch a coup after losing the 2022 Brazilian election.

Earlier this month secretary of state Marco Rubio said on social media that he ordered a visa revocation for De Moraes.

The US accuses De Moraes of “arbitrary pre-trial detentions and suppress freedom of expression”.

In a statement treasury secretary Scott Bessent added:

De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions—including against former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Today marks the first of three days of hearings investigating the plane collision in DC that killed 67 people in January.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is holding the hearings after an American Airlines passenger jet collided midair with a Black Hawk helicopter earlier this year. The crash killed all aboard both aircrafts. It is also the US's deadliest air disaster since November 2001.

NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the three days will be a “fact finding proceeding”, and today's hearing opened with a video animation of where both aircrafts were leading up to the collision.

At the press conference, when asked about whether Democratic senators would be comfortable with redactions, minority leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers “wouldn't force any agreements that have been broken”, but added that he believes “almost everything can come out”.

Schumer also said that he wants the files to be made available to the public and members of Congress, and that Democratic members are working to get some Republican colleagues on board to help make the files public. “It should be bipartisan,” he said. “But if not, there's recourse in the courts. This is the law.”

Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee, shared more about how the letter works, and what it demands.

“We are using very unique statutory authority that is granted only to our committee, to homeland security and government affairs. The statute that we are invoking requires the administration to hand over documents … requested by any five members of the Senate committee,” Peters said.

“This letter demands that the justice department produce documents that attorney general Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have publicly already confirmed they have in their possession. We all know in fact that the attorney general said, quote, she said they're sitting on her desk. It should be pretty easy to turn over documents that are sitting on the attorney general's desk.”

At the Capitol, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is outlining his attempt to force attorney general Pam Bondi to release the files related to the investigation of disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

“We're invoking federal law and using our authority as a check on the executive to compel transparency,” Schumer said.

“Today's letter matters. It's not a stunt, it's not symbolic, it's a formal exercise of congressional power under federal law, and we expect an answer from DoJ by August the 15th. That's what accountability looks like. This is what oversight looks like, and this is what keeping your promises to the American people look like.”

He noted that both Bondi and Donald Trump had previously said they want the case file's released:

This is not complicated. After promising full transparency for years, every single time Trump, his administration, Republican leaders have had a chance to be transparent about the Epstein files, they've chosen to hide. The evasions, the delays, the excuses, they are not just odd, they're alarming. It begs the question, if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?

Trump should stop hiding from the truth, he should stop hiding from the American people.

            A sea of birch trees and Baltic pines sways in the wind as the road goes deeper into the forest. Here in the peaceful depths of western Lithuania's Žemaitija National Park, an area of idyllic lakes, wetlands, old villages and forests 30 miles inland from the Baltic Sea, Soviet missile operators once waited in secret, poised for the destruction of Western Europe.
    


            Today, the once-classified complex known as Plokštinė Missile Base is the park's most-visited attraction, the Cold War Museum. In 2024, 35,000 people from all over the world came to explore this eerie underground world, including subterranean rooms, passages and a missile silo, plunging 100 feet beneath the ground.
    


            Several lines of barbed wire greet anyone arriving at the facility. Four white domes then come into view, contrasting with the green of the forest — the bunkers that once housed weapons of mass destruction. The structures stand there like parasitic mushrooms that don't belong in their surroundings.
    


            The history of the base reflects the logic of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. Western Lithuania — at the time, part of the USSR's Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic — was a perfect location for storing warheads targeting NATO countries.
    


            Squaring off against Scandinavia across the Baltic Sea, Lithuania was turned into a highly militarized zone with rocket bases, military towns and garrisons. Neighboring Latvia and Estonia — also part of the USSR — suffered the same fate.
    


            The Plokštinė forest, in the middle of nowhere, offered ideal conditions for building a secret underground complex. The 4.6 square mile Plateliai Lake nearby provided water for cooling systems, the population of the surrounding villages was small, and the soft, sandy soil was easy to excavate.
    


            Plokštinė missile base was completed in 1962 after two years of construction, involving more than 10,000 workers from all around the Soviet Union. Such an immense job didn't go unnoticed by the local population.
    


            “People didn't know what kind of weapons were stored there, but we knew about this place,” says Aušra Brazdeikytė, a guide at the Cold War Museum.
    


            Brazdeikytė was born in a village not far from the base and spent her whole life in the area.
    


            Soldiers became a fixture of local life, and hearing heavy machinery transporting military equipment was a regular occurrence.

            “We worked alongside soldiers from different Soviet republics at collective farms, but never discussed military topics,” she remembers. Asking the wrong questions could end tragically in the Soviet Union.
    


            The complex was heavily secured, with an electric fence stretching for two miles around the base. The dense forest made it even harder to reach, so the locals made no attempts to access it.
    


            All this secrecy paid off. US intelligence only discovered the base in 1978 through satellite reconnaissance. By then, the Soviets had decommissioned the facility as part of the rocket disarmament agreements between the USSR and the US.
    


            The entrance to the facility is — as it always was — through a hole in the ground.
    


            “Please, wipe your feet,” reads a sign in Russian above the hermetically sealed door. Cleanliness is important in a workplace, especially if you work at a secret underground facility with nuclear warheads.
    


            Plokštinė missile base was an elaborate military project, an exemplary facility of its kind in the Soviet Union. Centered around an underground command center with a network of corridors, it also had four 100-foot shafts housing R-12 Dvina surface-to-surface missiles. There was even a subterranean power plant to generate energy in emergencies.
    


            After Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, and the subsequent fall of the Iron Curtain, the base was completely abandoned and pillaged for its metal. Thanks to EU funding, local officials were able to create a superb museum, which opened in 2012, giving the public access to the command center, electric plant, and one silo.
    


            Walking through the dim underground maze gives you an eerie feeling — not least because it is filled with Soviet paraphernalia: statues of Lenin and Stalin, military awards, and hammer-and-sickle ceramics and flags. Visitors pass through thematic interactive halls devoted to various stages of the Cold War and learn about the propaganda produced during the second half of the turbulent 20th century. Here and there, lifelike silicon mannequins of grumpy soldiers send you to a Soviet-flavored uncanny valley.
    


            The most impressive attractions are the abandoned remains of military technology. The skeleton of the former electric plant would be an ideal background for a computer game. There's a gargantuan hall where the tank with missile fuel was stored.

            But the centerpiece is the silo. You will feel small and dizzy standing at the edge of the 100-foot hole into the abyss. Although missiles never left this shaft to sow destruction, there have been casualties over the years.
    


            “A soldier fell to his death when his [safety] belt broke during a routine service check,” says Brazdeikytė, her words echoing somberly in the darkness.
    


            “Two other soldiers died during a nitric acid spill while trying to refuel the missile,” she adds. The darkness thickens.
    


            Steps away from the four silos is the ghost town that was never named. Originally it housed around 300 soldiers and officers who worked at the missile base.
    


            Bizarrely, after the decommissioning of Plokštinė base, some administrative buildings in the town were converted into a children's summer camp. Called Žuvėdra, meaning seagull, it ran from 1979 to 1990. A bus stop right behind the entrance gate is painted with a colorful mural that shows a gnome on a mushroom holding a flower.
    


            Today, not much is left of the military town. The most compelling sight is a series of former storage hangars. Covered in mud and grass, they look like ancient pyramids lost to the forest.
    


            The juxtaposition of the somber abandoned nuclear missile base and the beautiful region surrounding it could be an allegory of modern Lithuania.
    


            The country has successfully overcome decades of Soviet occupation and turned its Cold War scars into teachable moments.
    


            Away from the base, Žemaitija National Park is one of the most gorgeous places in the Lithuania, filled with attractions. Visiting the park takes you to the heart of Samogitia — a region with rich local culture. Pagan and Christian traditions coexist here – it's thought this land was the last part of Europe to be converted to Christianity in the 15th century.
    


Chernobyl once brought tourists to Ukraine. They're still coming but now to see scars of different terror



Žemaičių blynai, or Samogitan pancakes, are the local food superstars — hearty potato pancakes with meat inside. Cepelinai, a potato dumpling stuffed with cottage cheese or ground meat, is another Lithuanian comfort food. And nobody leaves without sampling šaltibarščiai, a cold, pink-colored beetroot soup.
    


            The town of Plateliai, 15 minutes north of the nuclear site, is home to the Church of Apostles Peter and Paul, an awe-inspiring 18th-century wooden building. A restored manor in town is now home to a Mardi Gras Museum with distinctive wooden masks.
    


            Lake Plateliai itself is one for nature lovers, with cycling and hiking trails, waterside campsite spots and scenic restaurants next to the shore.
    


            Once, the biggest secret of Žemaitija was the Plokštinė nuclear missile base. Today, the region itself is a hidden gem of slow European travel.

A tsunami advisory sign is seen near Wickaninish Beach at Pacific Rim National Park near Tofino, B.C., on Tuesday.Dirk Meissner/The Canadian Press

The British Columbia government has cancelled a tsunami advisory that was issued after a massive underwater earthquake off Russia that was one of the strongest ever recorded. 

The advisory initially said tsunami waves of less than 30 centimetres were expected to hit Tofino, B.C., around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, after the quake that had a preliminary magnitude of 8.8.

Overnight, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the waves were highest in B.C. at Langara Island, at 27 centimetres.

They were 21 centimetres in Tofino.

The Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness issued a bulletin saying the province was standing down its operations centre.

“No zones of coastal British Columbia are at risk. Repeat, no zones of coastal British Columbia are at risk,” the 6:25 a.m. bulletin said.

Eyewitness footage shot on Wednesday (July 30) captured the moment of a tsunami hitting a Russian town, following a magnitude 8.8 earthquake off the country's Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula. 

Reuters

While the advisory was in place, British Columbians were being urged to stay away from the coast.

The District of Tofino had closed beaches and the province's emergency information agency warned of strong waves and currents.

The quake struck just before 4:25 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday, about 119 kilometres east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of about 180,000 residents in Russia's Kamchatka region.

The preliminary magnitude of 8.8 would make it the world's strongest quake since 2011, and one of the 10 most powerful recorded since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Signs alerting people about the now-cancelled tsunami advisory had been posted at Wickaninnish Beach in Pacific Rim National Park, southeast of Tofino, but people continued to take in Tuesday's sunset, although the parking lot was mostly empty.

Campers at the JX Surf Shop campground between Tofino and Ucluelet on Vancouver Island were glued to their phones Tuesday night searching for the news about the tsunami, but most campers appeared to be staying put.

A magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, generating a tsunami of up to 4 meters (13 feet), damaging buildings and prompting evacuation warnings in the area, officials said.

Reuters

Beyond B.C., the quake sent tsunami waves into Japan, Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. 

Several people were injured, but none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far. 

Authorities warned the risk from the quake could last for hours, and millions of people potentially in the path of the waves were initially told to move away from the shore or seek high ground. 

The worst appeared to have passed for many areas, including the U.S., Japan and the affected parts of Russia. But Chile raised its tsunami warning to the highest level for most of its lengthy Pacific coast and said it was evacuating hundreds of people.

In the immediate aftermath of the quake off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula, residents fled inland as ports flooded, and several were injured while rushing to leave buildings.

Three tsunami waves hit Russia's coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk on Wednesday, in the main settlement on the Kuril Islands in the Pacific, according to the local mayor Aleksandr Ovsyannikov.

People in Guam and Japan move to higher ground, while highways in Hawaii busy as residents leave for safe areas

Tsunami warning live updates

In the Pacific territory of Guam shortly before lunchtime on Tuesday, Sam Mabini's phone began to ping. A tsunami warning had been issued after an 8.8-magnitude quake struck a remote part of the Russian coast. Authorities had put out the alert over concerns that destructive waves could slam the shoreline in the coming hours, and urged people to move away from the coast. Mabini, a former Guam senator, took action.

“I went to higher ground just in case,” she said. Her family lives in the lower area of Tamuning and they moved to a more elevated part of the village. She joined other residents who evacuated to Agana Heights, a higher part of Hagåtña, the capital of the US island in the western Pacific Ocean.

In villages, towns and cities across the world's largest ocean, from Russian and Chinese ports to Japanese fishing communities and coastal cities across the US west coast and farther south in Latin America, warnings and evacuation orders rang out after the quake, one of the strongest ever recorded. Workers were sent home and businesses locked down as they braced for what might hit in the hours ahead.

Over the course of Wednesday, governments in many countries including the US and Japan downgraded their initial tsunami alerts, but not until after countless people across multiple time zones had fled as a precaution, many in the middle of the night.

In parts of Russia, waves of up to 4 metres were recorded and authorities urged people to move away from the shoreline.

In Japan, footage by the public broadcaster NHK showed many people on the roof of a building on the northern island of Hokkaido, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, while fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.

About 200 people evacuated to a Buddhist temple that sits on high ground overlooking Kamaishi, in Iwate prefecture, a city that lost about 1,250 residents in the devastating March 2011 tsunami. The Senjuin temple is a designated municipal tsunami evacuation area.

The chief priest, Keio Shibasaki, told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper: “Considering that more than 1,000 people took refuge here after the [2011] earthquake, the number of evacuees is relatively small, but we have started preparing lunch with stored food in case of unforeseen circumstances such as power outages. We are prepared for a long stay.”

Evacuees included staff from the city hall, the post office, and children and teachers from the nearby Kamaishi kindergarten.

“We evacuated when the tsunami warning was issued,” the kindergarten head, Keito Fujiwara, told the Mainichi Shimbun. “We stored emergency food supplies at the temple and have been preparing accordingly. During the 2011 earthquake, there were cases where parents went to pick up their children and became victims, so we communicated via group LINE [a popular Japanese messaging app] that under no circumstances should anyone go to pick up their children.”

In 2011, the tsunami waves swept over the Kamaishi tsunami protection breakwater, a decades-long $1.5bn project that had been completed two years previously, inundating the city in scenes that were captured on video and seen around the world.

The only death related to Wednesday's tsunami appeared to be in Japan, where a 58-year-old woman was reported to have died after her car fell from a cliff as she evacuated to higher ground, according to local media.

In Hawaii, tsunami warning sirens blared twice on Tuesday afternoon on multiple islands including Oahu, where the capital, Honolulu, is located, and Kauai. Evacuations were ordered for some coastal areas as the Honolulu department of emergency management warned: “Take action! Destructive tsunami waves expected.”

As residents raced to get out, traffic backed up in some Honolulu neighbourhoods. Even though it is summer break for pupils, some schools issued alerts cancelling sports and other activities.

On Kauai shortly after the tsunami warning was issued, staff at the National Tropical Botanical Garden suspended tours on its south shore and moved all visitors and employees out of the inundation zone to higher ground.

Still, blue skies and breezy conditions prevailed as many in Hawaii left work early heading for home or for designated safe areas away from the islands' heavily populated coastline. Residents have become particularly sensitive to phone warnings and civil defence sirens after Hawaii's emergency management agency issued a false alert warning of an inbound “ballistic missile threat” in 2018, causing widespread panic.

All islands activated emergency operating centres, shelters began opening, and people in coastal areas were advised to head to higher ground immediately. Kauai police asked the public to stay off the road unless absolutely necessary. When the waves arrived, they were not as destructive as feared, and Hawaii's emergency management agency said evacuation orders had been lifted and there were no reports of major damage.

In Guam, residents were urged to remain out of the water and told to move away from beaches and harbours, at least 100ft (30 metres) inland and 50ft above sea level. The port authority and other government agencies suspended operations, while marina users and local residents were told to evacuate to higher ground. Workers in some businesses and in the Guam visitors bureau in the coastal district of Tumon were sent home.

But some were not worried by the warnings. Tessa Borja, a policy analyst from Tumon, did not feel evacuating was necessary and stayed in her second-floor flat. “We are protected by the reef,” she said.

In nearby Saipan, the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, similar warnings were issued. Government offices were closed and businesses in low-lying areas shut their doors. Petrol stations had long queues of vehicles wanting to fill up.

Some residents living near the shoreline in Saipan, an island of about 43,000 people, fled to higher ground as they waited for the all clear from authorities. Tsunami drills by emergency authorities have been held regularly in on the island.

As the ripples of the earthquake spread across the Pacific, Latin America was one of the last places to be hit. Peruvians received beeping alerts and text messages on their phones from the National Civil Defence Institute, warning them to stay away from the beach and telling authorities to close coastal access points along the country's 1,864-mile (3,000km) Pacific-facing coastline.

In the capital Lima, the coastal road was closed, though La Punta, a low-lying peninsula in the nearby port district Callao, was not evacuated. R Adm Jorge Vizcarra, a spokesperson for the Peruvian navy, said: “The train of waves will be noticeable, but it will not be high enough to have a significant impact on the population.”

Beijing could face sweeping U.S. trade penalties for continuing to purchase Russian oil, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on July 29, Reuters reported.

"The Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously," Bessent said at a news conference in Stockholm. "We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they'd like to pay a 100% tariff."

"So I think anyone who buys sanctioned Russian oil should be ready for this."

His comments came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that secondary tariffs on Russia will take effect in 10 days unless the Kremlin agrees to a ceasefire, setting the deadline for Aug. 7.

Trump initially issued a 50-day ultimatum on July 14, threatening "severe" tariffs unless a peace deal is reached within that period. On July 28, he signaled growing impatience, saying he was no longer willing to wait that long.

Despite mounting pressure from the West, Beijing has maintained strong trade and diplomatic ties with Moscow. China is the top buyer of Russian crude oil and a key supplier of dual-use components that support Russia's war machine. 

Secondary sanctions, such as those proposed by Washington, would target countries and companies that do business with Russia by imposing penalties on their access to U.S. markets. 

If a third-party country like China keeps buying Russian oil, exports to the U.S. could face a further 100% tariff, significantly raising prices for American consumers and squeezing Chinese exporters.

Trump, who had promised to broker a peace deal within 24 hours of taking office, has grown increasingly frustrated with what he described as Russia's delays in moving forward with peace talks.

The U.S. strategy seeks to pressure Moscow by curbing its oil income, which accounts for roughly one-third of federal revenue and remains a vital source of funding for its war effort.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on July 15 that the tariff threat was "serious," but so far Moscow has not publicly responded to the ultimatum.

NEW YORK, July 30. /TASS/. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is considering the possibility of running for Tennessee governor next year, so he will have to leave his post as Pentagon chief, NBC News reported citing sources.

According to the sources, over the past three weeks Hegseth has been seriously discussing the possibility of running and starting an election campaign. However, according to Pentagon rules, Hegseth's participation in the gubernatorial election will require his resignation from his post as Defense Secretary. This will be the largest reshuffle in the leadership of the US defense department, NBC News noted.

However, Assistant Secretary of the Pentagon for Public Affairs Sean Parnell denied this information in a comment to the TV channel and said that "Hegseth's focus remains solely on serving under President Trump" and "advancing the America First mission at the Department of Defense."

"Fake news NBC is so desperate for attention, they are shopping around a made up story… again. Only two options exist: either the ‘sources' are imaginary or these reporters are getting punked," Parnell added.

According to NBC News sources, if Hegseth does announce that he is running for governor, Trump may temporarily hand over his duties to US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll or Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby.

In May, Taiwan shuttered its last nuclear reactor, completing a process of denuclearization that had unfolded over four decades. In the mid-1980s, the island generated half its electric power from nuclear energy, an enterprise undertaken by the dictator Chiang Kai-shek in response to the oil shock of the 1970s. But once military rule ended, in 1987, antinuclear sentiment began to take hold. Taiwan's early democratic activists feared that they could have a Chernobyl disaster of their own and associated nuclear power with Taiwan's authoritarian past.

The 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan added to nuclear fears. In the following years, Taiwan's government let licenses lapse for six functioning nuclear reactors—all with good track records—and halted the construction of two more. In doing so, they inadvertently undermined the island's energy security. Today, the island imports 98 percent of its energy, in the form of oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and coal. This reliance on energy imports could easily be exploited, especially by China, which has its eyes on unifying with Taiwan. The Chinese navy and coast guard routinely rehearse cutting off the island's ports, including from energy tankers.

Such a scenario would be a disaster not just for Taiwan but also for the United States. Taiwan supplies nearly all the advanced logic chips that U.S. technology firms use to power artificial intelligence. Chipmakers, both from Taiwan and elsewhere, are now trying to set up more advanced chip factories within the United States. But the trillions of dollars in capital and know-how already invested in Taiwan mean that, for the foreseeable future at least, the United States' AI success or failure runs directly through the island.

Taiwan is, in some ways, already facing an energy crisis: Taiwan's overtaxed electricity infrastructure is struggling to keep up with roaring AI chip production. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company alone now uses eight percent of Taiwan's power, almost half the amount consumed by all the island's homes. If the United States wants to ensure it has access to the leading AI chips—and if it wants to avoid a messy geopolitical crisis in which China holds Taiwan's energy imports captive—it should shore up Taiwan's energy security by helping to improve its energy storage and encouraging the island to embrace nuclear power.

Taiwan has spent years preparing for the threat of Chinese harassment. Taipei, for example, has doubled its defense spending over the past decade and now requires young men to serve a year of military service. It is surprising, then, that Taiwan has pursued energy policies that make itself so vulnerable to disruption. But the Taiwanese people, like those in many other democracies, see themselves as part of a global commons and have thought about their energy system largely through an environmental lens.

The island's energy policy is aimed at moving away from nuclear and coal in favor of renewables and natural gas. In 2022, the government even set the ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Such shifts were underscored by international pressure, especially from many of the U.S. companies that buy chips and other components from Taiwan; Apple, for instance, increasingly demands that local suppliers limit emissions.

Unfortunately, Taiwan's green energy transition is faring poorly. Just 12 percent of Taiwan's electricity mix came from renewables in 2024, falling short of the government's intention to hit 20 percent by 2025. The culprits are varied: onerous local-content requirements, land use limitations, and broader rising costs. When it comes to construction, Taiwan is more like California than Guangdong, with many people objecting to having new energy infrastructure built in their backyards.

As a result, the island has been pushing much of its existing infrastructure to the brink. The utilization ratio for Taiwan's two current LNG import terminals—in other words, the proportion of the facility that is used relative to its capacity—is over 90 percent, compared with 50 percent for the region's average. That leaves Taiwan little flexibility to surge imports or repair facilities. A third terminal is set to come online this summer, but it is years behind schedule because of environmental protests.



Adding to Taiwan's energy insecurity is the fact that its power grid, while cost-effective, is also brittle. The grid must shift power generated in the less-populated south to demand centers in the north through three mountainous transmission lines. In normal operating conditions, the power grid's reserve margins—that is, its buffer to generate extra electricity to meet unexpected shocks—regularly fall below ten percent, levels that would be concerning in the United States. The island struggles with blackouts, and the periodic threat of losing power stresses Taiwan's high-tech manufacturers. For example, half of Taiwan's chipmaking science parks faced rolling outages in May 2021.

Taiwan's insecurity is also exacerbated by its limited capacity to store energy. The United States and Europe can, thanks to their geology, stockpile months' worth of natural gas in depleted underground caverns, but the islands of East Asia—Japan, Korea, and Taiwan—must use tanks, which are much more costly. Taiwan's neighbors have taken steps to address this issue. Japan, for instance, spent the past 50 years bolstering its energy security by building extensive storage and creating its own LNG tanker fleet, now the world's largest, which both transports gas and acts as a form of floating storage. South Korea, meanwhile, maintains a 30-to-40-day supply of LNG to last through its cold winters. Taiwan, by contrast, can store enough for just ten days. With one LNG tanker unloading in a Taiwanese port every day and a half, a naval blockade, or even back-to-back typhoons, could quickly exhaust normal supplies.

In many ways, Germany serves as a useful cautionary tale for Taiwan: both closed well-functioning nuclear reactors, doubled down on a fragile natural gas import strategy, and hoped that renewables would grow fast enough to fill the gaps. In Germany's case, it grew reliant on Russian fuel, and when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Berlin had to scramble to divest and find other sources. Taiwan, by contrast, still has time to adjust. Investments in grid resiliency and energy storage would help, as would restarting recently closed nuclear reactors.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the people of Taiwan have begun to understand that they must take their own security—including energy security—more seriously. They identify with Ukraine, which endures nightly assaults on its power grid. They also see that Ukraine, and Europe more broadly, has suffered economic costs because of energy disruptions. People in Taiwan seem to be changing their minds. According to a poll conducted in August 2024 by Taiwan's CommonWealth Magazine, for example, nearly 70 percent of Taiwanese now wish to preserve nuclear power.

Yet in Taiwan's spirited democracy, the antinuclear minority remains powerful and well organized. And there are few outside technical experts that Taiwan can turn to for advice on how to change course, in part because it is not a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's International Energy Agency, whose remit is to analyze and mitigate energy security risks.

Given the importance to the United States of Taiwan meeting emerging power needs, the U.S. government should step in to help Taiwan reconsider its energy options. Despite its extensive work in international energy affairs, for instance, the U.S. Department of Energy has largely ignored Taiwan because of its diplomatic status and Washington's bureaucratic inertia. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the agency responsible for energy statistics, last published a review of Taiwan's energy system nine years ago. A more formal analysis of Taiwan's energy tradeoffs, using the same sorts of sophisticated models the U.S. government uses for itself, would help Taiwan's Energy Bureau assess risks and opportunities for changing its system.



Taiwan can also learn from the U.S. example. President Donald Trump has supported a revival of civil nuclear power by signing executive orders that aim to simplify nuclear permitting and reestablish the country “as the global leader in nuclear energy.” Congress has furnished subsidies and grants to keep older nuclear plants operating. And the United States' Nuclear Regulatory Commission has extended licenses of nearly all operating reactors from 40 years to 60 years, and in some cases, even 80 years. The U.S. technology sector is also resuscitating nuclear power to meet AI energy needs: Microsoft has signed a contract with Constellation Energy, an electric utility company, to reopen a reactor at Three Mile Island.

Taiwan could similarly restart the reactors it has closed over the past few years, including those at Maanshan and Kuosheng. Current and retired leaders of Taiwanese technology firms, such as Pegatron and United Microelectronics Company, have advocated for doing so. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Energy should hold technical talks with its Taiwanese counterparts on relicensing closed reactors, assessing seismic risks to nuclear plants, and managing spent fuel. And as the United States deploys its own third- and fourth-generation small modular reactors, which are safer and may be cheaper than earlier models, it should invite Taiwanese officials to witness the process so they can evaluate the technology's suitability for the island.

Cooperation over energy security should go beyond the nuclear realm. The United States and Taiwan should jointly evaluate the possibility of starting new LNG export projects. They could also establish a working group, made up of people from the public and private sectors, to propose ways to speed up the development of gas storage and handle disruptions to LNG shipping.

The fate of Taiwan's democracy may well rest in its ability to produce and store energy. If the island can stockpile more of it and resurrect its nuclear reactors, it would be in a much better position to withstand invasion or disruption. The United States should help Taiwan improve its energy security, not just for the island's sake but for its own. Nuclear power could be key to keeping the lights on at the world's chip factory.

 A tsunami warning has been issued for the coastal areas of Russia's Far East, with hazardous waves also possible in Japan, Alaska and Hawaii, after an earthquake struck off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The quake, initially measured at magnitude 7.5, since upgraded to 8.8, was registered around 11:30am local time on Wednesday, approximately 136km southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, according to the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The US Geological Survey (USGS) later assessed it as magnitude 8.8.

“An absolute tsunami alert on the coast of Avacha Bay!” the Russian agency announced, warning of potentially hazardous waves along the Kamchatka shoreline.

“The wave height is not large, but it is NECESSARY to move away from the coast. Under no circumstances should anyone approach the shoreline to observe the tsunami – this could be dangerous,” the Kamchatka branch of the Emergency Situations Ministry said. 

Residents reported strong shaking during the initial tremors, which caused furniture to rattle, household appliances to fall, and car alarms to activate.

Walls collapsed at a kindergarten in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, according to videos from the scene, though no casualties have been reported. The Emergency Situations Ministry (EMERCOM) said the quake's intensity reached 8 points in parts of the city.

In the Kuril Islands, a tsunami threat was declared following seismic activity near Severo-Kurilsk, located on Paramushir Island. Sakhalin Region Governor Valery Limarenko confirmed that evacuations are underway in the area as a precaution.

The Japan Meteorological Agency has also issued a tsunami advisory for wide areas along Japan's Pacific coast, stretching from Hokkaido to Kyushu. The authorities have urged residents in coastal regions to remain alert and evacuate low-lying areas if necessary.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued Tsunami Advisories for Alaska's Aleutian Islands and the entire state of Hawaii.

Watch live as the National Transportation Safety Board begins three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January.

Investigators probing the January midair collision of a passenger plane and an Army helicopter over Washington that killed 67 people found the chopper was flying higher than it should have been and its altitude readings were inaccurate.

The details came out of the first day of National Transportation Safety Board hearings in Washington, where investigators aim to uncover insights into what caused the crash between the American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, and the Black Hawk helicopter over Ronald Reagan National Airport.

The board opened the three days of hearings by showing an animation and playing audio and video from the night of the collision, as well as questioning witnesses and investigators about how the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army may have contributed to nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001. 

The board's final report won't be released until sometime next year, but it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying this route near the airport.

The January nighttime incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.




The hearing opened Wednesday with a video animation showing where the helicopter and airliner were leading up to the collision. It showed how the helicopter flew above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit on the helicopter route along the Potomac River before colliding with the plane. 

Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.

Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn't exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings.

Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn't find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them.

She said as long as an altimeter registers an altitude within 70 feet of the published altitude before takeoff the altimeter is considered accurate under the checklists.

Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk's altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet. 

The greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such small separation distances between helicopters and planes when planes are landing.

“The fact that we have less than 500 foot separation is a concern for me,” the Army's Scott Rosengren said.

But Rosengren said that “if he was king for a day” he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in this crash and replace them with newer versions of the helicopters.

Army officials and the head of a local medevac helicopter company that flies around Washington told the board they believed air traffic controllers would never let them fly the helicopter route involved in the crash anytime a plane was approaching the runway.

Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vetchen said after the crash he talked to many of his fellow pilots and everyone had the same assumption that controllers would never allow them to fly across the path of the runway the American plane was approaching before the crash. 

Citing the numbers for runways, Van Vetchen said that “100% of the time when I was on route four and 33/15 was active” he would be instructed to hold until after the plane landed or took off from that runway.

During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft, according to the NTSB's History of Flight Performance Study.

The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.

“All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,” the report stated. “This resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.”

Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision.

Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it. Officials on Wednesday also raised the use of night vision goggles, which limit the wearer's field of view, on the helicopter as a factor. 

The animation ended with surveillance video showing the helicopter colliding with the plane in a fiery crash.

Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capitol with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, introduced legislation Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.

The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. 

Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he'd like to discuss “a few tweaks,” the legislation is “the right approach.” He also suggested that the previous administration “was asleep at the wheel” amid dozens of near-misses in the airspace around Washington's airspace.

The fight over Trump's most unqualified prosecutor is escalating quickly.

On Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump called for Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to eliminate what Trump called the “‘Blue Slip' SCAM,” a Senate tradition that gives home-state senators a veto power over some presidential nominees who wield power entirely within the senator's state. Trump posted about his opposition to blue slips on Truth Social, his personal communications platform.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The blue slip is an informal Senate tradition, named after the blue pieces of paper that senators use to indicate whether they approve of a judicial or US attorney nominee for their own state. The practical effect of a senator's decision to oppose such a nominee varies wildly depending on who serves as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But, in recent years, senators of both parties have used the blue slip process to veto people nominated to serve as top federal prosecutors and as district judges, the lowest rank of federal judge who receives a lifetime appointment.

Trump's call to eliminate blue slips comes just one week after the temporary appointment of Alina Habba, one of Trump's former personal lawyers, as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey expired.

Federal law permits Attorney General Pam Bondi to temporarily appoint US attorneys for up to 120 days. Once that clock runs out, however, the same law allows federal district judges within the same judicial district to replace the attorney general's choice. Habba's appointment expired last week, and New Jersey's federal judges picked Desiree Leigh Grace, a career prosecutor, to replace her.

Bondi then claimed that Grace “has just been removed.” So it is unclear who, if anyone, currently serves as US Attorney for the District of New Jersey.

During her brief tenure in the office, Habba wielded her powers aggressively to target elected Democrats. She brought charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and US Rep. LaMonica McIver relating to the two Democrats' protest of an immigration detention facility in New Jersey.

A federal magistrate judge called the charges against Baraka a “worrisome misstep,” and Habba eventually ended that prosecution. The charges against McIver are still pending, despite a federal law that permits sitting members of Congress to enter federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight duties.

Habba also opened federal investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, and its Democratic attorney general, Matt Platkin, over a directive limiting state law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration officials. Under a line of Supreme Court decisions stretching back to New York v. United States (1992), the federal government may not compel state police to participate in federal law enforcement.

Currently, Habba's nomination to lead the New Jersey US Attorney's office indefinitely is on hold due to opposition from US Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats from New Jersey. Booker and Kim, in other words, used their blue slips to block the appointment of Habba.

In his post denouncing the blue slip, Trump complained that the Senate tradition currently prevents him from installing his choices for judicial and prosecutorial jobs in the blue states of “California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Virginia, and other places.” Given Habba's conduct in office during her brief tenure as US attorney, it is likely that Trump would install loyalists as prosecutors who would target Democrats within those states.

If Trump is also able to appoint district judges without seeking home-state senators' permission, these political trials could be conducted by Trump-loyalist prosecutors and then heard by Trump judges who are likely to attempt to rig them to ensure a conviction. Imagine judges like Aileen Cannon, the Trump judge who sabotaged the Justice Department's attempt to prosecute Trump for stealing classified documents, hearing political trials in every blue state.

Habba's conduct in office makes a compelling case for leaving existing norms in place. Right now, Trump cannot install loyalist prosecutors in blue states for more than 120 days. And he will have a tougher time installing loyalist district judges.

Before Trump's rise to power, however, the blue slip was often abused by senators seeking partisan control of the judiciary. For most of the Obama presidency, for example, then-Senate Judiciary Chair Patrick Leahy (D-VT) didn't just give home-state senators a veto over district judges and US attorneys. He also permitted them to veto more powerful appellate judges, who typically hear cases arising out of more than one state.

Republican senators wielded the power Leahy gave them with brutal effectiveness. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which oversees federal suits out of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, is currently dominated by MAGA judges known for extravagantly reasoned decisions declaring entire federal agencies unconstitutional or permitting red states to seize control of social media platforms — among other things. (These decisions are frequently reversed by the Supreme Court, despite the Court's 6-3 Republican majority.)

A major reason why the Fifth Circuit is such a MAGA stronghold is that, under Leahy, Republican senators from Fifth Circuit states could veto anyone President Barack Obama nominated to serve on this court. Similarly, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) exploited Leahy's expansive blue slip rule to hold a seat on the Seventh Circuit open for most of the Obama presidency. It was eventually filled by a Trump appointee.

Leahy's decision to let individual senators veto appellate judges was unusual, and Republicans abandoned this practice as soon as Trump took office in 2017. Since then, home-state senators have been allowed to veto district court and US attorney nominees, but not appellate judges.

There is some logic to this more limited blue slip process. Because appellate judges oversee multiple states, Leahy's expansive veto rule effectively permitted senators to dictate who would decide cases in neighboring states. The Seventh Circuit, for example, includes not just Johnson's home state of Wisconsin, but also the blue state of Illinois. Why should the senator from Wisconsin get to decide who interprets federal law in Illinois — or, at least, why should Johnson's vote count more than any other senator's?

But the jurisdiction of district judges and US attorneys is limited to a single state. Some states, like New Jersey, are their own federal judicial district. Other states, like California, are chopped into as many as four federal judicial districts. But none of these districts cross state lines.

The current blue slip practice, in other words, permits senators — who are the elected officials chosen to represent an entire state's interests in the federal government — to block nominees who would wield power entirely within their own states. Officials who wield power in multiple states are evaluated by the Senate as a whole.

If Trump gets his way, however, he may not just gain the ability to override home-state senators' vetoes — he may also get to install prosecutors who will bring fabricated charges against those same senators.

President Trump takes part in a bill signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room, enacting new legislation designed to help veterans access federal mortgage support.

President Donald Trump signed the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act into law Wednesday, cementing a partial claims program aimed at preventing veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. 

The new partial claims program under the Department of Veterans' Affairs' (VA) Home Loan Program will allow veterans who are late on mortgage payments to tack on those payments to the tail end of their loans. 

Additionally, the partial claims program seeks to replace the Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase (VASP) program created in 2024 under the Biden administration, but that the Trump administration nixed in May. 

Under the VASP program, the VA bought up delinquent VA loans from mortgage servicers, adjusted the loans and then offered borrowers a fixed 2.5% interest rate for the duration of the loan. 

But the VASP program faced scrutiny from Republicans, who decried that it was established without input from Congress and claimed it jeopardized the entire VA home loan guarantee program and would be costly for taxpayers. Altogether, the VA estimated that it purchased more than 17,000 home loans totaling more than $5.48 billion dollars under VASP. 

The House passed its version of the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act in May, while the Senate passed its version of the measure in July. 

"This bipartisan and bicameral legislation will assist veterans who are facing financial hardships and provide VA with a tool to better help veterans stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure. The VA Home Loan Program provides one of the best benefits VA has to offer, and has helped veterans and their families build home equity since its inception in 1944," House and Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs leaders said in a joint statement on July 16.

Live Updates


            • Improving conditions: Tsunami warnings for the US coastline and Japan have been downgraded to advisories after a massive earthquake off Russia's far eastern coast put the region on high alert.
    


            • Waves persist: A National Weather Service official urged people in the affected areas to stay cautious over the next 24 hours, as waves remain “pretty stubbornly persistent.” The tsunami's first waves hit Russia and Japan, where nearly 2 million people were evacuated, and waves overnight reached US shores — including parts of Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska.
    


• Historic quake: The massive 8.8 magnitude quake is tied for the sixth strongest ever recorded. There were no casualties in Russia, the Kremlin said.
    


            Around 125 aftershocks of magnitude 4.4 or greater have occurred near Russia in the more than 16 hours since massive 8.8 earthquake struck off the coast, according to data from the US Geological Survey.
    


            Of those, three have been magnitude 6.0 or greater, with the strongest being a 6.9 that occurred about 45 minutes after the mainshock.
    


            Strong aftershocks continue to rock the region, with a 6.4 magnitude aftershock striking around 200 miles southwest of yesterday's main quake's epicenter just before 11 a.m. ET Wednesday.
    


            Aftershocks are generally strongest and most numerous in the hours to days after the main earthquake, decreasing in number and intensity as time goes on.
    


            Here's what to expect after a major earthquake, on average:
    


            Video released by the health ministry in Russia's Kamchatka region shows the moment the powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck on Wednesday while doctors were performing surgery at Kamchatka Cancer Center.
    


            Doctors are seen holding onto the patient, surgical equipment and monitors as the room shakes violently.
    


            “Despite the danger, the doctors remained calm and stayed with the patient until the end,” Kamchatka's Health Minister Oleg Melnikov said. “At the moment, the patient is doing well.”
    


            Oncologist Yana Gvozdeva, one of the doctors performing the surgery, said that the operation was alrea﻿dy taking place when the earthquake started, according to a post on the website of Kamchatka region authorities.
    


            “We secured the patient as much as possible so that there would be no indirect processes: the patient did not fall off the table, the instruments did not fall﻿,” she said.
    


            “In turn, the anesthesiologist also secured the equipment that was nearby, because without an anesthesia machine you can't go anywhere. If the machine somehow disconnects from the patient, then the consequences, of course, can be dangerous, fatal,” Gvozdeva continued.
    


            The doctors who performed the surgery, which was to remove a tumor, will be nominated for state awards, according to the post.
    


This post has been updated to include the quotes from Gvozdeva.


Video shows medics in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, continuing a surgery on a patient despite a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck off Russia's far eastern coast on July 30.


            Beaches in Los Angeles County have reopened after tsunami advisories for the West Coast were lifted, the county  said.
    


                    “While the beaches are open, visitors should check with the nearest lifeguard for information on current conditions and practice good judgment before entering the water,” Los Angeles County said in a statement.
                





            Beach camp operators should also check with lifeguards before any in-water activity, the statement said.
    


            Chilean authorities said evacuations are underway along parts of the country's coast due to the threat of a tsunami after the large earthquake off Russia's far eastern coast overnight.
    


            In social media posts on Wednesday, Chile's national disaster response agency SENAPRED said evacuations had begun along the coasts of seven regions in northern Chile: Arica and Parinacota, Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Atacama, Coquimbo, Valparaíso, and O'Higgins.
    


            Videos from social media geolocated by CNN show shrill sirens echoing among the port city of Iquique's waterfront high-rises. After each round of sirens, an automated voice says “emergency” in Spanish.
    


            On Easter Island, residents were urged to head to safety on Wednesday morning.
    


            “Act calmly and follow the instructions of the authorities and response teams,” SENAPRED said. “During the evacuation, do not forget to consider your pet and its needs.”
    


            SENAPRED has put the country's entire coast, including its sparsely populated Antarctic Territory, under a “red alert” according to the agency's website.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron called for “vigilance” in French Polynesia and said that all the services of the state have been mobilized in the semi-autonomous territory to “protect our fellow citizens.”
    


                    “I call for vigilance: follow the instructions of local authorities,” Macron posted on X. “All my support to the Marquesans and all our compatriots in the Pacific.”
                





            Earlier, tsunami waves started to hit the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, authorities said, around 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) away from the epicenter of the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's far east.
    


            French Polynesia is a semi-autonomous French territory consisting of dozens of islands. It spans across more than 5.3 million square kilometers of the south Pacific Ocean.
    


            A surge of water several feet high caused a deck to break off in the Crescent City Harbor District, Harbormaster Mike Rademaker said.
    


            “We didn't have any injuries, fortunately, but we did sustain some damage in the Inner Boat Basin,” Rademaker said Wednesday.
    


            “At approximately 2:40 a.m., we noticed there was a surge of water several feet in height that caused the decking of H dock to lift along its pilings. So, as the water levels continued to rise, the structure was unable to adjust, and the decking became lodged in the pilings and was eventually submerged.”
    


            The dock was completely separated, Rademaker said.
    


            Crescent City, in the northwest corner of California, has a long history of tsunami damage due to its geography and crescent-shaped beach. In 1964, the city suffered a tsunami that killed 11 people and destroyed 289 buildings and homes.
    


            National Weather Service lead meteorologist Matthew Kidwell advised caution for the next 24 hours, noting that while waves are subsiding, Crescent City residents are “not out of woods.”
    


            “The waves are slowly diminishing, but they're pretty stubbornly persistent in Crescent City. So, most likely in the next, at some point this morning the tsunami warning will be downgraded to an advisory that still doesn't mean you're out of the woods,” Kidwell said. “There's still going to be a lot of currents, strong currents throughout the day. I would expect through a lot of the day, you'll need to be especially cautious of the ocean.”
    


            People should stay away from beaches “all day today” and said to be “extra cautious,” he said.
    


            Kidwell added residents should remain cautious into the evening hours. “Even once the advisory drops there could be some minor currents continuing, but overall we're on the downward trend on the wave size,” he said.
    


            The last tsunami warning — the highest level of alert — in effect for the United States coastline has been downgraded to a tsunami advisory. The portion of Northern California that was under the warning is now under a tsunami advisory.
    


            Tsunami advisories are still in effect for other parts of California as well as portions of Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii as the threat of smaller tsunami waves persists.
    


            The Northern California beach community that experienced the highest tsunami waves on the West Coast has not seen damage to buildings so far, according to city officials.
    


            “It was a long night for all of us,” said Eric Wier, the city manager of Crescent City. “We were fortunate this time. There was significant tsunami surges. We're still dealing with those now, but it did stay within the banks of Elk Creek.”
    


            The area saw peak waves of around 8 feet, in line with their highest tides of the year, but not enough to cause flooding inside the central area of the city, Wier said.
    


            “The city downtown is at a high enough elevation that it is open,” said Wier.
    


            Officials in Crescent City, California, are providing the latest updates on the tsunami warning that's impacting the northern portion of the state.
    


            Member of the California Assembly Chris Rogers said that wave activity should be expected for the next 30 hours.
    


            “We still continue to coordinate with the Office of Emergency Services, they are on stand by. Obviously, as we said last night, this is not a one issue, a one wave incident, that we do expect to see is continued activity for the next 30 hours. We are on standby and ready to bring in any resources that we need to be able to assist … Crescent City,” he said.
    


             The only portion of US coastline still under a tsunami warning — the highest-level alert — Wednesday morning is in Northern California. The warning covers about 40 miles of coastline from just south of Klamath, California, to the Oregon border, including Crescent City.
    


            As Latin America enters daytime hours, several regions across the Pacific remain under tsunami alerts following the massive earthquake off Russia's east coast.
    


            Earlier, we showed you the state of play with alerts in the US.

            Ring camera video from a business in Haleiwa, Hawaii, shows a time-lapse footage of water surging from the tsunami.
    


            Blue Planet Adventure Company is located along the Anahulu River in Haleiwa, on the northern shore of Oahu.
    


            The video starts around 7:20 p.m. local time and about 20 minutes later water can be seen rushing out of the area before a surge.
    


            The first surge from the tsunami can be seen around 7:50 p.m., when water can be seen getting very close to the deck of the establishment.
    


            Nearly 20 minutes later another surge takes place, and the water again almost reaches the deck.

            The tsunami alert in Mexico after the earthquake in Russia was issued as a preventive measure, President of Mexico Claudia Sheinbaum said during her morning press conference today.
    


                    “In reality the alert was issued but it did not generate major risks, there is no damage in Mexico,” she said.  “The Secretary of the Navy reported today in the Cabinet that the greatest risk could be precisely at this hour. And the sea level may rise slightly in certain areas of the Pacific, but in reality, the alert was issued, but it did not generate major risks.”
                





            Colombia has issued a red alert in its northeastern Chocó region, as its Pacific coast braces for potential tsunami waves resulting from the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's far east.
    


            Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared a letter on X from Chocó's regional government, ordering the immediate evacuation of beaches and low-tide lands.
    


            Visitor sites in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands have been temporarily closed following the massive earthquake in Russia's far east, according to the Galapagos National Park.
    


            The Ecuadorian government said on Wednesday that “there is a high probability of a tsunami being generated” along the country's coast.
    


            Waves are expected to reach up to 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) high, the Ecuadorian Oceanographic Institute of the Naval Forces (INOCAR) said in a post on X.
    


            Beaches, protected areas that involve maritime access, public areas and remote sites near the locations that tsunami waves might hit have also been temporarily closed, the Ecuadorian Navy said in a statement published by INOCAR.
    


            Classes will be held online along some parts of the Ecuadorian coast due to the tsunami risk, the country's ministry of education said.
    


            Tsunami alerts are still in effect for large parts of the United States' Pacific coastlines, but some areas are starting to get the all-clear.
    


            Large portions of Alaska's coastline are now free of any tsunami alerts. Alerts were also dropped in parts of Southern California.
    


            A tsunami warning is still in effect for about a 40-mile portion of Northern California's coast.
    


            Tsunami waves have begun to hit the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, authorities said, around 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) away from the epicenter of the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's far east.
    


            The highest waves are expected in the next few hours, but they are now expected to be between 1.1 and 2.5 meters (3 and 8 feet), down from previous forecasts of up to 4 meters (13 feet), the High Commission of the Republic of French Polynesia said on Facebook.
    


            Water withdrawals – the first sign of an incoming tsunami – were seen in the islands of Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa and Ua Huka, the commission said.
    


            Early tsunami warnings have allowed for timely evacuations and “appear to have been effective,” Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, told the Science Media Centre.
    


                    She cautioned, though, “unusual waves and potentially dangerous coastal activity is expected to continue for many hours even once the main tsunami waves pass. People are urged to take the risk to life seriously, remain vigilant, follow all evacuation orders and stay away from coastal areas.”
                





            Tsunami waves are “are not like normal surface waves, they are movements through the whole water column that travel over long distances. Even seemingly small waves carry tremendous force and can cause substantial damage and destruction,” Neumann added.
    


            Eurasia's highest volcano has erupted after the earthquake in the Kamchatka region of Russia's far east, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.
    


            At 4,750 meters (15,580 feet), Klyuchevskaya Sopka is one of the world's highest active volcanos.
    


            Tourists who had traveled to the area of the volcano have not canceled their tours and instead want to stay to watch the eruption, RIA reported, citing the Russian Union of Travel Industry (RUTI).
    


                    “A volcanic eruption, hot lava flowing down the western slope, a powerful glow over the crater and explosions are observed at night. Despite this, no cancellations of tours or complaints have been recorded among tourists visiting the foothills of volcanoes. On the contrary, many travelers are expressing a desire to personally observe this natural phenomenon,” RUTI said, according to RIA.
                





            In September 2022, eight people died on a climbing expedition on the volcano, according to local authorities.
    


            Conditions on the volcano are often treacherous and unpredictable, with strong winds, bitterly cold temperatures and snow at high altitudes.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            The Tantalus Lookout — a remnant of a long dormant volcano that now provides scenic views of Honolulu — became a gathering place for many people Tuesday looking for a quick getaway from the beach as the area was under a tsunami warning.
    


            A tourist couple who had been swimming with their kids at Waimanalo Beach rushed out when the tsunami warning reached their phones and made their way up to Tantalus.
    


            “This was the highest point we knew,” a woman told CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now. “We came in here (Monday), and we were like, instead of going to the hotel, let's go here.”
    


            Some local residents had the same idea.
    


            “I got on the road, and I noticed traffic was getting crazy,” said a man who lives in the suburb of Makakilo and said the traffic was too bad to return home. “I was thinking, no way, that (Interstate) H1 is crazy congested right now.”
    


            The tsunami warning was downgraded to an advisory hours after the 8.8-magnitude earth struck near Russia.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the operations on 'Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: A group of Senate Democratic leaders are accusing President Donald Trump of making "steep concessions to Beijing" by refusing to allow the Taiwanese president to come to the U.S. and allowing China to purchase Nvidia chips. 

The group claims the Trump administration has "ceded leverage" in trade talks without gaining any "real breakthrough" in negotiations, which took place in Sweden this week. 

"In the face of lackluster domestic economic forecasts and anemic interest from Beijing in achieving a real breakthrough in talks, Trump and his economic team have ceded leverage and negotiating power to Beijing in a desperate attempt to lure President Xi to a meeting with Trump," Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Patty Murray, D-Wash., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Andy Kim, D-N.J., Tim Kaine, D-Va., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Mark Warner, D-Va. said. 

"Even more dangerously, they risk putting American national security, technological advantage, and economic prosperity on the chopping block in order to do so."

Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te was planning a stopover in New York en route to a trip to Latin America, but the Trump administration reportedly denied permission for the stop after China raised objections. 

The U.S. does not maintain formal relations with Taiwan, but such stops have happened before. 

Last week, the Trump administration reversed a ban on selling Nvidia's lower-powered H20 chips to China to power its artificial intelligence, arguing they were only the U.S.' "fourth-best chip." 

That move was a concession in talks with China over rare earth minerals, in hopes that Beijing would stop cutting off exports of the materials needed for all sorts of American technologies.  

"President Trump is handing our primary geopolitical adversary the keys to the castle of 21st century global technological dominance. Doing so will enable Chinese leadership in artificial intelligence, infusing the Chinese military with the technological advantage it needs to continue hostile operations across the globe," the Democratic statement claimed. 

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly shot back in a statement to Fox News Digital: "Democrats enabled and applauded Joe Biden's weakness when they denied the Wuhan lab leak theory and allowed a spy balloon to surveil our country."

"President Trump is putting America First, and his strategy is working — China is sending rare earth magnets to the United States, and tariffs are rapidly leveling the playing field for American industries. This President is successful because he will look anyone in the eye to negotiate better deals for our country, and he will continue to advance American interests, such as bolstering our economy and stopping the flow of fentanyl into our communities."

The U.S. and China concluded their third round of high-level trade talks on Tuesday, ahead of an August 12 deadline after which the steep China tariffs Trump announced in April are expected to kick in. 

Trump told reporters Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent felt "very good" about the meeting, but it's unclear yet if the two sides reached any solid agreements — or plan to extend the August deadline. 

Trump, the Democrats claimed, "is emboldening Beijing to take aggressive actions and seek even more aggressive concessions in whatever trade negotiations may follow."

"Trump and this administration must reset their dangerously weak approach to China and make clear they will no longer accept symbolic wins in exchange for steep American concessions. An administration convinced it can renegotiate the world order needs to stop negotiating against itself." 

The White House could not immediately be reached for comment.

The federal grand juries that indicted Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges did not hear directly from any of the alleged victims in the case, Justice Department officials said in support of their request to unseal transcripts of the usually secret proceedings. Just two witnesses testified before the panel and both were law enforcement officials, the officials said.

In a court filing late Tuesday, the officials again urged the court to release the records, citing huge public interest, but they also sought to assure the judges that making them public wouldn't harm victims of the couple's crimes.

While the memo didn't detail what was in the grand jury testimony, it dampened expectations that the transcripts would contain new revelations, saying that “certain aspects and subject matters” contained in them became public during Maxwell's trial in 2021 and that other details have been made public through many years of civil lawsuits filed by victims.

The Justice Department described the grand jury witnesses in response to questions from two judges who would have to approve the release of the transcripts. Grand jury transcripts are rarely released by courts, unless they need to be disclosed in connection with a judicial proceeding. The papers filed Tuesday cite a 1997 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that said judges have wide discretion and public interest alone can justify releasing grand jury information.

The Epstein grand jury heard from just one witness, an FBI agent, when it met in June and July 2019, the government disclosed. The Maxwell grand jury heard from the same FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective when it met in June and July 2020 and March 2021, according to the submission.




It isn't unusual for law enforcement officials to be the only witnesses before grand juries, which have a limited role and don't need to decide whether a person is guilty of a crime.

The memorandum was signed by Jay Clayton, the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and included the names of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

The request to unseal the transcripts came after the Justice Department enraged parts of President Donald Trump's base of supporters when it announced in early July it wouldn't be making public any more investigative files related to Epstein, who was accused of paying underage girls for sexual acts.

The decision not to make additional materials public shocked some Trump supporters because members of his administration had hyped the expected release and stoked conspiracies around the well-connected financier.

Epstein took his own life in a federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on sex trafficking charges, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories because of his and Maxwell's links to famous people, such as royals, presidents and billionaires, including Trump.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her December 2021 conviction on sex trafficking charges that accused her of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last week, she sat for 1 1/2 days of interviews with Justice Department officials in Florida, answering questions “about 100 different people,” her attorney said. Maxwell was being interviewed because of Trump's directive to gather and release any credible evidence about others who may have committed crimes, the deputy attorney general said.

Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and claimed he had cut off their relationship long ago. But he faces ongoing questions about the Epstein case, overshadowing his administration's achievements. When reporters last week pressed the Republican president about possibly pardoning Maxwell, he deflected, emphasizing his administration's successes.

After the request to unseal grand jury records, two former prosecutors in Manhattan told The Associated Press the transcripts would be relatively short and contain only the testimony of law enforcement witnesses talking about evidence that tracks information in the indictments.

The court memorandum filed Tuesday said many of the victims whose accounts of being exploited by Epstein and Maxwell were discussed before the grand jury by the FBI agent and the NYPD detective later testified at Maxwell's public trial.

The government said no Epstein or Maxwell family members have come forward to express an interest in the request to unseal the grand jury transcripts, although Maxwell has indicated she will file a position with the court.

The memorandum says the request to unseal the transcripts is “consistent with increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.”

“There is undoubtedly a clearly expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes,” it says. “Beyond that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes.”

Under a 2008 nonprosecution agreement, Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. That allowed him to avert a possible life sentence, instead serving 13 months in a work release program. He was required to make payments to victims and register as a sex offender.

Epstein was later charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan for nearly identical allegations in 2019.

Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said Tuesday night that she doesn't like seeing the city cast in a negative light, especially in the national news.

CINCINNATI – The FBI and Department of Justice have confirmed that there is an open federal investigation into the vicious downtown beating last weekend that went viral online, shocking the nation.

"The FBI has been and will continue closely coordinating with the Cincinnati Police Department on this matter," the federal law enforcement group told Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning. 

A DOJ official also confirmed Wednesday morning that there is an open federal investigation into the matter.

THIRD SUSPECT IN BRUTAL CINCINNATI BEATDOWN ARRESTED, CHARGED WITH ASSAULT

On Sunday night, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon intimated about potential federal hate crime charges. 

"Our federal hate crimes laws apply to ALL Americans. We [at the DOJ Civil Rights Division] will monitor closely how local authorities handle this attack," she said on X regarding the beatings. "Nobody in our great nation should be the victim of such a crime, and where race is a motivation, federal law may apply."

The chaotic scene caught the attention of Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who slammed the assailants as "derelicts" and took to X to call for a federal investigation. 

"The do-nothing, extreme liberal Mayor [Aftab Pureval] won't lift a finger to protect his streets and restore order, so it's time to bring in professionals who will," Moreno wrote.

Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked Moreno for connecting the DOJ with one of the victims, and for "caring so much." 

The beatings occurred on the corner of Fourth and Elm Street in Cincinnati's downtown business district in the early morning hours on Saturday. Video that has been shared widely online shows a group of people savagely assaulting two others during a confrontation, with a woman being knocked out cold in the street.

TWO ARRESTED IN BRUTAL CINCINNATI MOB ATTACK; ONE WAS FREED ON BAIL DESPITE SERIOUS CHARGES

As of Wednesday morning, three people had been arrested and taken into custody, while two others had been charged but not yet arrested. 

Montianez Merriweather, 34, and Dekyra Vernon, 24, were arrested Tuesday night. Both face felonious assault, aggravated riot and assault charges. Merriweather is being held on a $500,000 bond, while Vernon is being held on a $200,000 bond.

A third suspect, Jermaine Matthews, was taken into custody overnight and charged with aggravated riot and assault. He is being held on $100,000 bond. 

Meriweather was out on bond after being charged with receiving stolen property, weapons under disability, improper transportation of a firearm and other charges earlier this month. 

Cincinnati Chief of Police Teresa Theetge denounced the attack at a Tuesday night public safety meeting.

"Let me be clear, crystal clear, that was a violent, violent encounter," she said. "It makes me sick to watch it over and over again on national news especially. I do not like Cincinnati being portrayed in a negative light on the national news. We can do better. We can so much better."

Theetge declined to comment further after the meeting, and the Cincinnati Police Department did not return a Wednesday morning comment request.

Three tsunami waves hit Russia's coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk on Wednesday, in the main settlement on the Kuril Islands in the Pacific, according to the local mayor Aleksandr Ovsyannikov.

A magnitude-8.7 earthquake in Russia's Far East early Wednesday prompted tsunami warnings in parts of Japan, Alaska and Hawaii. The Japanese government called for people living along the Pacific coast to evacuate to higher grounds.

Hawaii and parts of Japan downgraded tsunami warnings, with Hawaii lifting evacuation orders across the state while leaving a tsunami advisory in place.

A tsunami hit coastal areas of Russia's Kuril Islands and Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido after a powerful, 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia early Wednesday. Warnings are also in place for Alaska, Hawaii and other coasts south toward New Zealand.

TOKYO (AP) — One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck off Russia's sparsely populated Far East early Wednesday, sending tsunami waves into Japan, Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. Several people were injured, but none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far.

Authorities warned the risk from the 8.8 magnitude quake could last for hours, and millions of people potentially in the path of the waves were initially told to move away from the shore or seek high ground.

The worst appeared to have passed for many areas, including the U.S., Japan and Russia. But along South America's Pacific Coast, new warnings were forcing evacuations in Chile and Colombia. 

In the immediate aftermath of the quake off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula, residents fled inland as ports flooded, and several were injured while rushing to leave buildings. 

AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports a powerful earthquake has struck Russia's Far East, producing a tsunami in the northern Pacific.

In Japan, people flocked to evacuation centers, hilltop parks and rooftops in towns on the Pacific coast with fresh memories of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster. 

Cars jammed streets and highways in Honolulu, with standstill traffic even in areas away from the sea.

While tsunami advisories remain in place along much of the U.S. West Coast, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the worst was over.




“We were fully deployed and ready to respond if necessary but grateful that we didn't have to deal with the situation that this could have been,” she told reporters in Chile, where she is meeting officials. 

Unusually strong currents and unpredictable surges were expected in places as far away as New Zealand, and the National Weather Service warned the San Francisco Bay Area could see “some seriously dangerous currents along beaches and harbors.”

The earthquake appeared to be the strongest recorded since the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami and set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency said initial reports showed Japan's nuclear plants were not affected Wednesday.

Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world. Wednesday's occurred along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a series of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world's earthquakes take place.

The quake struck at 11:24 a.m. in Kamchatka with a magnitude of 8.8 and a depth of about 21 kilometers (13 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was centered offshore, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kamchatka's regional capital. 

Multiple aftershocks as strong as 6.9 magnitude followed.

Russia's Oceanology Institute said tsunami waves might have been as high as 10 to 15 meters (30 to 50 feet) in some sections of the Kamchatka coast — but the highest were less than 6 meters (20 feet) near the populated areas of the peninsula and the nearby Kuril Islands.

Meanwhile, lava began to flow Wednesday from Kamchatka's Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano, the largest active one in the Northern Hemisphere. Observers also heard explosions, the Russian Academy of Sciences' geophysical service said.

Chile, a place highly vulnerable to earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis, raised its warning early Wednesday to the highest level for most of its lengthy Pacific coast and said it was evacuating hundreds of people.

“Remember that the first wave is usually not the strongest,” Chilean President Gabriel Boric warned on social media. “Let's act calmly and follow official instructions.”

Colombian officials ordered the complete closure and evacuation of beaches and low-tide areas while maritime traffic was being restricted. 

Education officials in Ecuador canceled classes at schools in the Galapagos Islands as well communities along the coast.

In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kamchatka's regional capital, the quake damaged a local kindergarten, which was not in operation at the time because it was being renovated.

Oleg Melnikov, head of the regional health department, said several people hurt themselves while rushing to leave buildings and a hospital patient was injured while jumping out of a window. Melnikov said all injured people were stable.




A video released by a Russian media outlet showed a team of doctors at a cancer clinic on Kamchatka holding a patient and clutching medical equipment as the quake rocked an operating room, before continuing with surgery after the shaking stopped. 

Authorities introduced a state of emergency on the sparsely populated nearby Kurils after the tsunami. They earlier reported that several waves flooded the fishing port of Severo-Kurilsk, the main city on the islands, and cut power supplies to the area. The port's mayor said no major damage was recorded.

Authorities on Kamchatka peninsula and in the Kurils canceled their tsunami warnings but said some risk of waves remains.

Authorities in Hawaii downgraded the state to a tsunami advisory early Wednesday, and evacuation orders on the Big Island and Oahu, the most populated island, were lifted.

An advisory means there is the potential for strong currents and dangerous waves, as well as flooding on beaches or in harbors.

“As you return home, still stay off the beach and stay out of the water,” said James Barros, administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.

In northern California, tsunami activity continued to build Wednesday morning with maximum confirmed heights along the coast of 3.6 feet (1.1 meters) in Crescent City.

The Oregon Department of Emergency Management said small tsunami waves were expected.

“This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,” the department said.

A tsunami of less than 1 foot (30 centimeters) was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and waves of up to 1.4 feet (under 30 centimeters) above tide levels were observed in Alaska's Aleutian Islands.

A tsunami of 2 feet (60 centimeters) was recorded in Hamanaka town in Hokkaido and Kuji port in Iwate, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Several areas reported smaller waves, and at least one person was injured.

In Iwaki city in Fukushima, which was the epicenter of the 2011 tsunami and quake, dozens of residents gathered at a hilltop park after a community siren sounded and breakwater gates were closed. 

Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, severely damaged in 2011, took shelter on higher ground while remotely monitoring operations, the operator said. 

By late Wednesday, Japan had downgraded its tsunami alert but left an advisory in place along the Pacific coast.

Authorities in the Philippines, Mexico and New Zealand warned residents to watch for waves and strong currents. People were also urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has filed a lawsuit against a lobster festival in Maine, calling the steaming of lobsters "egregiously cruel."

PETA filed the lawsuit on July 24 against the Maine Lobster Festival and the City of Rockland, asking the court to stop the steaming of lobsters. The group said the judge should declare the event a "public nuisance."

"Today, PETA filed a lawsuit against the Maine Lobster Festival and the City of Rockland in Knox County Superior Court over the city-endorsed event's egregiously cruel method of steaming thousands of lobsters alive in what PETA contends is a violation of Maine law prohibiting the torture and torment of animals," the group wrote.

PETA filed the lawsuit with the Knox County Superior Court.

It asked the court to "issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the steaming of live lobsters on public lands."

According to the lawsuit, the festival prevents individuals from enjoying Harbor Park and other nearby areas.

In the lawsuit, PETA argued that people should be able to enjoy the area "without being forced to witness extreme animal suffering as approximately 16,000 live lobsters are illegally tormented and killed at the festival each year."

PETA Foundation Director of Litigation Asher Smith said the event amounts to "municipally supported cruelty."

"PETA is pushing to end these horrific displays and restore compassionate Rockland residents' ability to enjoy Harbor Park year-round," Smith said.

In a statement shared with the Penobscot Bay Pilot, the Maine Lobster Festival and Rockland Festival Corporation denied the allegations.

"We are aware of the lawsuit filed by PETA and take any public concern seriously. However, the methods we use to prepare lobster at the festival follow widely accepted and legal culinary practices that have been in place in homes, restaurants, and seafood festivals across the globe for generations," the groups wrote. "While we appreciate PETA's concerns, there is no conclusive scientific consensus that lobsters feel pain in a way comparable to mammals. They do not have a brain capable of processing pain."

            The first of the National Transportation Safety Board's three days of investigative hearings is underway to help determine what caused the deadly midair collision on January 29 between an Army helicopter on a training mission and American Airlines flight 5342 landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
    


Transcripts of the cockpit voice recorders and air traffic control audio released in the docket for Wednesday's hearing reveal what was said inside the aircraft in the moments before the crash.
    


            As the passenger jet approached the airport, inside the helicopter the instructor was asking the pilot to descend.
    


            “You're at three hundred feet, come down for me,” the transcript from the cockpit voice recorder, also known as a black box, says.
    


            Pilots on the regional jet performed their checks to land as the tower told the helicopter, call sign PAT 25, to look out for their CRJ-700 regional jet approaching at 1,200 feet.
    


            “PAT 25 has the traffic in sight. Request visual separation,” the helicopter responds, asking for permission to avoid it visually.
    


            In the helicopter the instructor says, “He's got'em stacked up tonight,” according to the black box transcript.
    


            The pilot responds, “Yeah kinda, busy.”
    


            At 8:47 p.m., the controller asks the helicopter, “PAT 25, you have the CRJ in sight?” as the beeping of an alert the planes are getting too close together is heard in the background.
    


            “PAT two five has uh – aircraft in sight. Request visual separation,” the helicopter responds.
    


            Another instruction – to stay behind the passenger plane – wasn't heard in the helicopter as a momentary press of the radio microphone in the Black Hawk cut it off.
    


            Inside the helicopter, the instructor tells the pilot to change course.
    


            “Alright kinda come left for me ma'am, I think that's why he's asking… We're kinda… out towards the middle.”
    


            “Oh-kay,” the helicopter pilot responds. “Fine.”
    


            Not even a second later the recordings capture the sound of the collision and impact as the aircraft falls into the icy river below.
    


            Aircraft flown by PSA Airlines received collision avoidance alerts caused by helicopters five times in the five months prior to the crash, including one caused by two Black Hawk helicopters the day before the fatal collision, according to documents released in the NTSB docket.
    


            The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, sounds an alarm in the cockpit if planes could be getting too close to each other.
    


            On January 28, a PSA Airlines flight from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington was leveling off at 3,000 feet when it received a warning due to two Black Hawks one to two miles away and 600 feet below it, the document shows.
    


            PSA flights also received TCAS warnings caused by helicopters while landing at Reagan National Airport in September, October, and November.
    


            The NTSB also presented for the first time major “discrepancies” in the altitude readouts on board the US Army Black Hawk helicopter that led to the crew believing they were flying lower over the Potomac River than they actually were.
    


            Investigators said Wednesday that, following the crash, they tested three of the same models of Black Hawk helicopters from the same Army unit involved in the collision flying over the river.
    


            “Notably, the barometric altimeters continued to be 80 to 130 feet lower than the helicopter's determined altitude above sea level when flying at speed over the tidal portion of the Potomac River,” NTSB investigator Marie Moler presented to the hearing.
    


            Barometric altimeters use pressure to gauge altitude and can be impacted by a variety of atmospheric and other factors.
    


            In its preliminary report, the NTSB said the Black Hawk was consistently higher than maximum published altitudes along the Potomac River, including when it collided with the passenger jet.
    


            The heavily technical findings were some of the the most significant in Wednesday's 10-hour-long hearing.
    


            The helicopter route at the time of the collision allowed the Black Hawk to fly as close as 75 feet below planes descending to land on runway 33 at Reagan National Airport, according to the NTSB. With allowable errors in the helicopter's altimeters and other equipment as well as Army rules expecting aviators to hold their altitude within 100 feet, it could end up being much closer.
    


            “How much tolerance should we have for aviation safety whenever civilian lives are at risk?” asked Todd Inman, NTSB board member. “How much is that tolerance,” he continued. “I think it should be zero.”
    


            The Army responded that machines cannot be exact, but when dealing with such close altitudes the variables are concerning.
    


            “We have to understand there are physical limitations to that, which is offhand plus or minus 100 feet,” Scott Rosengren, speaking on behalf of the Army responded. “Knowing that there's plus or minus 100 feet, any qualified Army pilot or any civil pilot will (think) the fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern.”
    


            The helicopter route has since been closed, but Homendy said she doesn't believe “anyone did the math until the NTSB did the math” to determine how close planes and helicopters were getting until after the crash.
    


            “My concern is, where else in the National Airspace does that exist where there are charted helicopter routes?” she said.
    


            Homendy also called on the Army to test the altimeters in all Black Hawks, not just a similar model to those involved in this crash.
    


            The Army, PSA Airlines, a regional subsidiary of American Airlines which operated the plane, the Federal Aviation Administration and other parties are represented.
    


            “This is not an adversarial hearing,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in her opening remarks. “This does not mean difficult questions won't be asked. They will be, and they should be. This is an investigation. We are here to improve safety.”
    


            At the start of the hearing, an 11-minute animation was shown detailing the minutes leading up to the collision and a video of the accident itself.  The board paused briefly to allow any of the family members of the victims of the crash to leave the room or look away before it was played.
    


            The air traffic controller working in the control tower that night was responsible for two different positions on two different radio channels, the timeline animation reveled.
    


            The captain of the regional jet had completed 106 flights into the airport and the first officer had completed 51, records reviewed by NTSB showed.
    


            However, investigators said interviews with PSA Airline's pilots showed they generally didn't know much about the helicopter routes in the area. Three Reagan National Airport-based captains and one first officer were asked about their knowledge of published helicopter routes and only one PSA captain – who was a former military helicopter pilot in the region – had knowledge of the routes prior to the accident.
    


            Sixty-seven people died in the accident over the Potomac River, including 60 passengers and four crew on the plane and three soldiers on the helicopter.
    


            The NTSB will meet again Thursday and Friday to discuss the facts learned in the investigation.  A determination of what caused the crash will come in January.

The communities of sea creatures push the boundaries of what we know about life.

The Titanic lies about 12,500 feet under the ocean. The pressure down there is so immense that even submersibles supposedly built for those conditions can, as we know, tragically fail.

Now imagine taking a sub nearly three times deeper.

That's what an international team of scientists did last summer. Led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the researchers took a manned submersible to the bottom of deep-sea trenches in an area in the northwest Pacific Ocean, roughly between Japan and Alaska, reaching a depth of more than 31,000 feet.

The researchers weren't looking for a shipwreck. They were interested in what else might be lurking on the seafloor, which is so deep that no light can reach it.

It was there that they found something remarkable: entire communities of animals, rooted in organisms that are able to derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions. Through a process called chemosynthesis, deep-sea microbes are able to turn compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide into organic compounds, including sugars, forming the base of the food chain. The discovery was published in the journal Nature.

This was the deepest community of chemosynthetic life ever discovered, according to Mengran Du, a study author and researcher at the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Using a deep-sea vessel called Fendouzhe, the researchers encountered abundant wildlife communities, including fields of marine tube worms peppered with white marine snails. The worms have a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live in their bodies. Those bacteria provide them with a source of nutrients in exchange for, among other things, a stable place to live.

Among the tube worms the scientists encountered white, centipede-like critters — they're also a kind of worm, in the genus macellicephaloides — as well as sea cucumbers.

The researchers also found a variety of different clams on the seafloor, often alongside anemones. Similar to the tube worms, the clams depend on bacteria within their shells to turn chemical compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide that are present in the deep sea into food.

Unlike other deep-sea ecosystems — which feed on dead animals and other organic bits that fall from shallower waters — these trench communities are likely sustained in part by methane produced by microbes buried under the seafloor, the authors said. That suggests that wildlife communities may be more common in these extremely deep trenches than scientists once thought.

“The presence of these chemosynthetic ecosystems challenge long-standing assumptions about life's potential at extreme depths,” Du told Vox in an email.

Players and coaches around the NFL learned Tuesday that the target was the NFL itself, Mayor Eric Adams said, with the shooter picking the wrong elevator bank and getting off on a different floor. A league employee was among those wounded, according to Commissioner Roger Goodell, and all the victims were in the thoughts of members of the football community across the country with training camps in full swing.

The shooter was Shane Tamura; authorities say he was intending to target the NFL offices in Manhattan but entered the wrong elevator in the Midtown skyscraper. Among the victims was Didarul Islam, 36, had served as a police officer in New York City for 3 1/2 years. He was an immigrant from Bangladesh.

NEW YORK (AP) — Graham Gano stayed late at the New York Giants' practice facility Monday watching news coverage of a gunman killing four people at a Manhattan office building that includes the NFL headquarters.

“I was praying for just whoever was involved immediately,” said Gano, a veteran kicker and the Giants' union representative. “It's sad to see no matter who it is, league office or not.”

Gano, fellow players, coaches and others learned Tuesday that the target was the NFL itself, Mayor Eric Adams said, with the shooter picking the wrong elevator bank and getting off on a different floor. A league employee was among those wounded, according to Commissioner Roger Goodell, and all the victims were in the thoughts of members of the football community across the country with training camps in full swing.

“Our hearts go out to the people in New York, especially the families of the people that passed,” three-time Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “The people at the league office that had to go through all that. It's a bad deal. We've got to try to keep peace somewhere here. There's too much of this.”

Goodell said in a memo to staff that a league employee was seriously injured in the attack and was hospitalized in stable condition.

“We are deeply grateful to the law enforcement officers who responded to this threat quickly and decisively and to Officer Islam, who gave his life to protect others,” said Goodell, referring to Didarul Islam, an off-duty police officer working a corporate security detail who was killed in the attack.




Cleveland Browns owner Dee Haslem, flanked by her husband, Jimmy, said in remarks at camp, “We honor the policeman that also died in the line of duty, and our prayers are with the ones that are injured.”

In another memo sent Tuesday evening, Goodell said the league employee was surrounded by family members and “We are all continuing to hope for and support his full recovery.” He instructed those working in the New York office to work remotely through at least Aug. 8 and said there would be a virtual town hall Wednesday.

“This has been a challenging time for our entire team,” Goodell said. “Thank you to all of you for the compassion, care, and support you are showing to one another right now. It means so much to see how our team is pulling together. In the midst of this difficult time, we hold on to hope and optimism for healing and brighter days ahead.”

Chicago Bears coach Ben Johnson said the shooting “keeps things in perspective as we enter training camp and the guys are going hard that there's a little bit more to life than just football.”

Investigators believe Shane Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building's lobby, then another in a 33rd-floor office on Monday, before he killed himself, authorities said.

“It's always tough to hear things like that and really to try to stay focused,” New York Jets coach Aaron Glenn said. “You have to because you have a job to do, but you think about the families that go through that and it's tough.”

Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested that he had a grievance against the NFL over a claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can be diagnosed only by examining the brain after a person dies.

Tamura played high school football in California a decade ago but never in the NFL.

Giants coach Brian Daboll opened his pre-practice news conference in East Rutherford, New Jersey, by referencing the shooting and saying he had not had any conversations with players or staff about the situation or if they were concerned for their safety. Gano expressed no worry.

“Our security staff here is fantastic,” Gano said. “I think we've got one of the best. ... We're fully confident in our security team here.”

Three-time Tennessee Titans Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons saw reports of the shooting on Tuesday morning. He didn't have a chance to read up on the attack before practice at 8 a.m., but Simmons said that's why mental health is one of the topics brought up in football circles these days.

“Mental health is a big thing in this world, and it's our job, especially in this building,” Simmons said. “One thing we talked about as the leaders you never know when a guy's last day may be in this building or he could be on this team forever. So, I just want to treat everybody the same.”

            President Donald Trump is ratcheting up the pressure on India, calling into question the prospects of a deal with a key US trading partner just days before his tariff deadline.
    


            Trump, in a pair of social media posts Wednesday, sharply attacked India's trade barriers and directly targeted India's sustained reliance on Russian oil purchases and military equipment. He doubled down on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on all Indian imports and threatened an additional “penalty” in response to India's energy purchases.
    


            “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia's largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!”
    


            Trump's tariff escalation comes on the heels of a series of deals with major US trading partners that have set a rough baseline of between 15% and 20% and included a series of pledges to expand market access for US products and foreign investment commitments.
    


            For India, it marks a major setback in a monthslong effort to secure a deal that officials believed on several occasions was nearing the finish line.
    


            Top trade officials have been transiting back and forth between the Washington and New Delhi for months in pursuit of a final agreement. But the recent trade agreements with Japan and the European Union have emboldened Trump in the final days before the August 1 deadline for the administration's paused “reciprocal” tariffs to snap back into place, officials say.
    


            Trump's ability to secure commitments on market access for US producers has become a particularly salient fixation as Trump has reviewed draft offers in recent days, the officials said. That has created a significant obstacle to the prospects of an agreement with India, one official told CNN.
    


            “They're willing to go part of the way,” the official said. “But the president isn't in a ‘part of the way' mood - he wants barriers removed completely or as close to completely as possible.”
    


            Trump's approach is tied in part to a strategy that has become increasingly apparent to foreign trade officials involved in late-stage talks: Trump has no qualms about letting those higher tariffs go into place - a message he's delivered repeatedly in public over the last several weeks.
    


            But it's also created an environment in which Trump has embraced a clear sense of leverage over trading partners - even close allies - who are desperate to maintain access to the world's largest consumer market.
    


            “I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people,” Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said at the White House on Wednesday.
    


            The tariffs on India, Hassett said, might cause them to “reconsider their practices.”
    


            “Over time, I would guess that Indian firms will be onshoring production in the US, and Indians might even open their markets more to us so that we reconsider our future trades,” Hassett added.
    


            At the same time, Trump has escalated in parallel his threat to impose secondary sanctions on Russian energy exports in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate attacks on Ukraine.
    


            That dynamic, which has long been weighed across successive administrations, would directly impact India and China most as nations who purchase the bulk of Russian energy products.
    


            India's oil imports from Russia have ticked up this year as Russia continued to be the top supplier to the world's most populous nation. Russia for roughly 35% of India's overall supplies, followed by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for more information on what the penalty will be and if India will be receiving an official letter from the United States marking the tariff, as other nations have received.
    


            On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that India would pay 25% tariffs if they don't reach a deal by August 1.
    


            When imposing a 50-day deadline on Russia to reach a ceasefire earlier this month, Trump announced that countries that purchase Russian oil would face secondary sanctions. That ceasefire deadline has since moved to August 8.
    


            Trump officials have been privately making clear to counterparts that Trump's threat to significantly escalate an already sweeping US sanctions regime on Russia should be taken seriously and is not a negotiating ploy, the officials said.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday he shared that message directly with his Chinese counterparts during trade talks in Stockholm.
    


            “I think anyone who buys sanctioned Russian oil should be ready for this,” Bessent told reporters at a news conference at the conclusion of the talks.
    


            According to an analysis of Russian fossil fuel exports and sanctions conducted by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in June, India continued to be the second-largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels behind China.

Jennie Taer joins Jimmy Failla on Fox Across America to discuss the details that are emerging about the horrific shooting which took place at an office building in New York City on Monday evening. 

New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani faced renewed scrutiny Tuesday for his anti-police rhetoric after his social media posts mourning a slain NYPD officer.

As New York City reels from a deadly mass shooting in midtown Manhattan that killed four, including an NYPD officer, Mamdani attempted to voice solidarity.

Mamdani, who was just married at a guarded compound in Uganda, tweeted Monday, "I'm heartbroken to learn of the horrific shooting in Midtown, and I am holding the victims, their families, and the NYPD officer in critical condition in my thoughts. Grateful for all of our first responders on the ground."

The New York politician also posted Tuesday that the officer, Didarul Islam, was a "Bangladeshi immigrant," highlighting an anecdote about how, "When he joined the police department, his mother asked him why he would pursue such a dangerous job. He told her it was to leave behind a legacy that his family could be proud of. He has done that, and more. I pray for him, his family, and honor the legacy of service and sacrifice he leaves behind."

However, Mamdani's critics argued these tributes to an officer slain in the line of duty seemed like a cynical shift from his past statements. 

New York City councilwoman Inna Vernikov retorted, "Come on, @ZohranKMamdani. Spare us the BS," along with an image of a Mamdani tweet from June 8, 2020, saying, "No, we want to defund the police." 

"This you?" radio personality Dana Loesch asked as she retweeted his same past call to defund the police.

Another past tweet that particularly caught attention was from a few days after the 2020 election when a user claimed to have seen a policeman crying in his car and Mamdani responded, "Nature is healing."

Fox News' Guy Benson shared screenshots of that post as well as one from June 28, 2020, where Mamdani said, "We don't need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD. But your deal with @NYCMayor uses budget tricks to keep as many cops as possible on the beat. NO to fake cuts - defund the police."

Benson wrote in response, "There's a crisis in the city Zohran Mamdani wants to run. A member of its police force, which he deeply despises and wants to defund, has been murdered. He is overseas, reportedly partying at the lavish and heavily-guarded compound his family owns. And yes, he *loathes* NYPD."

"It's also interesting that he's ripped NYPD as ‘anti-queer,' while holding (one of) his wedding celebration(s) in a country where gays are punished for existing by some combination of lengthy imprisonment & execution. He's also very concerned about ‘human rights' in the Jewish state, of course," he added.

Political commentator David J. Freeman, better known as "Gunther Eagleman," resurfaced the tweet and replied to a Mamdani post, "Imagine how many brothers in Blue were mourning the loss of a brother today and see this post. You are f-----g pathetic."

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a closer look at the controversy over thimerosal, plus companies pledging to remove artificial dyes from foods and more on 'America Reports.'

Dental floss could eventually do much more than improve oral hygiene.

A new study led by Texas Tech University and the University of North Carolina suggests that the thin filament could eventually double as a vaccine mechanism.

In animal models, the researchers showed that dental floss can effectively release vaccines through the tissue between the teeth and gums, according to a press release.

In the study, the flossing technique triggered the production of antibodies in "mucosal surfaces," such as the lining of the nose and lungs, the release stated.

The findings were published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering.

"Mucosal surfaces are important, because they are a source of entry for pathogens, such as influenza and COVID," said co-author Harvinder Singh Gill, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at North Carolina State University, in the release. 

With the traditional method of injecting vaccines, the antibodies are primarily produced in the bloodstream, he noted.

"But we know that when a vaccine is given via the mucosal surface, antibodies are stimulated not only in the bloodstream, but also on mucosal surfaces," said Gill. 

"This improves the body's ability to prevent infection, because there is an additional line of antibody defense before a pathogen enters the body."

The vaccine enters through the "junctional epithelium," which is a thin layer of tissue in the deep pocket between the tooth and the gum.

This tissue doesn't have the same barrier as other tissue linings, which means it can release immune cells into the body.

In the study, the researchers added a peptide flu vaccine to unwaxed dental floss before flossing the teeth of lab mice, according to the release.

Next, they compared the effectiveness of the floss-delivered vaccine to techniques that delivered it nasally or orally.

"It would be easy to administer, and it addresses concerns many people have about being vaccinated with needles."

"We found that applying vaccine via the junctional epithelium produces a far superior antibody response on mucosal surfaces than the current gold standard for vaccinating via the oral cavity, which involves placing vaccine under the tongue," said first author Rohan Ingrole, a Ph.D. student at Texas Tech University. 

"The flossing technique also provides comparable protection against the flu virus as compared to the vaccine being given via the nasal epithelium."

With the traditional method of injecting vaccines, the antibodies are primarily produced in the bloodstream, the researchers noted. (iStock)

In addition to flu, the test was repeated for three other vaccine types: proteins, inactivated viruses and mRNA. 

For all types, the flossing technique produced "robust antibody responses in the bloodstream and across mucosal surfaces," the release stated.

Next, the research team aims to test the effectiveness of vaccine delivery to the epithelial junction in humans through the use of floss picks, which are easier to hold.

"It would be easy to administer, and it addresses concerns many people have about being vaccinated with needles," Gill said. "And we think this technique should be comparable in price to other vaccine delivery techniques."

For all four types of vaccines tested, the flossing technique produced "robust antibody responses in the bloodstream and across mucosal surfaces," the researchers stated. (iStock)

Hua Wang, assistant professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois' Grainger College of Engineering, was not involved in the study but shared his reaction to the findings.

"This study presents a promising floss-based vaccination method that can avoid needle injection or any potentially painful procedure," he told Fox News Digital.

"The authors demonstrated that vaccine components in the floss coating can penetrate the junctional epithelium in gingival sulcus and reach the underlying tissues, leading to systemic antibody responses."

The floss-based vaccination method could help to improve patient compliance if it goes through the full evaluation process, he noted.

There are some limitations and drawbacks associated with floss-based vaccines, the researchers acknowledged.

Babies and toddlers who don't have teeth yet wouldn't be candidates for the technique, for example.

"In addition, we would need to know more about how or whether this approach would work for people who have gum disease or other oral infections," Gill added.

Wang agreed that many questions remain to be answered about this experimental vaccination method. 

"In addition to the unclear impact of gingival tissue infection on vaccination, the local and systemic side effects of this vaccination method remain to be understood," he told Fox News Digital. 

"This study presents a promising floss-based vaccination method that can avoid needle injection or any potentially painful procedure," an expert said. (iStock)

"For example, vaccination at the gingival tissue may initiate local inflammation that eventually induces undesirable side effects."

It's also not yet clear what exact path the vaccine components follow when traveling from the tooth site to the tissues or how the immune responses are generated, Wang noted.

"Lastly, from the translation perspective, the efficacy of floss-based vaccines would need to be comparable to conventional needle-based vaccines."

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and by funds from the Whitacre Endowed Chair in Science and Engineering at Texas Tech University.

More than 460 days away, next year's midterm elections are approaching, but Democrats are looking hopefully toward the past.

The president's party has lost House seats in all but two midterm elections since 1938. The two exceptions were 1998, when Bill Clinton's party gained five seats amid an unpopular Republican attempt to impeach him, and 2002, when George W. Bush's party picked up eight seats in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Republicans control the White House, Senate, and the House of Representatives. Their congressional majorities are small, especially in the House, where the GOP currently holds 219 seats. 

A blue wave could easily wash these majorities away. In the 2018 midterm elections during President Donald Trump's first term, Democrats gained 40 House seats and a majority that would go on to impeach him. But it wouldn't take anywhere near that big a loss to cost Republicans their House majority in 2026.

In 2022, Republicans expected a red wave. They ended up with a smaller net gain in House seats than they managed in 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden was elected president. But it was still more than enough for Republicans to take control of the House, however narrowly.

But the 2022 midterm elections are also a cautionary tale for Democrats. Both parties may have picked so much of the low-hanging fruit in past wave elections that the pickup opportunities are now extremely limited. 

“I don't foresee anytime soon here where you have a 30- or 35-seat majority,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told the Washington Examiner last year. “Because of gerrymandering and redistricting, the number of actual swing seats in the country has dwindled to a small number. It is anticipated for the days ahead that whomever is in the majority, it will be a small majority.”

For years, Democrats held seats in dozens of conservative congressional districts. Republicans seized control of these districts in the 1994 Republican wave under Clinton and then in the 2010 Tea Party election under Barack Obama. Democrats similarly vacuumed up the previously Republican-held districts with the most liberal voters in them in 2006 and 2008 under Bush, finishing the job in 2018 under Trump.

Republicans now hold just three seats in congressional districts won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. In 2018, Republicans held 25 seats in districts Hillary Clinton had carried two years earlier and would go on to lose 22 of them.

Before the resignation of former Tennessee Republican Rep. Mark Green, 134 out of 220 seats held by Republicans were in districts Trump won by at least 20 points. Another 45 represent districts Trump carried by between 12.6 and 19.9 points. There are 19 Republican districts that went from Trump by between 7.6 and 12.5 points, and another 19 where Trump won with a margin of victory of 7.5 points or less.

In 2018, Democrats didn't win a single seat in a district Trump won by 20 or more points. Democrats scored six upsets in districts Trump won by between 7.6 and 19.9 points. However, most of their gains came in Clinton districts or districts that Trump won by 7.5 points or less.

While the map is more challenging for Democrats than it was in Trump's first term, the Republican majority is small enough that replicating the 2018 results would be good enough to change partisan control of the chamber. So Republicans will need to do two things to defy history: squeeze more pickup opportunities out of redistricting, especially in states such as Texas and Ohio, while doing a much better job of defending the more marginal Trump districts than they did in his first midterm election.

The two biggest advantages Republicans have going into the midterm elections are that they aren't defending many seats in districts that voted against Trump and that Democrats have few options for countering their redistricting push. The Republican majority is smaller, but much better structured for withstanding a moderately hostile political climate.

Structure matters. Republicans defied the blue wave in 2018 Senate races because they had pickup opportunities in red states. Democrats gained seats in a bad national climate in 2022 because they overperformed in the battleground states, thanks in part to Republicans recruiting lower-quality candidates in those races.

The big advantage Democrats still have, besides the historic trend, is their edge among higher-propensity voters. The Resistance will show up at the polls to register their protests against Trump, even if he isn't on the ballot himself. Meanwhile, there are Trump supporters who don't show up when he isn't on the ballot or consistently vote for down-ballot Republican candidates.

FOR NOW, THE BIG FIGHT IS DEMOCRATIC ANGER VS. TRUMP ACCOMPLISHMENT

If things such as Trump's rift with Elon Musk, the Jeffrey Epstein files, or his seemingly hawkish turn in foreign policy matter at all in the midterm elections, it will likely be among the low-propensity voters who cast ballots for the GOP in 2024. (Musk was also personally part of the get-out-the-vote operation that turned out these voters.)

Nevertheless, with few true swing districts left, we could wave goodbye to red or blue waves for the foreseeable future.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the FBI to conduct an immediate counter intelligence threat assessment on the Jeffrey Epstein files, claiming potential national security risks.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has called on the FBI to conduct a counterintelligence threat assessment on the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday that the FBI assessment should accomplish three things: determine if foreign intelligence agencies could gain access to the information "the president does not want to release in the Epstein files, through methods that include cyber intrusion;" identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by foreign intelligence agencies with access to non-public information in the Epstein files, "including being able to gain leverage over Donald Trump, his family, or other senior government officials;" and result in the FBI publicly showing that the bureau is "developing mitigation strategies to counter these threats and safeguard our national security." 

At his weekly Democratic leadership press conference afterward, Schumer condemned what he categorized as the Epstein "cover-up," further taking aim at President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

"Trump promised he'd release the Epstein files while he was on the campaign trail, yet he has yet to do it," Schumer told reporters. "Speaker Johnson quite literally preferred to shut down Congress, sending everyone home on an Epstein recess to avoid the topic. Americans are right to be angry over the lack of transparency, but there are also some very real questions about risks to national security."

"Given Trump's total about-face on releasing files and given what we know from the FBI whistleblowers, it's natural to ask, what happens if our adversaries use cyberattacks and other means to access files and materials into Epstein that are damaging or worse for President Trump and or those around him?" Schumer continued. "What happens if the Epstein files end up in the hands of Russia or North Korea, or Chinese governments? Unless the Epstein files are fully released to the public, could our adversaries use that, Epstein, to use that information to blackmail someone like the president? 

Last Thursday, Schumer noted, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services were among several government agencies hacked as part of a breach to Microsoft SharePoint system. 

"This was confirmed that it was Chinese actors. So we don't need this happening again," Schumer said. "We have to ensure that it can't happen. National security is not and should never be a partisan issue. We need to do everything we can to make sure we protecting the U.S. and American families. This report is vital in doing that. Beyond that, there is one more thing Donald Trump could do to quell people's anger, confusion, frustration, and/or deep fears. That is, release the files." 

Last week, Johnson ended the House legislative session a day early, averting a potential vote on a resolution by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., that would have compelled the Justice Department and the FBI to release the Epstein files. Johnson asserted on Sunday that House Republicans supported "maximum disclosure" but argued that the resolution was "reckless" and poorly drafted, arguing that it ignored federal rules protecting grand jury materials and "would require the DOJ and FBI to release information that they know is false, that is based on lies and rumors and was not even credible enough to be entered into the court proceedings."

Johnson said he supported the Trump administration's stance that "all credible evidence and information" be released, but emphasized the need for safeguards to protect victims' identities.

During a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland on Monday, Trump was asked why he kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, Florida, years ago.

"That's such old history. Very easy to explain, but I don't want to waste your time by explaining it. But for years, I wouldn't talk to Jeffrey Epstein. I wouldn't talk because he did something that was inappropriate," Trump told reporters. "He hired help, and I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' He stole people that worked for me. I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' He did it again, and I threw him out of the place, persona non grata. I threw him out and that was it." 

Trump said he turned down an invitation to Epstein's notorious island in the Caribbean and claimed former President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University President Larry Summers had gone.

"I never went to the island and Bill Clinton went there, supposedly 28 times. I never went to the island, but Larry Summers, I hear, went there. He was the head of Harvard and many other people that are very big people. Nobody ever talks about them," Trump said. "I never had the privilege of going to his island. And I did turn it down. But a lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island. In one of my very good moments, I turned it down."

“Democratic voters have said they want a fighter, and Jasmine Crockett, a former attorney who represents the Dallas area, has spent two and a half years in Congress trying to be one. Through her hearing-room quips and social-media insults, she's become known, at least in MSNBC-watching households, as a leading general in the battle against Trump.”

That kind of slobbering cover story, headlined “A Democrat for The Trump Era,” on Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) is exactly what one would expect from the Atlantic, which continues to serve at the pleasure of the left wing of the Democratic Party. The key part of that paragraph is the part where she's become known “at least in MSNBC-watching households, as a leading general in the battle against Trump.”

This “general” has appeared on MSNBC dozens of times this year, almost as if she were a paid employee of the network. CNN is also a cozy destination, appearing on that channel many times as well. But if the folks at the Atlantic believe appealing to the dwindling viewerships of MSNBC and CNN actually matters, they're either blindly partisan or engaging in wishful thinking.

If anyone needs a refresher course on who Crockett is, try this ego on for size. The Atlantic piece also reveals the following: “During many of our conversations, Crockett wore acrylic nails painted with the word RESIST, and a set of heavy lashes over her brown eyes.”

In other words, she's the ultimate performance artist.

“The lock screen on her phone is a headshot of herself.”

Because who among us doesn't have a headshot of ourselves on the lock screen of our cellphones?

And when it comes to the reason that she should be the top Democrat on the powerful House Oversight Committee?

“It's like, there's one clear person in the race that has the largest social-media following,” she said in June. This may be why, according to The Atlantic, “She monitors social-media engagement like a day trader checks her portfolio.” Nope. No sophomoric ego there whatsoever.

What the piece doesn't explore beyond the sizzle is, you know … what Crockett actually advocates or what bills she has sponsored or co-sponsored that have actually become law — see: zero. But in terms of 80-20 issues, she does believe the following.

Those entering the country illegally are not committing a crime, and it should be simply treated as a “civil violation.”

She also believes all those in the country illegally should be granted a pathway to citizenship.

She supports men playing against women in sports: “Find the little trans child that is ruining your life,” she once mocked.

She's called President Donald Trump “a wannabe Hitler.”

Has referred to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is paralyzed, as “Governor Hot Wheels.”

She recently asked for Elon Musk to be “taken out” as a birthday present.

And when it comes to freedom of the press, Crockett believes in censorship when it pertains to any piece she doesn't approve of 100%. Also per the Atlantic: “Four days before this story was published, Crockett called me to express frustration that I had reached out to so many House members without telling her first. She told me that she was ‘shutting down the profile and revoking all permissions.'”

That's some chilling stuff right there.

But despite Crockett coming across as an unhinged narcissist who takes extreme positions, she's leading in the race to be the Democratic challenger to Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), according to a July NRSC poll. Crockett, who hasn't declared yet, leads comfortably with 35% of the vote, followed by former Rep. Colin Allred at 20%, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke at 13%, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) at 13% and undecideds making up the final 18%.

Much can change until Election Day, more than 15 months away, but if that's who Democrats in Texas end up nominating, she'll make O'Rourke look good.

The same is happening with Democrats in the mayoral race in New York, where Zohran Mamdani, an antisemitic socialist, leads by double digits against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, incumbent Eric Adams, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.

If Mamdani wins in November, his plans include opening government-run supermarkets, which worked so well in the old Soviet Union and Cuba; defunding the police in high-crime areas in favor of social workers; and vehemently opposing Trump and Immigration and Customs Enforcement on deporting violent criminals here illegally. He has vowed to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he enters New York, wants to use millions of taxpayer money to pay for sex changes for minors, and — this is a doozy — would “slowly buy up the housing on the private market and convert properties into communes.”

This is madness. Yet as it stands right now, all the energy is behind the communist, who is fully endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has hit the campaign trail with him.

Speaking of Ocasio-Cortez, she's also polling well among Democrats nationally. When CNN asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is, Ocasio-Cortez came out on top, beating 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), former President Barack Obama, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

In a hypothetical race against Vice President JD Vance, Ocasio-Cortez is also within the margin of error, with Vance receiving 44% and her getting a surprising 41% in an Emerson College survey. But while that result is disconcerting, given that she wants to spend trillions on the Green New Deal despite flying on private jets to her “Fight the Oligarchy” rallies, still believes in defunding the police, supports open borders, opposes funding for Israel's Iron Dome, and advocates late-term abortion, how will these positions play in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona?

Meanwhile, whatever centrist voices are left in the party are having a rough go at it. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), who has called on Democrats to work with the Trump administration on areas where they can find common ground, all while being a staunch advocate of Israel, has been subject to criticism from Ocasio-Cortez and Crockett. There have been subsequent smear pieces this year by legacy media outlets regarding his health, which are completely unfounded. Compromise has become a dirty word on the left wing, and Fetterman is Exhibit A.

Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) is seen as a 2028 presidential contender, but his Jewish heritage could put him at odds with the left flank. We saw this play out when Harris inexplicably chose Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) as her running mate last year over Shapiro, reportedly out of fear of alienating anti-Israel Democratic voters. Walz, who only installed tampon machines in elementary school bathrooms and provided free healthcare and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, played a sizable role in Harris's defeat following his horrific debate performance.

As for 2028, Republicans should want Ocasio-Cortez, Mamdani, and Crockett front and center as much as possible. Because what appeals to MSNBC and CNN viewers doesn't play well once you hear their actual positions on key issues.

Per Trump on Truth Social recently, “After years of being left out in the cold, including suffering one of the Greatest Losses in History, the 2024 Presidential Election, the Democrats should nominate Low IQ Candidate, Jasmine Crockett, for President, and AOC+3 should be, respectively, Vice President, and three High Level Members of the Cabinet – Added together with our future Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, and our Country is really SCREWED!”

He's not wrong.

In a funny way, legacy media puff pieces from places such as the Atlantic only help the GOP.

The days of centrist Democrats actually governing and compromising on a national level seemingly ended with President Bill Clinton in the '90s.

KAMALA HARRIS SINKING LIKE A ROCK IN THE 2028 RACE

Today's Democrats are about resisting and appealing to the elites. The working class, unions, and black and Latino voters are being increasingly usurped by Trump.

And if that trend continues, the only fight Democrats will have will be among themselves.

            A first-of-its-kind satellite has launched to track nearly imperceptible changes on Earth's surface, an effort that could aid with responses to natural disasters.
    


            Called the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar mission, or NISAR, the spacecraft is equipped with two kinds of synthetic aperture radar designed by the US space agency and the Indian Space Research Organization in the countries' first joint satellite project.
    


            The radar, pioneered by NASA to use in space, works like conventional radar in that it uses microwaves to detect distant surfaces and objects. But advanced data processing enables the details to be seen at high resolution.
    


            NISAR lifted off from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India's southeastern coast at 8:10 a.m. ET (5:40 p.m. IST) Wednesday aboard an ISRO Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, or GSLV-F16. The launch was streamed live on NASA+ and the agency's YouTube channel.
    


            The satellite will orbit Earth 14 times per day in order to complete scans of almost all of the planet's ice and land surfaces twice every 12 days, detecting changes in Earth's surface down to fractions of an inch in the process.

            NISAR's dual radar will collect information that could allow for a better understanding of landslides and earthquakes, and improve the monitoring of ice sheets, glaciers, permafrost, forests, wetlands and agricultural fields. The data, which will be publicly available as it is collected and downloaded from the satellite, will also be used to prepare for and respond to hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, flooding and wildfires.
    


            The mission, first proposed in 2014, will allow scientists to monitor Earth like never before, changing the way we study our home planet and better predicting a natural disaster before it strikes, said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
    


            “Even though we may not always notice it, much of our Earth's land surface is in constant motion,” Fox said. “The changes, however, are so subtle that right now they're virtually undetectable. The need to be better prepared before, during and after the challenges caused by natural disasters around the world could not be greater.”
    


            NISAR, which is about the length of a pickup truck, is expected to capture a broad range of information due to its dual radar system — an L-band system with a 10-inch (25-centimeter) wavelength, and an S-band system with a 4-inch (10-centimeter) wavelength. The L-band was provided by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, while the S-band was supplied by ISRO.
    


            “NISAR is an equal 50/50, partnership between NASA and ISRO,” said Wendy Edelstein, NISAR deputy project manager at NASA's JPL, during a July 21 news conference. “These two radars work together to achieve science that neither could see on their own.”
    


            The signal of each system is calibrated to features of different sizes on Earth. Shorter wavelengths in the S-band can measure small objects, like leaves and the roughness of surfaces, to monitor crops, while long wavelengths in the L-band can peer through thick tree canopies to study forest structure and even spot boulders and tree trunks. The radar systems can also take specific measurements of motion, land deformation and moisture content.
    


            By bouncing microwave signals off Earth's surface and receiving return signals on a large radar antenna reflector, NISAR will be able to see through clouds and rain during the day and at night. The satellite's continuous observation could spot potential land movement before a volcanic eruption, or help scientists understand how motion on Earth's surface could disrupt infrastructure like levees or dams. It could even provide insights about where earthquakes may occur, according to NASA.
    


            The satellite is the result of conversations between NASA and ISRO that began in response to the National Academy of Science's 2007 decadal survey, which identified research priorities and recommended prioritizing observations of Earth. The two agencies signed an agreement on  September 30, 2014, to partner on the NISAR mission.
    


            In addition to providing the S-band radar, ISRO is calibrating the instrument, processing its data and developing algorithms to achieve the scientific goals of the mission. The agency has also supplied the body of the satellite, the launch vehicle and launch services. Meanwhile, NASA contributed a radar reflector antenna, a deployable boom, a communication subsystem for incoming data and other aspects of the spacecraft.
    


            “We are two nations with one mission,” said Karen St. Germain, director of Earth science at NASA, during a recent news conference. “NISAR unites the US and India to study our home planet together. The collaboration, cooperation and information sharing between our two agencies is a foundation that we really look forward to continuing to build upon.”
    


            Previously, some NASA instruments were flown aboard India's first deep-space mission Chandrayaan-1, which launched in 2008 and orbited the moon for nearly two years.
    


            Together, members of the NASA and ISRO team collaborated across 13 time zones and more than 9,000 miles (14,500 kilometers) to work on NISAR, requiring long-distance travel and many late-night and early morning video calls to build and test systems. The hardware was assembled on two different continents before being integrated in India to complete the satellite.
    


            Edelstein has traveled to India more than 25 times over the past decade and spent more than 150 days over the last two years working alongside team members at ISRO. Traveling from JPL, it took her 36 hours, door to door, to reach Bengaluru, India, where the systems were being tested. But she said the journey has allowed her to get to know her colleagues at ISRO well and be immersed in Indian culture — something she calls a very big personal highlight.
    


Earth is spinning faster, leading timekeepers to consider an unprecedented move



            St. Germain agrees: “Building a satellite on opposite sides of the world during a global pandemic was really hard, but it strengthened our relationship with ISRO,” she said.
    


            Dr. Jitendra Singh, India's Minister for Science and Technology, said the mission is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for India to become a “Vishwa Bandhu,” or a global partner that contributes to the collective good of humanity, according to a news release shared by the country's Press Information Bureau.
    


            “This mission is not just about a satellite launch — it is a moment that symbolises what two democracies committed to science and global welfare can achieve together. NISAR will not only serve India and the United States but will also provide critical data for countries around the world, especially in areas like disaster management, agriculture, and climate monitoring,” Singh said. “NISAR is not just a satellite; it is India's scientific handshake with the world.”

BANGKOK (AP) — China's top leaders have pledged to help companies slammed by higher U.S. tariffs but held back on major moves after trade talks with the U.S. this week kept businesses and planners in limbo. 

At their summer economic planning meeting, the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party pledged to stabilize foreign trade and investment. 

“We must assist foreign trade enterprises that have been severely impacted, strengthen financing support, and promote the integrated development of domestic and foreign trade,” the official Xinhua News Agency said in reporting the closed door meeting. It mentioned export tax rebates and free trade pilot zones but gave no other specifics.

The inconclusive outcome of two days of trade talks in Stockholm, Sweden, leaves open the question of higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States. 

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said the two sides had agreed to work on extending a deadline for higher tariffs. The U.S. side said the extension was discussed, but not decided. 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters after the talks that President Donald Trump would decide whether to extend the Aug. 12 deadline for reaching an agreement or to let tariffs that have been paused for 90 days to “boomerang” back to a higher level. 

“We haven't given the sign-off,” Bessent said, though he emphasized that the talks had been “very constructive.”

China remains one of the biggest challenges for the Trump administration after it has struck deals over elevated tariff rates with other key trading partners — including Britain, Japan and the European Union.




Many analysts had expected that the Stockholm talks would result in an extension of current tariff levels, which currently stand at a U.S. tariff of 30% on Chinese goods and a Chinese tariff of 10% on U.S. products, far lower than the triple-digit percentage rates raised in April. 

The truce in the tariffs war to allow time for talks, agreed on in early May to allow time for negotiations, allowed exporters and other traders to ramp up shipments in hopes of beating any higher tariffs that might follow. 

The meeting headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping mostly reiterated Beijing's priorities for the year, including a need to “unleash domestic demand” which has lagged, leading to a surge of exports by industries unable to find growth at home. It also stressed the need to promote jobs and prevent a “large scale relapse into poverty.”

The economy “has demonstrated strong vitality and resilience,” the Xinhua report said. But it acknowledged many risks and challenges. That includes reining in brutal competition that has led to damaging price wars among automakers and some other manufacturers and managing excess capacity in some industries, it said. 

China's economy expanded at a 5.2% annual pace in April-June, slowing slightly from the previous quarter. But analysts have said actual growth may have been significantly slower. 

Even with the hiatus in higher tariffs, companies are feeling a pinch. Industrial profits in China fell 1.8% in the first half of the year and 4.3% in June, according to data released earlier this week. 

It's unclear what level of tariffs might eventually be imposed on Chinese exports to the United States. 

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Thursday that Beijing hopes the U.S. side would follow through on the “important consensus” reached between Trump and Xi in a phone call to promote stable relations between the world's two largest economies. 

But Guo reiterated China's stance on its U.S. objections to its purchases of oil and gas from Russia, which Bessent raised during the talks in Stockholm, threatening more tariffs. 

“China will take reasonable measures to ensure energy security in accordance with its national interests,” Guo said. “There are no winners in a tariff war. Coercion and pressure will not solve the problem. China will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests.”

            The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting as it remains under intense pressure from President Donald Trump and his allies to lower borrowing costs.
    


            The central bank left its benchmark lending rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has been since December, but the decision wasn't unanimous. Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman cast dissenting votes, marking the first time more than one Fed governor has dissented since 1993. They preferred a quarter-point rate cut instead, the Fed said.
    


            The division among policymakers underscores the extraordinary and uncomfortable moment the Fed is in: Central bankers want to wait a little while longer for additional data to see how the US economy is faring during Trump's trade war, but they're facing repeated attack from the White House because of their wait-and-see strategy.
    


            Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a post-meeting news conference that these are still the “early days” of Trump's tariffs — and their effects on the US economy — meaning that “there are many, many uncertainties left to resolve,” he said.
    


            Here are takeaways from the Fed's latest decision to hold rates steady as the central bank faces intense pressure to reduce borrowing costs, even from within.
    


            A Fed governor dissenting on a policy decision is rare, and even more so when two of them do it at the same time. But Powell didn't characterize that as an issue.
    


            “On the dissents, what you want from everybody and also from a dissenter is a clear explanation of what your thinking is and what the arguments are you are making. We had that today,” Powell said. “Basically, this was a good meeting around the table where people thought carefully about this and put their positions out there.”
    


            Bowman and Waller could share their views on why they dissented as soon as Friday morning, after the customary post-meeting blackout.
    


            Even though the Fed is standing pat for now, the central bank is widely expected to lower rates at least once this year, and as many as two times by year's end, according to futures. This year's first rate cut could some as soon as September, some investors say.
    


            Powell said there are still too many things up in the air when it comes to the economy to know whether it makes sense to resume rate cuts in the fall. “We have made no decisions about September,” he said.
    


            For now, Fed policymakers are waiting to see if the effects of Trump's tariffs on inflation prove to be mild and if the economy continues to weaken. Those two developments would give the Fed the green light to resume rate cuts and ease some pressure off the economy.
    


Fed keeps interest rates unchanged for fifth-straight time



            “Most in the (Fed's rate-setting) committee think it will be appropriate to cut rates fairly soon, but they might be disagreeing over exactly how much evidence they need or how comfortable they have to be before they start cutting rates again,” William English, a former senior Fed adviser, told CNN.
    


            The job market has been a pillar of strength for the US economy for years, but it's not clear how much longer that resilience will persist as tariffs start to take a bigger bite.
    


            In addition to taming inflation, the Fed is also responsible for protecting the labor market.
    


            Powell reiterated repeatedly Wednesday that the labor market remains in good shape, but said “you do see a slowing of job creation” and some “downside risk,” meaning a turn for the worse.
    


            And it's not just Waller and Bowman who have doubts over how much longer the labor market can keep its ahead above water without any rate cuts.
    


            “I wouldn't want to see more weakness in the labor market,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said earlier this month at an event in Idaho. “Which is why you can't wait forever.”
    


            Powell said officials are looking at various factors of the labor market such as demand for workers and the supply of workers, which is being affected by Trump's ongoing crackdown on immigration.
    


            Trump hasn't let up with his monthslong, insult-laden pressure campaign against Powell.
    


            The president raised the temperature earlier this month when he and his allies seized on the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters in Washington, DC. They said the Fed, with Powell at the helm, has mismanaged the project, seeing it as a potential legal opening to oust Powell. Last week, Trump toured the renovation site and at one point even feuded with Powell, on camera, over the total cost of the project.
    


Wall street investors react to Trump-Powell squabble



            Powell said it was “a nice visit with the president,” adding that “he really wanted to see was us getting this construction completed as soon as possible.”
    


            “That is our focus. And that's what we are going to do,” he said.
    


            Since then, Trump has backed off from his criticism of the renovation project. On Monday, he even said he will “greatly miss” Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026.
    


            Trump is still calling on the Fed to lower rates, but instead of saying it drove up the federal government's debt servicing costs, he's now pointing to the effects of elevated interest rates on the housing market.
    


            “‘Too Late' MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media platform.
    


            However, the Fed cutting rates will not be the silver bullet that fixes the housing market, which is still grappling with the longstanding issue of not enough homes on the market. And last year, after the Fed began to lower interest rates, mortgage rates climbed instead.
    


            On the housing market, Powell said “there are other things going on housing sector, and one of those is … a long-term housing shortage.”
    


The Trump allies behind the escalating power play against Jerome Powell



            The Fed's decision comes the same day new data showed underlying momentum in the economy is sputtering.



            The Commerce Department earlier on Wednesday reported that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, registered an annualized rate of 3% in the second quarter. That figure beat economists' expectations and was a sharp rebound from the first quarter, when surging imports as businesses tried to get ahead of tariffs prompted GDP to decline at a 0.5% rate.
    


            But that strong headline figure masks underlying weakness buried in the details of the GDP report, and even the Fed noted that in its latest policy statement.
    


            “Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,” Fed officials wrote.
    


            A key gauge of demand in the economy — real final sales to private domestic purchasers — expanded at a 1.2% rate in the April-through-June period, down from 1.9% in the beginning of the year.
    


            “We expected the GDP data that we got this week and I think it's still a little bit difficult to interpret because you have these massive swings in net exports,” Powell said.

            Two more of Joe Biden's top White House aides are set to appear before the House Oversight Committee for scheduled interviews this week as part of the Republican-led panel's ﻿intensifying investigation into the former president's cognitive decline and possible efforts to conceal it from the public.
    


            The committee has scheduled interviews with former Biden counselor Steve Ricchetti and former senior adviser Mike Donilon for Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. In a departure from some previous high-profile witnesses, the two have signaled they will voluntarily sit for them. As of Tuesday afternoon, the committee had not issued subpoenas compelling their appearances.
    


Trump orders investigation of Biden actions and autopen use, citing former president's ‘cognitive decline'



            Several Biden aides have declined to cooperate with the committee's investigation, prompting the panel to subpoena their appearances. They then invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the closed-door meetings.
    


            Earlier this month, three Biden aides – White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor, former assistant to the president and senior adviser to the first lady Anthony Bernal and former assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, who previously served as director of Oval Office Operations – pleaded the fifth in the face of questions from the panel.
    


            Invoking the Fifth Amendment is typically done to avoid answering specific questions, and though it can be perceived by the public as a way of avoiding accountability, the US Supreme Court has long regarded the right against self-incrimination as a venerable part of the Constitution.
    


            Still, a number of Biden aides have sat for voluntary interviews with the panel. Former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain, for example, told the committee last week that Hillary Clinton had expressed concerns to him in 2023 that Biden's age was an issue the campaign hadn't dealt with effectively, and that national security adviser Jake Sullivan told him in 2024 after the presidential debate that Biden wasn't as effective as he once had been, a source familiar with the matter previously told CNN.
    


            Klain told the committee that he believed Biden had the mental sharpness to serve as president and he saw no reason to doubt Biden's mental acuity, another source said.
    


            A Clinton spokesman did not dispute Klain's account, but said Clinton was concerned with how the question of Biden's age was being handled politically in light of the attacks and questions he was facing.
    


            As with Klain, Neera Tanden, the former White House Director of the Domestic Policy Council, and Ashley Williams, former special assistant to the president and deputy director of Oval Office Operations, sat for transcribed interviews.
    


            According to a source familiar with her interview, Williams told the committee she believes that Biden was in command the night of the debate and was fit to be president, including now.
    


            The source said Williams stated she “did not recall” many times during her five-hour interview to several questions, including whether teleprompters were used for Cabinet meetings, if there were discussions about Biden using a wheelchair, if there were discussions about Biden undergoing a cognitive test, if she discussed Biden declining physically or mentally, if she ever had to wake Biden up, and how she got involved in his 2020 campaign. The source said that Williams would not say a good memory was an important trait for working at the White House.
    


            An attorney representing Williams did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.
    


            The committee is expected transcribe interviews with additional high-level aides next week, including with former deputy chief of staff for policy Bruce Reed﻿ on Tuesday and former senior adviser to the president for communications Anita Dunn on Thursday.
    


            Other former aides expected to testify in the coming months include: former special assistant to the president and senior adviser in the White House Counsel's Office Ian Sams on August 21; former deputy assistant to the president and senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates on September 5; former assistant to the president and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on September 12; and former chief of staff Jeff Zients on September 18.

NEW YORK (AP) — A gunman who killed four people inside a Manhattan office tower blamed his mental health problems on the National Football League and intended to target its headquarters but took the wrong elevator, officials said Tuesday.

Shane Tamura, a Las Vegas casino security worker, was carrying a handwritten note in his wallet that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He accused the league of hiding the dangers of brain injuries linked to contact sports.

Tamura, 27, sprayed the skyscraper's lobby with bullets then shot another person in a 33rd-floor office on Monday before he killed himself, authorities said. Among the dead were a police officer, a security guard and two people who worked at companies in the building. An NFL employee was badly wounded but survived.

The attacker's grievances with the NFL emerged as police worked to piece together his background and motivations, and as loved ones began to mourn the dead. 

It's unclear whether Tamura showed symptoms of CTE, which can be diagnosed only by examining a brain after death.

Tamura, who played high school football in California a decade ago but never played in the NFL, had a history of mental illness, police said without giving details. In the three-page note found on his body, he accused the NFL of concealing the dangers to players' brains for profit. The degenerative brain disease has been linked to concussions and other repeated head trauma common in contact sports such as football.

Detectives planned to question a man who supplied gun parts for the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack, including the weapon's lower receiver, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a video statement.

She and members of the force also paid tribute to Officer Didarul Islam, who was guarding the building on a paid security job when he was killed. His flag-draped remains arrived late Tuesday afternoon at the Bronx mosque preparing for his funeral.

Mayor Eric Adams visited the scene and recalled working in the mailroom of the building as a young man.

“To have to walk through and see the remnants of violence at that level, tore at me,” he told mourners at an evening multifaith vigil for those killed.

Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and other faith leaders delivered prayers at the gathering held at a park about a dozen blocks from where the shooting took place.

Both Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke of the need for stronger gun laws. Hochul said guns designed to kill people on battlefields shouldn't be in New York buildings. 

“We cannot respond to senseless gun laws through vigils,” Adams said. 

Tamura's note repeatedly said he was sorry and asked that his brain be studied for CTE. He mentioned a PBS Frontline documentary about the disease and referred to former NFL player Terry Long, who was diagnosed with CTE, and the manner in which Long killed himself in 2005.

The NFL long denied the link between football and CTE, but it acknowledged the connection in 2016 testimony before Congress and has paid more than $1.4 billion to retired players to settle concussion-related claims.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who works out of the offices, called the shooting “an unspeakable act of violence,” saying he was deeply grateful to the law enforcement officers who responded.

Goodell said in a memo to staff that the injured NFL employee was hospitalized in stable condition.

The shooting happened at a skyscraper on Park Avenue, one of the nation's most recognized streets, just blocks from Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center. It is less than a 15-minute walk from where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed last December by a man who prosecutors say was angry over what he saw as corporate greed.

Monday's attack drew a response from the White House, with President Donald Trump posting that his “heart is with the families of the four people who were killed” and that the officer “made the ultimate sacrifice.”




Tamura, who worked in the security department at the Horseshoe Las Vegas but failed to show up for his shift Sunday, drove across the country over the past few days and into New York City just before the attack, Tisch said.

Surveillance video showed Tamura exit his BMW outside the building at about 6:30 p.m. Monday wearing a button-down shirt and jacket with the rifle at his side.

Once inside the lobby, he opened fire and killed Islam and Wesley LePatner, a real estate executive at the investment firm Blackstone, which occupies much of the building. Tamura then made his way toward the elevator bank, shooting the NFL employee and an unarmed security guard, Aland Etienne, who helped control access to the upper floors.

Tamura waited for the next elevator to arrive in the lobby, let a woman walk safely out of the elevator, then rode it up to the 33rd-floor offices of the company that owns the building, Rudin Management. He killed a worker for that company before killing himself, officials said.

Islam, 36, had served as a police officer in New York City for over three years and was an immigrant from Bangladesh, Tisch said. He was working a department-approved job, in his New York Police Department uniform, when he was shot.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports from the scene of Monday's deadly shooting in Manhattan - on a possible motive.

Islam leaves a pregnant wife and two children. Friends and family stopped by their Bronx home on Tuesday to drop off food and pay their respects.

“He was a very friendly guy and a hardworking guy,” said Tanjim Talukdar, who knew him best from Friday prayers. “Whenever I see him or he sees me, he says, 'How are you, my brother?'”

This story was updated to correct that Tamura played high school football about a decade ago, not nearly two decades ago.

President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday proposed revoking a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.

The proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule would rescind a 2009 declaration that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. This “endangerment finding” is the legal underpinning of many climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.

Angrily screaming at two of his shocked Democratic colleagues, Booker blocked the passage of several bipartisan bills that would fund police programs, arguing that the Trump administration has been withholding law enforcement money from Democratic-leaning states.

“This is the problem with Democrats in America right now,” Booker bellowed. “Is we're willing to be complicit with Donald Trump!”

The surprise Senate spat over bills that have broad bipartisan support — mental health resources and other help for police officers — strikes at the heart of the beleaguered Democratic party's dilemma in the second Trump era: Do they cooperate where they can, or do they fight everything and shut down governance in the process?

Retailers rushing to stock up before expected tariffs has boosted activity at the port. The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that the port moved 5.7 million container units in the 2025 fiscal year, an 8.6% increase over the previous year. 

The surge is partly due to the president's promises to enact heavy tariffs on U.S. trading partners. However June saw a drop in container volumes amid ongoing uncertainty. 

Other major U.S. ports also saw gains. The Port of Los Angeles reported its busiest June ever, while the Port of New York and New Jersey saw a 6.5% increase in container volumes from January through May.

(Brendan McDermid, Pool Photo via AP, File)



The Senate confirmed Bove 50-49 for a lifetime appointment as a federal appeals court judge Tuesday as Republicans dismissed whistleblower complaints about his conduct at the Justice Department.

A former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was on Trump's legal team during his New York hush money trial and defended Trump in the two federal criminal cases. He will serve on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Democrats vehemently opposed Bove's nomination, citing his current position as a top Justice Department official and his role in the dismissal of the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. 

They also criticized his efforts to investigate department officials who were involved in the prosecutions of hundreds of Trump supporters who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. 

In its push to remove transgender athletes from Olympic sports, the administration provided the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee a detailed legal brief on how such a move would not conflict with the Ted Stevens Act, the landmark 1978 federal statute governing the Olympic movement.

That gave the USOPC the cover it needed to quietly change its policy, though the protection offers no guarantee the new policy won't be challenged in court.

Olympic legal expert Jill Pilgrim called the Trump guidance “a well thought-out, well-reasoned set of arguments for people who want to look at it from that perspective.”

“But I'd be pretty shocked if this doesn't get challenged if there is, somewhere along the line, a trans athlete who's in contention for an Olympic team or world championship and gets excluded,” said Pilgrim, who has experience litigating eligibility rules for the Olympics and is a former general counsel for USA Track and Field.

The lawsuit filed Tuesday by more than 20 mostly Democratic-led states targets the administration's efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider.

The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed this month. Part of the cuts focus on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.

The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. 

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to and it unconstitutionally retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access.

The Department of Health and Human Services, which is named as a defendant, defended the provision.

“States should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care,” spokesperson Andrew G. Nixon said via email. 

The Taiwanese government has called off the proposed stopover by President Lai Ching-te on his way to Latin America, The Associated Press has learned, a decision leading to conflicting accounts of the reason for the cancellation.

The cancellation is certain to hand a major diplomatic victory to Beijing and has drawn concerns from experts that the White House is setting a bad precedent for U.S.-China relations.

Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble offered an annual earnings outlook that was below analysts' projections and said it would raise prices on about a quarter of its products in the U.S. in part due to higher costs from the president's tariffs.

The assessment delivered Tuesday came a day after the Cincinnati-based maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper named current COO Shailesh Jejurikar as its next president and CEO. 

The price increases, implemented starting next month, will be in the mid-single-digit percentages and will also be combined with improved features, CFO Andre Schulten told reporters on a call.

P&G said in April that it was doing whatever it could to reduce higher costs from tariffs, from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties. Schulten said then that the company still would likely have to pass on higher costs to consumers as early as July.

P&G estimates that tariffs will increase its costs by about $1 billion before tax for fiscal 2026. 

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit argued that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.

The settlement comes nearly a year after a preliminary injunction was issued, marking the first time a U.S. judge ruled against a university over the handling of campus demonstrations against Israel and the war in Gaza. 

UCLA argued that it had no legal responsibility because protesters, not it, blocked Jewish students' access. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.

But U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California, one of the nation's largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests.

The Trump administration joined the lawsuit in March as it opened new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at multiple campuses.

The Board of Supervisors voted 4-0 Tuesday to direct county counsel to draft an ordinance barring officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks, with limited exceptions such as for medical protection or during undercover operations. Officers would also be required to visibly display identification and agency affiliation while out in public.

It is a response to recent immigration raids in which some federal agents refused to identify themselves or covered their faces. 

Supervisor Janice Hahn, who co-authored the motion, said the raids under the Trump administration have sparked fear and residents have a right to know who is stopping, questioning or detaining them.

Hahn conceded that it is unclear if the county will be able to enforce the law when it comes to actions by ICE and other federal agencies. 

Administration officials have defended the use of masks, saying immigration agents have faced harassment as they have gone about enforcement. They say agents are hiding their identities for their safety to avoid things like death threats and having their personal information made public.

Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters Tuesday that they plan to vote in favor of confirming Waltz.

His nomination cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month, and his path to final confirmation now appears smoother with the support of two Republicans who previously opposed some of the president's nominations.

Waltz was ousted as Trump's national security adviser in May after he mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss sensitive military plans.

The president said he wants to end what he called the “‘Blue Slip' SCAM” under which home-state senators weigh in on judicial and U.S. attorney nominations, something that carries significant weight for whether they proceed. 

Trump said on his Truth Social platform that Democratic senators are using the tradition of stating their opinions of potential nominees to stop him from getting the federal judiciary he wants.

He criticized the Senate Judiciary chairman, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, for preserving the practice.

Trump said as a result of the “custom” only Democrats or “a weak and ineffective Republican” can get nominated. He called on Grassley to have the “Courage” to end it.

Monarez, 50, was named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in January and then tapped as the nominee in March after the president abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon.

The Atlanta-based federal agency, which is tasked with tracking diseases and responding to health threats, has been hit by widespread staff cuts, key resignations and heated controversy over longstanding CDC vaccine policies upended by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

With Tuesday's vote, Monarez becomes the first CDC director to pass through Senate confirmation following a 2023 law.

Mexican national Paola Clouatre was released following advocacy from Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican who backs the president's hard-line immigration crackdown.

Clouatre is one of tens of thousands of people who have been detained as the Trump administration presses immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day suspected of being in the U.S. illegally.

Emails reviewed by AP show that Kennedy's office said Friday that it put in a request for the Department of Homeland Security to release her after a judge halted her deportation order earlier that week. By Monday she was out of a remote ICE detention center in north Louisiana and home in Baton Rouge with husband Adrian Clouatre and their two young children.

Kennedy's constituent services representative congratulated Adrian Clouatre on his wife's release and thanked him for his military service. 

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Previously it has said it considered Clouatre to be in the country illegally.

The U.S. representative and staunch Trump ally announced that she will not seek the office next year, putting an end to her flirtation with the race. 

In a long social media post, Greene said she is turned off by a political “good ole boy” system and alleged that it is endangering Republican control of the state.

Greene chose earlier not to run for Senate under pressure from Republicans who feared she would hand a second term to Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff. 

But she told reporters she might instead run for governor during a June appearance at the Georgia Republican Party convention in Dalton, where she wore a “Make Georgia Great Again” hat and discussed state issues.

Greene said Tuesday that she would focus on the northwest Georgia congressional seat that she has held since 2020 but left open the door for a future campaign. One day she may run, she said, “but it won't be in 2026.”

Legal groups sued the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday, claiming it is unlawfully refusing to enforce federal workplace protections for transgender workers.

Led by Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, the agency charged with enforcing laws against workplace discrimination has moved swiftly to comply with the president's executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes. The EEOC has dropped several lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers, stalled progress on some cases and subjected others to heightened scrutiny. 

The lawsuit also says the agency halted payments to state and local civil rights agencies for investigating gender identity discrimination claims.

“The Trump-Vance administration's unlawful effort to erase protections for transgender people is cruel, and a violation of the law and the Constitution,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which alongside the National Women's Law Center brought the case on behalf of Maryland LGBTQ+ advocacy group FreeState Justice.

The EEOC referred questions to the Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The Senate is set to vote as soon as Tuesday evening to confirm former Trump lawyer Emil Bove for a lifetime appointment as a federal appeals court judge despite vocal Democratic opposition and a new whistleblower complaint against him.

The whistleblower provided Congress with an audio recording of Bove that runs contrary to some of his testimony at his confirmation hearing last month, according to two people familiar with the recording. The audio is from a private video conference call at the Department of Justice in February in which Bove, a top official at the department, discussed his handling of the dismissed corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, according to transcribed quotes from the audio reviewed by AP.

The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the whistleblower has not made the recording public. The whistleblower's claims were first reported by the Washington Post.

The president said Tuesday that the disgraced financier “stole” the women who worked for the spa at Mar-a-Lago, the latest evolution in his description of how their highly scrutinized relationship ended years ago.

One of the women, he acknowledged, was Giuffre, who was among Epstein's most well-known sex trafficking accusers.

Trump's comments expanded on remarks a day earlier when he said he banned Epstein from his private club in Florida two decades ago because his onetime friend “stole people that worked for me.” At the time he did not make clear who those workers were.

The president has faced an outcry over his administration's refusal to release more records about Epstein after promises of transparency, a rare example of strain within his tightly controlled political coalition. Trump has attempted to tamp down questions about the case, expressing annoyance that people are still talking about it six years after Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial, even though some of his own allies have promoted conspiracy theories about it.

Trump's statements over the last two days expressing alarm at the unfolding humanitarian situation in Gaza mark a break from his lock-step support for Israel.

They also bring him closer to some in his MAGA base, who have rejected the Republican Party's longstanding, unequivocal support for Israel. Taylor Greene, for one, now calls what is happening in Gaza “genocide.” 

But Greene's comments do not represent MAGA as a whole. Podcaster Charlie Kirk, who leads the powerful Turning Point network, railed during his Monday show against what he deemed a “propaganda campaign trying to make it seem as if Israel is intentionally starving the people of Gaza.”

His show featured Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, who directs Israel365 Action and talked about what he called the “starvation lie.”

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said details would be forthcoming and that Trump “wants to alleviate suffering for the people of Gaza because he has a humanitarian heart.”

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce defended Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's work and said Trump would announce new plans once he returns from his trip to Scotland.

“The issue here is getting more food, more access, more everything. That has always been at the top of our list,” Bruce said, declining to discuss specifics at a briefing.

Democrats want a “large-scale expansion” of food and water into Gaza, channeled through established aid organizations. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he's “very skeptical” that Trump's plans will do enough to address starvation among Palestinians.

“Could the U.S. set up food centers? Yes, but what about the World Food Program, Mercy Corps and all the groups have been doing it for decades? Why don't we allow them to do it?” Kaine told The Associated Press.

China's top trade official said Tuesday that China and the U.S. agreed to work on extending a deadline for new tariffs beyond the latest deadline of Aug. 12 for a comprehensive trade deal. The U.S. side said extension plans were discussed, but not decided.

Li Chenggang didn't say how the extension would work. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged that such an extension was discussed, but said the U.S. team would head back to Washington and “talk to the president about whether that's something that he wants to do.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. side expressed concerns that China is producing goods at a rate beyond what is sustained by global demand, and that China was purchasing Iranian oil and supplying Russia with dual-use tech that could be used on the battlefield.

“It's the most truthful and easiest thing to say that Oct 7th in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be returned, but so is the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza,” the Georgia Republican posted on X Monday night. The staunch Trump ally previously called for an end to the war and pushed to cut U.S. defense aide to Israel.

Her statement was aimed at Florida Rep. Randy Fine, who last week dismissed reports that children in Gaza were dying of starvation as “all a lie” and “Muslim terror propaganda.”

“Release the hostages,” Fine wrote. “Until then, starve away.”

Greene said it's “disgraceful” for “a Jewish U.S. Representative” to be “calling for the continued starvation of innocent people and children.”

The Trump administration is pressing for a deal with Harvard University that would require the Ivy League school to pay far more than the $200 million fine agreed to by Columbia University to resolve multiple federal investigations, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Harvard would be expected to pay hundreds of millions of dollars as part of any settlement to end investigations into antisemitism at its campus, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Harvard leaders have been negotiating with the White House even as they battle in court to regain access to billions in federal research funding terminated by the Trump administration.

The White House's desire to get Harvard to pay far more than Columbia was first reported by The New York Times, which said the school has signaled a willingness to pay as much as $500 million.

Harvard did not immediately comment.▶Read more about Trump and Harvard

The U.S. president has long been angling for a meeting with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, and expects to have one shortly.

“I would say before the end of the year,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. The president said he spoke by phone with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the trade meeting in Sweden with Chinese officials.

That meeting resulted in the extension of the 30% tax the U.S. is charging on goods from China and the 10% tariffs that China is levying in retaliation, down significantly from tariff rates that reached triple digits earlier this year.

“He felt very good about the meeting there, better than he felt yesterday,” Trump said of his call with the treasury secretary.

The president says new tariffs intended to isolate the Russian economy will take effect in 10 days, but the president said he hasn't heard from the Kremlin about it.

“I haven't had any response. It's a shame,” he said.

Trump said he's been told he could take his first flight on the new plane as early as February.

Qatar gifted the president a plane earlier this year and the Air Force is converting it to be used as Air Force One. Next generation Air Force One aircraft under development are way behind schedule.

Trump has brushed off ethical concerns about his decision to accept such an expensive gift free of charge from a foreign government.

The president told reporters that his new deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a deal to stop the fighting with Ukraine will be in 10 days.That gives Putin until Aug. 8 to reach a deal or face steep tariffs or sanctions from the U.S.

Trump had originally given Putin 50 days, but said earlier this week that he was shortening the deadline because he didn't see any progress being made.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said following two days of talks with China that the U.S. team would head back to Washington and “talk to the president about whether that's something that he wants to do,” meaning pause changes in tariffs beyond the Aug. 12 deadline.

China's trade officials earlier said that the two sides agreed to “pushing” for the tariff pause beyond the existing deadline.

Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, say they are open to having their client cooperate with Congress but want her to be guaranteed immunity by lawmakers first.

Maxwell's attorneys also say that any interview with members of the House Oversight Committee should be scheduled only after her petition for the Supreme Court to take up her case has been resolved. Maxwell is serving a long prison sentence in Florida after having been convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls. She was questioned at a courthouse last week by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, issued a subpoena for her deposition. In a letter to Comer on Tuesday, Maxwell's attorneys say that though their “initial reaction” was that Maxwell would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, they are now looking for ways to cooperate.

“I haven't heard that,” Trump said when asked by a reporter on Air Force One.

Then he shifted the topic.

“Did you get to see my drive on the first hole?” he said. “Pretty long.”

A key goal of Trump's plan to boost artificial intelligence and data centers is wiping away barriers to rapid growth. And that means taking aim at NEPA, a 55-year-old bedrock law that requires agencies to consider a project's possible environmental impacts and allows public input before approval.

Data centers demand vast amounts of energy and water, arousing strong opposition. The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, giving “categorical exclusions” to data centers for “maximum efficiency” in permitting.

“It's par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,” said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.

“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,'' said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It boggles the mind and endangers the nation's safety and welfare.”

Under Zeldin and Trump, “the EPA wants to shirk its responsibility to protect us from climate pollution, but science and the law say otherwise,'' she added. “If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.”

“There are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,” Zeldin said Tuesday on the “Ruthless” podcast. “They created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy.”

The EPA proposal must go through a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it is finalized, likely next year. Environmental groups are likely to challenge the rule change in court.

Watch live as U.S. officials hold a press conference after second day of trade talks with Chinese officials in Stockholm.

Coming out of two days of trade talks with the U.S. in Stockholm, Li Chenggang, China's top trade official, told the press on Tuesday that the two sides agreed to continue the tariff pause after past the Aug. 12 deadline. That means the U.S. will continue to tax Chinese goods at 30%, and the Chinese side will keep taxing U.S. products at 10%.

Li said the two sides had “comprehensive and in-depth” discussions on microeconomic issues and that they agreed to keep close contact and “communicate with each other in a timely manner on trade and economic issues.”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to speak with the press soon.

Missouri's Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe is considering whether to call a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. A similar effort is underway in Texas. The goal would be to try to increase Missouri Republicans' current 6-2 advantage in congressional seats. Staff for Trump and Kehoe have had conversations about redistricting, a Kehoe spokesperson said Tuesday. And Kehoe has expressed being open to it.

To create another GOP congressional seat, Missouri state lawmakers likely would need to split up a Kansas City area district held by longtime Democratic Rep. Emanual Cleaver. Republicans considered that plan in 2022 but opted against it, fearing it could backfire with losses by spreading GOP voters too thin and subject the state to lawsuits alleging violations of constitutional voting rights.

Keir Starmer told his ministers on Tuesday that Britain will recognize a state of Palestine before the United Nations General Assembly, “unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, reaches a ceasefire, makes clear there will be no annexation in the West Bank, and commits to a long-term peace process that delivers a two state solution.”

Britain has long supported the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel, but has said recognition should come as part of a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict. Gaza also was on the agenda as Trump spoke with Starmer during his trip to Scotland, and said he'd insist to Israel that “I want them to make sure they get the food.”

Pressure to formally recognize Palestinian statehood has mounted since French President Emmanuel Macron announced that his country will become the first major Western power to recognize a Palestinian state in September.

The EPA administrator described the proposed rule change on the “Ruthless” podcast ahead of an official announcement set for Tuesday in Indiana.

Zeldin had called for a rewrite of the endangerment finding in March as part of a series of environmental rollbacks.' A total of 31 key environmental rules on topics from clean air to clean water and climate change would be rolled back or repealed under Zeldin's plan.

The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

Rooke said that space is being increasingly militarized as nations compete for access to valuable minerals, satellite dominance and control over new energy sources that could be developed on the moon, including helium 3, a material that could be used to generate huge amounts of clean energy. Control over the moon in the next few decades could determine which country emerges as the globe's next great superpower, cyber analyst Joseph Rooke said.

That's leading to increased competition between the U.S. and its partners and Russia, China and its allies. China and Russia have announced plans to build a nuclear plant on the moon in coming years, while the U.S. is planning missions to the moon and Mars. Artificial intelligence is likely to speed up the competition, as is the demand for minerals and energy that AI requires.

Hackers are increasingly targeting satellites as the space-based communication platforms take on greater economic and national security roles, a leading cyber analyst says.

Satellites now drive global positioning systems and digital networks vital for the global economy, communications, and military operations. Disrupting those satellites or the industrial supply chains that support their development would cause significant damage to an opponent's economy and defense, said Joseph Rooke, director of risk insights at the firm Recorded Future, who led an online discussion Tuesday about the militarization of space.

“The race is back on,” Rooke said. “If you dominate Earth's energy needs, that's game over.”

The monthlong August break “is a critical opportunity to continue to define how this legislation will help every voter and push back on Democrat fearmongering,” the National Republican Campaign Committee's memo says.

Republicans could face constituents after the first months of their complete control of the federal government, which they used to pass, among other things, a massive tax and spending bill. Most U.S. adults think the GOP tax bill will help the wealthy and harm the poor, according to an AP-NORC poll.

“The best defense is a good offense,” the NRCC memo says. “Think of creative events” to connect with voters, such as round tables, visiting a local hospital or “work the counter at a local store and chat about your work to lower costs.”

David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said it's virtually “impossible to think that the EPA could develop a contradictory finding (to the 2009 standard) that would stand up in court.”

Doniger and other critics say that if it somehow does stand up however, this “kill shot” would erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to tackle climate change.

“The Endangerment Finding is the legal foundation that underpins vital protections for millions of people from the severe threats of climate change, and the Clean Car and Truck Standards are among the most important and effective protections to address the largest U.S. source of climate-causing pollution,'' said Peter Zalzal, associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund.

Trump's executive order directed the agency to submit a report “on the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding.

Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have hailed the EPA proposal as a way to undo rules they say are economically damaging.

Three former EPA leaders have criticized Zeldin's proposal, saying it would endanger the lives of millions of Americans and abandon the agency's dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

“If there's an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they're doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under Republican President George W. Bush.

Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed on Tuesday the revocation of a scientific finding key to U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.

The proposed EPA rule rescinds a 2009 declaration that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

This “endangerment finding” is the legal underpinning of a many climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. Zeldin said he's thrilled to end what he called “the Holy Grail of the climate change religion” as the EPA “does its part to usher in the Golden Age of American success.''

France's prime minister described it as a “dark day” for the European Union. Commentators said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen's handshake with Trump amounted to capitulation. But Europe depends mightily on the United States, and not just for trade: Its security is at stake.

Mirroring Trump, Von der Leyen gushed that the arrangement she endorsed to set U.S. tariffs on most European exports at 15%, which is 10% higher than currently, is “huge.”

A month after NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte ingratiated himself with Trump by referring to him as “daddy,” the Europeans again conceded that swallowing the costs and praising an unpredictable president is more palatable than losing America. U.S. allies are convinced that should he win his war against Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to take aim at one of them next.

The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, likely deepening the divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and his chief critic, Trump, see the economy.

The Fed itself, to be sure, is increasingly divided: Many economists expect two Fed board members appointed by Trump to dissent in favor of cutting rates, the first such vote against the chair since 1993. 

Trump says that because the U.S. economy is doing well, the Fed should cut rates, as if the U.S. is a blue-chip company that should pay less to borrow than a risky start-up. But Fed officials — and nearly all economists — see it the other way: A solid economy means rates should be relatively high, to prevent overheating and a burst of inflation.

The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose two points to 97.2 in July, up from 95.2 the previous month. That's in line with analysts' forecasts.

In April, American consumers' confidence in the economy sank to its lowest reading since May 2020 amid anxiety over the impact of Trump's tariffs.

A measure of short-term expectations for income, business conditions and the job market rose 4.5 points to 74.4, however that's still well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. And consumers' assessments of their current economic situation inched down by 1.5 points to 131.5.

Employers posted 7.4 million job vacancies last month as the American job market continues to cool. The Labor Department reported Tuesday that job openings in June were down from 7.7 million in May.

Layoffs were little changed. But the number of people quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their prospects elsewhere — dropped again. 

Why? It's partly because of the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023, and partly because uncertainty about Trump's trade wars is paralyzing hiring managers.

The economy has been generating 130,000 jobs a month this year, down from 168,000 last year and 400,000 a month on average during the recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns.

The Senate on Tuesday evening confirmed President Donald Trump's ranking Justice Department official, Emil Bove, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit despite calls from Democrats to investigate whistleblower allegations against the nominee.

Bove, a former federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York and the DOJ's principal associate deputy attorney general, was confirmed in a 50-49 vote after a tense debate and a razor-thin vote. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski broke with their party to oppose the nomination, while Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) did not vote.

The vote marked Trump's second successful appellate court appointment since returning to the White House.

The confirmation reflects Trump's aggressive judicial strategy in his second term, building on the recent confirmation of Whitney Hermandorfer to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month to replace an Obama-era appointee, further tilting the court that hears appeals from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee to the right.

Bove's confirmation, however, was far more contentious.

Just hours before the vote, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) sent a letter to the Justice Department's acting inspector general, William Blier, urging an investigation into allegations that Bove once suggested ignoring court orders related to immigration enforcement. The two Democratic senators said it was “imperative” that the Senate thoroughly examine the whistleblower disclosures before taking final action.

“In the event these whistleblower complaints and other reports have not already prompted investigations by your office, we urge you to undertake a thorough review of these disclosures and allegations,” the letter stated.

A third whistleblower reportedly emerged Tuesday ahead of the vote, meeting with staff for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), whose spokesperson dismissed the late allegations as “a bad faith attempt to sink a nominee.”

In a speech on the Senate floor, Grassley stated how his team encountered challenges while attempting to review the three whistleblower disclosures in good faith, saying, “Any assertion that I or my staff was uninterested in the evidence is false.”

Bove, who served as Trump's defense attorney during his criminal cases last year, has denied any wrongdoing previously under oath during his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said he never instructed attorneys within the DOJ to defy federal court orders.

“I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,” Bove told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added, “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.”

Former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni filed the initial complaint against him in June, with the backing of the Government Accountability Project. The liberal-aligned organization has received millions in funding from George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations and the left-of-center Fund for Constitutional Government.

Legal scholars aligned with Trump called the attacks on Bove politically motivated.

SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ADVANCES FIVE TRUMP JUDICIAL PICKS, INCLUDING EMIL BOVE, AS DEMOCRATS STAGE WALKOUT

“Judicial fortitude is a hallmark of a Trump judicial nominee, and I have seen hundreds of judicial nominees; his performance at his confirmation hearing displayed that he has fortitude in spades,” said Robert Luther III, a professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University and former White House associate counsel. “He has undergone abuse beyond the measure of what any person should have to endure to secure a position in public service.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) delivered a blistering rebuke on the floor minutes after the vote: “How have Republicans allowed the bar to fall so low? This is a dark, dark day. A dark vote.”

Booker, who co-authored the last-ditch appeal to the Justice Department inspector general, said Bove's record made him unfit for the federal bench. “His temperament — using vulgarities to claim that the Trump administration should disobey court orders — is disqualifying for the bench,” Booker said.

The most serious allegations against Bove stem from text and email messages obtained by congressional investigators and the whistleblower, Reuveni, who was fired in April after more than 14 years at the department. 

Reuveni claims he was terminated for refusing to present what he called an “overzealous and misleading” legal argument in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia deportation case, and alleged Bove told DOJ prosecutors to be prepared to tell federal courts “F*** you” to an order that Abrego Garcia and others be returned from El Salvador to U.S. custody after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg sought to block a series of March 15 deportation flights.

Bove will now take a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit, which covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and the U.S. Virgin Islands — replacing Judge Julio Fuentes, a Clinton appointee who assumed senior status.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a rare public outburst on the Senate floor Tuesday, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker took his Democratic colleagues to task, declaring his party “needs a wake-up call!” 

Angrily screaming at two of his shocked Democratic colleagues, his words all but reverberating off the chamber walls, Booker blocked the passage of several bipartisan bills that would fund police programs, arguing that President Donald Trump's administration has been withholding law enforcement money from Democratic-leaning states. 

“This is the problem with Democrats in America right now,” Booker bellowed. “Is we're willing to be complicit with Donald Trump!” 

The surprise Senate spat over bills that have broad bipartisan support — mental health resources and other help for police officers — strikes at the heart of the beleaguered Democratic party's dilemma in the second Trump era as they try to find a way back to power, and also their frustration as Republicans have pushed through legislation and nominations that they vehemently disagree with. Do they cooperate where they can, or do they fight everything, and shut down governance in the process? 

“A lot of us in this caucus want to f—— fight,” Booker said with an expletive as he left the Senate floor after the exchange. 

Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, one of the two Democrats on the floor who tried to pass the law enforcement bills that raised Booker's ire, said she had a different view. 




“We can do both,” she said afterward. “Support our communities, keep them safe, and take on Donald Trump and his bad policies.” 

Booker's tirade began Tuesday afternoon when Cortez Masto tried to pass seven bipartisan bills by unanimous consent. But Booker objected to five of the seven bills, which would have directed resources to law enforcement agencies, arguing that the Trump administration is “weaponizing” public safety grants by canceling them in many Democratic-leaning states like New Jersey. 

“Why would we do something today that's playing into the president's politics and is going to hurt the officers in states like mine?” Booker asked. 

Things escalated from there, with Cortez Masto and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., saying that Booker should have objected when the bill was passed unanimously out of committee. “This is not the way to go about it,” Cortez Masto said. 

Klobuchar said to Booker: “You can't just do one thing on Police Week and not show up and not object and let these bills go through and then say another a few weeks later on the floor.” 

“I like to show up at the markups and I like to make my case,” Klobuchar said. 

Booker responded with a booming tirade. “The Democratic party needs a wake up call!” he yelled, walking away from his desk and out into the aisle. “I see law firms bending the knee to this president, not caring about the larger principles,” he said, along with “universities that should be bastions of free speech.” 

He added: “You want to come at me that way, you will have to take it on with me because there's too much on the line.” 

The arguments points to the tensions below the surface of the Democratic caucus as they head into important moments — both this week, as Republicans push to quickly confirm dozens of Trump administration nominees before the August recess, and this fall when Congress will have to pass bipartisan spending bills to avoid a government shutdown. 

Democrats suffered a swift backlash from their base in the spring when Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., helped advance a Republican spending bill that kept the government open instead of forcing a shutdown. Schumer argued that shutting the government down would have been worse, and that they were both “terrible” options. It is unclear whether Schumer and Democrats will want to force a shutdown in the fall if Republicans don't include some of their priorities in spending legislation. 

Booker did not have specific advice for his colleagues beyond the need to fight harder. But other senators say they will have to find a balance. 

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says he hears both things at home — “why can't you all get along” and “thank you for fighting.” 

 “Both are absolutely necessary at this moment in history,” Blumenthal said.

Republican senators, frustrated by what they see as Democratic delays, are exploring aggressive options to accelerate the confirmation of President Donald Trump's nominees, including potential rule changes and even recess appointments, according to people familiar with a closed-door meeting Tuesday.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) isn't ruling out scrapping part or all of the August recess as Democrats continue to slow-walk confirmations, consuming valuable floor time. More than 130 of President Donald Trump's nominees remain in limbo, and the White House is pushing hard for movement this week.

A GOP leadership aide said discussions about potential rule changes are underway but remain in the early stages. Among the floated ideas are reducing the number of positions requiring Senate confirmation and shortening the floor time needed to process nominees. Separately, a source familiar with the talks said Republican leaders are also exploring a bipartisan package of nominees in conversations with their Democratic counterparts.

“This is unprecedented obstruction by the Democrats. We need to do something to get the president's people in place,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), the No. 2 Senate Republican.

Republicans also spent considerable time during their party lunch weighing the possibility of recess appointments. This option was once seen as extreme but is now drawing increasing interest within the conference, according to several sources familiar.

Thune told reporters whether that option was discussed: “Well, I wouldn't take any option off the table. Obviously, it's one of many suggestions that have been made.”

Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) confirmed that recess appointments and rule changes were discussed. However, he believes the GOP is leaning toward recessing to allow Trump to act unilaterally.

“We've reached the point of stalemate, and Chuck [Schumer] refuses to relent and negotiate on the nominations,” Kennedy said. “We're spending hours and hours and hours to confirm the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and then it flies through with virtually no opposition.”

He acknowledged time is running short, citing competing legislative priorities like appropriations and the NDAA. He suggested that initiating a recess, despite procedural complications, may be the most practical path forward. “We're going to get started on a recess, and then the president can appoint whomever he wants.”

While some Republicans openly discuss recess appointments, the chances of them happening remain slim. One key obstacle lies beyond the Senate's control; both chambers must formally adjourn to enable such appointments, but the House has already left town and is holding pro forma sessions instead.

Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) echoed the growing frustration within the GOP, calling Democrats' tactics unprecedented. “Democrats, for the first time ever, are making every single nomination go through the full process, that's never been done before,” he said. “We're spending record amounts of time here, and we're still not getting folks confirmed.”

Hoeven said the best outcome would be a bipartisan agreement to move nominees forward, but warned that if Democrats refuse to cooperate, Republicans are prepared to stay in session through August, pursue rule changes, or enable recess appointments. “All options are on the table,” he said. “One way or another, we've got to get this done.”

Changing the rules wouldn't be without precedent. In 2019, Senate Republicans, led by then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, pushed through a rules change that slashed post-cloture debate time on most executive branch nominees from 30 hours to just two. Frustrated by Democratic delays, McConnell argued the move was necessary to overcome obstruction and expedite confirmations, a strategy Republicans are now again considering as they face a mounting backlog.

Though only a simple majority is required to change cloture rules, the process still takes time. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) questioned the need for even two hours of debate per nominee. “Why are we waiting two hours? … Why not 10 minutes?” he asked.

As tensions rise, some Republicans believe a deal may still be within reach, and preferable to more drastic steps.

“I think we get a deal done,” said Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), speaking to the Washington Examiner. “Because if we don't, the discussion around here about going out on recess and doing recess appointments is a real discussion. And if that happens, I can't imagine that's something the Democrats would want.”

Democrats, meanwhile, are holding off on any decisions as they await a GOP offer. A person familiar with internal Democratic discussions described the Republican threats as part of a political pressure campaign. “The big question is what would Democrats receive in return for expediting the nominees,” the person said, noting that lawmakers on both sides are eager to return home for the August recess.

Some Democrats have indicated they're open to confirming certain Trump nominees, depending on who's included. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said a key sticking point is Republicans' refusal to allow Democratic appointees to serve on independent commissions, a sharp break from the long-standing bipartisan tradition.

“Maybe we didn't obviously support all their appointees, but we've always had Democratic and Republican appointees on the FEC, on the CFTC, on the Safety Commission for product safety,” she said, speaking to reporters on Tuesday.

SENATE'S AUGUST PLANS IN LIMBO AS GOP EYES STALLED NOMINEE BREAKTHROUGH

Klobuchar said Democrats are focused on processing nominations, including some bipartisan picks that have received support from most of the caucus. While she didn't rule out the possibility of a deal for quick approval on certain nominees, she noted that some problematic nominations are still expected.

In this article

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed on order imposing a universal 50% tariff on copper imports, the latest metal he has targeted with a steep import tax.

U.S. copper prices plunged as much as 18% in after-hours trading as soon as the White House announced the new tariff rate. Copper miners Freeport-McMoRan and Southern Copper were down about 10% and more than 6%, respectively.

The sell-off, if it holds through Thursday's trading session, will mark the metal's largest single-day decline since 1989.

The new, higher copper tariffs go into effect Friday, according to a fact sheet released by the White House.

The Trump administration says that the new duties, which follow 50% U.S. tariffs already imposed on steel and aluminum, are aimed at boosting domestic industries and addressing "trade imbalances."

But experts warn that they could raise prices on all sorts of products, ranging from construction materials to electronics, that utilize the versatile metal.

And Trump's other sector-specific tariffs and ongoing trade investigations, which target imported autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals, could dampen overall U.S. growth, according to the Tax Foundation.

Copper is the third-most-consumed metal, behind iron and aluminum. The U.S. imports nearly half of the copper it uses, most of which comes from Chile, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

WASHINGTON – A divided Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, despite a barrage of criticism from President Donald Trump and dissents from two top officials.

The Federal Open Market Committee, the group that sets the overnight borrowing rate, voted 9-2 to stay on hold. The federal funds rate will continue to be set in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. The level sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending, but influences a slew of other rates across the economy.

However, the decision met opposition from Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both of whom have advocated for the Fed to start easing in acknowledgement that inflation is under control and the labor market could start weakening soon. This was the first time since late 1993 that multiple governors cast no votes on a rate decision.

The post-meeting statement offered only a couple changes in how the committee views economic conditions.

"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year," the document stated. "The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated."

At the June meeting, the committee had a more optimistic view, saying the economy "continued to expand at a solid pace."

The Wednesday statement said uncertainty about conditions "remains elevated," also a less upbeat assessment from June, which noted that uncertainty had "diminished but remains elevated."

A slower economy would boost the argument for lower interest rates, though the committee stopped short of endorsing that view.

Markets had overwhelmingly expected no action on rates, but stocks headed lower after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference that the committee hadn't yet determined whether it would cut rates at its September meeting.

 "We have made no decisions about September," he said. "We don't do that in advance. We'll be taking that information into consideration and all the other information we get as we make our decision."

He further explained that the central bank is watching the potential impact of tariffs on inflation.

"Our obligation is to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem," he said.

Traders had been expecting the Fed to cut in September, but after Powell's comments, the likelihood of a quarter percentage point reduction slipped to 46% from 64%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. In June, Fed officials narrowly indicated they see two cuts in total this year. The committee normally has 12 voters but was without Governor Adriana Kugler at the July meeting.

"It is an exceedingly rare occurrence when two Fed governors dissent at an FOMC meeting, but it was the most well telegraphed dissention ever at today's FOMC meeting," said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. "The driver of the dissension was about the timing of rate cuts, not the direction of policy adjustments. Not a big deal. The real impact of the dissenters was to pull Powell toward the dovish camp for September."

McIntyre said he expects the Fed will cut in September, barring any major surprises in the July and August employment reports.

The news follows a remarkable stretch for an entity with great sway over the economy but one that has mostly avoided the political fray, at least overtly.

Trump has called for Powell's resignation and even toyed with the legally questionable idea of firing him. Though he's largely backed off the threat of sacking Powell, the president has kept up the criticism of a former appointee whom he now regularly calls "Too Late."

The president has suggested the Fed lower its benchmark rate by 3 percentage points, which he said would reduce bowering costs on the surging national debt and help the moribund housing market.

In addition to the hectoring over rates, the Trump administration has ripped Powell and the central bank for cost overruns on a massive remodeling project at two of the Fed's buildings in Washington. Powell has insisted that the overruns are not the product of mismanagement but rather escalating costs since the project began.

Wednesday brought more news that could influence the Fed's path, Trump's badgering notwithstanding.

The Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product grew at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, considerably stronger than expected. Though much of the headline gain was propelled by a reversion of a massive import surge in the first quarter ahead of Trump's tariffs, the report nevertheless reinforced the notion of an economy still on solid ground.

Moreover, the report showed inflation running at just a 2.1% rate for the period, according to the Fed's main forecasting tool. Core inflation was a bit higher at 2.5%, but both numbers plunged from their first-quarter levels and neared the Fed's 2% bogey.

"We at the White House 100% respect their independence, but we also like to respect their analysis," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Wednesday on CNBC. "We expect that the Fed will catch up to the data soon. That's going to be a really big, positive story."

The Fed next will gather at its annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August. The event historically has featured a major policy speech from the chair.

The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has been a target of criticism by President Donald Trump for his handling of legal cases involving former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

Shortly after those sanctions were announced, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil, with a statement from the White House referencing de Moraes.

"President Trump is defending American companies from extortion, protecting American persons from political persecution, safeguarding American free speech from censorship, and saving the American economy from being subject to the arbitrary edicts of a tyrannical foreign judge," the statement said.

The sanctions come five months after Trump's social media company, Trump Media, sued de Moraes for over an order by the justice to the video hosting company Rumble to suspend the accounts of a "well-known politically outspoken user" of Rumble, whose services Trump Media uses.

Trump previously said that the 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil are partly in retaliation for the ongoing criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro, an ally of his.

De Moraes last year drew the ire of mega-billionaire Elon Musk, who at the time was a close ally over Trump, by blocking Musk's X social media platform nationwide in Brazil for failing to comply with orders banning some user accounts and to remove certain content.

"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies," said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a statement Wednesday announcing the sanctions, which would block any property de Moraes might have in the United States.

"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions — including against former President Jair Bolsonaro," Bessent said.

"Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens."  

The Washington Post on July 17 reported that Eduardo Bolsonaro, a son of Bolsonaro, was "working closely with the White House to impose sanctions on" de Moraes. Eduardo Bolsonaro is a federal congressman in Brazil.

De Moraes is the so-called rapporteur of cases against Jair Bolsonaro, and is sitting on a five-judge Supreme Court panel that is overseeing the former president's trial for allegedly trying to stage a coup against sitting Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and other charges.

Geothermal energy has been used for thousands of years, powering heating systems as early as the 14th century. It's getting a big upgrade.

Beyond geothermal, there's superhot geothermal, which uses ultra-deep drilling to access extremely hot rocks, extracting 5 to 10 times more power per well.

Quaise Energy, a  Massachusetts-based startup, is in the market developing the technology, which involves an electromagnetic beam that vaporizes rock. The company's systems are able to reach superhot geothermal energy up to 12 miles below the service of the earth.

Temperatures that deep can reach 500 degrees Celsius, or over 930 degrees Fahrenheit.

"To access the resource at a scale that actually matters, we have to drill hotter first and deeper second," said Carlos Araque, CEO of Quaise. "The oil industry routinely drills to depths of 2 to 3 miles, and maybe no more than 150 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. We need to double or triple that to actually start to get the right resource."

Quaise's technology was invented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2007. The company is working to scale it for commercial use, and demonstrated its technology with oil and gas company Nabors Industries in June. While the drilling itself is costlier, the energy output is so much higher that it's ultimately a cost savings for the heat.

"We intend to build the first in the world superhot, or super critical geothermal power plant, to show exactly that 10X output that you get by going hotter," Araque said.

Quaise plans to pilot the plant near Bend, Oregon, and hopes to have it ready by 2028. Nabors sees it as a very timely play.

"The potential of the market, the size of the market, the fact that today's world with data centers, with AI, with the electrification of everything, we require so much power, kind of at all times," said Guillermo Sierra, vice president, energy transition at Nabors.

Nabors is also an investor in Quaise. Other backers include Prelude Ventures, Engine Ventures, Safar Partners, Mitsubishi and Collab Fund. The company has raised a total of $103 million.

Sierra said the technology could also help repurpose a significant portion of the labor force that's working in oil and gas.

At a geothermal event in Washington, D.C., in March, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright showed strong support for geothermal energy. He said it could help with the growth of artificial intelligence and manufacturing and lower prices for electricity.

Wright also noted that President Donald Trump specifically mentioned geothermal, along with nuclear and hydropower, in his National Energy Emergency executive order. The recently passed tax and spending bill kept funding for geothermal, originally part of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, while cutting money for other forms of renewable energy.

In this article

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a letter outlining his vision for "personal superintelligence" Wednesday, giving investors a glimpse into his artificial intelligence strategy ahead of Meta's second-quarter earnings report.

The company has shelled out billions of dollars hiring top AI researchers and engineers in recent weeks, and Wall Street will be listening for what Zuckerberg has to say about the spending spree.

Zuckerberg did not outline specific products or applications that Meta plans to build in his letter, but he said he views superintelligence as a tool for "personal empowerment" over automation and efficiency.

"This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output," Zuckerberg wrote.

Meta has been racing to keep up with competitors like OpenAI and Google. In June, the company announced plans to invest $14.3 billion into Scale AI and hired its CEO Alexandr Wang.

Weeks later, Zuckerberg revealed a new business unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs, where employees will work on foundation models such as the open-source Llama family of AI models, products and Fundamental AI Research projects.

Wang is leading the lab as Meta's chief AI officer, and the company has also recruited talent from Anthropic, OpenAI and Google.

Investors have seen Zuckerberg make expensive decisions around emerging technologies before. 

In recent years, Meta has poured billions of dollars into building the metaverse, a computing platform involving digital worlds that are accessible through VR and augmented reality devices. He published a similar letter about his vision for the technology in 2021.

Meta's Reality Labs business unit houses its metaverse efforts. As of April, Reality Labs has reported cumulative losses of more than $60 billion since late 2020.

"The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take," Zuckerberg wrote, "and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society."

WATCH: Trend is bullish on Meta for the long-term

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday outlined his vision for "personal superintelligence," predicting a "new era of personal empowerment."

"I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress," Zuckerberg wrote in a letter published on Meta's blog and social media platforms.

"But perhaps even more important is that superintelligence has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose," he said.

"Meta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone," he wrote. "We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives."

He also talked about the hardware that he expects people to use to access AI, saying he believed glasses would become "primary computing devices."

"Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," he added. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices."

Meta is bullish on the form factor and has developed and launched multiple models of AI-powered smart glasses, with its AI Ray-Bans being the most popular. It's also working to develop a more advanced version of AI glasses with integrated displays, showing off a prototype of the technology, called "Orion," last year.

If the term "superintelligence" sounds familiar, that's because it's one of the phrases AI companies have used to describe a yet-to-be-reached breakthrough generally defined as when AI is capable or more capable than human intelligence. Another similar phrase is "artificial general intelligence," or AGI.

Last month, Zuckerberg announced Meta's superintelligence lab. The Meta CEO has aggressively recruited established AI talent, including hiring Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang to lead the new lab, and offering jaw-dropping offers to top engineers at OpenAI, Apple, and other AI firms.

Read Zuckerberg's full letter below:

Over the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. The improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is now in sight.

It seems clear that in the coming years, AI will improve all our existing systems and enable the creation and discovery of new things that aren't imaginable today. But it is an open question what we will direct superintelligence towards.

In some ways this will be a new era for humanity, but in others it's just a continuation of historical trends. As recently as 200 years ago, 90% of people were farmers growing food to survive. Advances in technology have steadily freed much of humanity to focus less on subsistence and more on the pursuits we choose. At each step, people have used our newfound productivity to achieve more than was previously possible, pushing the frontiers of science and health, as well as spending more time on creativity, culture, relationships, and enjoying life.

I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress. But perhaps even more important is that superintelligence has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose.

As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.

Meta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.

This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well.

The intersection of technology and how people live is Meta's focus, and this will only become more important in the future.

If trends continue, then you'd expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and more time creating and connecting. Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful. Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.

We believe the benefits of superintelligence should be shared with the world as broadly as possible. That said, superintelligence will raise novel safety concerns. We'll need to be rigorous about mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source. Still, we believe that building a free society requires that we aim to empower people as much as possible.

The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society.

Meta believes strongly in building personal superintelligence that empowers everyone. We have the resources and the expertise to build the massive infrastructure required, and the capability and will to deliver new technology to billions of people across our products. I'm excited to focus Meta's efforts towards building this future.

— Mark

If you ask Donna Morris, there's one behavior that's the ultimate red flag an employee won't get far in the workplace: when someone is a "Debbie Downer."

Morris, 57, has been executive vice president and chief people officer at Walmart since 2020, helping shape the employee experience of 2.1 million workers since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Prior to her current role, she spent 17 years at Adobe in a variety of leadership positions — and throughout her career, she's learned a thing or two about red flags in the office.

"Nobody wants [to hire] a Debbie Downer," Morris tells CNBC Make It, adding that this kind of person is "constantly negative. You know they're going to show up [and] they're going to bring the problem, never the solution. I like people who bring the problem and a suggestion for how they might resolve [it.]"

A "Debbie Downer" can also be someone who's a naysayer, sharing negative opinions about others' ideas and goals, or regularly being a hindrance to new projects and perspectives. This could make it difficult for them to make the connections needed to climb the corporate ladder, or for their bosses and managers to trust them with new projects.

If your co-worker has this character trait, they're "only going to support you to a restricted limit," Juliette Han, a Harvard-trained neuroscientist, told CNBC Make It in June 2023. "They need you to stay within a short leash, and might discourage you from meeting new people in the company or going after new projects if it doesn't benefit them directly."

That doesn't mean you should practice toxic optimism, pretending everything is fine when your team is facing difficult circumstances, for example. It's unnatural and unrealistic for someone to be happy all the time, Morris says. Similarly, a continuous negative spiral could be a signal that you're in the wrong job or company, she adds. 

There are a couple attributes that separate the most highly successful employees to those who fall short, says Morris.

She thinks highly of workers who "deliver what you are expecting at the time that you're expecting," she says. "You're better to deliver early than to deliver late, and you're better to deliver more than less."

"Another green flag is they're open to opportunities, and they put their hand up to take on more," she adds. "Or they bring a problem with the remedy or request help in a timely manner, as opposed to the house is on fire."

You can show you have this kind of team player, self-starter attitude by offering help even when you're not asked for it, like volunteering to mentor the new intern or pitching an idea that solves a problem your boss has been dealing with.

Demonstrating radical intellectual curiosity, like researching a new AI tool or a new software your competitors are using, then sharing your findings with your boss or manager, also goes a long way, according to Michael Ramlett, CEO of global data intelligence firm Morning Consult. 

And if you're willing to help your colleagues along the way, acting as a mentor and sharing the things you've learned, that's the icing on the cake, Morris says.

"People who you see are actually helping others [are a] total green flag."

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that India will pay a tariff of 25% beginning Aug. 1, in addition to a "penalty" for what he views as unfair trade policies and for India's purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia.

The 25% tariff rate is modestly lower than what he imposed on India on "liberation day," when he announced a 26% rate on the key trading partner.

But it's still on the higher end of what Trump appeared to be considering for India. Trump on Tuesday said he was considering a rate between 20% and 25%.

"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia's largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!" he continued.

"INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST," he said.

The White House did not respond to CNBC's request for comment on what the additional penalty might be.

India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry said the "government is studying" the implications of Trump's tariff announcement.

"India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months," the ministry said in a statement. "We remain committed to that objective." 

In a subsequent Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said, "WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!"

Trump has repeatedly said that the goal of his sweeping tariff regime is to dramatically cut the United States' trade deficit with other countries.

Economists have questioned this motive, however. They note that importing goods from countries with lower labor costs means that Americans can pay lower prices for finished products.

There is also deep uncertainty as to whether American workers would be willing or able to do the low-skilled and potentially dangerous jobs needed to produce the goods typically imported from overseas, like clothing, toys and chemicals.

Earlier this year, Trump went so far as to declare America's global trade deficit an emergency threat to national security in order to claim the legal authority to impose unilateral tariffs without consulting Congress.

Trump's plans to impose an additional "penalty" on India over its trade with Russia also comes as he has increased his rhetoric in recent weeks over President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

In an escalation earlier this month, the president threatened to implement secondary tariffs of 100% starting in early August on countries that buy Russian oil and gas, unless the Kremlin reaches a ceasefire deal with Ukraine.

China, India, Brazil and other major U.S. trade partners that rely on Russian energy would be hit particularly hard by a tariff like this.

Palo Alto Networks will take over Israeli identity security provider CyberArk in a deal valued at roughly $25 billion.

CyberArk shareholders, for each of their shares, will get $45 cash and 2.2005 shares of Palo Alto. The deal is expected to close during Palo Alto Networks' fiscal 2026.

Shares of Palo Alto fell 5% on Wednesday, building on a 5% loss from Tuesday. CyberArk's stock whipsawed.

Palo Alto Chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Wednesday that the company is entering the identity market as it hits an inflection point, which has always been its strategy.

"They are poised to go and disrupt this market and create the platform we need and also solve the upcoming problem with agentic AI," he said. "From all those factors, we believe this is the right time to do something like this and be ready for the market in the next 12 to 18 months."

Blockbuster cybersecurity deals have been a force in the mergers and acquisitions market in 2025 after a relatively slow period for deal-making. In March, Google shelled out $32 billion for cloud security startup Wiz in its biggest acquisition ever.

Palo Alto Networks intends to use the deal to officially penetrate the identity security market and improve its offering for customers. Arora told CNBC that Palo Alto's scale can help accelerate the reach of CyberArk's platform.

CyberArk, which went public a little over a decade ago, creates identity software tools that grant employees access to platforms and applications. Its biggest competitors in the space include Okta and Microsoft.

As artificial intelligence advances, these tools have become more critical to protecting businesses against cyber and ransomware threats.

Since taking the helm of the company in 2018, Arora has bolstered the cybersecurity provider's offerings and swelled its market value to roughly $120 billion.

This year, Palo Alto bought startup Protect AI for an undisclosed amount to improve its AI tools. The company acquired Talon Cyber Security, Dig Security and Zycada Networks in 2023.

Arora said he expects ongoing consolidation in the cybersecurity space over the next five years.

"Our job is to get this done, execute, deliver to the market and show our shareholders that we have the ability to execute these kinds of transactions, which I firmly believe we do," he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that both companies had discussed a potential deal, sending shares of CyberArk skyrocketing more than 13%.

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly framed the terms of the deal for CyberArk shareholders.

The U.S. economy grew at a much stronger-than-expected pace in the second quarter, powered by a turnaround in the trade balance and renewed consumer strength, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.

Gross domestic product, a sum of goods and services activity across the sprawling U.S. economy, jumped 3% for the April through June period, according to figures adjusted for seasonality and inflation.

That topped the Dow Jones estimate for 2.3% and helped reverse a decline of 0.5% for the first quarter that came largely due to a huge drop in imports, which subtract from the total, as well as weak consumer spending amid tariff concerns.

Financial markets reacted little to the report, with stock index futures mixed and Treasury yields higher.

"The word of the summer for the economy is 'resilient,'" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. "The consumer is hanging in there, but still on edge until the trade deals are done."

The period reported Wednesday includes President Donald Trump's April 2 "liberation day" tariff announcement. Imports had jumped in the first quarter as companies sought to get ahead of the announcement.

Over the past three months, Trump has been engaged in multiple rounds of saber-rattling and often intense negotiations with U.S. trading partners that have jangled nerves but nonetheless coincided with a subdued but solid pace of economic growth.

The talks have largely resulted in tariffs well above where they were at the beginning of the year but not as severe as initially proposed.

"The anti Trump story has been that we're going to have a recession or a depression because of the tariffs, which are going to jack up prices and cause consumers to run for the exits" Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, said on CNBC. "In fact, every single thing about this GDP release has shown strength."

Consumer spending rose 1.4% in the second quarter, better than the 0.5% in the prior period. While exports declined 1.8% during the period, imports fell 30.3%, reversing a 37.9% surge in Q1.

The GDP tally showed strength across key areas of the economy, as well as evidence that inflation is ebbing though not eradicated.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation metric, showed a gain of 2.1% for the quarter, just above the central bank's 2% target. Core PCE inflation, which the Fed considers a better gauge for longer-run trends as it excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 2.5%. The respective numbers for the first quarter were 3.7% and 3.5%.

The Fed meets later Wednesday and is expected to hold its key overnight borrowing rate steady in a 4.25%-4.5% range, where it has been since December.

Trump responded to the GDP report with a fresh demand for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.

"2Q GDP JUST OUT: 3%, WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED!" Trump posted on Truth Social. Using his nickname for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the president added "'Too Late' MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!"

There were some signs of a slowdown in the report.

Final sales to private domestic purchasers, a metric that Fed watches closely as a demand indicator, rose just 1.2%, down from the 1.9% increase in Q1 and the slowest gain since the fourth quarter of 2022. The decline in exports added more than 5 percentage points to the headline number, meaning the trend could reverse in the third quarter.

Trump has been complaining about high mortgage rates, which have held back the housing market. Residential investment fell 4.6% in Q2.

At the same time, GDP posted its strong rise without help from government spending. Federal outlays declined 3.7%, coming off a 4.6% drop in the first quarter. State and local government spending rose 3%.

While its megacap tech peers are bragging about building island-sized data centers filled with Nvidia chips to power artificial intelligence devices of the future, Apple remains largely on the sidelines.

Wall Street is getting concerned.

The iPhone maker is the second-worst performer this year among the so-called Magnificent Seven, with its stock down over 15% as of Tuesday's close. Tesla, down 20%, is the only other member of the group that's lost value in 2025.

Apple has disappointed its users and investors by declining to share more about its AI strategy, despite delaying the next generation of Siri until at least next year. Making matters worse, longtime Apple design chief Jony Ive in May sold his nascent startup IO for $6.5 billion to OpenAI. In the announcement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said his company is currently working on new hardware devices.

OpenAI's aggressive move underscores Apple's unclear role in the future of AI and its lack of a clear strategy when it comes to competing. Analysts worry that Apple's position could start to hurt iPhone sales, which are still happening in historic volumes.

"The incomplete AI strategy is still the biggest overhang, but we think Apple still has approximately 1.5 years to effect a compelling solution," TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note on Monday. He recommends buying the shares.

Don't expect Apple to dwell on its AI problem when it reports fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday. The company will likely be too busy talking about the $40 billion in iPhones it's expected to sell, per a FactSet estimate, and its profitable services business. Revenue in the services division is expected to show growth of about 11% to $26.8 billion, more than double the growth rate for the whole company.

Fortunately for Apple, it's built quite the moat against the threat of AI due to high user satisfaction with its products and its ability to lock in customers who own multiple Apple devices. So while AI could threaten Apple's spot as the most important computer hardware maker, the company has still got some time on its side.

Deepwater Asset Management founder Gene Munster says pressure for Apple in AI over the next year is minimized due to the ongoing strength of iPhones, Macs and the Apple Watch. And competitors like Google's Android haven't yet found a killer AI feature, Munster wrote in a recent report.

"With AI, the substance will exceed the hype, and this will be kind of a re-positioning, or a re-ranking of tech leadership," Munster said in June. "It's going to happen, but it's not going to happen this next year."

Apple has already lost an opportunity to capitalize on AI in the eyes of investors. In the summer of 2024, Apple released features that summarized emails and texts, generated images like emoji, and gave voice assistant Siri a visual redesign. It was collectively branded as Apple Intelligence.

However, the defining feature, a more versatile Siri, was delayed earlier this year until 2026.

Analysts initially hoped that the addition of Apple Intelligence might drive a "super cycle," or prompt people who would have typically held off on upgrading their iPhones to purchase new devices for the AI features. But the increased sales never came.

"We haven't seen that materialize in the way that the market had initially expected," said Visible Alpha Research analyst Melissa Otto.

Apple declined to comment.

The vast majority of people who got a new iPhone last year did so because their current device was no longer working, according to a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners poll. Only 13% of people polled this year said they made the purchase for new features, including AI. When polling those who got new phones earlier this year, about 89% of U.S. iPhone owners choose to upgrade to another Apple device, the firm found.

Apple is keenly aware of the future risks. Eddy Cue, head of the company's services business, said as much in a court case earlier this year.

"You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as it sounds," Cue said.

Apple's AI competition will likely come from two main sources. There's Google, which offers Android devices, and AI-powered gadgets that might not even include screens, relying instead on different kinds of input, such as voice assistants.

OpenAI has announced plans to release the latter, and startups have played with new kinds of form factors, such as pins, pendants and smart glasses like the Ray-Ban Meta device.

Google has been aggressively integrating its Gemini assistant into Android. Users of Android 16, the latest version of the operating system that powers Samsung and other phones, can use Gemini to control apps, including Google Maps and YouTube. Users can ask Gemini to create to-do lists based on YouTube app tutorials — capabilities that are currently far beyond what Siri can do.

Still, even Google CEO Sundar Pichai is saying that it may be a few years before any AI-oriented device would challenge the smartphone.

"I still expect phones to be at the center of the experience for the next two to three years at least," Pichai said during Alphabet's earnings call last week.

Apple has to get more aggressive in the AI race, said Needham analyst Laura Martin, on CNBC last week. Martin said Apple is one to two years behind competitors, including Google, in artificial intelligence.

"If Android is going to integrate all the latest Gemini and generative AI, the next time you replace your iPhone — a year from now, two years from now — that Android ecosystem is going to have more and more cool stuff in it, and then Apple starts losing its installed base," Martin said.

Perhaps Apple's biggest challenger in AI hardware will be OpenAI with the addition of Ive, who is credited with helping to design and launch the iPhone, Apple Watch and other key products.

But OpenAI hasn't given any timeline about its hardware launch, or even what it will be rolling out. It will likely take years before a product hits the market, and then the company has to figure out how to manufacture and ship hardware at scale.

When the iPhone was first announced in January 2007, it was a low-volume product for early adopters. Apple only sold 1.4 million iPhones in the first year, most of them in the fourth quarter, a tiny fraction of the more than 1.15 billion mobile phones sold that year, of which over 435 million were Nokia devices. Apple didn't introduce the App Store until 2008.

Four years later, Apple's unit sales had passed Blackberry maker RIM, as well as HTC, an early Android phone maker, and Motorola. By 2011, Nokia's sales had nosedived, and Apple had grown its business to sell more than 80 million iPhones per year.

Munster predicts that OpenAI's device will likely be unveiled next year and would start shipping to customers in 2026. Apple has some time, but the clock is ticking.

At age 54, Loren Greiff, an executive career coach and strategist, worked at one of the world's most well-respected executive search firms.

Her experience as an older worker inspired Greiff, who lives in Asheville, North Carolina, to found her own career coaching business — PortfolioRocket — in 2020.

Greiff, now 61, is looking to help executives over 40 take their next career step and avoid being put out to pasture. Since launching her business, Greiff has helped candidates land jobs at companies such as Meta, Target, Ford, and Dick's Sporting Goods.

After working with older employees over the past four years, Greiff told BI the problem isn't just ageism in organizations; negative beliefs held by the candidates themselves may keep them from reaching their career potential.

"The first belief — and also the biggest lie — is that they're powerless against ageism," Greiff said. Acknowledging the bias exists doesn't mean candidates don't have the agency to overcome it, the coach said.

Greiff said the second mistake many older job seekers make is believing buzzwords hiring managers may use, such as "overqualified," "too expensive," and "not a culture fit." Instead, she said, words like these may mask biases or deeper systemic issues in the organization.

In making her own job transition as an older candidate and guiding others in this age group through theirs, Greiff has devised job-search strategies that help over-40s combat negative thought patterns and direct ageism during applications and interviews.

She emphasized that older employees need to repackage their deep work experience using these five strategies:

Greiff shared that many older candidates she'd coached assumed that work experience and career relevance were one and the same. But she said two decades of experience might be worth less to employers than someone else's two years if a candidate can't show they've been building value.

"Experience is time; relevance speaks to the impact to lead and drive for now and what's next," she said.

"Decision makers seek agility and willingness to learn outside of what you already know," Greiff added, saying candidates shouldn't rely on their time in a role to speak for itself. "Start addressing the underlying issues decision makers are concerned about most."

Greiff said decision makers aren't scrolling LinkedIn to verify your past — they're hunting for clues about your present.

"Do you think like someone who gets it? Do you engage like someone who's still in the game? Do you comment like someone who sees around corners?" she asked. "The market cares less about what you've done. It cares more for what you're doing."

While it feels natural to use the past tense in résumés since the work experience section highlights prior positions, Greiff emphasized that doing so can be a career killer.

"This is positioning you as a 'has-been' akin to an obit, sending a signal that your best days are over," she said.

Instead of writing, "Created new growth channels and elevated brand health from #5 to #2," Greiff recommends keeping yourself more relevant and present tense with phrasing like, "Revenue and partnership growth expander, systematically advancing global brand health from bottom-tier to near-leadership status."

Even when describing something you achieved in a previous job, Greiff advises integrating metrics that point to the future to avoid appearing like old news.

"Stop giving them reasons to worry about your value or impact and start giving them reasons to buy it — numbers don't lie, and they don't age," she said. "Don't say '20 years in tech.' Say, 'Company transformer through AI integration, most recently reducing costs by 40%.'"

She said older candidates should provide numbers to address a hiring team's spoken or unspoken fears. Be prepared to provide data-driven proof of your ability to continue delivering measurable results and share ROI figures that show you're worth what you cost.

It's vital in many industries to demonstrate that you value lifelong learning and development, which points to your future impact.

Greiff stressed that it's fair — and savvy — to consider experiences you've had outside the workplace as part of this dialogue. She shared that a client in her early 50s was applying for C-suite roles, and leveraged that she'd recently climbed Mount Kilimanjaro during her executive job search.

"In every networking conversation, her mountain stories became a metaphor for her agility and capabilities," Greiff said. "Anyone can take a course, but it takes unique character to train and climb a serious mountain like Mount Kilimanjaro."

It's also important for senior-level job seekers to show their true career growth through their work history.

Another one of Greiff's clients originally felt like he'd aged out of the tech industry. He decided to package his career evolution, including his freelance work, as an asset.

"While other 40-plus creatives were ashamed of their freelance patchwork, he showcased every single gig — 22 of them — on LinkedIn," Greiff said. "Most older workers think job-hopping makes you look like you're inconsistent or can't hold down a job, but he made it look like he wasn't bouncing around — he was building."

As a result, hiring managers didn't see him as a washed-up applicant but someone who was committed to evolving his craft, and he got an offer from a Big Tech company.

"Energy beats experience when packaged right," Greiff said. "Age becomes irrelevant when your value becomes undeniable."

Microsoft pay guidelines obtained by Business Insider reveal how much the software giant generally will pay technical talent, shedding light on an opaque hiring process.

The documents, last updated in May, do come with a carve-out: In competitive situations, recruiters can seek approval for higher offers for exceptional candidates.

That's a key caveat considering big tech companies are in an all-out battle for AI talent, with some offering staggering pay packages to engineers and researchers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta is offering engineers $100 million signing bonuses. Meta also reportedly poached a former top Apple AI engineer with a pay package worth more than $200 million.

Microsoft has a level system to denote seniority. Levels 57 to 59 are generally considered entry-level engineers, while senior engineers begin at level 63, and principal-level engineers begin at level 65. The higher levels are more rare. Partners start at level 68 while distinguished engineers are at level 70.

According to the documents, Level 70 candidates can earn a yearly salary of as much as $408,000, depending on location. Their compensation would also include a one-time stock award upon hiring of as much as $1.9 million and could include an additional signing bonus, though a range isn't specified. Their future compensation would include an annual stock award worth as much as $1,476,000, according to the documents.

Microsoft has different salary ranges for different locations. For example, there's a "main" pay range for workers at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters, along with a "high" pay range for workers in higher cost-of-living areas such as San Francisco. Most of Microsoft's hiring happens in these locations, according to a person familiar with the hiring process.

The packages outlined in these documents include ranges for salaries, on-hire stock awards, signing bonuses, annual stock awards, and percentages for annual bonuses based on levels.

Microsoft declined to comment.

Microsoft's leveling system indicates seniority for engineers and other talent. Lower levels can include entry-level engineers, while higher levels include senior engineers and principal-level engineers. See the list below for the different levels and the compensation ranges.

Google on Wednesday said it will sign the European Union's guidelines on artificial intelligence, which Meta previously rebuffed due to concerns they could stifle innovation.

In a blog post, Google said it planned to sign the code in the hope that it would promote European citizens' access to advanced new AI tools, as they become available.

Google's endorsement comes after Meta recently said it would refuse to sign the code over concerns that it could constrain European AI innovation.

"Prompt and widespread deployment is important," Kent Walker, president of global affairs of Google, said in the post, adding that embracing AI could boost Europe's economy by 1.4 trillion euros ($1.62 trillion) annually by 2034.

The European Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, published a final iteration of its code of practice for general-purpose AI models, leaving it up to companies to decide if they want to sign.

The guidelines lay out how to meet the requirements of the EU AI Act, a landmark law overseeing the technology, when it comes to transparency, safety, and security.

However, Google also flagged fears over the potential for the guidelines to slow technological advances around AI.

"We remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe's development and deployment of AI," Kent Walker, president of global affairs of Google, said in the post Wednesday.

"In particular, departures from EU copyright law, steps that slow approvals, or requirements that expose trade secrets could chill European model development and deployment, harming Europe's competitiveness."

Earlier this month, Meta declined to sign the EU AI code of practice, calling it an overreach that would "stunt" the industry.

"Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI," Joel Kaplan, Meta's global affairs chief, wrote in a LinkedIn post at the time. "This code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act."

Tsunami waves have reached California and Hawaii several hours after a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Russia's Far East.

The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said Wednesday morning that tsunami waves measuring 1.6 feet above tide level have been observed in Arena Cove in the U.S. state of California.

In Hawaii, tsunami waves of up to 4.9 feet above tide level were registered although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said available data suggests a major tsunami is not expected to strike the island state.

"A strong earthquake in the Pacific Basin has generated a tsunami wave. Tsunami Warnings and Advisories have been issued for Hawaii, portions of Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, and the West Coast of the U.S.," the U.S. National Weather Service warned earlier Wednesday.

The NWS told people in the affected states to follow instructions from government agencies and to be observant and exercise caution if they are near or in the ocean.

It warned that sea level changes and strong currents are still possible close to the shore and in harbors and marinas. It added that officials are assessing damage but have not reopened coastal evacuation areas and warned residents to stay clear of these areas.

The advisories came after a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The quake triggered tsunami warnings in Japan and several states in the western United States, including Hawaii, Alaska and California.

The earthquake sparked evacuation orders in Hawaii and Japan. The U.S. Coast Guard also ordered commercial vessels in harbors in Hawaii to evacuate.

So far, Hawaii has "not seen a wave of consequence, which is a great relief to us," Hawaiian Gov. Josh Green told reporters during a news conference. He said Hawaii registered two waves through the Midway Atoll, one measuring 30 centimeters (12 inches) and the other 3 feet, he said.

Green added that there was no major wave activity that was noticed past the "Big Island," and that the state wouldn't be "all clear" until two to three hours later. The conference was held at 8:20 p.m. local time.

Japan issued tsunami warnings for much of its eastern coastline, and lower-level advisories in other parts of the country, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

The agency estimated that a tsunami would strike Hokkaido, the area of Japan that is closest to the quake's epicenter, at 10 a.m. Japan local time, with an estimated maximum height of 3 meters.

Kiyomoto Masashi, an official from the Japan Meteorological Agency, cautioned people in coastal areas to move to higher ground, adding that tsunamis can occur for more than a day after the quake, according to local media.

A tsunami that averaged 3 meters to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) was recorded in Kamchatka, Reuters reported, citing a Russian official.

Waves in Japan have been smaller, ranging from 30 centimeters to 1.3 meters, with the highest at Kuji Port in Iwate prefecture, according to Japanese national broadcaster NHK Japan.

Several flights to Hawaii have returned to the U.S. mainland or been diverted, according to Hawaiian local media, citing a joint statement made by Hawaiian Airlines and Alaskan Airlines. Other flights have been put on hold as the carriers await more information, it said.

"We are monitoring a tsunami warning for the Hawaiian Islands and portions of the state of Alaska and assessing our flight operations. We are holding flight departures to the Islands on Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines," the carriers said in a joint statement, according to Hawaii News Now.

All flights in and out of the Hawaiian island of Maui have been canceled, Green said during the news conference.

A tsunami is a series of long ocean waves, with crests that can last from five to 15 minutes or longer, according to the Hawaii's Maui County website.

"The danger may persist for many more hours ... Tsunami waves efficiently wrap around islands so all shores are at risk no matter which direction they face," it states.

Elon Musk says he has banished the job title "researcher" from his AI startup, xAI.

The distinction between researcher and engineer is a "thinly masked way of describing a two-tier engineering system," Musk wrote in an X post on Tuesday.

"There are only engineers," Musk said."Researcher is a relic term from academia."

Musk then drew a comparison to his rocket company, SpaceX, which he said did more "meaningful, cutting-edge" research on rockets and satellites than "all the academic university labs on earth combined."

"But we don't use the pretentious, low-accountability term 'researcher,'" Musk said.

xAI did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

OpenAI, which Musk co-founded with Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in 2015, uses a similar naming approach for its technical hires.

Brockman, the president of OpenAI, wrote in an X post in February 2023 that they did not want to "bucket people into researchers and engineers" and "thought hard about what job titles to use." OpenAI later decided to use the term "Member of Technical Staff."

Brockman said the term was first used by Xerox PARC, a research laboratory known for its pioneering innovations, such as the mouse and the graphical user interface used on computers.

Anthropic, a company founded by former OpenAI employees, said on its website that its "research and engineering hires all share a single title — 'Member of Technical Staff.'" The company said it listed its engineers as authors on their research papers, "often as first author."

"While there's historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models," Anthropic wrote on its career page.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's edition of CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

From startups to tech giants, Chinese companies are finding business demand for their artificial intelligence services, even as AI models elsewhere keep burning cash.

AI can now resolve more than 80% of online customer questions at Toyota's joint venture with Chinese state-owned carmaker FAW, more than twice as many as it could address half a year ago, Wu Yongjian, vice president at Tencent Cloud, told me on Friday. Tencent provides some AI tools to the automakers.

And now it only takes around two weeks to get Tencent's AI customer-service platform up and running, down from up to three months, Wu told me, as we sat inside the company's shiny new office in an up-and-coming Shanghai waterfront district.

Over the weekend, Tencent announced an upgrade to its Hunyuan AI model alongside releases by other companies as the "World AI Conference" got underway in the city.

While not every company is seeing a similar demand for their products and services, the focus on business opportunities reflects a shift underway in China in capturing the AI opportunity. And that's also reflected in job applications.

Zhou Yuxiang, CEO of Temasek-backed startup Black Lake Technologies, told me on Saturday that in the last few months he's been getting resumes from AI model engineers who want to shift into developing AI for specific industry applications. "Before it was hard to get AI engineers," he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

Black Lake primarily sells AI tools to small factories in China to help them speed up production and better utilize capacity.

Many of the business owners are experiencing "FOMO" right now because they missed out on the direct-to-consumer e-commerce boom of the past few years, Zhou said, adding that the cost to use AI has also dropped significantly.

Z.ai, formerly Zhipu, on Monday became the latest Chinese startup to slash operating costs with an open-source AI model release. Its pricing undercut Alibaba-backed startup Moonshot's Kimi K2 model released earlier this month, and DeepSeek's R1 in January, which offered lower rates compared with what industry leader OpenAI was charging people to use ChatGPT.

Open source AI models can be used for free, and even altered and distributed, without special permission from the creator. Users who opt not to download the model can access them via the cloud and pay per use.

Many businesses are realizing they need to have better data in order to apply AI effectively. It's a foundational layer that's seeing huge demand, just like chips, even if monetization of the AI application takes time.

Chinese startup DeepExi, backed by venture capital firms Hillhouse and BAI, says its AI system combines business-specific data analysis with AI models to "deliver zero hallucination outputs." That means the system does not make up results, as generative AI models are quite prone to do. CNBC was unable to independently verify the claim.

DeepExi lists clients such as Han's Laser Technology and an unnamed public healthcare operator "that oversees 40 public hospitals and 100 clinics."

The startup's revenue surged by 88.3% to 242.9 million yuan last year, DeepExi said in an April filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for a planned listing.

Data labeling, or annotating bits of information for better AI use, is also seeing surging demand.

Beijing-based Haitian Ruisheng last week estimated its revenue in the first half of 2025 grew by at least 61% from a year ago to 148.9 million yuan. Its revenue in 2024 was nearly 240 million yuan.

After excluding items, profit is expected to have more than doubled to between 4.5 million yuan and 4.9 million yuan in the first half of the year, according to the company's filing with the Shanghai stock exchange.

Haitian Ruisheng counts ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and several U.S. "Magnificent 7" companies such as Microsoft and Amazon as clients, Zhang Zhe, the company's secretary to the board, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

In China, the company sees the greatest monetization opportunities in education, healthcare and tourism, Zhang said, adding that there was also potential in smartphones and "embodied intelligence" — a category that includes robots.

Haitian Ruisheng combines automated data annotation with evaluation by human experts, Zhang said, adding that AI requires global cooperation and his company was eying overseas markets, with a subsidiary in Singapore.

Just days after the U.S. unveiled its AI action plan, the Shanghai-based "World AI Conference" opened Saturday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang announcing plans for a global AI cooperation organization. China called for supporting AI integration across industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, education and agriculture.

Tencent has already taken steps in that direction.

It has local partnership in Japan for a "virtual human service" that domestic businesses can purchase, Wu said. That's a digital avatar of a human, often used for livestreaming and other digital content.

Other popular AI business lines in regions such as Southeast Asia include "know your customer" identification verification for finance, translation services as well as a platform for developers to develop AI agents, Wu said.

With these business projects — and broader state-backed ambitions — China has clearly gone beyond the labs in the global AI race.

Starbucks' grab-and-go stores are on the way out.

On Tuesday, the coffee store chain announced that it's discontinuing its mobile order-only store model.

Around 80 to 90 pickup-only locations in the US, many of which are located in office buildings and offer no seating, will be phased out, said CEO Brian Niccol. Some will be converted into full-service stores with room to linger.

"These stores felt too transactional and didn't deliver the warmth or human connection our customers expect," Niccol told investors on the third-quarter earnings call.

Earlier this year, Niccol said that mobile ordering has "chipped away" at the brand's soul. On a podcast that aired in February, he said he thought mobile orders negatively affected the brand's connection with customers.

A Starbucks spokeswoman declined to comment, including on how much the store renovations would cost.

The company has also been working with CloudKitchens, the ghost kitchen company run by Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick, to broaden Starbucks' network in locations like San Francisco, Business Insider reported in 2023. These ghost kitchens, with private kitchens and no corporate storefronts, get Starbucks orders out on platforms like DoorDash to lessen the burden on brick-and-mortar stores.

Starbucks announced on Tuesday that it is developing a new "coffeehouse of the future" prototype that includes 32 seats and a drive-thru, which it plans to debut in the company's next fiscal year. Starbucks is investing $500 million over the next year to bolster staffing and improve in-store wait times.

The changes come as Starbucks tries to boost sales — same-store sales dropped for a sixth quarter in a row. Niccol, who took over as CEO last year, has issued memos telling employees to spend more time in the office as part of his effort to "turn things around."

On Tuesday's call, Niccol said unpredictable coffee prices and ongoing pressure from tariffs may mean challenging financials until 2026. He said that "momentum is building" and that the company is "ahead of schedule."

Throughout the day, Starbucks shares dipped on Q3 earnings that came in below analyst expectations, but rose around 3% in after-hours trading. Shares are flat this year.

Price changes are the last resort for Starbucks' CEO, Brian Niccol, he said on Tuesday's Q3 earnings call, but he won't rule them out as part of his revitalization efforts of the coffee giant.

A quick-service restaurant veteran, Niccol has led successful revitalization campaigns at Taco Bell and Chipotle. His "Back to Starbucks" campaign is proceeding ahead of schedule, the CEO told investors on Tuesday.

"But with that said, you know, pricing will be a part of our business model," he added. "There are times where it makes sense to take some price — and when those situations present itself, we're going to do it in the least amount of pricing necessary. I prefer to always hold back on that one as much as possible. So will we have to use it in the future? Absolutely — it's going to be the last lever I'd like to pull. And when we pull that lever, I probably want to do as little as possible."

Since Niccol took over, Starbucks has already implemented changes to its pricing model. The company has removed surcharges for non-dairy milk substitutes and changed the pricing structure for syrups and powder add-ins.

It is unclear when any additional price changes may take place or what menu items may be affected. A spokesperson for Starbucks declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.

Niccol's comments on changes to the menu prices came as Starbucks reported a decline in sales for the sixth consecutive quarter while the company continues its turnaround plan.

Global comparable store sales declined 2% overall, driven by a 2% decline in comparable transactions, according to Starbucks' Q3 earnings report. The decline was partially offset by a 1% increase in the average ticket price. Most of the decrease was seen in North American markets, as international comparable store sales were mostly flat.

The company's revenue — up 4% to $9.5 billion — beat analysts' tepid expectations, Reuters reported. However, it missed on earnings, with an adjusted EPS of $0.50, a 46% decline over the prior year, missing estimates of 65 cents, the outlet reported.

Starbucks' stock increased more than 3.5% in after-hours trading following the earnings call.

"While our financial results don't yet reflect all the progress we've made, the signs are clear — we're gaining momentum," CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement included in the report. "Our 'Back to Starbucks' plan is working. It's grounded in what makes us Starbucks: handcrafted beverages, welcoming coffeehouses, and the human connection that brings it all together."

Niccol's preferred turnaround method starts with customer service, making the chain's new Green Apron Service model the heart of the revitalization campaign. Niccol and CFO Kathy Smith said on the call that the foundational operating model, focused on crafting cravable coffees and enhancing consumer connection, is being rolled out early across stores nationwide after being tested in pilot stores.

Coffee houses already using Green Apron Service techniques have driven improvements in transactions, sales, and customer service times, outperforming the broader North American portfolio, Niccol said Tuesday.

Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" campaign, which he launched upon taking over last September, aims to improve slumping sales and customer experience complaints that have plagued the international coffee giant.

Starbucks has since rolled out a series of changes in-store, including remodeling stores with comfy chairs and ceramic dishes to encourage visitors to stay longer, bringing back the self-serve condiment bar, and asking baristas to hand-write smiley faces and inspirational messages on to-go orders.

On the corporate side, the company has cracked down on its return-to-office mandate, requiring most support staff to work from the Seattle headquarters or Toronto office four days a week — or leave the company, Business Insider previously reported.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a Layer-2 altcoin, is attracting significant investor attention as its initial coin offering (ICO) approaches $6 million in total presale capital raised. The project is positioning itself as a high-potential asset in the AI cryptocurrency sector, with some observers suggesting it could deliver 100x returns by August 2025 [1]. The presale, which has already surpassed $5.8 million in funding as of late July 2025, reflects strong interest from both retail and institutional participants [2]. HYPER aims to improve the scalability of the Bitcoin network through faster transactions and lower fees, aligning with growing demand for Layer-2 solutions that facilitate broader blockchain adoption [2].

The altcoin's rapid fundraising progress highlights a shift in investor sentiment toward innovative projects that combine blockchain with AI technologies. Analysts have pointed out that HYPER's integration of AI could provide distinct advantages over traditional altcoins, potentially opening up new use cases and setting performance benchmarks [3]. These features have contributed to HYPER's emergence as a key player in the Layer-2 space, where it is being closely watched as a potential indicator of the AI crypto sector's overall momentum [1].

Despite HYPER's strong performance, it is important to note that forecasts of 100x returns are speculative and not guaranteed [2]. The broader cryptocurrency market has shown mixed signals, with the total market cap declining by 3.8% on July 30, 2025 [4]. While HYPER and similar AI-driven projects stand out, traditional assets like Ethereum and spot ETH ETFs continue to show resilience, with the latter experiencing net inflows for 18 consecutive days [4]. This divergence underscores the fragmented nature of the digital asset market, where niche innovations are gaining traction even as overall volatility persists.

HYPER's fundraising phase is set to conclude in early August, after which the project plans to proceed with a token listing and broader market entry [2]. The project's success reflects broader trends in the crypto space, where Layer-2 solutions and AI-focused initiatives are increasingly viewed as critical to the next phase of blockchain development. However, as with all speculative crypto investments, potential investors are advised to approach such opportunities with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before committing capital.

In a move that could reshape the future of digital assets in the U.S., President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency working group has released a sweeping set of proposals aimed at accelerating innovation in digital finance. The report, unveiled on Wednesday, urges federal regulators to clarify rules on trading digital assets and streamline the adoption of new financial products, signaling a pro-crypto stance from the administration. Drawing from executive actions earlier this year, including the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the group emphasizes regulatory clarity to position America as a global leader in blockchain technology.

The recommendations come at a pivotal time, with cryptocurrency markets surging amid growing institutional interest. The working group, formed under a January executive order, includes industry figures like David Sacks and focuses on dismantling bureaucratic hurdles that have long stifled decentralized finance (DeFi) growth.

Regulatory Clarity Takes Center Stage

Central to the proposals is a call for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to collaborate on defining digital assets as securities, commodities, or collectibles. This push for “safe harbors” and regulatory sandboxes would allow innovative products to reach consumers without endless delays, according to details in the report covered by Bloomberg. Insiders note that such measures could unlock billions in institutional capital, particularly for stablecoins and tokenized assets.

The group also advocates fast-tracking the GENIUS Act, legislation designed to provide clear guidelines for stablecoin issuance and adoption. This builds on Trump's earlier ban on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), positioning private-sector innovations as the preferred path forward.

Pushing for a National Crypto Stockpile

Echoing the administration's March fact sheet on establishing a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, the new proposals explore expanding a national reserve of Bitcoin and other assets. A White House release, as reported in White House fact sheets, highlights this as a strategic move to bolster economic security, akin to oil reserves. The working group suggests regulatory frameworks that encourage federal investment in digital assets, potentially including tokenized Treasuries on permissioned blockchains like XRP.

Recent posts on X reflect enthusiastic sentiment, with users praising the potential for nationwide crypto trading and DeFi expansion. For instance, discussions emphasize how these reforms could enable banks to settle transactions in seconds, weakening traditional financial monopolies.

Implications for DeFi and Web3 Innovation

The report's blueprint for Web3 reforms, detailed in coverage from Crypto Economy, envisions a “golden age of crypto” by integrating blockchain into mainstream finance. Proposals include easing custody rules for digital assets and promoting direct SEC-CFTC oversight to simplify market structures.

Industry experts warn, however, that implementation will require congressional buy-in, especially for legislative proposals tied to the stockpile. As per insights from The Block, the group recommends prohibiting agencies from advancing CBDCs while prioritizing permissionless coins like Bitcoin as “digital gold.”

Global Competitiveness and Risks Ahead

Trump's vision, articulated in a January executive order reported by Reuters, aims to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” The latest proposals reinforce this by calling for international cooperation on digital finance standards, potentially countering China's advancements in blockchain.

Yet, challenges loom: volatility in crypto markets and regulatory risks could undermine adoption. Posts on X highlight optimism around XRP and other assets, but also underscore the need for balanced oversight to prevent fraud. As the administration pushes these reforms, the focus remains on fostering innovation without compromising financial stability, setting the stage for a transformative era in American digital finance.

The Bank of Korea (BOK) has renamed its Digital Currency Research Lab, removing the word “research” from the title, and established a Virtual Asset Committee to address stablecoin legislation. This week the ruling and opposition parties tabled separate stablecoin bills.

“We wanted to make it clear that this is not a department that only does research,” a BOK official said, according to Yonhap News. “There will not be much change in the original work.”

Several Korean media outlets reported that the Bank of Korea suspended Project Han River, its wholesale central bank digital currency and tokenized deposit initiative, following resistance from participating banks. These seven financial institutions are now forming a consortium to launch their own stablecoins, capitalizing on recent government initiatives that will expand stablecoin issuance opportunities.

The central bank argued that Project Han deposit tokens differ little from proposed stablecoins, except that banks serve as issuers. The initiative combined bank deposit tokens with a wholesale CBDC for interbank settlement.

When the Bank of Korea first unveiled Project Han, it promoted the concept as a CBDC despite not being a retail CBDC. Brazil's central bank took a similar approach. This positioning could create confusion with retail CBDC initiatives in Korea, particularly given high profile pushback against retail CBDCs in the United States.

Both major political parties tabled stablecoin bills this week with key differences that will be explored in a subsequent article. One bill supports interest bearing stablecoins while the other does not.

“Stablecoins are surging like a tsunami, but we are fighting over who will run a small boat in the face of a tsunami,” said Min Byung-duk, who chairs the ruling party's Special Committee on Digital Assets, according to the Financial Times.

The central bank has raised financial stability concerns and seeks a supervisory role over stablecoins. It would prefer limiting issuance to banks, which appears unlikely.

Other commentators highlighted issues including the international valuation of the won. The currency is not currently traded offshore and has limited trading hours. Issuing a won denominated stablecoin would immediately enable 24/7 global trading. While many won foreign exchange controls have been relaxed, restrictions still persist.

“If digital won trading expands in an unregulated global crypto market while the currency remains nonconvertible, the risk of exchange rate volatility could grow,” wrote Professor Park Sun-Young in the Korean JoongAng Daily.

She mentioned risks of speculative exchange rate attacks by non residents, potentially undermining government exchange rate control policy and impacting Korea's monetary policy.

However, governments appear compelled to respond quickly to America's Genius Act for stablecoins. While this may seem risky, as Min Byung-duk noted, the won is a small boat. It remains to be seen whether any issuance will reach sufficient scale to impact monetary or exchange rate policies.

 Bitcoin's tight consolidation just below $120,000 suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate an uptick in volatility. 

Key points:

Bitcoin remains stuck in a narrow range, suggesting a breakout could be around the corner.

The FOMC minutes and Federal Reserve interest rate decision could set the tone for crypto's next steps. 

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade near the $120,000 resistance, indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure. Although Bitcoin is on a strong wicket, the up move may face seasonal headwinds. According to Axel Adler Jr., BTC has recorded an average return of just 2.56% in August in the past 13 years.

However, near-term uncertainty or August's historical weakness has not stopped Strategy from buying more BTC. The firm said on Tuesday that it had acquired 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256, boosting its total holding to 628,791 BTC.

As BTC consolidates, Ether (ETH) and BNB (BNB) have been gaining ground. Glassnode said in a post on X that ETH's perpetual futures volume dominance has surpassed BTC, marking the “largest volume skew” on record. The “shift confirms a meaningful rotation of speculative interest toward the altcoin sector,” the analytics platform added.

Could BTC break out of its range? Will select altcoins continue their bull run? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

BTC continues to trade inside a tight range between $115,000 and $120,000. The longer the price stays inside a narrow range, the larger the eventual breakout from it.

The upsloping 20-day simple moving average ($118,313) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive the price above $120,000, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to a new all-time high above $123,218. The pair may then ascend to $135,000.

Conversely, a break and close below $115,000 suggests the bears have overpowered the bulls. That could sink the price to $110,530. This is a vital support to keep an eye on because a break below it opens the gates for a drop to $100,000.

ETH is trying to maintain above the breakout level of $3,745, signaling that the bulls are not hurrying to book profits as they anticipate another leg higher.

If the price rebounds off the $3,745 support, the ETH/USDT pair could reach the overhead resistance at $4,094. Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge at $4,094, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket toward $4,868.

Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $3,745, it suggests that the bulls have given up. That could tug the price to the 20-day SMA ($3,516), where the buyers are expected to step in. If the price rebounds off the 20-day SMA with strength, the bulls will again try to pierce the overhead resistance.

XRP (XRP) is witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day SMA ($3.16).

If the price skids below the $3.05 support, the next stop is likely to be $2.95. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2.95 level because a break below it could start a deeper correction toward $2.65.

Alternatively, a strong rebound off the $2.95 level suggests solid demand at lower levels. The 20-day SMA could act as a resistance on the way up, but if the bulls overcome it, the XRP/USDT pair may climb to $3.33 and, after that, to $3.66.

BNB has pulled back to the breakout level of $794, which is a crucial support to watch out for. 

If the price rebounds off $794 with strength, it suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could retest the all-time high of $861. A break and close above $861 could start the next leg of the uptrend to $900.

On the contrary, a break and close below the $794 level signals profit-booking by short-term buyers. The pair could then dip to the 20-day SMA ($751), which is likely to attract buyers. Sellers will have to yank the pair below the 20-day SMA to gain the upper hand.

Solana (SOL) has pulled back to the 20-day SMA ($178), which is likely to act as solid support.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day SMA with strength, the bulls will again try to push the SOL/USDT pair toward the overhead resistance of $209. A break and close above $209 could open the doors for a rally to $240. There is minor resistance at $220, but it is likely to be crossed.

Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day SMA could tug the price to the 50-day SMA ($160). That suggests the pair may extend its stay inside the large range between $110 and $209 for a few more days.

Dogecoin (DOGE) turned down from $0.25 on Monday and broke below the 20-day SMA ($0.22) on Tuesday, indicating selling on rallies.

The next support is at $0.21. If the price bounces off $0.21 and breaks above the 20-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the DOGE/USDT pair to $0.26 and later to $0.29. Sellers are expected to defend the $0.29 level with all their might because a close above it could propel the pair to $0.35 and then to $0.44.

On the other hand, a break and close below $0.21 could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). That suggests the pair may remain inside the large $0.14 to $0.29 range for a while longer.

Cardano (ADA) slipped below the 20-day SMA ($0.79) on Tuesday, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge.

There is support at $0.76, but if the level breaks down, the ADA/USDT pair could extend the correction to $0.73 and then to the 50-day SMA ($0.67). Such a fall suggests that the pair may remain inside the $0.50 to $0.86 range for a while.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day SMA. That suggests a lack of aggressive selling at lower levels. The bulls will then try to push the pair above the $0.86 resistance.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been stuck between the support line of the ascending channel and the 20-day SMA ($45.13).

The failure of the bulls to push the price above the 20-day SMA increases the risk of a break below the support line. If that happens, the HYPE/USDT pair could correct to $36 and subsequently to $32.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and rises above the 20-day SMA. The pair may then climb to the $48 to $49.87 overhead resistance zone.

Stellar (XLM) plunged below the 20-day SMA ($0.44) on Monday, and the bears defended the level during a retest on Tuesday.

Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below $0.40. If they manage to do that, the XLM/USDT pair could decline to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.37 and then to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.34. 

Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to make a comeback by pushing the price above $0.46. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the overhead resistance of $0.52. The next leg of the rally to $0.64 could begin on a close above $0.52. 

Sui (SUI) rose above the $4.30 resistance on Sunday, but the breakout proved to be a bull trap as the price turned down sharply on Monday.

The bears are trying to sustain the price below the 20-day SMA ($3.85). If they do that, the SUI/USDT pair could drop to $3.51. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $3.51 and the 50-day SMA ($3.27).

If the price turns up from $3.51 and breaks above the 20-day SMA, it suggests a possible range formation. The pair may swing between $3.51 and $4.30 for some time. A break and close above $4.30 could start a new uptrend toward $5.

In late 2024, US regulators put an end to a longstanding fight between banks and technology companies over control of their customers' financial data: Customers have the right to demand, download and transfer their data, for free, per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's landmark open banking rule.

Less than 10 months later, policymakers say they're going back to the drawing board, the country's biggest bank is planning to charge for access to customers' data, and executives at some of the biggest financial technology companies, crypto firms and retailers are furious. 

“I thought we were done with this one, but here we are again,” said Leigh Phillips, chief executive officer of the nonprofit SaverLife, which runs an app that accesses its users' bank data to reward them for saving. If new fees trickle down to the organization's hundreds of thousands of mostly low-income members, “it's not a marginal effect,” she said. “Our families are really struggling, so anything that increases costs or your risk of fees is a big deal.” 

The CFPB said in a court filing Tuesday that it would reconsider the open banking rule, less than three weeks after Bloomberg reported JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s plan to start charging tech firms for access to customers' data. The move — and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.'s subsequent announcement that it would consider similar charges — sent shock waves through the digital world, which relies on that flow of information to power almost every consumer financial app on the market. 

App developers hustled to understand the consequences for their business models. Investors recoiled, sending shares in the biggest fintech companies falling by as much as 6.5%. Cryptocurrency partisans at the highest levels of President Donald Trump's administration warned of its innovation-stifling consequences.   

Across the industry, there's widespread agreement – in theory – that consumers should control who accesses their data and when. But in practice, that information flow is subject to regulation and to the ongoing maintenance of a digital infrastructure, for which the banks currently bear the cost. 

They paint the data aggregation services as freeloaders. Companies like Plaid Inc. and MX Technologies Inc., along with others owned by Stripe Inc., Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., provide the digital tools that deliver customers' data from the banks to almost every financial technology app on the market, a business model that, the banks say, takes advantage of their investments in infrastructure and compliance for their own profit. 

“Data middlemen endlessly access our customers' data for free — 90% of the time without a customer request — and then charge third parties for that same data,” a JPMorgan spokesperson said in an emailed statement. 

Tech firms and consumer advocates disagree, saying that banks have to facilitate the information flow as part of their responsibility to customers, akin to the way a patient can direct her doctor to share her health records with other providers at any time, for any reason.

JPMorgan plans to start charging the data aggregators within months. Those firms could quickly shift any increased costs to clients, who will in turn have to figure out whether and how much to pass on to users. Across the industry, it could total hundreds of millions of dollars. 

“The fee is the first step,” said Dan Quan, a former CFPB official and now general partner of NevCaut Ventures. “Ultimately, this is about who's the boss. The next thing is about controlling the access.”

Banks and tech companies have been sparring over access to customers' data for at least a decade. In the early days, apps would collect users' bank or credit card login credentials, then funnel it to aggregators like Plaid or Yodlee, which used it to scrape and structure users' data and pipe it back to the app.  

For consumers, and the growing financial technology industry, the availability of the data opened the door to all kinds of new applications. But the banks complained about the potential for fraud inherent in customers sharing their credentials with a third party. They also realized that some of the fintechs were offering services – overdraft alerts, for example, or high-yield savings – that threatened parts of the big banks' businesses. 

The technology, and the growth of the app economy, outpaced the banks' objections. Roughly half of US consumers have interacted with Plaid at some point. In April, it raised $575 million in fresh capital at a valuation of $6.1 billion. 

The bank now receives around 2 billion “data calls” each month, according to people familiar with the firm's operations but not authorized to speak publicly about them. The digital inquiries originate when Robinhood Markets Inc., Coinbase Global Inc., Wealthfront or any of the hundreds of other fintechs verify a user's account balance or track transactions. 

As of now, the fintechs pay the aggregators for each data call, with fees that could be as high as $1.25 to link a new customer's accounts and as low as 5 cents to check a balance, according to estimates in a July 14 note by UBS analysts.

JPMorgan plans to create a similar fee structure, charging the aggregators for each call. Rates and terms seem negotiable — the bank announced plans to offer customers a direct link to Coinbase — but in at least one case, the proposed pricing exceeds transaction revenue by 1,000%, according to a person who'd seen the terms. 

For smaller companies, particularly those that provide financial advice or budgeting apps, higher costs for data could upend their entire businesses, Quan said. “If you're in that kind of business, you're dead,” he said. “You can't afford to do that.”

Many other banks are considering whether to follow JPMorgan. Capital One Financial Corp. declined to comment but previously pushed for the “recoupment of reasonable costs.” A Bank of America Corp. spokesperson said its clients “own their data and should control how, when and by whom it is used,” but declined to say whether they were planning to charge for the data. Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. declined to comment. 

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has no plans to charge for access, according to a person familiar with the company's plans.

In addition to a new layer of costs, many in the industry are objecting to what they see as a unilateral move by JPMorgan to dictate the framework and fee structure for consumer data.

“Horrible anti competitive behavior from JPMC,” venture capitalist and Trump supporter Ben Horowitz wrote on X. The crypto outcry reached the White House, with both senior adviser David Sacks and Donald Trump Jr. amplifying a post from Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss accusing “the banksters” of trying to kill fintech and crypto companies. 

For retailers, the fees and the higher rate for payment calls complicate their efforts to build proprietary apps that would let customers pay via bank transfer, which the retailers like because it avoids the fees banks charge to process credit and debit card transactions. 

“The fintechs and crypto and stable really have an opportunity to disrupt the ecosystem when it comes to debit and credit and for future payments,” said Austen Jensen, a spokesperson for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which includes Walmart Inc., Target Corp., and the Home Depot Inc. among its members. 

Last week, the Financial Technology Association, the Blockchain Association, National Retail Federation and others asked President Trump to support the CFPB's current open banking rules and fight JPMorgan's efforts in court. 

“You recognize the transformative potential of digital financial technologies and are leading efforts to enact and implement digital asset legislation,” they wrote in a letter. “The largest banks stand in direct opposition to your vision of making America the financial innovation capital of the world.”

The 2024 open banking rule is now on indefinite hold, its April implementation deadline stayed by a federal court judge on Tuesday at the CFPB's request. The agency plans to reconsider the issues from the beginning, a process that can take years and span administrations before it becomes a rule.

The long-awaited White House crypto strategy is out, but the 163-page report isn't likely to tell the crypto industry much that it doesn't already know — including about the federal bitcoin reserves, which remain a black box for a sector keen to learn anything new.



The report offers the most comprehensive outline of President Donald Trump's crypto push to date, covering all the major and minor policy efforts underway this year. For an industry that's been following each of those closely, however, it doesn't offer revelations of new initiatives or go into a deep explanation of individual policy pursuits.



Senior administration officials said on Wednesday that it's meant as a guidepost against which the government's progress can be measured. So far, the progress has been considerable when compared with the administration of former President Joe Biden. A new law, the GENIUS Act, already demands regulations to govern U.S. stablecoin issuers, and an even bigger piece of legislation to set up rules for the wider crypto markets, known in the House as the Clarity Act, has cleared the House of Representatives and is underway in the Senate.



But in the report, Trump's earlier call for crypto stockpiles — one for bitcoin BTC$117,746.03 and another for all other digital assets — only made the last page of the report, where the initiative was broadly summarized without the detail that wasn't offered before.



One of the officials said the infrastructure is well underway for that project and that there will be more information soon.



Bo Hines, one of Trump's top crypto advisers, had suggested earlier this month that the president's executive order calling for the reserves had required a report on the process but that the administration wasn't yet making it public and may choose not to. The lack of specifics had many crypto observers hoping the plans might be further revealed in this week's more comprehensive document.



The industry's stakes remain high on that project, which had initially disappointed many observers by promising a fund built only on assets organically seized by government agencies, but that also hinted at the administration's desire to find other ways to fund it. Lawmakers in Congress may also play a part by working on legislation that reinforces the process. Senator Cynthia Lummis has been in the vanguard of that with her Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, but it hasn't yet moved.



Meanwhile, Wednesday's report could be read by sitting U.S. regulators as a call to action. The group of regulators who agreed on its content "encourages the Federal government to operationalize President Trump's promise to make America the 'crypto capital of the world' and adopt a pro-innovation mindset toward digital assets and blockchain technologies," the report said.



More specifically, its core recommendations suggest that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) "should use their existing authorities to immediately enable the trading of digital assets at the federal level." That's a push to get started with regulation even as Congress produces its market structure work, and though the CFTC still lacks a permanent leadership under Trump, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has suggested his agency has the authorities to act that he's been exploring.



The report also included a tax section that echoes a number of the ideas also pushed by Senator Lummis, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets. A package of tax revisions she included in her legislative effort are meant to reduce burdens on crypto users, including by setting a minimum value by which a transaction should be subject to capital-gains considerations and an overhaul of when gains should be factored into crypto rewards from practices such as staking.

 Ethereum price is painting an ascending triangle pattern breakout with a price target of around $16,700. 

Key takeaways:

Ether runs into resistance at $4,000, but strong technicals and rising institutional demand could drive ETH into price discovery.

Ether's ascending triangle pattern targets an ETH price of as high as $16,700.

Ether (ETH) trades 23% below its $5,000 all-time high reached in November 2021, as the $4,000 level remains the key resistance to break.

Multiple analysts believe the largest altcoin is ready for a breakout that will usher in “its biggest move of the cycle.”

ETH price has already risen by over 300% since establishing a cycle low of around $880 in June 2022. In doing so, its price has painted several chart patterns in the monthly time frame, suggesting an impending upside breakout.

Popular crypto investor Ivan On Tech shared a chart showing Ether seeking a breakout from a symmetrical triangle, signaling a massive upward move once it is confirmed.

The measured target of the triangle was $7,709, or a 105% price increase from the current levels.

“Ethereum coiling up for its biggest move of the cycle,” analyst Bitcoinsensus said about Ether's symmetrical triangle pattern on the monthly chart, adding:

Popular crypto analyst Mikycrypto Bull shared a chart showing ETH price action has also formed an ascending triangle in the same time frame over a five-year period.

“Ethereum is set for a macro breakout. It will spark off a huge altseason if it happens,” the analyst said in a Wednesday post on X, adding:

The pattern will resolve once the price breaks above the triangle's resistance line at $4,000. If this happens, the price could rise by as much as the maximum distance between the triangle's trendlines.

That puts Ether's breakout target for 2025–2026 at about $16,700, up by more than 350% from current price levels.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator has produced a “bullish cross” on the monthly chart.

Previous instances show that ETH tends to rise sharply when the MACD line (blue) crosses above the signal line (orange). The gains were 2,000% during the 2020-2021 cycle and 130% in Q4/2023.

“Ethereum is setting up for a monster move, with a massive bullish monthly candle and fresh MACD crossover,” said analyst Merlijn The Trader, adding:

Several analysts are optimistic of an ETH price rally into the five-digit territory, with pseudonymous trader DeFi Dad saying the altcoin could reach as high as $30,000 based on its recent performance.

Tuesday's $218 million net inflow into Spot Ether ETFs marks an 18-day streak of positive inflows, totaling over $5.3 billion since July 2.

Cumulative net inflows into these investment products now exceed $9.6 billion since their July 2024 launch. 

Additionally, Ether treasury companies like SharpLink Gaming, which has acquired a total of 438,000 ETH worth more than $1.69 billion, are bolstering demand by integrating ETH into corporate balance sheets.

This institutional buying, coupled with ETF inflows, suggests a demand-supply imbalance, according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, as Ethereum's network issues only 800,000 ETH annually against a projected $20 billion demand. 

Strong ETF inflows, corporate accumulation, and Ethereum's fundamentals support a strong bullish case for Ether's price trajectory.

LONDON, United Kingdom – July 30, 2025 (ICROWDNEWSWIRE) – BODIAM CAPITAL LTD. (doing business as Bay Cryptocurrency) – In the era of rapid financial technology development, blockchain is no longer the exclusive domain of programmers or institutional investors. Mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), are becoming new tools for everyday users to explore digital participation and realize diversified returns.

Over the past five years, digital assets have gradually evolved from speculative assets to an important part of personal financial planning. As blockchain infrastructure matures, more and more ordinary users are beginning to explore ways to participate without high-frequency trading or technical barriers.



Passive Income Opportunities in 2025

Against the backdrop of continued economic uncertainty, many people hope to reduce their reliance on a single source of income through "passive income". Cryptocurrencies based on smart contracts and decentralized networks are becoming part of this trend, helping users interact with value in a more flexible way.

BTC, ETH and XRP: More Than Just Coins

Bitcoin represents digital gold, Ethereum is the core support for smart contracts and DeFi, and Ripple has attracted attention for its fast and low-cost cross-border payment capabilities. These mainstream currencies build the key foundation of the blockchain ecosystem, and any user can find an application method that suits them in these systems.

Platforms like Bay Cryptocurrency are following this trend and providing tools for ordinary users to explore on-chain participation without a technical background. Visit the Bay Cryptocurrency official website and register as a new user to receive a welcome gift worth $15, allowing you to experience participation without any cost.

Towards convenient crypto growth

BayCryptocurrency's new contract model is based on a three-step system. Users sign up, select their preferred yield contract, and activate it with XRP. The backend infrastructure is hosted in a certified green energy data center and automatically manages the yield process. Yields are tracked in real time and can be withdrawn or reinvested based on user preferences.

Key product features include:

A handy tool for beginners

Today's blockchain platforms are increasingly focusing on user experience. Some fintech services already support connecting digital wallets through cloud interfaces, so users can try to participate in certain revenue-generating mechanisms without having to deploy any equipment or learn complex processes.

How the operating mechanism is implemented

Most services use smart contract mechanisms to ensure transparency and automation. Users only need to set a wallet address to allocate assets into different on-chain modes, such as liquidity support, protocol staking, or stablecoins.

Bay Cryptocurrency simplifies the entire process with a built-in dashboard to help users visualize their assets and participation paths. The platform supports BTC, ETH, and XRP, especially for users who want to participate steadily but do not have a technical background.

Getting started is easier than you think

Users do not need professional knowledge to try to participate. For example, the Bay Cryptocurrency platform allows users to create a free account, connect a crypto wallet, and explore asset tools through a browser interface without installing any software.

JPMorgan and Coinbase team up to make crypto access easier for its customers as JPM expands into digital assets.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has teamed up with Coinbase (COIN) to make cryptocurrency more accessible to its 80 million customers. The partnership combines JPMorgan's banking services with Coinbase's crypto expertise to boost crypto adoption. Also, it reflects JPM's rising interest in digital assets.





Starting later this year, Chase credit card users will be able to add money to their Coinbase accounts directly, making it easier and faster to buy digital assets. Further, by 2026, JPM plans to let users link their Chase bank accounts directly to COIN wallets through a secure API, allowing smooth transfers between bank and crypto accounts.

Interestingly, the bank's customers will also be able to convert their Chase reward points to USDC, a stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar, at a 1:1 ratio. JPMorgan will be the first big U.S. bank to turn loyalty points into digital currency.

This partnership is part of JPMorgan's broader move into digital assets. The bank has launched JPMD, a deposit token built on Coinbase's Base blockchain, to help institutional clients settle transactions and make cross-border payments.

It is also exploring crypto-backed loans, with plans to offer lending against Bitcoin and Ether by 2026. Meanwhile, JPM's blockchain unit, Kinexys, is building tools for token-based settlements, aiming to become a leader in stablecoins and blockchain-based finance.

These moves come as CEO Jamie Dimon's stance on crypto has softened. He recently said, “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” marking a shift from his earlier criticism of the cryptocurrency.

Turning to Wall Street, JPM stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, five Holds, and two Sells assigned in the last three months. At $307.20, the average JPMorgan price target implies a 2.99% upside potential.

After Bitcoin touched a new all-time high of over $123,000 in mid-July, the crypto market has entered a sharp corrective phase, with nearly $400 million in long positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin alone accounted for $159 million in liquidations, while altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin dropped more than 5%. Analysts suggest this pullback is a “healthy and necessary correction,” especially as long-term holders appear to be taking profits. 

The total market capitalization briefly exceeded $4 trillion, and analysts now consider $3.4 trillion as a key support level for the ongoing bullish trend to remain intact. Derivatives activity also points to rising caution, with a $5 million put option on Bitcoin placed at a $110,000 strike, reflecting increased hedging amid market uncertainty. 

However, analysts from major institutions like Citigroup continue to project long-term upside, estimating Bitcoin could reach $135,000 by year-end. As momentum temporarily cools, investor focus is shifting toward undervalued altcoins with real-world use cases and strong fundamentals. Hence, they need assets that could gain traction once market volatility subsides.

One such emerging project is Tapzi, a Web3 skill-based gaming ecosystem aligning utility with Ethereum's expanding institutional narrative. But it is not the only one! So, without any further ado, let's check the top undervalued altcoins to buy now that could make you rich soon. 

The following is a list of the top undervalued altcoins to buy now:

While a healthy and necessary correction in the current crypto market was need of the hour, it even implies emphasizing our attention to the projects that deserve our attention. Amongst them, the top undervalued altcoins to buy now present a compelling opportunity due to various reasons, and let's learn in detail! 

Tapzi is an emerging altcoin in the Web3 gaming space, building infrastructure around competitive, skill-based PvP experiences. As the market enters a consolidation phase, projects like Tapzi that prioritize product delivery and long-term utility are gaining attention from early-stage investors. This is because everyone now seeks stability beyond hype cycles.

Moreover, Tapzi's phased roadmap emphasizes scalability and player retention, with smart contract audits, a web-based multiplayer demo, and tokenomics designed to avoid inflationary pitfalls. The first public-facing phase is set for Q3 2025, followed by platform beta and token listing in Q4.

What distinguishes Tapzi is its rejection of speculation-heavy GameFi mechanics. Instead of idle farming or luck-based gameplay, Tapzi focuses on real-time competition through games like chess, checkers, and rock-paper-scissors. 

Players can stake the TAPZI token in matches and tournaments, while future updates will add NFT customization, governance elements, and developer integration via an SDK. 

With support for 100K+ daily users and planned cross-chain expansion to Ethereum, Polygon, and potentially TON, the platform is designed for both accessibility and scale.

Tapzi is not yet listed on major exchanges, making it a relatively undervalued entry for investors who anticipate utility-led altcoin growth in the post-hype GameFi cycle. 

As presale phases begin, its value proposition aligns with a maturing digital asset landscape. 

Tron has quietly become one of the most used blockchain networks, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia and Africa, where affordable and fast transactions are critical. Its focus on decentralized content distribution, entertainment, and stablecoin transfers makes it highly relevant to real-world users. However, it is often overlooked in Western crypto narratives.

The network's ability to handle high volumes at near-zero fees has made it the go-to platform for USDT transfers, with billions in daily value moved. With a growing DeFi ecosystem, native stablecoin support, and a proactive DAO reserve strengthening its economic layer, TRX has demonstrated impressive resilience and utility.

Despite its strong fundamentals, Tron remains undervalued relative to its actual on-chain activity. As institutional capital begins to recognize networks with real adoption rather than hype, TRX could see a major re-rating. 

For investors seeking mainstream utility wrapped in a high-performance chain, Tron offers deep value at current prices.

Toncoin, originally developed by Telegram's team, is emerging as a major player in blockchain infrastructure by combining scalability, usability, and massive network potential. With Telegram's 900 million+ user base forming a latent distribution network, TON is uniquely positioned to mainstream crypto functionality through social messaging.

Its lightning-fast performance, infinite sharding architecture, and embedded wallet support within Telegram make Toncoin ideal for everyday micro-transactions, NFTs, and gaming. As TON expands into DeFi and dApps, developers are increasingly turning to it as a scalable, user-friendly alternative to crowded L1s like Ethereum and Solana.

Despite this strong technical foundation and growing ecosystem, TON remains largely under the radar in Western markets. However, the upcoming rollout of crypto-native features across Telegram could act as a catalyst for mass adoption. 

With real distribution channels and embedded usability, Toncoin is a prime example of an undervalued asset poised to go mainstream.

VeChain is a purpose-built Layer-1 platform focused on supply chain management, logistics, and sustainability tracking. While not a typical DeFi or gaming protocol, VeChain's real-world partnerships, including Walmart China, BMW, and PwC, make it one of the few blockchains actively solving enterprise-level problems.

Its dual-token model (VET for value transfer and VTHO for gas) enables cost-efficient and scalable dApp development. VET's use in tracking carbon emissions, food authenticity, and pharmaceutical logistics reflects its deep integration into real-world systems, especially across Asia and Europe.

Despite being active since 2015, VeChain is still undervalued due to its low retail hype. But as blockchain utility becomes a dominant investment narrative, VeChain's focus on enterprise and ESG applications gives it a unique edge. 

With governments and corporations turning to blockchain for transparency and compliance, VET is quietly setting itself up as a long-term foundational player.

Cardano is a research-first blockchain protocol that emphasizes long-term sustainability, decentralization, and peer-reviewed development. With a slow but methodical approach, it has built a strong foundation through academic rigor, scalability plans (Hydra), and decentralized governance (Voltaire era).

Despite a slower rollout compared to faster-moving competitors, Cardano's native dApp ecosystem is steadily expanding, and the chain's proof-of-stake mechanism remains one of the most energy-efficient in the industry. 

ADA also supports several projects across sectors such as education, identity, and healthcare, especially in developing economies like Ethiopia.

Currently priced below its historical highs and underrepresented in mainstream narratives, ADA offers a low-risk, high-conviction entry point for long-term investors. As global interest in regulated, energy-efficient, and equitable blockchain infrastructure increases, Cardano is likely to benefit from its thoughtful architecture and community-driven ethos.

As the crypto market navigates through corrections and macro uncertainty, one thing is becoming increasingly clear. The spotlight is shifting toward real-world use cases, proven fundamentals, and application-layer innovation. 

Projects like Tron, Toncoin, VeChain, and Cardano stand out not just for their technical resilience but for the real impact they're making across industries and geographies. While hype-driven tokens may continue to grab headlines during bull runs, long-term value often lies in ecosystems built for scale, utility, and inclusivity. 

For investors seeking early exposure to the next wave of mainstream adoption, these top undervalued altcoins present a compelling opportunity. Among them, Tapzi deserves special mention for seamlessly blending blockchain utility with Web3 gaming in a way that prioritizes both transparency and long-term player engagement. Thus, it is a model that many crypto whales are watching and waiting for the opportunity to grab!

Corporate interest in bitcoin certainly doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.

According to Forbes, more than 70 companies around the globe are holding the cryptocurrency as a Treasury asset. As a whole, this amounts to well over $67 billion and that number is growing fast. Back in June, Elliot Chun of Architect Partners reported that since April 2, 2025, 32 public companies released new crypto Treasury strategy plans. In total, these plans are looking to raise at least $11.3 billion in capital, according to Architect Partners.

This report showcases how interest in applying the digital currency to corporate strategies is expanding beyond a few select names. Meanwhile, these deals are happening as the cryptocurrency continues to flirt with new highs on a regular basis.

However, even with all this momentum, some advisors and investors might be wondering if it's too late to jump into bitcoin during this rally. These concerns are certainly valid. The price of bitcoin could always head into a new bout of volatility, even as companies look to add it to their Treasuries.

Keeping these concerns in mind, advisors still have plenty of tools at their disposal to access bitcoin exposure in a risk-managed way. One opportune means of doing so is through the use of a Calamos Protected Bitcoin ETF. These funds look to offer distinct upside to bitcoin's price performance along with a barrier of downside security.

The Calamos Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF – July launched in July. For investors, CBOY provides 100% downside protection across the entire one-year outcome period. Considering the traditional price volatility bitcoin can face, this could be a distinct boon for the risk-wary.

Meanwhile, the fund still offers return opportunities through bitcoin's price movements. That said, there is an upside cap on potential returns.

This framework makes CBOY an attractive vehicle for navigating the current bitcoin market. The fund can help advisors and investors tap into momentum within bitcoin, while providing peace of mind through its downside overlay.

Before investing, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Please see the prospectus and summary prospectus this and other information which can be obtained by calling 1-866-363-9219. Read it carefully before investing.

An investment in the Fund is subject to risks, and you could lose money on your investment in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Your investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. The risks associated with an investment in the Fund can increase during times of significant market volatility. The Fund also has specific principal risks, which are described below. More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus.

Investing involves risks. Loss of principal is possible. The Fund(s) face numerous market trading risks, including authorized participation concentration risk, underlying ETP risk, cap change risk, capital protection risk, capped upside risk, cash holdings risk, concentration risk, clearing member default risk, correlation risk, costs of buying and selling fund shares, counterparty risk, derivatives risk, equity securities risk, FLEX options risk, interest rate risk, investment in a subsidiary, investment timing risk, liquidity risk, management risk, market maker risk, market risk, new fund risk, non-diversification risk, options risk, OTC options risk, position limits risk, premium-discount risk, secondary market trading risk, sector risk, tax risk, trading issues risk, U.S. Government security risk, U.S. Treasury risk, and valuation risk. For a detailed list of fund risks see the prospectus. 

The Target Outcome may not be achieved, and investors may lose some or all of their money. The Fund is designed to achieve the Target Outcome only if an investor buys on the first day of the Outcome Period and holds the Fund until the end of the Outcome Period. While the Fund seeks to provide 100% protection against losses experienced by the price of Spot bitcoin for shareholders who hold Fund Shares for an entire Outcome Period, there is no guarantee it will successfully do so. If the Fund's NAV has increased significantly, a shareholder that purchases Fund Shares after the first day of an Outcome Period could lose their entire investment. An investment in the Fund is only appropriate for shareholders willing to bear those losses. There is no guarantee the Capital Protection and Cap will be successful and a shareholder investing at the beginning of an Outcome Period could also lose their entire investment.

The Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before taking fees and expenses into account, track the positive price return of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate – New York Variant (“BRRNY”) (“Spot bitcoin”) up to a predetermined upside cap (the “Cap”) while seeking to protect against 100% of losses (before fees and expenses) of (i) Spot bitcoin or (ii) one or more of the Underlying ETPs and/or Bitcoin Indexes, in each case, over a period of approximately one (1) year (the “Outcome Period”). The Fund will not invest directly in bitcoin. Instead, the Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before taking fees and expenses into account, track the positive price return of Spot bitcoin by investing in options that reference the price performance of either (i) one or more underlying exchange-traded products (“Underlying ETPs”) which, in turn, own bitcoin or (ii) one or more indexes that are designed to track the price of bitcoin (“Bitcoin Index”). 

Digital Assets Risk: The bitcoin network was first launched in 2009 and bitcoins were the first cryptographic digital assets created to gain global adoption and critical mass. Although the bitcoin network is the most established digital asset network, the bitcoin network and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. Moreover, because digital assets, including bitcoin, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this prospectus. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry, and the value of the Underlying ETPs' shares depends on the acceptance of bitcoin. The realization of one or more of the following risks could materially adversely affect the value of the Underlying ETPs' shares.

The fund's expense ratio as of the prospectus dated 4/7/2025 is 0.69%.

Cap Rate – Maximum percentage return an investor can achieve from an investment in the Fund if held over the Outcome Period. 

Protection Level – Amount of protection the Fund is designed to achieve over the Days Remaining. 

Outcome Period – The defined length of time over which the outcomes are sought.

VERT Capital, a Brazilian credit structuring and securitization firm, plans to tokenize up to $1 billion in debt and receivables on the XDC Network XDC$0.09896, expanding the scope of public blockchain use in structured finance, the firms told CoinDesk.

As part of the deal, the firms will move financial instruments such as corporate debt, agribusiness receivables and structured credit products on-chain over the next 30 months.

The migration shifts VERT's existing securitization work, which includes clients like Cargill, Santander and Raízen, towards digital issuance with a blockchain-based infrastructure designed to meet regulatory and audit requirements.

"Our goal is to transform traditional structured assets into digital assets with global liquidity," Gabriel Braga, head of digital assets at VERT, said in statement. "We already have ready-to-issue structures, proven frameworks, and validated compliance."

Meanwhile, XDC Network, an Ethereum-compatible layer 1 with two-second settlement times and ISO 20022 messaging support, has positioned itself as a hub for real-world asset tokenization. Its partners include Circle, Deutsche Telekom MMS and Securitize, and the network has integrated frameworks like MLETR and R3 Corda to support cross-border finance.

The deal between VERT and XDC adds to a growing list of tokenization moves around the world. Traditional financial institutions increasingly explore blockchain rails for moving and recording ownership of financial instruments like credit, bonds and funds, also dubbed real-world assets (RWA), seeking to gain operational efficiencies.

It can potentially be a huge opportunity: tokenized assets could grow to a multiple trillion-dollar market over the next few years, as projected by reports from Ripple, BCG, McKinsey and others.

Brazil has emerged as a key hub for asset tokenization in the region, Diego Consimo, XDC Network's head of Latin America, noted in an interview with CoinDesk.

Brazil-based crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin shared plans earlier in July to tokenize over $200 million in RWAs, including fixed income and equity instruments, on the XRP Ledger. Last week, VERT also debuted a credit protocol on XRP Ledger with a $130 million Agribusiness Receivables Certificate (CRA).

Key Insights



 

The Bank of Korea is stepping up its regulation of digital assets by launching a “virtual asset committee”. This move shows that interest in crypto across South Korea is on the rise. Besides, this is especially as the country inches closer to legalizing stablecoins and expanding its crypto efforts.

The main goal of this committee is to monitor the crypto market, support ongoing legislative efforts, and keep tabs on won-pegged stablecoins. This is important as banks prepare to issue their own stablecoins and lawmakers push forward with regulation.

The virtual asset committee is being established under the Bank of Korea's Financial Settlement Bureau. It will monitor developments in the crypto sector, especially those tied to Korean won-pegged stablecoins and upcoming legislative changes.

South Korea's central bank forms a Virtual Asset Committee to monitor crypto markets & stablecoin legislation.

Its CBDC research team is now a practical “Digital Currency Team,” focusing on execution, not theory.

A BOK official told Yonhap News that the team will also be responsible for cooperating with government agencies throughout the legal process. The focus on collaboration shows  the need for unity as South Korea moves toward formalizing its crypto laws.

In line with this shift, the Bank of Korea has also renamed and restructured its CBDC teams. Previously, the teams operated under the title of “Digital Currency Research.” Now, they've been renamed to reflect more practical business operations, rather than just theoretical work.

As a breakdown, the main team is expected to act as the main unit handling CBDC projects. In addition, the technology team will conduct research and analysis related to crypto and stablecoins.

Finally, the Infrastructure Team will work on a digital voucher management platform, which will support testing based on deposit tokens.
Overall, these changes show the central bank's change from crypto being related mostly to academic research, to being used in real-world applications. 

According to BOK officials, this is part of the country's active deployment plan, if a CBDC becomes necessary.

Amid the stablecoins push, South Korea had already been conducting retail CBDC trials since April of the previous year. But the program was paused in June. The decision came after complaints from local banks about the high costs of participation and the government's support for private sector stablecoins.

Even though the latest round of CBDC testing ended early, the central bank has made it clear that its digital currency plans are not off the table. A BOK spokesperson noted that the team will resume discussions once the legal uncertainties are resolved.

Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong echoed this sentiment, stating, “Whether we choose stablecoins or deposit tokens, South Korea will need digital currency in the future.”

While the central bank is still considering CBDCs, eight major South Korean banks are moving forward with plans to issue stablecoins backed by the Korean won. These coins are expected to launch between lQ4 and early next year.

Banks continue to argue that stablecoins are more flexible and less costly than CBDCs. The BOK has also acknowledged these arguments and may gradually shift responsibility to banks for issuing such digital assets. Still, the central bank is expected to maintain a supervisory role to make sure that monetary policy remains effective.

"There was Maji before, and now there's Yi Nengjing. Many of the biggest names in NFT trading last year have returned."

In 2021, the star power fueled the NFT craze. Now, they're back again, bringing unique stories and bets.

Meanwhile, NFT market trading volume has rebounded, with a surge in buyers. Is this apparent recovery a sign of true spring, or an illusion amidst a cold winter?

The market's macroeconomic data presents a puzzling contradiction.

On the one hand, long-term expectations remain optimistic. Authoritative institutions such as Vancelian predict that the market size will exceed tens of billions of dollars this year. On the other hand, On the one hand, the short-term reality is remarkably bleak: DappRadar reports that NFT transaction volume declined by nearly 29% quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter of this year. 

However, this apparent retreat has not caused market panic; instead, it reveals a structural shift.

According to DappRadar data, in the second quarter of 2025, although the total NFT transaction volume declined due to a decrease in high-priced collectibles, the number of transactions surged 78% from approximately 7.02 million to 12.5 million, and the number of unique buyers also increased significantly by 44% from 651,000 to 936,000.



This unusual data set of "falling prices and rising volumes" reveals the profound changes the market is undergoing. NFTs are quietly shifting from a high-priced speculative game for a few to a broader "popularization process."

As Coindoo reported: Despite a decline in trading volume, the increase in sales and the decline in average transaction value indicate broader market participation, and that the driving force behind transactions is shifting from pure speculation to practicality and community consensus.

And at this delicate juncture, A group of previously departed "star players" have returned. What does their return truly signify? 

From Jay Chou's PhantaBear to Shawn Yue's ZombieClub, to Annie Yi's own Theirsverse, these once-fevered projects have seen their floor prices plummet over 98% from their peak, practically to zero. Behind these cold numbers lie the wounds of countless investors still silently licking their wounds. 



However, to understand today's market, we must look back to that year of mixed enthusiasm and sobriety.

2021: Peak of the Carnival

This was a golden age where dreamers and speculators danced together.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $69,000, and NFTs leapt from niche toys to global buzz. In October 2021, Maji spent 425 ETH to buy Cyborg Bored Ape, FOMO exploded instantly. 

At the end of the year, Jay Chou-themed PhantaBear sold out in 40 minutes, with daily sales exceeding $10 million.

2022: Winter Arrives

But prosperity was fleeting. Amidst multiple shocks, including black swan events, high inflation, interest rate hikes, and war, Bitcoin plummeted below $20,000, and the crypto market capitalization halved to $1 trillion.

Edison Chen, Shawn Yue, and Annie Yi successively launched NFT projects, but all ultimately collapsed in the bear market. Theirsverse plummeted from 0.219 ETH to 0.02 ETH has plummeted over 96%, earning Yi Nengjing the label "The Queen of Chives."

2025: Old faces return, new forces enter the game

Mr. Maji has completed his transformation, transitioning from a major NFT investor to a high-leverage Memecoin trader. He bets real money on BLAST and PUMP tokens, publicly sharing his profits and losses, becoming a "number one gambler" who thrives with the market. Meanwhile, Yi Nengjing has quietly returned.

Furthermore, legendary businessman Qian Fenglei, with his "tens of billions" fortune, entered Web3 earlier this year, claiming to invest $100 million in the creation of a "Peach Blossom Spring NFT." Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz quietly switched to Pudgy. Penguin avatar. 

It feels like we've returned to 2021, with stars returning and the market thriving. But this time, the excitement is tempered by less blind faith and more restraint. 

In the NFT market of 2025, the community will no longer be a mere participant, but will transform into a true "judge." 

On the surface, the data looks positive: NFT trading volume has steadily rebounded, with CryptoPunks, BAYC, and Pudgy... The prices of blue-chip projects like Penguins continue to climb. However, this time, the community's reaction has been unprecedentedly calm. 

"The 2021 NFT craze won't be repeated,"@RicecakeNFT stated bluntly on X,"The barrier to entry has significantly increased, and investors prioritize practicality and community value."This statement reveals the truth about the NFT market in 2025: after the speculative bubble recedes, a return to value will become the dominant theme.

Community member @waleswoosh predicted: "By 2025, not a single top NFT project may exist, but we will see several with floor prices exceeding 50 ETH. This year will be a year of repricing and real value."



The NFT world of 2025 appears bustling on the surface, but is actually calm.

From hype to consensus, from frenzy to rationality, this profound shift in the NFT market represents a reshaping of value.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The cryptocurrency market is navigating a period of consolidation as Bitcoin and Ethereum trade within narrow ranges, with investors adopting a cautious stance ahead of key U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve decisions. Bitcoin remains between $116,000 and $120,000, while Ethereum struggles to maintain strength near $4,000, signaling a temporary plateau after recent price surges [1]. This stagnation reflects broader market fatigue and uncertainty, with analysts attributing the pause to anticipation of macroeconomic developments [2].  

The lack of upward momentum underscores a shift in investor behavior, as buyers hesitate to commit capital amid macroeconomic volatility. Bitcoin's stability in this range, though typically seen as a positive, highlights subdued demand for aggressive positions [1]. Ethereum's slowdown near $4,000 is compounded by mixed sentiment around its upcoming upgrades and broader crypto market jitters [2]. Traders appear less enthusiastic, with Ethereum's role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) failing to reignite bullish momentum [1].  

Market dynamics are increasingly influenced by U.S. economic indicators, particularly inflation and employment data. The Federal Reserve's potential response to these metrics remains a critical variable. Rising interest rates, often triggered by inflationary pressures, typically dampen risk-on sentiment, leading investors to avoid high-volatility assets like cryptocurrencies [1]. Conversely, a robust jobs market could encourage more aggressive risk-taking, potentially bolstering crypto demand. However, analysts note that delayed or divided Fed policy decisions could prolong uncertainty, complicating short-term price direction [2].  

The upcoming U.S. inflation and employment reports are expected to shape near-term market psychology. If data signals a weaker labor market—such as a projected 4.2% unemployment rise—investors may anticipate slower rate cuts, easing pressure on interest-sensitive assets [2]. Conversely, stronger employment figures could accelerate policy normalization, introducing new risks for crypto markets. This dual scenario has led to a “wait-and-see” environment, with ETF inflows for Bitcoin softening and Ethereum facing downward pressure despite recent optimism [2][9].  

Ethereum's challenges extend beyond price action, as broader ecosystem trends reveal vulnerabilities. NFT-related projects on the network have seen a 35.7% drop in trading volume, highlighting reduced speculative activity [7]. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's sideways movement contrasts with Tron (TRX)'s anomalous performance, which has defied the broader decline [8]. These divergences underscore the fragmented nature of current market sentiment.  

Analysts emphasize the importance of focusing on projects with strong fundamentals amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Howard Wu advised prioritizing stability and privacy in long-term crypto assets, as speculative momentum wanes [10]. This aligns with a broader trend of risk-averse positioning, with investors avoiding aggressive bets until clarity emerges on the Fed's policy path. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September remains a pivotal event, with internal divisions among policymakers extending the window for uncertainty [4].  

Looking ahead, the third quarter will be critical for Bitcoin and Ethereum. A delayed rate cut could prolong consolidation, while unexpected policy shifts may reignite volatility. For now, the market is balancing the potential for policy-driven tailwinds with the risks of prolonged uncertainty [10]. Investors are urged to remain patient and informed, as external economic events will likely dictate the trajectory of major cryptocurrencies in the coming months [1].

As the digital economy continues to evolve, the U.S. government
and a handful of states are beginning to experiment with new
strategies for financial resilience, including the creation of
Strategic Bitcoin Reserves ("SBR"). An SBR is a financial
policy tool where a government entity, such as a U.S. state,
allocates a portion of assets to securely hold Bitcoin as a
long-term store of value or hedge against economic risks like
inflation. SBRs function similarly to traditional strategic
reserves of assets like gold, as there is a finite supply of
Bitcoin.1 A government (or corporation or individual
investor) might wish to add a non-sovereign asset like Bitcoin to
their portfolio with the expectation that such assets will
appreciate over time or at least maintain a relatively stable
value. Recent SBR legislation passed in several states shows
Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a long-term financial
strategy rather than as a speculative asset. These laws also serve
as a marketing strategy to position those states with SBRs as
tech-friendly and pro-crypto – particularly in light of
shifting priorities under the new administration.

Federal Strategic Bitcoin Reserves
Proposals

On March 6, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled the "Establishment
of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset
Stockpile," noting: "The United States Government
currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not
implemented a policy to maximize BTC's strategic position as a
unique store of value in the global financial system." The
order directs the U.S. Treasury Department to establish and manage
a SBR to create long-term reserve holdings capitalized by Bitcoin
previously forfeited in civil or criminal proceedings. This would
mark a departure from the government's prior policy of selling
Bitcoin and digital assets forfeited in legal proceedings,
typically through public auctions, and would represent a policy
shift in embracing crypto assets. The order also directs Treasury
to establish an office to manage the "United States Digital
Asset Stockpile" that would consist of holdings of other
cryptocurrency or digital assets obtained in forfeiture
proceedings, subject to exceptions for digital assets returned to
crime victims or used for law enforcement purposes.

Following the order, on March 11, 2025 Senator Cynthia Lummis
(R-WY) introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2025, which would, among other
things, codify the executive order and establish a federal SBR. The
bill proposes a framework allowing the Treasury Department, using
various methods, to acquire one million Bitcoin over a five-year
period and place the assets in secure cold storage (akin to the
country's gold reserves) for a minimum 20-year holding period.
Treasury would be required to make regular public reports about the
reserve fund. The bill text also includes congressional findings
recognizing Bitcoin as a useful diversification method and a hedge
against economic uncertainty and monetary instability. While the
bill remains in committee, its introduction signals that Congress
and the White House are open to treating digital assets as a
legitimate asset class worthy of public investment. With the
passage of the GENIUS Act (S.1582), which establishes a regulatory
framework for payment stablecoins, it's possible more digital
asset legislation like the SBR bill could advance in the coming
term.

State Laws Enabling Strategic Bitcoin
Reserves

Meanwhile, as the federal government begins work on its own SBR,
several states were already in the process of developing
legislation of their own to implement Bitcoin reserves. Some of
these laws authorize the use of public funds while others are more
modest in scope.

New Hampshire became the first state to pass an SBR law. HB 302 authorizes the state treasurer to invest
up to 5% percent of the total amount of public funds in precious
metals or digital assets that have a market cap of over $500
billion (Bitcoin is the only digital asset that currently meets
this criterion). The state treasurer must maintain such assets
securely,2 whether through a state secure custody
solution, a qualified custodian, or in the form of an
exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company.
While the bill does not specifically mandate the creation of such
reserve, it gives the state's treasurer discretion to invest in
one.

Arizona passed HB 2749, which is not its first foray into
legislation related to blockchain and digital assets.3
HB 2749 updates the state's unclaimed property laws and creates
the Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund. This fund requires the
state to hold unclaimed digital assets for three years before they
can be sold, with any airdrops or staking rewards retained in their
digital form and added to the reserve (the state treasurer, with
approval of the state legislature, can deposit ten percent of
digital assets held in the fund into the state's general fund).
Under the law, digital assets are presumed abandoned three years
after a written or electronic communication sent to the account
owner is returned as undeliverable. However, this presumption ends
immediately if the owner takes action regarding the digital asset,
such as by conducting a transaction or electronically accessing the
account.

In late June, Texas joined the SBR movement with the passage of
SB 21. The law establishes a Texas SBR managed
by the state comptroller as a special fund outside the state
treasury. The law authorizes the state comptroller to allowed
qualified third parties to manage the reserve and requires crypto
purchases, with funds appropriated by the legislature or from
reserve revenues, to be invested in digital assets that have an
average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over the
most recent two-year period.

Similar bills are pending in other state legislatures, including
Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. If more states establish such funds, it
will be interesting to see the effect on the price of Bitcoin as,
presumably, more supply of the coin would be acquired and
thereafter held in storage and would not generally be traded on
exchanges.

Future Implications and Potential Risks

While states have taken different approaches to establishing
SBRs, their adoption signals a growing willingness to investigate
the potential for certain established digital currencies as to
become recognized strategic asset classes for long-term investment
of state funds. States pursuing these initiatives also hope that
such laws might attract professionals and businesses seeking
jurisdictions with more favorable crypto regulations. The success
of these early adopters could also lead to innovation at the
federal level as lawmakers observe these policies in practice.

Although the creation of SBRs at the state level mirrors what
institutional and individual investors are doing with Bitcoin
stockpiles or investments in similar ETF products, their adoption
presents potential legal and regulatory risks. States must first
ensure that they have the expertise and specialized secure
infrastructure necessary to store their digital assets or otherwise
contract with a qualified custodian to do so. Texas's SB 21,
for example, requires cold storage, an offline method of custody.
Moreover, the New Hampshire SBR law allows for investment in
Bitcoin ETFs, negating the need to hold the underlying digital
currency itself. Moreover, states with SBRs need to develop
frameworks and processes for managing such investments with
reasonable care and reporting, tracking, and disclosing reserve
holdings to the public.

Additionally, bills like Arizona's HB 2749 raise procedural
concerns similar to those associated with the forfeiture of any
type of unclaimed assets, by allowing the state to repossess
unclaimed digital assets after a period of time. Legal challenges
could arise over asset seizure, and account owners in such states
should maintain periodic vigilance over accounts to maintain an
active presence.

Lastly, Bitcoin's price, having risen since the new
administration took office, is not guaranteed to continue climbing
and may experience future volatility. With Bitcoin reaching new highs in the past year,
it's possible that states purchasing or acquiring Bitcoin at
its peak could experience losses in the future or that Bitcoin
could underperform as compared with traditional assets (of course,
bitcoin and other digital assets acquired via forfeiture of
criminal proceeds would sidestep this concern). A sudden drop in
value could raise questions about the general responsibility of
state officials to prudently manage public funds. Presumably, this
latter concern explains why the aforementioned state bitcoin
reserve laws are relatively modest in scope and limit state
investments either to unclaimed funds or to Bitcoin itself, as
opposed to other cryptocurrencies.

Laws in states like Arizona, Oregon, New Hampshire, and Texas
signal a gradual step toward modernizing state treasuries and
reflect the growing legitimacy of digital assets as an enduring
asset class. However, with the momentum comes risks, including
questions about secure custody, property concerns and general
management responsibilities. As more states consider incorporating
SBRs into their long-term financial strategies, the U.S. is
attempting to position itself as a leader in global financial
crypto policy.

Footnotes

1. Bitcoin will eventually reach its hard cap of 21
million BTC around the year 2040. Once this number is reached, no
new bitcoins will be minted, absent an action by a consensus of
network participants to agree on a code change, which is highly
unlikely given that Bitcoin's fixed supply is central to its
value proposition.

2. "Secure custody solution" means a
technological product or blended product and service which has all
of the following characteristics: (1) The cryptographic private
keys that secure digital assets are exclusively known by and
accessible by the government entity; (2) The cryptographic private
keys that secure digital assets are exclusively contained within an
encrypted environment and accessible only via end-to-end encrypted
channels; (3) The cryptographic private keys that secure digital
assets are never contained by, accessible by, or controllable via a
smartphone; (4) Any hardware that contains the cryptographic
private keys that secure digital assets is maintained in at least 2
geographically diversified specially designated secure data
centers; (5) The secure custody solution enforces a multi-party
governance structure for authorizing transactions, enforces user
access controls, and logs all user-initiated actions; (6) The
provider of the secure custody solution has implemented a disaster
recovery protocol that ensures customer access to assets in the
event the provider becomes unavailable; (7) The secure custody
solution undergoes regular code audits and penetration testing from
audit firms.

3. Note: A previous Arizona bill (SB 1373), which would have established a
digital assets strategic reserve funded by monies appropriated by
the state legislature, was vetoed by the governor in May 2025;
another bill (SB 2324), which would have using confiscated
digital asset funds from criminal cases for a state reserve fund,
was vetoed by the governor in early July.

Bitcoin is still trending up on strong exchange-traded fund (ETF) demand and low exchange reserves, but its dominance is slipping as altcoins rally and regulations evolve, crypto bank Sygnum said in a new Q3 report.

Bitcoin (BTC) ETF assets have now surpassed $160 billion, with more than 110,000 BTC added last quarter alone, the report notes. At the same time, exchange reserves have dropped to a near seven-year low, tightening available supply. According to CryptoQuant data, BTC reserves across exchanges currently sit at around 2.37 million coins.

Earlier this year, Bitcoin surpassed Google to become the sixth-largest asset globally by market capitalization, “further cementing its status as a credible macro asset in global markets,” the report reads. BTC is currently trading at around $117,000 with a market cap of $2.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko.

Bitcoin's dominance also recently hit its highest level since early 2021 – but that trend has reversed, with its share of the market falling more than 6% amid a broader altcoin rally, led by large-caps like ETH, XRP and BNB. Currently, BTC dominance hovers around 61%, according to TradingView data. Moreover, with regulatory clarity expected to further boost the altcoin space, Bitcoin's dominance could continue to slide, the report said. 

These findings point to a shift in the crypto market, with Bitcoin still leading but interest spreading to other coins as investors seek to capitalize on opportunities beyond just BTC.

Most recently, the total cryptocurrency market cap crossed the $4 trillion mark for the first time, led by surging valuations of altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP). ETH traded as high as $3,864 over the weekend – its highest level since December 2024. It has since retraced to $3,767. 

The report notes that sentiment around Ethereum has recently shifted partly because of its successful Pectra upgrade, which raised the staking cap from 32 to 2048 ETH and implemented several core improvement proposals (EIPs). 

“Ethereum's tailwinds have also led to exchange reserves returning to cycle lows, with market data revealing large whale accounts accumulating Ether and a steady rise in on-chain transactions and active users,” the report added. “If these demand trends pick up in the coming quarter, we cannot rule out the possibility of a supply squeeze and an upward price shock.”

Meanwhile, XRP last week reached an all-time high of $3.64. Currently, the token is trading at $3.11, down 12% over the past week. 

“As regulatory clarity extends to altcoins, capital could rotate towards projects with real economic use cases and sustainable token models, and perhaps this shift is already underway as some sectors currently show,” Sygnum's report reads. 

This rally comes on the heels of the U.S. House of Representatives passing three major cryptocurrency bills: The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, the Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.

The GENIUS Act sets rules for stablecoins, while the Clarity Act creates a regulatory framework for digital assets. Meanwhile, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act bans the conception of a federal digital dollar.

A long-anticipated rotation into altcoins may be underway amid improved regulatory clarity, growing liquidity and a surge in onchain activity, according to Sygnum's Q3 2025 Investment Outlook.

Geopolitical tensions and US fiscal uncertainty earlier this year led to a sell-off across the altcoin sector. However, changing market dynamics “may ignite the long-awaited altseason,” the digital bank said in the report shared with Cointelegraph.

“As regulatory clarity extends to altcoins, capital could rotate toward projects with real economic use cases and sustainable token models, and perhaps this shift is already underway as some sectors currently show,” Sygnum wrote.

The report also noted a decline in Bitcoin dominance, which hit its highest level since 2021 amid geopolitical and trade-related macro pressures, but recently dropped over 6% amid capital return to altcoins.

Bitcoin hits new highs on supply squeeze

The report said that liquidity trends for Bitcoin (BTC) remain “extremely bullish,” as a persistent supply and demand imbalance has driven the largest cryptocurrency by market value to new all-time highs. BTC hit an ATH above $123,000 on July 14.

“Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now exceeded USD 160 billion in assets under management, accumulating more than 110k BTC last quarter alone,” Sygnum wrote. Ether (ETH) followed with falling exchange balances, ETF inflows and nearly 30% of its liquid supply staked.

The Ethereum narrative shifted after a successful Pectra upgrade, which “raised the staking cap and introduced several protocol improvements.” Regulatory clarity has reinforced this trend, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission clarified that protocol staking “does not fall under securities law.”

Sygnum said Ether has “conclusively broken its long-term downtrend,” citing a surge in institutional demand. Sharplink is planning a $1 billion ETH allocation, and a fresh wave of tokenization and stablecoin initiatives from Wall Street giants, including BNY Mellon, Société Générale and a Trump-backed USD1 stablecoin, are launching on Ethereum.

DEX market share hits 30%

Decentralized exchanges hit a record high last quarter, capturing 30% of all crypto spot trading after memecoin launches pushed DEX volumes to $530 billion. The surge was led by PancakeSwap on BNB Chain, while Solana's PumpSwap quickly overtook Raydium, the report noted.

DeFi lending also hit an all-time high of $70 billion locked, and liquid staking surpassed 30% of Ether's supply. “The DeFi lending sector is one of the strongest beneficiaries of market rallies, with active loans on Ethereum surging to new all-time highs as investors take on greater risk and leveraged exposure,” Sygnum wrote.

However, the bank warned that the current momentum in altcoins could spark another memecoin bubble, which history suggests may end in a sharp correction if it continues unchecked.

Fundamental Global Co-Founder Joe Moglia to serve as Executive Advisor to the Company

Maja Vujinovic, an Early Blockchain Pioneer, to Lead the Digital Asset Business

Strategic and financial investors include Galaxy Digital, Kraken, Hivemind Capital, Syncracy Capital, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and Kenetic

Charlotte, NC, July 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fundamental Global Inc. (Nasdaq: FGF, FGFPP) (the “Company” or “Fundamental Global”) today announced the pricing and signing of a private placement for the purchase and sale of 40,000,000 prefunded common stock warrants at a price of $5.00 (inclusive of the $0.001 exercise price) per warrant for expected aggregate gross proceeds of $200 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses (funded in a combination of cash and cryptocurrencies) to launch the Company's Ethereum treasury strategy.

Fundamental Global offers investors a capital markets vehicle engineered for Ethereum - the foundation of digital finance and settlement layer for the majority of stablecoins, DeFi, and tokenized assets. The Company's structure aims to provide investors with multiple value drivers beyond ETH price appreciation, including staking rewards that support network security and access to tokenized real-world asset opportunities. With industry leaders bridging Wall Street, Decentralized Finance, and backed by world-class financial and digital assets institutions, the Company is uniquely positioned to help support the rapid adoption of Ethereum by the global financial ecosystem, which already has stablecoins leading the way.

Strategic and financial investors participating in the private placement include Galaxy Digital (Nasdaq: GLXY), one of the world's leading digital asset investment firms led by CEO Mike Novogratz. Galaxy will also serve as a strategic advisor to Fundamental Global, managing its Ethereum treasury and providing asset management, yield execution, and infrastructure support. Other strategic investors include Kraken, who will work with FG Nexus strategically on treasury management and staking. The private placement saw participation from top tier global financial institutions as well as Hivemind Capital, Syncracy Capital, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and Kenetic.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to purchase ETH, which will serve as the Company's primary treasury reserve asset. In addition to its Ethereum treasury and staking strategy, the Company is in a unique position to apply its digital expertise in its merchant banking and reinsurance businesses to fuel the adoption of the Ethereum blockchain in real-world finance. As part of the transformation, the Company will rebrand as FG Nexus Inc., with new ticker symbols FGNX and FGNXP expected to go live shortly.

The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about August 1, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Following the closing of the offering FG Nexus's digital asset strategy will be led by a deeply experienced team:

Maja Vujinovic, CEO of Digital Assets, is an early pioneer, investor, and operator in cryptocurrencies, blockchain and AI. She helped shape the industry by acquiring the first bank for Tether and in her role as CIO of Emerging Technologies at GE, where she launched one of the first institutional-grade finance transactions on blockchain in 2015.

Theodore Rosenthal, President of Digital Assets, is a hedge fund founder and manager of TMR Capital which is focused on value and event-driven equity strategies. TMR Capital is an advisor to over $2 billion in family office capital across equities and crypto and was an early investor in AI and crypto projects such asMaker, Aave, and Hyperliquid. Mr. Rosenthal is a Member of the Value Investors Club and a frequent speaker at MOI Global and other forums.

Said Moglia, “Throughout my career, I have seen foundational shifts that fundamentally alter global markets. Ethereum is the foundation layer for the next generation of financial services, and I believe that what we are creating at FG Nexus is the most strategic way for investors to not only gain access to ETH, but also participate in the future of the world's fast evolving financial system.”

Kyle Cerminara, CEO and Chairman of the Company, stated, “This marks a pivotal moment in our evolution. FG Nexus will leverage our deep capabilities in merchant banking, reinsurance, and capital markets to unlock the full potential of Ethereum as a reserve asset. We're honored to welcome Joe Moglia in an advisory capacity and thrilled to have Maja, Jose, and Theodore at the helm of our digital asset strategy. This is the future of capital allocation.”

Maja Vujinovic, CEO of the Digital Asset division, added, “Ethereum isn't just infrastructure, it's personal. As CIO of GE, I helped bring Ethereum inside one of the world's largest companies, working with Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder, to explore smart contracts across a variety of business lines. That conviction hasn't changed At FG Nexus, we're building the institutional-grade rails for Ethereum treasuries, secure, transparent, yield-driven. With today marking Ethereum's 10-year anniversary, I am thrilled to be part of the next chapter in a journey that started a decade ago.”

Immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments are common in cancers such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (MASH-HCC)1,2,3. Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood4. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation5,6,7. Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways8,9,10,11,12. Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC.

Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support unchecked growth and to evade immune surveillance13,14. These metabolic adaptations often involve enhanced glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, enabling sustained biomass production and proliferation. At the same time, these pathways reshape the tumour microenvironment by limiting the availability of key nutrients, and by generating immunosuppressive byproducts such as lactate and succinate13,14. As a result, tumour metabolism not only fuels intrinsic cancer cell growth but also contributes to immune evasion. HCC exemplifies the interplay between metabolic dysfunction and immune suppression. Although once primarily linked to viral hepatitis, alcohol and toxins, HCC is increasingly driven by MASH1,15,16. MASH-HCC arises in a distinctly immunosuppressive hepatic microenvironment that is resistant to immunotherapy compared with viral-driven disease1,15,16. Although recent clinical observations suggest that features such as intratumoural steatosis17, reduced B cell infiltration3 and downregulation of the chemokine CXCL13 (ref. 17) may influence immune responsiveness in MASH-HCC, the mechanisms linking tumour metabolism to immune regulation remain poorly defined.

ACLY functions at a key metabolic junction, converting citrate into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, thereby linking carbohydrate availability to fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and histone acetylation5,6,7. Through these roles, ACLY supports both the anabolic growth demands of tumour cells and epigenetic regulation of gene expression5,6,7. Although ACLY inhibition has been shown to suppress tumour proliferation in many preclinical models18,19,20, its therapeutic potential has been questioned due to compensatory upregulation of alternative acetyl-CoA-generating pathways, including acetate CoA synthetase 2 (ACCS2)8,10, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)9,10, pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2)11 and fatty acid oxidation12, that may bypass ACLY dependency. However, most studies have largely relied on cell lines and xenograft models that lack intact immune systems and do not reflect the immune-metabolic complexity of solid tumours such as MASH-HCC. Of note, although ACLY is upregulated in HCC and reduced expression correlates with improved survival, previous studies have focused predominantly on viral-related or toxin-related HCC1,21,22,23,24,25, leaving its role in MASH-HCC unexplored. Given the immunosuppressive nature of the MASH-HCC microenvironment and the emerging links with metabolism, we hypothesized that ACLY may serve as a key metabolic regulator of tumour–immune interactions.

To model MASH-HCC, male C57BL/6J mice were injected with diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) and then maintained on a control chow (control-DEN) or a high-fat/fructose Western diet with physiologically relevant levels of cholesterol26 (WD-DEN) starting at 8 weeks for 28 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Compared with control-DEN mice, WD-DEN mice showed increased liver weights, liver:body weight ratios and significantly elevated levels of plasma α-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker of HCC (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Histological analysis confirmed enhanced steatosis, ballooning and inflammation in WD-DEN livers (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f), along with a marked increase in surface tumours and tumour burden (Extended Data Fig. 1g–k). Lesions were histologically classified as non-neoplastic or neoplastic, the latter showing features typical of human MASH-HCC, including macrovesicular or microvesicular steatosis, ballooning, Mallory–Denk bodies and lymphocyte infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 1l). WD-DEN mice developed more neoplastic lesions (Extended Data Fig. 1m) with significant macrovesicular or microvesicular steatosis, ballooning and lymphocyte infiltration that were pathologically similar to those of humans with MASH-HCC27 (Extended Data Fig. 1n). To assess relevance to human MASH-HCC, we performed bulk RNA sequencing of tumours and compared gene expression with patient samples and two other models: control-DEN28 and WD-CCl4 (FAT-MASH)29 (Extended Data Fig. 1o). The majority (8 out of 9) of WD-DEN tumours uniquely matched the Hoshida S1 subtype found in patients with MASH-HCC, whereas control-DEN and WD-CCl4 aligned with S2 or S3 subtypes (Extended Data Fig. 1p,q). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) validated immunological similarity, with lymphocytes and AFP+ and GPC3+ tumour cells in WD-DEN and WD-CCl4 mice having similar correlation coefficients to humans with MASH-HCC (Extended Data Fig. 1r). Acly expression was broadly distributed across cell types in WD-DEN livers, mirroring the human condition (Extended Data Fig. 1s,t). Together, these findings demonstrate that the WD-DEN model recapitulates key pathological, molecular and immune features of advanced human MASH-HCC.

Having validated the relevance of the WD-DEN model, we replicated the study using Acly-floxed (Aclyfl/fl) mice8. To control for baseline tumour burden, mice were stratified by plasma AFP levels at 28 weeks, and two groups with equivalent AFP levels were injected with hepatocyte-targeted adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8)-TTR vectors expressing either YFP (wild type (WT)) or Cre recombinase (Acly knockout (KO)) to induce hepatocyte-specific Acly deletion (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Eight weeks post-injection, immunohistochemistry showed marked reductions in ACLY expression in both tumoural and non-tumoural hepatocytes of Acly-KO mice, but not in infiltrating immune or mesenchymal cells such as endothelial and Kupffer cells (Fig. 1b–e). Pathology analysis showed similar scores for liver steatosis, ballooning and inflammation between genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 2c), but biochemical assessment of non-tumour liver tissue revealed reduced levels of several fatty acids in Acly-KO mice (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Despite comparable liver pathology, Acly-KO mice exhibited markedly fewer surface tumours (Fig. 1f–i) and reduced tumour surface area (Extended Data Fig. 2e) than WT controls. Fewer than 30% of Acly-KO mice had more than 30 surface tumours, versus 90% of WT mice (Fig. 1h). Histological classification indicated that this reduction was driven primarily by an approximately 70% decrease in neoplastic lesions, with many Acly-KO mice having none (Fig. 1i), alongside a trend towards fewer non-neoplastic proliferative lesions (P = 0.0563; Extended Data Fig. 2f). Neoplastic lesions in Acly-KO mice had reduced steatosis (Fig. 1j), consistent with smaller lipid droplet size (Extended Data Fig. 2g), lower tumour lipid area (Fig. 1k) and reductions in fatty acids (Fig. 1l). These findings demonstrate that hepatocyte-specific Acly deletion in a physiologically relevant MASH-HCC model reduces tumour number, size, severity and lipid content.

Source data

Over the past three decades, several ACLY inhibitors have been described5. Bempedoic acid competitively inhibits ACLY activity and allosterically activates AMP-activated protein kinase-β1 (AMPKβ1)-containing complexes when converted to bempedoic acid-CoA in hepatocytes30. In mice, it lowers MASH26, and in phase III studies, reduces LDL-cholesterol and cardiovascular events31. Potent allosteric ACLY inhibitors have also been developed32, but poor bioavailability and/or cell permeability have hindered development5. To identify more potent and cell-permeable ACLY inhibitors, we conducted a phenotypic screen in primary mouse hepatocytes, evaluating fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis across a library of compounds varying in hydrocarbon chain length, terminal functional groups and core chemical substitutions. Several candidates inhibited lipogenesis (Supplementary Table 1 and originally disclosed in ref. 33), with EVT0185, selected for further study due to strong inhibition of de novo lipogenesis (−84% at 100 µM, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 0.46 µM; Fig. 2a). Like bempedoic acid, EVT0185 was converted to EVT0185-CoA in rat liver microsomes (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Because HEK293 cells lack long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity34, we engineered stable lines expressing SLC27A1 (also known as FATP1 and ACSVL5), SLC27A2 (also known as FATP2 and ACSVL1), SLC27A4 (also known as FATP4 and ACSVL4) and SLC27A5 (also known as FATP5 and ACSVL6) to identify the activating enzyme (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Incubation of HEK293 cells with EVT0185 followed by mass spectrometry analysis indicated that only cells expressing SLC27A2 generated the CoA thioester (Extended Data Fig. 3f–h). Transcriptomic analyses revealed that SLC27A2 is upregulated in livers of people with MASH or MASH-HCC compared with healthy controls (Extended Data Fig. 3i), with no expression in immune cells per the protein atlas and single-cell datasets (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Consistent with this, EVT0185 had no effect on B cell or T cell proliferation in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 3k–o). These data indicate that EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester by SLC27A2, in the liver and tumours but not in immune cells of MASH-HCC.

Source data

ACLY is inhibited by palmitoyl-CoA5, therefore we hypothesized that the conversion of EVT0185 to its CoA thioester may drive the inhibition of ACLY activity. In cell-free assays, EVT0185-CoA (not the unconjugated diacid) inhibited recombinant human ACLY (hACLY) activity (Fig. 2b) and this effect was competitive with CoA (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 4a). hACLY is a 1,101-residue polypeptide forming a functional 0.5-MDa tetramer and featuring an N-terminal citryl-CoA synthetase (CCS) module, consisting of CCSβ and CCSα regions, and a C-terminal citrate synthase homology (CSH) domain that serves as the oligomerization platform of the ACLY enzyme and contains the CoA-binding site32,35 (Fig. 2e). The catalytic itinerary of ACLY starts in the CCS module, which catalyses the ATP-driven formation of citryl-CoA (Fig. 2e). Shuttling of this high-energy reaction intermediate to the CSH module of ACLY, facilitated by flipping of the long pantothenyl-arm of citryl-CoA, positions the citryl-thioester moiety in the CSH active site where citryl-CoA undergoes retro-aldol cleavage into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA35,36. To directly examine the molecular interactions by which EVT0185-CoA inhibits hACLY, the ACLY–(R,S)-EVT0185-CoA complex was characterized using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4b). A 3D reconstruction without the application of symmetry had a resolution of 3.7 Å following a gold-standard refinement (Extended Data Fig. 4c) and revealed a pseudo-D2-symmetric ACLY assembly where four CCS modules arrange around the central CSH module (Fig. 2g). Markedly, the cryo-EM map for one CCS module was poorly defined, indicating structural heterogeneity in this region. Inspection of the cryo-EM map revealed clear density corresponding to the ligand at all four CoA-binding sites situated at the interface between the four CCS modules and the central CSH module of the ACLY holoenzyme (Extended Data Fig. 4d). To resolve this pseudo-D2-symmetric assembly at a higher resolution, we applied symmetry expansion in combination with local refinement followed by 3D classification (Extended Data Fig. 4c). This approach improved the overall map quality (Fourier shell correlation of 0.143 (FSC0.143) = 3.3 Å; Fig. 2h,i, Extended Data Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 2) and ligand density, which we interpreted as representing the adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-diphosphate moiety of bound EVT0185-CoA with the pantothenyl arm and dicarboxylic acid moiety disordered (Fig. 2j). On the basis of this experimentally observed binding mode, which is analogous to the binding of CoA to ACLY (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g), we speculate that ACLY-bound EVT0185-CoA may adopt both compact and extended conformations in which the terminal carboxylic acid moiety may anchor itself in the citrate-binding sites of the CSH or CCS module, respectively.

In addition to inhibiting ACLY, fatty acyl-CoAs or bempedoic acid-CoA can activate AMPK, which suppresses fatty acid and sterol synthesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and HMG-CoA reductase30,37 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). To assess potential ACLY-independent effects of EVT0185, we measured lactate incorporation into fatty acids and sterols in hepatocytes from WT and Acly-KO mice, comparing results to bempedoic acid at equimolar doses (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We also tested both compounds for their ability to inhibit acetate incorporation, a process independent of ACLY but sensitive to ACC and/or ACSS2 inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 5c). In WT hepatocytes, EVT0185 more potently inhibited fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis from lactate and acetate than bempedoic acid, with differences amplified in Acly-KO cells, suggesting that additional targets may be involved (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Cell-free assays revealed that, unlike bempedoic acid30, EVT0185-CoA inhibited rather than activated AMPKβ1-containing complexes (Extended Data Fig. 5d), and also inhibited ACC1, ACC2 and ACSS2 (Extended Data Fig. 5e–g). EVT0185 also suppressed clonogenic survival of human (Hep3B) and mouse (Hepa1-6) HCC cell lines more effectively than bempedoic acid (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Given the role of AMPK in pro-survival signalling38 and the compensatory upregulation of ACSS2 upon ACLY inhibition8,9,12, these findings highlight key mechanistic differences between EVT0185 and bempedoic acid and supported continued development of EVT0185 for HCC.

Having established mechanisms for EVT0185 inhibition of ACLY, we subsequently examined in vivo efficacy. Compared with vehicle-treated controls, oral administration of EVT0185 reduced the respiratory exchange ratio within 1 h, an effect sustained for up to 5 h, indicating rapid and sustained inhibition of lipogenesis and/or increase in fatty acid oxidation (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Oral EVT0185 dosing inhibited hepatic lipogenesis from 14C-glucose in a dose-dependent manner, with a trend at 10 mg kg−1 (−18%) and significant reductions at 30 mg kg−1 (−56%, P = 0.02) and 60 mg kg−1 (−69%, P = 0.005; Extended Data Fig. 6b), indicating oral bioavailability. We then tested EVT0185 in three mouse models, spanning both prevention and treatment of MASH-HCC. In the WD-DEN model (described initially in Extended Data Fig. 1), mice were randomized by AFP and treated daily with vehicle, EVT0185 (30 or 100 mg kg−1) or bempedoic acid (100 mg kg−1) for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). EVT0185 reduced tumour burden, whereas bempedoic acid had limited efficacy (Fig. 3a,b). Similar to Acly-KO mice, EVT0185 also reduced tumour surface area and lipid accumulation (Extended Data Fig. 6e–g). In the WD-CCl4 prevention model, in which MASH and fibrosis are present by 12 weeks but tumours have not yet formed29,39, EVT0185 nearly eliminated tumour development (Fig. 3c–e). In an 18-month WD model without DEN or CCl4, mice with elevated levels of AFP were randomized to vehicle or EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1) for 4 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 6h). EVT0185 again drastically reduced tumour number (Fig. 3f,g). To assess therapeutic potential, we treated WD-CCl4 mice with established tumours starting at 19 weeks. EVT0185 reduced tumour burden and nodule size comparably with sorafenib and lenvatinib (Fig. 3h–j and Extended Data Fig. 6i), and in combination with lenvatinib, led to complete tumour remission in 8% of animals (Fig. 3j). Finally, combining EVT0185 with anti-PDL1 and VEGFR antibodies in the WD-CCl4 model markedly reduced tumour burden and the proportion of animals with more than 25 tumours, overcoming the limited efficacy of immunotherapy alone (Fig. 3k–m and Extended Data Fig. 6j). These data indicate that EVT0185 reduces tumour burden in diverse mouse models of MASH-HCC and improves the efficacy of current standards of care.

To explore mechanisms underlying reduced tumour burden in Acly-KO mice, we performed bulk RNA-seq on liver tumours from WT (n = 9) and Acly-KO (n = 12) mice at two timepoints following AAV injection: a late timepoint (8 weeks; Fig. 1a–h and Extended Data Fig. 2) and an early timepoint (4 weeks), before detectable differences in tumour burden (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Including the early timepoint allowed us to assess whether transcriptional changes precede tumour reduction. Acly expression was significantly reduced at both timepoints (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d), although less so at the later stage, possibly due to clonal selection or infiltration by non-hepatocyte cell types. In contrast to previous reports in hepatocytes26,40, but similar to findings in pancreatic islets41, the expression of Acss2 was not significantly upregulated at either timepoint (Fig. 4a).

Time-adjusted analysis revealed 367 upregulated and 333 downregulated genes in Acly-KO tumours, with enrichment of antitumour gene sets, including reduced tumour growth size (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Metabolically, Acly-KO tumours showed higher citrate and lower succinate levels, corresponding with reduced expression of Acly and succinate-CoA ligase subunits Suclg1 and Sucla2 (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h). Unexpectedly, genes linked to leukocyte proliferation and migration were significantly upregulated in Acly-KO tumours (Fig. 4b). Semantic clustering identified nine immune-enriched biological process clusters, including T cell and B cell activation, IFNα or IFNγ responses, and leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 7i). As tumour burden was unchanged at 4 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 7b), these early immune-related signatures suggested a potential causal role. Supporting this, gene networks inversely correlated with both Acly expression and tumour burden were enriched for immune processes (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). Finally, gene expression deconvolution, using TIMER2, revealed a consistent negative correlation between Acly levels and B cell infiltration (Fig. 4d), suggesting a potentially important connection between Acly, immunogenicity and tumour burden.

To further investigate tumour–immune interactions, we performed spatial transcriptomics on livers from WD-DEN, WT or Acly-KO mice (Fig. 4e,f) and from WD-CCL4-treated, vehicle-treated or EVT0185-treated (100 mg kg−1) mice (Fig. 4k,l). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of spatially resolved tumour cells showed increased fatty acid and lipid metabolism in both Acly-KO mice (Fig. 4g,h) and EVT0185-treated mice (Fig. 4m,n). Spatial analysis also revealed a selective increase in the number of B cells, but not in the number of T cells, macrophages or natural killer T cells, in tumours from Acly-KO and EVT0185-treated mice (Fig. 4f,l and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Using established markers, we found that these B cells were predominantly plasma cells, which mediate antibody production (Fig. 4i,o). Gene Ontology analysis of B cells confirmed enrichment of fatty acid metabolism pathways, supporting their role in plasma cell differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Similar findings were observed in scRNA-seq datasets from EVT0185-treated WD-DEN and WD-CCl4 tumours (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). The levels of Cxcl13, a key B cell chemoattractant known to be reduced in MASH-HCC17, were elevated in tumours from both Acly-KO and EVT0185-treated mice (Fig. 4j,p), a finding replicated in publicly available RNA-seq data from WT and Acly-KO DEN-induced tumours cultured in vitro10 (GSE223966; Extended Data Fig. 8f). These data indicate that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ACLY in MASH-HCC leads to increases in tumour CXCL13 levels and plasma B cell numbers.

To further interrogate the inferred cell populations obtained from the RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic analysis, we examined similar-sized, neoplastic lesions from the livers of WT and Acly-KO mice using multiplexed ion-beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) imaging, which enables single-cell protein profiling42. A 21-antibody Lanthanide panel (Supplementary Table 3) and FlowSOM clustering identified nine cell types in amounts greater than 0.5% of the total cell population: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD11b+ macrophages, CD11c+ macrophage/dendritic cells, F4/80+ macrophages, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, endothelial–mesothelial cells and tumour cells (Fig. 5a). Consistent with the transcriptomic datasets, Acly-KO mice had increases in the number of B cells at the tumour periphery, with non-significant increases in T cells or other immune cell populations (Fig. 5b–d); findings that were confirmed using immunohistochemical staining of CD19+ B cells (Fig. 5e). These changes were accompanied by reductions in the levels of lipid droplet-associated protein (PLIN2) and increases in CXCL13 protein expression (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are B cell aggregations that have been associated with improved HCC outcomes43. Detailed analysis of the tumour B cell infiltrates by a pathologist blinded to the treatments revealed that although diffuse and peripheral B cell infiltrations were observed in tumours from both genotypes, B cell aggregations resembling TLSs were predominantly observed in Acly-KO mice (80%; Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). MIBI spatial mapping showed B cells near antigen-presenting cells (CD11c+, CD4+) in Acly-KO tumours (Fig. 5g–i and Extended Data Fig. 9f). This pattern was also seen in tumours from WD-CCl4 EVT0185-treated mice without significantly altering T cell counts (Extended Data Fig. 9g–n). Supporting their functional role, scRNA-seq revealed upregulation of complement activation and cytotoxicity pathways in B cells from EVT0185-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 9o). Reduced tumour burden in Acly-KO and EVT0185-treated mice was accompanied by lower Ki67 and higher cleaved caspase 3 levels at the tumour edge (Extended Data Fig. 10a–f). As AAV8-TTR-Cre does not target immune cells (Fig. 1e) and EVT0185 is inactive in them (Extended Data Fig. 3), these findings across multiple platforms (RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, scRNA-seq, MIBI and immunohistochemistry) strongly implicate B cells as key mediators of the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition.

Source data

To determine whether the immunogenic response was important for reducing tumour burden in response to genetic inhibition of Acly, we generated an inducible system for knocking down ACLY expression in the human Hep3B cell line (Extended Data Fig. 10g) for orthotopic implantation in immunodeficient NRG mice. As anticipated, Acly knockdown reduced glucose incorporation into triglycerides and led to compensatory upregulation of acetate incorporation into triglycerides (Extended Data Fig. 10h,i). In addition, inducible knockdown increased fatty acid oxidation (Extended Data Fig. 10j). However, despite these anticipated changes in metabolic activity, Acly knockdown did not impair orthotopic tumour growth in immunodeficient mice (Extended Data Fig. 10k,l). This suggests that alterations in lipid metabolism without a functional adaptive immune system was not sufficient for reducing tumour burden.

To more specifically address whether an increase in tumour-infiltrating B cells is critical for the reduced tumour burden in Acly-KO mice, we established MASH-HCC in Aclyfl/fl mice as described in Fig. 1. After 28 weeks, AFP levels were assessed, and mice were randomized to four distinct groups based on this parameter before injection with either AAV8-YFP (WT) or AAV8-TTR-Cre (KO), and treatment with an anti-CD20 antibody, which depletes B cells44 (Fig. 5j). As anticipated, the anti-CD20 antibody eliminated B220+CD19+ B cells compared with isotype control-injected mice (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). In WT animals, the depletion of B cells had no effect on the number of visible surface tumours (Fig. 5k–m). Consistent with our previous findings (Fig. 1), Acly-KO mice had large reductions in visible surface tumours when treated with isotype control; however, these effects were eliminated following the depletion of B cells (Fig. 5k–m). These data indicate that the reduction in tumour burden elicited by the inhibition of ACLY in mice with MASH-HCC requires B cells.

To assess the relevance of ACLY inhibition in human MASH-HCC, we first analysed the microarray dataset15 (GSE164760), comparing tumour, non-tumour adjacent, MASH, cirrhotic and healthy liver tissue. ACLY was one of 73 genes consistently upregulated in MASH-HCC across all pairwise comparisons (Fig. 5n and Extended Data Fig. 12a,b), suggesting that its overexpression in malignant tissue is not confounded by intermediate disease states. This pattern was not observed for other lipogenic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, ACSS2 or FASN (Extended Data Fig. 12c). Supporting this, snRNA-seq datasets confirmed that increased ACLY expression in malignant hepatocytes versus normal hepatocytes from patients with MASH-HCC (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 12d).

We next explored the relationship between ACLY and tumour immunogenicity. Similar to our mouse models, ACLY expression inversely correlated with B cell marker expression in human MASH-HCC (Fig. 5p), and cell deconvolution analyses showed higher ACLY levels associated with reduced B cell infiltration (Fig. 5q). To understand the pathways underlying ACLY overexpression, we performed differential gene expression modelling followed by weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) module analysis (Extended Data Fig. 12e,f). CXCL13 expression was significantly reduced in tumours with high ACLY expression and increased in those with low expression, mirroring mouse data (Extended Data Fig. 12g). Gene co-expression modules linked to high levels of ACLY were enriched for metabolic pathways—including macromolecule biosynthesis, aerobic respiration and acetylation—whereas they were negatively associated with immune-related features (Extended Data Fig. 12h,i). These findings reinforce a conserved inverse relationship between ACLY expression and tumour immunogenicity across human and mouse MASH-HCC.

This study reveals an unexpected immunoregulatory role for ACLY in MASH-HCC. Although ACLY is well known for its metabolic function in suppressing fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, we have demonstrated that hepatocyte-specific ACLY deletion not only suppresses intratumoural steatosis and proliferation but also enhances antitumour immunity. Genetic inhibition of ACLY increased tumour infiltration by B cells and upregulated the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13, promoting the formation of TLSs, immune niches associated with favourable prognosis in HCC and other solid tumours17,43,45,46,47. Crucially, B cell depletion abolished the antitumour effect of ACLY inhibition, confirming their essential role. As these tumour-suppressive effects in the Acly KO occurred independently of changes in liver histology, and the TTR-Cre promoter used to induce deletion does not affect immune cells26, these studies provide surprising findings about how inhibiting ACLY not only suppresses tumour proliferation but also enhances immunogenicity. Our findings indicating a critical role for B cells are consistent with emerging studies involving mouse models and patients with HCC that have shown favourable outcomes linked to increased tumoural B cell infiltration and TLSs48,49,50,51,52,53,54. These effects were associated with increases in the B cell chemokine CXCL13, which has been shown to be important for predicting response rates to immunotherapy in MASH-HCC. The precise mechanisms by which ACLY inhibition increases CXCL13 and TLS formation remain undefined; however, future studies investigating whether reductions in the levels of tumour metabolites such as fatty acids and succinate or increase in the levels of citrate directly impact tumoural B cell recruitment and formation of TLSs or, alternatively, whether there are reductions in the level of CXCL13 promoter acetylation will be important.

We developed and characterized EVT0185, a novel, orally available small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, which phenocopied the immune and antitumour effects of genetic ACLY deletion. EVT0185 is activated in hepatocytes via SLC27A2-dependent conversion to its CoA-thioester form, allowing liver-specific action while sparing non-hepatic tissues. In multiple MASH-HCC mouse models, EVT0185 reduced tumour burden and synergized with current standards of care, including lenvatinib or anti-PDL1 and VEGFR antibodies. Structural cryo-EM analysis demonstrated that EVT0185-CoA binds directly to the ACLY CoA-binding pocket, supporting a clear mechanistic basis for its inhibitory action. Like the Acly-KO model, EVT0185 treatment was associated with increased plasma cell differentiation and complement-mediated cytotoxic pathways. Although our data strongly support ACLY as the principal target of EVT0185 in driving tumour immunogenicity, it remains possible that other targets may be important as we found that this compound also reduced acetate incorporation into fatty acids and sterols, an effect that was independent of ACLY. However, analysis of MASH-HCC tumours in humans mirrored our findings in Acly-KO mice, with ACLY expression but not ACSS2, ACC1/ACC2 or FAS being inversely correlated with B cell infiltration. Together, these data in both mice and humans strongly suggest that inhibition of ACLY is the primary driver of the enhanced tumour immunogenicity, mediated by EVT0185. EVT0185 was inactive in cultured immune cell populations, consistent with their low expression of Slc27a2, as activated T cells and macrophages require ACLY to elicit effector function. Together, these data position EVT0185 as a promising candidate for targeting ACLY in MASH-HCC.

In conclusion, these studies have shown that genetic inhibition of ACLY in MASH-driven mouse models of HCC promotes the infiltration of tumour-infiltrating B cells and that this is critical for reducing tumour burden. Similar effects are also observed with EVT0185, a small-molecule competitive inhibitor of ACLY. These findings expand the role of tumour ACLY from a regulator of metabolism and proliferation to a mediator of antitumour immunity and suggest that targeting of tumour metabolism may be a largely untapped mechanism to improve immunotherapy response rates. As reductions in ACLY in clinical datasets are also associated with lower tumour burden and increased B cell infiltration, further studies investigating whether pharmacological inhibition of ACLY also increases immunosurveillance and reduces tumour burden in clinical populations will be important.

EVT0185 and EVT0185-CoA were synthesized at Symeres (www.symeres.com); experimental methods and compound characterization are presented in the Supplementary Information.

Animal experiments were carried out using the guidelines approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board at McMaster University (Steinberg Laboratory Animal Utilization Protocol #16-12-42, 21-01-04) or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (IACUC approval# PROTO202100080). The tumour development was monitored based on the established progression timelines for mouse HCC models. The welfare of the animals was evaluated through observation of visible masses, impaired mobility and marked weight loss. However, no specific tumour volume end points were defined for intrahepatic tumours. All experimental procedures did not exceed the limits set by the Animal Utilization Protocol or IACUC.

C57BL/6J male mice were housed within the McMaster University Central Animal Facility. At 2 weeks of age, mice were injected with DEN at 25 mg kg−1 body weight. After weaning, mice were housed with littermates and fed a normal chow diet (8640 22/5, Teklad). At 10 weeks of age, mice were maintained on chow diet (control) or switched to a high-fat and high-fructose diet (WD), which consisted of 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% wt cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets) and housed at thermoneutral conditions (26–29 oC)26. Throughout the experiments, mice were housed in ventilated cage racks with ad libitum access to food and water. An automatic timing device was used to maintain an alternating 12-h cycle of light and dark. After 29 weeks, mice were euthanized, and blood and tissues were collected.

For the WD-DEN Acly-KO mouse model (Figs. 1 and 5), at 2 weeks of age, C57BL-6/Aclyfl/fl mice (obtained from JAX) were injected with DEN at 25 mg kg−1 body weight. After weaning, mice were housed with littermates and fed a normal chow diet (8640 22/5, Teklad). At 10 weeks of age, mice were switched to a high-fat and high-fructose diet (WD): 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets) and housed at thermoneutral conditions. When the mice reached 7.5 months, they were bled from the tail vein, and plasma AFP levels were determined. Animals were grouped based on their AFP levels, so there were no differences between groups, and were then injected with AAV intravenously (AAV8-YFP or AAV8-TTR-Cre) as previously described26. After 4 (early timepoint) or 8 (late timepoint) weeks following AAV injection, mice were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood was collected by cardiac puncture. For the B cell depletion experiments, AFP levels were assessed as described above after 7.5 months, and mice were randomized before being injected with AAV intravenously (AAV8-YFP or AAV8-TTR-Cre) and intraperitoneally injected with 250 µg of isotype control (400566, BioLegend) or anti-CD20 antibody (152104, BioLegend) with tissues collected 8 weeks later.

For the WD-DEN EVT0185 and bempedoic acid study (Fig. 3), male mice housed within the McMaster University Central Animal Facility were used for these experiments. C57BL/6J mice were injected with DEN at 2 weeks of age and followed the above-mentioned protocol. Animals were grouped based on their AFP levels and orally gavaged with a single daily dose of vehicle (1.5% CMC and 0.2% Tween-20), EVT0185-30 or 100 mg kg−1 or bempedoic acid-100 mg kg−1. After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood and tissues were collected.

Male C57BL/6J mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory were used for these experiments. Mice at 6–8 weeks of age were fed ad libitum with WD (Envigo; TD.120528, Teklad Custom Research Diet) and maintained on sugar water (fructose (23.1 g l−1) + glucose (18.9 g l−1)) for the duration of the study. Animals received weekly intraperitoneal injections of CCl4 (0.2 μl, 100% CCl4 per gram of body weight) throughout the study as described below.

The prevention study was conducted after 12 weeks of CCl4 injections + WD at McMaster University with mice orally gavaged with vehicle or EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1) for 18 weeks.

The combination treatment study was conducted after 19 weeks of CCl4 injection + WD at Mont Sinai with mice orally gavaged with EVT0185 (50 or 100 mg kg−1), sorafenib p-tosylate (sorafenib; at 15 mg kg−1; S-8502, LC Laboratories), lenvatinib mesylate (lenvatinib; 7 mg kg−1; 29832, LC Laboratories) or sorafenib + EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1) or lenvatinib + EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1).

The combination study with immunotherapy was conducted after 24 weeks of CCl4 injections + WD at McMaster University with mice being injected with InVivoPlus anti-mouse PDL1 (B7-81; BP0101), and InVivoPlus anti-mouse VEGFR2 (DC101; BP0060) alone or in combination with EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1). Isotype controls received InVivoPlus rat IgG1 isotype control, horseradish peroxidase (HRP; BP0088) and InVivoPlus rat IgG2b isotype control, anti-keyhole limpet haemocyanin (LTF-2; BP0090) as a single intraperitoneal injection containing 200 µg of each antibody in a total volume of 100 µl. Antibodies were prepared in InVivoPure pH 7.0 Dilution Buffer (IP0070). After 6 weeks of treatment, animals were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood was collected by cardiac puncture.

Male C57BL/6J mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory were used for these experiments. Mice at 6 weeks of age were fed ad libitum with WD, which consisted of 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% wt cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets). Throughout the experiments, mice were housed at thermoneutral conditions (26–29 °C). An automatic timing device was used to maintain an alternating 12-h cycle of light and dark. After 18 months, AFP-positive mice were divided into two groups and received a single daily dose via gavage of either vehicle (1.5% CMC and 0.2% Tween-20) or EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1). After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood and tissues were collected. Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and serum was collected and stored at −80 °C freezer. The liver was weighed, a photo was taken and the number of visible lesions on the surface of the liver was counted and recorded. A portion of tumour-free liver (approximately 200 mg, caudate lobe) and tumours were removed, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for molecular analysis. The remainder of the liver was placed in 10% formalin, fixed for 48 h and stored in 70% ethanol until it was embedded in paraffin, sectioned and mounted on slides for histological analysis.

1 day before surgery, male NOD-Rag1nullIL2rgnull (NRG) received intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg kg−1 cyclophosphamide and subcutaneous injections of 5 mg kg−1 carprofen. One hour before surgery, Hep3B-Luc cells were resuspended on ice in a 1:1 dilution of phenol red-free Matrigel (356237, Corning) and cold PBS (10010023, Gibco), aliquoted in 50 µl volumes at a cell density of 2 × 107 cells per millilitre. During surgery, mice were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane (1001936040, Baxter), hair removed with 3-in-1 hair removal lotion (061700222611, Nair) and placed in a supine position on a heating pad, with nose fitted in an anaesthesia nose cone. The abdomen was disinfected and an approximately 2-cm horizontal incision was made below the left coastal margin from the midline of the abdomen. Separating the skin from the peritoneum, a second and smaller horizontal incision was made across the peritoneum to expose the liver. Next, the left lobe of the liver was withdrawn, stabilized and tumour cells were injected into the liver parenchyma while applying pressure using a cotton tipped applicator (4305, Dynarex) to enable haemostasis. Following injection, the liver was returned into the peritoneal cavity and the peritoneum was closed with multiple single interrupted sutures using 4-0 Vicryl sutures (J743D, Ethicon). The skin was closed using 9-mm wound clips (RS-9262, Roboz). Finally, mice received post-surgical subcutaneous injections of 5 mg kg−1 carprofen and were placed in cages on a heating pad containing diet recovery gel (72-06-5022, Clear H2O) and monitored until they were ambulatory. Mice were monitored for recovery for 7 days after surgery. Wound clips were removed on day 6, and mice were imaged for tumour progression on day 7 and weekly thereafter. Induction of in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression was achieved via supplementing drinking water with 2 mg ml−1 doxycycline (Dox; D9891, Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% sucrose starting on day 7 post-surgery and every 2–3 days thereafter. In parallel, control mice were fed with drinking water supplemented with 5% sucrose without Dox. Tumour progression was followed until the end point, which is defined as the loss of more than 20% of the body weight. Mice were culled collectively when the first mouse in the experimental cohort (Hep3B-shACLY-Luc) reached the end point. Liver and tumour tissues were weighed and collected for downstream analysis. Tumour progression was monitored via bioluminescence imaging using the IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System (124262, Perkin Elmer). Bioluminescence was achieved through intraperitoneal injection of d-luciferin dissolved in saline (S8776, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 0.15 mg g−1 of body weight. IVIS imaging was performed on the auto-exposure setting at 10-min post-injection.

Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6J mice as previously described55 and seeded in white opaque 96-well plates, and the next day were serum starved for 2 h followed by the treatment with EVT compounds (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, 10, 30, 60 and 100 µM) in the presence of 14C-acetate (1 µCi ml−1) in a concentration-dependent manner. After 4 h of treatment, plates were washed two times with 1× PBS and 100 µl microscint fluid (Microscint O, part #601361) was added to each well. Plates were wrapped with aluminium foil and were shaken at 250 rpm for 2 h. After 2 h of shaking, 14C incorporation into the lipid fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting using a TopCount NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Perkin Elmer).

To compare the effect of bempedoic acid and EVT0185 in WT and Acly-KO mice, Aclyfl/fl mice were injected with hepatocyte-targeted AAV8-TTR expressing either YFP (WT) or Cre recombinase (Acly KO) via the tail vein to induce Acly genetic deletion as previously described26. After 2 weeks, hepatocytes from each mouse were collected and de novo lipogenesis (DNL) was assessed as previously described26. In brief, the cells were resuspended in complete William's Media E and plated in six-well plates and allowed to adhere for 4 h. Cells were then washed with warm PBS and switched to fresh fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free (serum-free) William's Media E for 2 h. Following a 2-h serum starvation, cells were washed in warm PBS, then treated with serum-free media supplemented with 1 µCi ml−1 [14C]-lactate (NEC599050UC, Perkin-Elmer) or 0.5 µCi ml−1 [14C]-acetate (NEC553050UC, Perkin-Elmer) for 18 h in the presence of 1 µM of EVT0185 or bempedoic acid both of which were dissolved in DMSO. After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped with 1 M KOH/EtOH, and incubated for 2 h at 70 °C with gentle agitation. After cooling, a 1:2 mixture of H2O:n-hexane was added to each sample, vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min (1,500 rpm). The top phase was transferred to a scintillation vial combined with Ultima Gold (NC0169557, Revvity) for counting of the sterol fraction. 2 N HCl and petroleum ether were added to the remaining bottom phase, which was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min (1,500 rpm) at room temperature. The top phase was transferred to a scintillation vial for counting of the fatty acid fraction using a TopCount NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Perkin Elmer).

Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks of age) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and were fed a normal chow diet upon arrival. At approximately 10 weeks of age, mice were given a diet containing high-fat and high-fructose (rodent diet with 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets) and housed at thermoneutral conditions (26–29 °C). After 7–8 months, the mice were divided into four groups and received a single daily dose via gavage of either vehicle (1.5% CMC and 0.2% Tween-20) or EVT0185 at a dose of 10, 30 or 60 mg kg−1 for 7 days. On the morning of day 8, animals received a final dose, and after 1 h, 14C glucose (PerkinElmer) was administered at a concentration of 12 μCi per mouse in a volume of 0.1 ml in 0.9% saline (intraperitoneal). One hour after 14C glucose was given, animals were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine–xylazine (150 mg and 12.4 mg kg−1, respectively). Blood was drawn through cardiac puncture; the liver was removed, and a sample from the left lobe was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver tissue was chipped on dry ice and the weight of the chip was weight recorded (30–50 mg of tissue). Liver tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol using a bead homogenizer at 5,000 rpm for 2 × 12 s. Samples were incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C for 2 h, vortexed for 2 × 12 s, and then centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and 200 μl of 0.9% saline was added. Samples were vortexed for 2 × 12 s and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Next, 200 μl of the lower organic phase was removed and added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The amount of radioactivity in the sample was measured by scintillation counting. The number of disintegrations per minute was determined over 5 min and normalized to the amount of liver tissue. Of plasma obtained at termination, 5–10 µl was also counted and lipid per gram of tissue counts were normalized to plasma counts.

Male C57BL/6J mice were fasted overnight (approximately 12 h) until food and 30% fructose water were again made accessible the next day at 7:30. Animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for approximately 2 h. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was monitored in metabolic cages using Oxymax/CLAMS (Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System) equipment and software (Columbus Instruments). The calorimetry system consists of metabolic cages each equipped with water bottles and food hoppers connected to monitor food intake. All animals had ad libitum access to standard rodent chow and water throughout the study. Those animals with RER > 1 were administered with or without EVT0185 at a dose of 100 mg kg−1 via gavage. Animals remained in the metabolic cages and RER was monitored for 24 h.

Plasma AFP levels were determined using a mouse AFP Duoset ELISA kit (DY5369-05, R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 100 µl sample (1:1,000 in reagent diluent) was added to each well of a 96-well plate coated with mouse AFP capture antibody. Next, the plates were washed with wash buffer and 100 µl detection antibody was added to each well, followed by the Streptavidin HRP and substrate solution. The reaction was stopped by stop solution and the optical density of each well was measured in a microplate reader set to 450 nm.

Following fixation with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 48 h, the cassettes with a medial lobe of the liver were switched to 70% ethanol. Livers were then processed, paraffin-embedded, serially sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), antibodies targeted to CD3+ and CD19+ cells by the McMaster Immunology Research Centre Histology Core Facility. Images were taken using a Nikon 90i Eclipse upright microscope at indicated magnifications.

Liver histology scores were assigned to liver sections by a pathologist who was blinded to the treatment conditions. Steatosis, inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning scores were assigned from H&E-stained liver sections as described by Kleiner et al.56. NAFLD activity scores (NAS) were obtained from the sum of these three scores. The surface area of tumour in the liver was quantified using qupath software from H&E-stained slides. The quantification of tumour CD3 and CD19-positive staining was completed from the same histological sections using HALO software by an analyst who was blinded to the treatment conditions.

The H-score system was used for ACLY immunohistochemistry evaluation on tumoural and non-tumoural hepatic tissues. This was determined by the multiplication of the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic staining intensity ordinal value (0 for no, 1 for weak, 2 for medium and 3 for strong staining), which ranges from 0 to 300 possible values. The percentage of each staining intensity was taken into account by the eye and multiplied by the staining intensity. The whole tumoural areas of each liver were evaluated in ×10 magnification as well as non-tumoural areas, and H-scores were calculated separately.

Hepatic lesions were characterized into neoplastic and non-neoplastic proliferative lesions by a histopathologist according to the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice (INHAND) guidelines57. All lesions had a hepatocellular phenotype. Non-neoplastic proliferative lesions, including foci of altered hepatocytes (FAHs), are referred to as premalignant lesions because they are composed of phenotypically altered cells demonstrating a higher risk of progression to malignancy than normal cells58,59. FAHs were defined as sharply demarcated circular, oval or irregularly shaped foci with preserved hepatic architecture and without compression of surrounding liver parenchyma. The basophilic-type FAH was the dominant type observed in this study, composed of slightly smaller hepatocytes with basophilic cytoplasm and slightly enlarged pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli, showing increased mitotic activity compared with background hepatic parenchyma. Scattered eosinophilic FAHs were also identified, composed of enlarged, polygonal hepatocytes with distinctly granular and pale pink, intensely eosinophilic or ground-glass appearance, as well as few clear cells and mixed cell types of FAHs. Neoplastic lesions as HCCs were characterized by loss of normal architecture (thickened hepatocytes plates), revealing mostly solid patterns as well as focal pseudoglandular and trabecular (micro or macro) patterns, including unpaired arteries or arterioles, consist of polygonal cells with more nuclear atypia (irregular nuclear membrane, pleomorphism, increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, multinucleation and prominent nuclei), higher mitotic rate and cytoplasmic alterations include Mallory–Denk bodies and hyaline bodies57.

Frozen tumour tissue (approximately 30 mg) was homogenized with Buffer RLT (RNeasy Mini Kit, 74106, Qiagen), and RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy kit (74106, Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer G2938C with the Aligent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent).

Only samples passing the RNA integrity number threshold of 7.0 were used for sequencing. mRNA was enriched using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Isolation Module (NEB) followed by library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA library kit (NEB). Next-generation sequencing was conducted at the McMaster Genomics Facility, Farncombe Institute, McMaster University, using Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Illumina). Samples were randomly distributed across lanes of a HiSeq Rapid v2 flow cell to eliminate lane-specific effects, and single-end 50-bp reads were generated at 12.5 million clusters per sample. Sequence quality was assessed using FastQC followed by the removal of low-quality reads and adapter sequences using Cutadapt. Genome alignment was performed using HISAT2 and the Mus musculus mm10 reference genome. Quantification of reads was performed using feature Counts.

We obtained raw RNA-seq files for tumour samples derived from control-DEN and WD-CCl4 models from PRJNA488497 (ref. 28) and PRJNA386995 (ref. 29), respectively. Sequencing files were processed using the same method as described for in-house samples. Count-level expression data were adjusted for surrogate batch effect across all samples using ComBat-Seq as implemented in the sva package in R. Subsequently, adjusted expression data were normalized to transcript per million. Molecular classification of Hoshida subtypes for human sample and mouse models were performed using the nearest template prediction module as implemented in the Gene Pattern platform online. Pairwise correlation between each mouse sample and each human sample were averaged on a per-model basis for mouse models, and on a per-subtype basis for human samples. Consistent with a previous report15, we validated the unique transcriptomic enrichment of the Hoshida S1 subtype60 and depletion of the S2 subtype among patients with MASH-HCC relative to HCC of mixed aetiology shown in Extended Data Fig. 1o.

Microarray CEL files were downloaded from GSE164760. Normalization was performed using the robust multiarray average expression method implemented in Affy (v1.74.0). The HGU219 custom chip definition file was obtained from the Brainarray Microarray Lab (http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/) and used for mapping probes to gene identifiers in a one-to-one format. Surrogate variable analysis was performed using sva (v3.44.0) to identify the presence of any unknown sources of variation by modelling different types of tissue as the variable of interest.

For RNA-seq, overall and timepoint-specific differential gene expression results were obtained using the DESeq2 package (v1.36.0) by modelling the additive and interaction effect of timepoint and Acly KO. To obtain the overall result, we adjusted association of gene expression with Acly KO by a binary indicator of experimental timepoint (that is, early or late) as a confounding variable using an additive model (that is, time + Acly KO). Timepoint-specific results were obtained by modelling gene expression association using only samples belonging to either early or late timepoints. Finally, we modelled the modifying effect of timepoint on differential gene expression by using an interaction model (that is, time × Acly KO). We used a false discovery-adjusted threshold of 5% to determine gene significance. Individual sample read counts underwent variance stabilizing transformation. Gene ranks were obtained for downstream gene set enrichment analysis by performing natural logarithmic transformation of P value and applying the numerical sign of log2 fold change based on DESeq2 result.

Differential expression analysis for microarray data was performed using limma (v3.52.3). Comparisons between tissue were performed by specifying all combinations of contrast involving MASH-HCC. Comparison using ACLY expression level as an independent variable was performed by first using a linear model to identify overall fold change direction followed by a natural cubic splines model with 5 degrees of freedom to identify gene significance.

WGCNA (v1.71) in mouse tumour tissues was restricted to genes with greater than or equal to 15 counts in 75% of samples. A soft power of 14 was selected, resulting in a scale-free topology fit of 0.875 WGCNA for human MASH-HCC samples utilized a soft power of 12, resulting in a scale-free topology fit of 0.812. We constructed signed module networks for both mouse and human datasets using the robust correlation method and restricted the number of excluded outliers to 0.10 as recommended. Modules below the hierarchical clustering height of 0.25 were merged. Significant module genes and associated traits were identified using Pearson correlation and asymptotic P value for correlation.

Over-representation and gene set enrichment analysis were conducted using clusterProfiler (v4.4.4). For over-representation analyses, we further calculated fold change as the ratio of a gene-to-background ratio. We used an adjusted P value of 0.05 as the threshold for significance. To identify clusters of similar Gene Ontology terms, we utilized the semantic similarity and binary cut method implemented in simplifyEnrichment (v1.6.1).

Mouse cell-type deconvolution was performed using transcript per million normalized gene expression data and mMCP-counter (v1.1.0). Validation of B cell enrichment was performed using methods implemented in the online TIMER2.0 tool61. For human cell-type deconvolution, we used TIMER2.0 in addition to the ESTIMATE package (v1.0.13). We filtered cell types for those containing greater than 0 count in at least 75% of samples. Association with gene expression was assessed using univariate linear regression. Significance was determined using a false discovery-adjusted threshold of 5%.

Liver tissues were collected and fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 36–48 h. After fixation, the samples were immersed in a 70% alcohol solution. The liver tissues were then processed, paraffin-embedded and sectioned. RNA quality of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was tested by TapeStation system with DV200 > 30% (DV200 (distribution value 200) refers to the percentage of RNA fragments that are greater than 200 nucleotides in length). Slides with 5 µm of tissue sections were processed with deparaffinization, H&E staining, imaging, decrosslinking, hybridization, ligation, probe extension, pre-amplification and probe-based library construction to generate gene expression libraries for each tissue for sequencing. Images were taken using the Nikon 90i Eclipse upright microscope. RNA-seq was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 2000 (P2 Flow cell, 2 × 50 bp configuration) system. Sequence data from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were analysed using the Space Ranger count pipeline from 10X Genomics for raw data processing and quality control. Downstream analyses included quality control, normalization, dimensional reduction and clustering, variable gene selection, spatially variable feature detection, annotation, differential expression and integration with multiple samples using Seurat62. Spatial transcriptomics data analyses were performed using the Linux system, R, RStudio software and Python programming language. The B cell subtypes within the tumours were examined using established markers63.

Frozen mouse liver samples (WD-DEN and WD-CCl4 HCC models) were minced, fixed and dissociated following the 10X Genomics ‘tissue fixation and dissociation for chromium-fixed RNA profiling' protocol (document number CG000553, Rev B). Probe hybridization, library construction and sequencing followed the 10X Genomics ‘chromium-fixed RNA profiling reagent kits for multiplexed Samples' (document number CG000527, Rev D). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencing system (S4, 2 × 150, 2–2.5 billion reads, targeting 5,000 cells per sample at a depth of 25,000 read pairs per cell). Demultiplexing was performed using Cell Ranger via the 10X Genomics Cloud Analysis platform. Demultiplexed samples were integrated by condition and processed in R using Seurat v5.

Mouse–human correlation analysis was performed in R. Mouse gene symbols were converted to their 1-to-1 orthologous human EnsemblIDs using the biomaRt package. Normalized count data were filtered for each dataset to include only genes common between all datasets. Each dataset was then filtered to include only cells expressing specific marker genes (those encoding CD45, AFP or GPC3, respectively). Pairwise Pearson correlation values were calculated between the human MASH-HCC data64 and WD-CCl4 mouse data15, using normalized gene expression in the relevant cell type. Results were visualized with the pheatmap package. Human gene-specific mean expression data were generated with Seurat (v5) in R. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess the significance of differential expression of ACLY and SLC27A2 in different human conditions, relative to the MASH-HCC condition (P < 0.05 considered significant).

Single-nucleus sequencing of cells derived from healthy, MASLD, MASH-HCC tumour and tumour-adjacent tissue were obtained from GSE174748 and GSE189175 (ref. 64) and processed using the Seurat package (v5.1.0) in R. We applied sctransform to normalize RNA read counts using the default selection of 3,000 genes as the number of variable features. Transformed counts underwent dimension reduction using principal component analysis. The 30 most variable components were then selected for uniform manifold approximation and projection. Clusters were then identified using the Louvain clustering method at a resolution of 0.2. Cell types were identified using the automated cell-type assignment pipeline as implemented in the sc-type package in R65. We utilized the custom gene set containing liver-specific cell-type expression markers provided by the GepLiver resource66. SCT normalized counts were used for this analysis. Low-confidence clusters based on the default score threshold was assigned with the ‘unknown' cell type. The proportion of cells expressing ACLY was determined for hepatocytes and malignant hepatocytes and compared between tumour and non-tumour adjacent tissues using χ2 test of independence.

Tissues were sectioned (4-µm-thick sections) onto gold-coated MIBI slides. Slides were baked at 65 °C for 1 h, followed by deparaffinization and rehydration in sequential washes in xylene (3×), 100% ethanol (3×), 95% ethanol (2×), 70% ethanol (2×) and MIBI-water. Antigen retrieval in a pH 9 Target Antigen Retrieval Solution (DAKO Agilent) occurred at 125 °C for 40 min in a Decloaking Chamber (Biocare Medical). After cooling to room temperature, slides were washed twice in TBS-T (Ionpath). The tissue was incubated in a blocking buffer consisting of 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in TBS-T for 20 min. The antibody panel consisting of metal-tagged antibodies supplied by Ionpath was diluted in blocking buffer and added to the tissue for overnight incubation at 4 °C in a moisture chamber. After overnight incubation, tissues were fixed and dehydrated in sequential washes in TBS-T (3×), 2% glutaraldehyde (5 min), Tris pH 8.5 (3×), MIBI-water (2×), 70% ethanol (2×), 90% ethanol (2×), 95% ethanol (2×) and 100% ethanol (3×). Slides were stored in a desiccator before MIBIscope analysis. The antibody panels and reagents are listed in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.

Spectral images of stained liver lesions were collected using an Ionpath MIBIscope with multiplexed ion-beam imaging technology. Xenon primary ions from a Hyperion ion gun rastered across the slide to sputter stained tissue, which was detected by mass spectrometry by time of flight to reconstruct the spectral images, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, of each channel consisting of a single stained antibody. A more detailed description of the multiplexed ion-beam imaging technology has been previously described42. Spectral images of 400 × 400-µm regions of interest (ROIs) were selected with the assistance of a pathologist and the images were collected using an Ionpath MIBIscope with multiplexed ion-beam imaging technology. These high-resolution images were denoised and filtered, and with the nuclear and membrane channels, we created segmentation masks using Mesmer67. For Acly-KO cohort, 35 400 × 400-µm regions for each experimental group, representing 43,974 cell objects, were acquired, whereas for the EVT0185 cohort, 24 400 × 400-µm regions for each experimental group were collected for a total of 30,191 cell objects.

Multiplexed raw image sets were denoised and aggregate filtered using Ionpath's MIBI/O software using the default correction settings. Processed image data were stored as TIFF files for further data processing and analysis.

Whole-cell segmentation was performed with the input of the nuclear stained and the membrane-stained marker channels using Mesmer67, and the segmentation mask images were stored as TIFF files for further analysis in R Studio.

Single-cell data were extracted for all cell objects defined by the segmentation masks using a custom R script and packages described in Supplementary Table 5 (refs. 68,69,70,71). The aim of the single-cell analysis was to classify each of the objects in terms of their individual marker intensities to construct a profile of the tissue architecture and identify the proximity and relative spatial distribution of cells and features across the tumours. Marker intensities were asinh transformed by a cofactor of 1. To classify cell types based on their marker expression levels, the FlowSOM clustering algorithm was used with the Bioconductor ‘FlowSOM' R package72. The algorithm clustered the single cells from the cohort into 100 FlowSOM clusters. By inspecting a heatmap displaying normalized individual marker intensities, we annotated each of the 100 clusters into ten cell types.

The tumour ROIs were selected based on the presence or high abundance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Regions with the highest CD45-positive marker expression were selectively chosen as the representative of the cohort. The invasive margin was defined at the border of the malignant tumour and mostly consisted of approximately 50% malignant and 50% non-malignant tissue. The tumour and non-tumour regions were omitted from analysis. For each treatment group, four tumours were sampled for a total area of 1.6 mm2.

We used the imcRtools package to detect cellular neighbourhoods. A spatial graph was constructed by detecting the k-nearest neighbours in 2D per cell73. First, for each cell, we used the aggregateNeigbors function to compute the fraction of cells of a certain cell type among its neighbours. Second, for each cell, the function aggregated the expression counts across all neighbouring cells. On the basis of the fraction of the different cell types among the ten nearest neighbours, k-means clustering was used to group cells into a user-defined number of cellular neighbourhoods. The choice of six cellular neighbourhoods was determined by a parameter sweep across varying k values.

Morphometric lipid droplet analysis was adapted from the previously published article74. In brief, H&E sections of tumour-bearing livers were processed using ImageJ for the average size of lipid droplets and average lipid area. Original H&E-stained slides were converted to an 8-bit greyscale image, which was then black and white inverted. These images were used for lipid droplet analysis using the following plugin: run (‘Analyze Particles…', ‘size = 50–20,000', circularity = 0.50–1.00 display summarize'), which defined the upper and lower limits to a lipid droplet area (50–20,000 µm2)75 to exclude irregular-shaped structures (lipid droplets are more spherical).

Quantitation of free fatty acid levels was carried out using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–multiple reaction monitoring–mass spectrometry (UPLCMRM–MS) method as previously described76. In brief, a stock solution of fatty acids was prepared with their standard substances in LC–MS grade isopropanol:methanol (1:1). This solution was serially diluted 1:4 (v/v) to make 10 working standard solutions with the same solvent. A volume of the extractant equivalent to 2 mg of raw tissue was dried under a nitrogen gas flow. The residue was resuspended in 20 µl of LC–MS grade isopropanol:methanol (1:1). Each sample solution or 20 µl of each standard solution was then mixed in turn with 40 μl of 200 mM 3-nitro phenylhydrazine (3-NPH)-HCl solution and 40 μl of 150-mM EDC-HCl-6% pyridine solution. The mixtures were allowed to react at 40 °C for 60 min. After the reaction, 50 μl of each solution was mixed with 100 μl of a mixture of 13C6-3NPH derivatives of all the targeted organic acids. Of aliquots of the resultant solutions, 6 µl was injected onto a C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.5 µm) to run UPLCMRM–MS with (−) ion detection on an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system coupled to a Sciex 4000 QTRAP MS instrument, with the use of 1 mM ammonium acetate in water (A) and acetonitrile:isopropanol (1:1, v/v) as the mobile phase for binary-solvent gradient elution in a range of 30–100% B over 16 min at 0.4 ml min−1 and 60 °C.

The tumour tissues isolated were snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Around 20–30 mg tissues from each group were chipped and homogenized (with 80% methanol)77. The supernatant was dried for gas chromatography (GC)–MS sample preparation78. Dried samples were further derivatized in 50 μl of 10 mg ml−1 methoxamine hydrochloride for 60 min at 42 °C, followed by 100 μl of N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide for 90 min at 72 °C. Next, TCA metabolites were separated by Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph with HP-5ms Ultra Inert GC column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm, 7 inch; 19091S-433UI, Agilent). Metabolites were then analysed by Agilent 5977B mass-selective detector, using full-scan mode. Total metabolite abundances were measured as the area of the total ion counts normalized to protein content.

Liver tumour CXCL13 protein levels were determined using the mouse CXCL13/BLC/BCA-1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (MCX130, R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 50 µl of tissue homogenate was added to each well of a 96-well plate coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for mouse BLC or BCA-1 for 2 h. Next, the plates were washed with wash buffer and 100 µl mouse BLC–BCA-1 conjugate was added to each well for the next 2 h followed by the addition of substrate and stop solution. The optical density was measured using a microplate reader set at 450 nm.

Paraffin-embedded, 5-µm sections of tumour-bearing livers were used for immunofluorescence. Slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to antigen retrieval (10 mM sodium citrate buffer). Slides were blocked in BSA and subsequently incubated with primary antibody overnight at a concentration of 1:500 CCP3 (Cell Signaling Technology) and Ki67 (Thermo Fisher). Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were then applied to tissues and mounted with coverslips. Slides were imaged on an inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microscope Systems). Representative images were acquired and analysed using ImageJ analysis.

All cell-free assays were conducted at Reaction Biology. Human ACC1 (50202), ACC2 (50201) and ACLY (50255) were obtained from BPS Biosciences. Recombinant protein of human ACSS2, transcript variant 1 (accession no. NM_018677) tagged with MYC–DDK was obtained from Origene (TP304260). ADP-Glo (V9101, Promega) was used to measure ACLY, ACC1 and ACC2 enzyme activity following the manufacturer's instructions. The assay was performed in two steps: (1) after the specific enzyme-mediated reaction that utilizes ATP and produces ADP, ADP-Glo reagent was added to terminate the kinase reaction and depleted the remaining ATP; and (2) kinase detection reagent was added to convert ADP to ATP and allow the newly synthesized ATP to be measured using a luciferase–luciferin reaction. The light generated, measured by the luminometer, correlated to the amount of ADP generated, which is indicative of ACLY, ACC1 or ACC2 activity. ACSS2 activity was assessed using the Bellbrook Transcreener AMP2/GMP2 Assay kit, a far-red competitive fluorescence polarization assay. AMP produced in the reaction was detected by AMP/GMP Alexa fluor 633 tracer bound to an AMP2/GMP2 antibody. AMP displaced the tracer allowing free rotation of the fluorophore and decreased fluorescence polarization, which was quantified using an appropriate multimode plate reader. Human AMPKα1–AMPKβ1–AMPKγ1 heterotrimers were co-incubated with the AMPK substrate peptide at 20 μM, AMP at 125 μM and ATP at 10 μM using the HotSpot assay.

Human recombinant ACLY was obtained from Sino Biological (11769-H07B). Recombinant full-length hACLY (accession no. P53396) was expressed in insect cells using baculovirus expression host, with a poly histidine tag at the N terminus. The molecular weight was 123 kDa. The ACLY ADP-Glo assays were performed at room temperature. Enzyme and sodium citrate were prepared in reaction buffer at three times the reaction concentration and 5 µl was added to Corning 3572 reaction plate wells. Of compound concentrations, 100× were prepared by serial dilution in 100% DMSO. Then, the compound was transferred to the reaction plate, which contains enzyme and sodium citrate, using acoustic technology. The compound and enzyme were pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 5 µl of 3× coenzyme A was delivered to the reaction well, followed by 5 µl of 3× ATP to start the reaction. The assay was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. For the background wells, all assay components were added without enzyme. After a 2-h reaction, ADP-Glo reagent was added to stop the reaction and incubated for 40 min at room temperature following detection kit protocol. Then, ADP-Glo detection was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature following the detection kit protocol. The luminescence signal was measured after 30 min of incubation with ADP-Glo detection. The luminescence signal was then converted to µM ADP using ADP standard curve. The compound was tested in triplicate and each dataset was analysed separately.

HEK293 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (319-005-CL, Wisent Bioproducts) supplemented with 10% FBS (098150, Wisent Bioproducts) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmid for SLC27A1 (NM_198580, human tagged ORF clone; RC209285, OriGene), SLC27A2 (NM_003645, human tagged ORF clone; RC221033, OriGene), SLC27A4 (NM_005094, human tagged ORF clone; RC209557, OriGene), SLC27A5 (NM_012254, human tagged ORF clone; RC215758, Origene) or control vector (pCMV6-entry mammalian expression vector; PS100001, OriGene). Transfected cell lines were supplemented with G418 (A1720, Sigma-Aldrich) during maintenance at a concentration of 800 µg ml−1. Transfected SLC27A2 protein was detected by western blot using the antibody DYK tag (2368, Cell Signaling); while endogenous SLC27A2 was detected using the polyclonal antibody (PA5-30420, Invitrogen).

The day before the experiment, HEK293 cells overexpressing SLC27A1/A2/A4/A5 were plated in six-well plates at 1–1.5 × 105 cells per cm2 in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium and cultured overnight. Cells were treated with 30 µM of EVT0185 for 3 h. At the end of the treatment period, medium was removed, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and were flash frozen in liquid N2. For extraction, plates were placed on ice, and cells were scraped in 266 µl of PBS per well. The cell suspension from three wells were pooled (approximately 800 µl total volume) and added to 1 ml of ice-cold 2:1 dichloromethane:methanol in a glass vial. The samples were vortexed for 2 × 12 s and then centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.45-µm PTFE filter. Samples were delivered to the Centre for Microbial Chemical Biology at McMaster University for LC–MS/MS analysis.

Samples were evaporated using a Turbovap LV (Biotage) evaporation system with the water bath set to 30 °C. Dried samples were resuspended in 100 µl of methanol, then analysed by injecting 5 µl into an Agilent 1290 Infinity series HPLC (Agilent) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Separation of the analytes was achieved on an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 (100 mm × 2.1 mm, internal diameter (i.d.), 3.5 µm) analytical column using mobile phases consisting of (A) 10 mM ammonium acetate in water, pH 8.5, and (B) acetonitrile and a constant flow of 0.2 ml min−1. The analytical column was maintained at 30 °C. The separation of analytes was achieved using a gradient starting at 20% B, which was held for 1.5 min. The gradient increased to 95% B over the next 3.5 min and was held for 4.5 min. The column was then re-equilibrated back to the initial conditions over the final 5.5 min. The total run time was 16 min. The HPLC eluent was introduced into the mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode with a spray voltage of 3.6 kV. The mass spectrometer was set to acquire spectra in data-dependent acquisition mode. The full MS scan was set to an m/z range of 100–2,000 in the ion trap with a resolution of 30,000. The MS/MS was performed in the Orbitrap with a collision induced dissociation (CID) collision energy of 35. The activation time was set at 30 ms with the activation parameter q = 0.250 and an isolation window of 1.5 m/z. The resulting mass spectra were analysed using the Xcalibur 2.1 Qualitative software package.

Hep3B (HB-8064) human hepatocarcinoma and Hepa1-6 (CRL-1830) mouse hepatoma cell lines were purchased from the ATCC and grown in eagle's minimum essential medium (10-009-CV, Mediatech) and Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (319-005-CL, Wisent Bioproducts), respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS (098150, Wisent Bioproducts) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (15140122, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2/95% air. Bempedoic acid was purchased from MedChemExpress. Hep3B and Hepa1-6 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a cell density of 1,000 and 500 cells per well, respectively. On day 2, media in each well were aspirated and replaced with 1,000 µl of fresh complete media and cells were treated with or without the respective drugs in an increasing concentration followed by the incubation of the cells for 7 days in an incubator. On day 9, the media in each well were aspirated and cells were fixed with 10% formalin (500 µl) for 10 min at room temperature. Formalin was aspirated and the plates were washed with 1× PBS and stained with crystal violet for another 10 min. After 10 min of staining, crystal violet was poured over the cells, rinsed with tap water for three times and the plates were dried overnight. The next day, colonies (more than 50 cells) were counted and analysed.

The pTrcHis2-hACLY expression construct35 for full-length human ACLY (Uniprot ID P53396-2) in frame with C-terminal MYC and His tags was transformed in BL21(DE3) cells. Cultures were grown in Luria–Bertani medium at 28 °C and expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6–0.7. After overnight expression, the bacterial culture was collected by centrifugation and bacterial cells were resuspended in IMAC-binding buffer, consisting of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA (Roche). Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was clarified using a 0.22-μm filter and loaded onto a Ni Sepharose column equilibrated with IMAC-binding buffer. The IMAC column was washed and His-tagged ACLY was eluted with binding buffer supplemented with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Elution fractions were pooled and concentrated using ultracentrifugation. ACLY was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 and Superose 6 (Increase) columns with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl as a running buffer. The top fractions from the final size-exclusion chromatography elution peak were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg ml−1, aliquoted, flash frozen and stored at −80 °C in a freezer until further use.

For cryo-EM grid preparation, purified ACLY (10 mg ml−1 in HBS buffer) was supplemented with 0.5% CHAPSO, 1 mM Mg2ATP and 4 mM EVT0185-CoA (freshly prepared from powder). Of the sample, 4 µl was applied to a glow-discharged C-Flat 1.2/1.3 300 mesh copper grid (Protochips), blotted for 4.5 s under 99% humidity at 22 °C and plunged into liquid ethane using a GP2 Leica grid plunger. Grids were screened using a JEOL 1400 Plus microscope equipped with a JEOL Ruby CCD camera at the VIB Bioimaging Core Ghent. Data collection was performed using a JEOL cryoARM 300 microscope equipped with a 6k × 4k GATAN K3 detector resulting in 7,263 movies with a raw pixel size of 0.72 Å (BECM). Movies were processed via patch-based motion correction and contrast transfer function estimation as implemented in cryoSPARC (v3.1.0)79.

Particles were extracted with a box size of 480 pixels with 2× binning. Good-quality 2D classes were initially obtained via the Blob Picker job in cryoSPARC, followed by template-based picking and neural network-based particle picking via TOPAZ as implemented in cryoSPARC80. Ensuing 2D classification, 2D class selection and removal of potential duplicate particles within a distance of 150 Å resulted in a particle set of 210,900 particles. Ab initio 3D classification (number of classes = 5) followed by homogeneous and non-uniform refinement81 without application of symmetry resulted in a 3D reconstruction that had a resolution of 3.7 Å following a gold-standard non-uniform refinement and represented the pseudo-D2-symmetric ACLY tetramer. In this cryo-EM map, the central, tetrameric CSH module was markedly better defined than the N-terminal CCS modules, indicating structural heterogeneity of the CCS modules with respect to the central CSH module.

To address this flexibility and possibly resolve the CCS–CSH assembly at a higher resolution, we applied symmetry expansion in combination with local refinement followed by 3D classification. Following homogeneous and non-uniform refinement in D2 symmetry, the associated particle set was re-extracted without binning (0.72 Å per pixel) and symmetry expanded around the D2 axes. Using the molmap function in Chimera, a volume blurred to 25 Å that contained one CCS arm and the central CSH module was generated and transformed into a mask with the Volume Tools job in cryoSPARC (map threshold = 0.09, dilation radius = 7.2 Å and soft padding width = 14.4 Å). Gold-standard local refinement was performed by limiting the rotation and shift search extent around the original consensus refinement poses to 20° and 10 Å, respectively, in combination with a Gaussian prior over the pose or shift magnitudes (with SDROT = 15 Å and SDSHIFT = 7 Å). The centre of mass of the mask was used as a fulcrum point. Ensuing 3D classification without alignment in cryoSPARC using the 3D classification job followed by another round of gold-standard local refinement resulted in a cryo-EM volume with a FSC0.143 resolution of 3.3 Å in which the atomic models for the CSS and CSH modules (extracted from Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 6XHX) were fitted using Chimera and real-space refined in Phenix82 using reference restraints to the starting model. Cryo-EM map regions representing ligand density in the ATP-grasp fold domain of the CCS module and in the CoA-binding domain were of the CSH module modelled as Mg.ADP and the adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-diphosphate moiety of bound EVT0185-CoA, respectively. Restraints for EVT0185-CoA were generated via the de Grade Web Server (https://grade.globalphasing.org)83.

A cryo-EM micrograph for the ACLY–EVT0185-CoA complex is provided in Extended Data Fig. 4b. Cryo-EM data and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard FSC0.143 criterion84, and FSC curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution85. A map-to-model correlation was calculated using phenix.mtriage using the independent half maps as input. Local resolution maps were computed using the blocres algorithm86 as implemented in cryoSPARC with an FSC threshold of 0.5. All representations of cryo-EM Coulomb potential density maps and structural models were prepared with ChimeraX87 and PyMol88. Cryo-EM map contour sigma levels have been reported based on map normalization in Coot.

The protein expression construct for full-length human ACLY is available via the BCCM/GeneCorner Plasmid Collection (http://bccm.belspo.be) through the following accession code: LMBP 11277 (pTrcHis2-hACLY).

Cryo-EM maps following global and local refinement and the real-space-refined model for the CCS–CSH assembly have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) with the accession code EMD-53847 and in the PDB with the ID 9R90 (Extended PDB ID pdb_00009R90).

Hep3B cells (ATCC HB-8064) were cultured adherently using Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC 30-2003) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (10437-028, Gibco) and 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic solution (15240112, Gibco). HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216) was cultured adherently using Dulbecco's modified eagle medium, high glucose (11965092, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic solution as aforementioned along with 1% (v/v) l-glutamine (25030081, Gibco), 1% (v/v) MEM non-essential amino acids solution (11140050, Gibco) and 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate (11360070, Gibco).

Dox-inducible shACLY plasmid vectors were generated using the inducible EZ-Tet-pLKO-Hygro vector (Addgene plasmid no. 85972). Two ACLY shRNA sequences—5′-CGTGAGAGCAATTCGAGATTA and 5′-GGCATGTCCAAGCTCAA—and one non-targeting shRNA sequence (5′-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG) were ligated, transformed, amplified and validated using established protocol as previously described89.

A second generation lentivirus production system was used to generate high-titre lentivirus. HEK293T cells were incubated with psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid no. 12260), pMD2.g (Addgene plasmid no. 12259) and the EZ-Tet-pLKO-Hygro (Addgene plasmid no. 85972) transfer plasmid at a ratio of 1:1:2 pmol in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM. Sixteen hours post-transfection, media were changed to 1% bovine serum albumin (A1470, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM Na-butyrate (3850, Tocris) supplemented with antibiotic-free DMEM (11965092, Gibco) for HEK293T cell culture. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, lentivirus media were collected and mixed with Lenti-X concentrator (631232, Takara) before storing overnight at 4 °C. Next day, lentivirus was concentrated through centrifugation at 1,500g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended at 1:10 of initial media volume, aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage.

An initial dilution of 1:50 v/v followed by serial dilutions of 1:4 v/v were used to transduce target cell lines at 60,000 cells per well in six-well plates using 5 µg ml−1 polybrene (107689, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented cell culture media. Cells were transduced for 24 h, followed by recovery in lentivirus-free media for another 24 h before selection of successfully transduced cells using a pre-determined, cell line-dependent concentration of hygromycin B (H3274, Sigma-Aldrich) or puromycin (P8833, Sigma-Aldrich) for 7 days. Surviving cells post-antibiotic selection were further propagated to establish stable cell line.

Cells were incubated in media supplemented with 1 µCi [14C] glucose (NEC042V250UC, Perkin Elmer) and [3H] acetate (NET003005MC, Perkin Elmer) for 4 h. Subsequently, cells were washed and scraped in PBS (10010023, Gibco). Lipids were extracted using a chloroform:methanol (1:2) solution, vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min to isolate cellular debris and protein fractions from lipid supernatant. Lipids were further purified with chloroform:water (1:1) solution via vortex and centrifugation as described. Peptide concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225, Thermo Scientific) for normalization calculation. Of lipid supernatant, 100 µl was extracted from the non-polar chloroform phase and mixed with 5 ml of Ultima Gold Scintillation Fluid (6013329, Perkin Elmer) for radioactivity quantification.

Cells were incubated with serum-free cell culture media supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin (A1470, Sigma-Aldrich), 500 µM sodium palmitate (P9787, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 µCi ml−1 [14C] palmitic acid (NEC075H050UC, Perkin Elmer) and 1 mM l-carnitine (11242008001, Roche) for 4 h. Cell culture supernatant was collected at the end of incubation and mixed with 1 ml of 1 M acetic acid (34256-1L-R, Fluka). Solution was sealed in a glass vial and shaken at 75 rpm at room temperature for 2 h. Released CO2 was absorbed in 450 µl of 1 M benzethonium hydroxide (B2156, Sigma-Aldrich) during this time. Subsequently, tube containing benzethonium hydroxide was mixed with 5 ml of Ultima Gold Scintillation Fluid (6013329, Perkin Elmer) for radioactivity quantification.

For western blotting, cells were washed with cold PBS (10010023, Gibco) and scraped with 100–200 µl of cold cell lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM Na-orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100 and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail; 11836153001, Roche). Solution samples were collected and centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min at 4 °C to isolate protein fraction from cell debris. Protein samples were quantified for peptide concentration using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225, Thermo Scientific) according to instruction. Samples were then diluted to 1 µg µl−1 using 4× SDS sample buffer (40% glycerol, 240 mM, Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM dithiothreitol) and cell lysis buffer. Samples were then heated for 5 min at 95 °C before immunoblotting. SDS polyacrylamide gels were prepared at 10% or 12% polyacrylamide concentration dependent on protein size. Of the protein sample, 25 µg was loaded into each lane. Gel electrophoresis was performed first at 90 V as protein travels through the stacking gel and then at 120 V, through the separating gel. Protein samples were then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (03010040001, Roche) at 4 °C for 90 min following the standard wet transfer protocol. Subsequently, membranes were rinsed and rocked gently with 1× TBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 1 M HCl, pH 7.4) for three cycles of 5 min each then blocked using a TBST-BSA solution (1× TBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (ACLY (13390; 1:1,000 dilution); p-ACLY S455 (4331; 1:1,000 dilution); and β-actin HRP conjugate (12620; 1:5,000 dilution); all Cell Signaling Technology) were diluted at 1:1,000 in TBST-BSA solution. Membranes were then cut according to protein sizes and incubated in respective antibody solutions overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The next day, primary antibody solutions were removed, and membranes were washed using TBST. Subsequently, membranes were incubated at room temperature with gentle rocking for 1 h in solutions containing 1:10,000 dilution of species-specific secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (anti-rabbit IgG HRP linked; 7074, Cell Signaling Technology). At the conclusion of incubation, membranes were washed again in TBST solution and kept in TBS solution until imaging and for storage.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from donors using the Ficoll Paque density gradient method. PBMCs were then washed with RPMI1640 and pelleted. Cells were resuspended with 10 ml of 3.5 µM CellTrace CFSE (C34570, Thermo Fisher) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After incubation, 40 ml complete RPMI1640 was added for the next 5 min to absorb excess CFSE. PBMCs were then washed, resuspended in complete RPMI1640 (10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 1% l-glutamine) and plated at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells per well in 12-well plates.

For T cell proliferation, PBMCs were induced with 3 µg ml−1 of concanavalin A (C5275, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 ng ml−1 of human recombinant IL-2 (200-02, Preprotech). For B cell proliferation, PBMCs were induced with 1 µg ml−1 of R848 (36611, mAb Tech) and 10 ng ml−1 of IL-2 (36611, mAb Tech). EVT0185 was diluted in DMSO and was added at the final concentration of 0.1 µM, 0.3 µM, 1 µM, 3 µM and 10 µM. Next, PBMCs were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator for 5 days. Cells were then harvested, stained with E780 Live/Dead stain (C34570, Thermo Fisher), CD3 (300434, BioLegend) and CD19 (302241, BioLegend) antibody and analysed using flow cytometry. The results were further analysed using the FlowJo software. After 5 days, cells were then prepared for flow cytometry.

For the B cell depletion study, the tail vein blood was collected from each animal after 15 days of single injection with 250 μg of anti-CD20 (152104, BioLegend) or isotype (400566, BioLegend) antibody. The red blood cells were lysed twice with 1× red blood cell lysis buffer. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and blocked with Fc block (1:200; 553142, BD Biosciences) and stained with CD45.2 BV510 (1:25; 109838, BioLegend), B220 (1:100; 563894, BD Biosciences), CD19 (1:100; 152409, BioLegend) and 7AAD (1:100; A1310, Thermo Fisher Scientific). CytoFlex Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) was used for data acquisition and was further analysed using FlowJo (v10.5).

For PBMC analysis, the cells were harvested after 5 days of treatment and stained with E780 Live/Dead stain (C34570, Thermo Fisher), CD3 (300434, BioLegend) and CD19 (302241, BioLegend) antibody and analysed using flow cytometry. The results were further analysed using the FlowJo software.

Independent t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v9.5.1). Correlation and regression analysis were performed using R studio. All values are reported as mean ± s.e.m. unless stated otherwise. Differences were considered significant (∗) when P < 0.05. Statistical significance between two independent groups was analysed by unpaired t-test. Representative images shown in Figs. 1e and 5g and Extended Data Figs. 1n and 9d,e were repeated at least four times. Extended Data Fig. 3d,e was repeated two times. Extended Data Fig. 4b shows a representative cryo-EM micrograph from the dataset (7,263 micrographs in total), illustrating the particle distribution and image quality. Histological scores were analysed using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test when comparing two independent groups. Wilcoxon's test was used to analyse cell type and regional prevalence in MIBI-TOF images. Descriptions of additional software and statistical analysis used for transcriptomic analysis are mentioned in their respective methods.

People infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (lungs of a person with the disease shown here) have a nearly twofold increased risk of cancer-related death, data show.Credit: Rajaaisya/Science Photo Library

Hidden in the lungs of some breast cancer survivors are tumour cells that can remain dormant for decades — until they one day trigger a relapse. Now, experiments in mice show that these rogue cells can be roused from their slumber by common respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 or the flu.

The findings, published in Nature on 30 July1, seem to extend to humans too: data from thousands of people show that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is linked with a nearly twofold increase in cancer-related death, possibly helping to explain why cancer death rates increased early during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results are “really quite dramatic”, says James DeGregori, a cancer biologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora, and an author of the study. “Respiratory virus infections didn't just awaken the cells,” he says, they also caused them to proliferate, or multiply, “to enormous numbers”.

Researchers have spotted dormant cancer cells, which detached from the initial tumour, hiding in tissues such as bone marrow in people in remission from breast, prostate and skin cancer, among others. These cells, a precursor to metastasis — which is the spread to distant organs — pose a problem, even in survivors of these cancers. For instance, in about one-quarter of breast cancer survivors, such cells can trigger a relapse and metastasize.

Scientists have long been trying to uncover what triggers these cells to reawaken. Previous work has hinted at chronic inflammation as a culprit, such as that caused by smoking cigarettes2 and ageing3.

DeGregori and his colleagues wondered whether acute inflammation caused by a respiratory infection could also reactivate dormant cancer cells. To test this, the researchers genetically engineered mice to develop breast tumours similar to those in humans and to seed dormant tumour cells into other tissues including the lungs. Then, they infected the animals with either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza.

Within days of infection, dormant cancer cells in the lungs of the mice kicked into high gear, proliferated and formed metastatic lesions. But it wasn't the pathogens directly that caused this to happen, the researchers learnt: it was a key immune molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which helps to rev up the body's response to foreign threats. They confirmed this by engineering mice to lack IL-6. In these animals, the dormant cancer cells did not multiply nearly as quickly.

About two weeks after the researchers infected the mice, the cells fell dormant again. This means that the infections do not directly cause cancer, but make it more likely that a future threat, whether it's an infection or a genetic mutation, could cause the cancer to become active again, DeGregori says. He likens the process to starting a fire a few times. “You've awakened the flames and then it dies back down,” he says. “But now you've got 100 times the embers that you had before” — making it easier to turn into an inferno.

Even so, that's not the end of the story. The researchers observed that, although IL-6 was essential to awakening the cancer cells, another key immune player called a helper T cell shielded the cancer cells from other immune-system defences. “Seeing that these cancer cells were perverting the immune system to protect them as opposed to eliminate them was really quite shocking,” DeGregori says.

Population data in large repositories such as the UK Biobank helped to corroborate the study's findings in people: the increased risk of cancer-related death in those who tested positive for COVID-19 was most pronounced in the months immediately following infection, mirroring the rapid proliferation of reawakened cancer cells observed in the mice.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with most deaths caused by metastatic disease, often following long periods of clinical dormancy1. Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation2,3. Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4+ T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis.

Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women and is the second most common cause of cancer-associated deaths in the United States1. After initial remission, DCCs can stay dormant for years to decades before metastatic relapse, most commonly in lung, bone and liver4. Both cell-intrinsic factors and the tumour microenvironment determine whether metastatic cells stay dormant or progress5. Importantly, microenvironmental perturbations, such as those caused by increased inflammation, can be sufficient to increase metastasis5.

Viral respiratory infections are common. Seasonal influenza affects more than 1 billion people each year6 and, by May 2025, SARS-CoV-2 infection had caused nearly 778 million recorded cases of COVID-19 (ref. 7). Viral respiratory infections are typically associated with pulmonary inflammation, with a concomitant increase in pulmonary inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferons (IFNs), and an expansion of immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes2,3. Such inflammatory mechanisms, specifically involving IL-6 and STAT3 signalling8,9, neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps10, as well as the CD4+ cell–macrophage axis11, have been identified as regulators of metastatic processes in cancer.

The observation that death rates from cancer rose in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic12, which is not fully accounted for by COVID-19 deaths or delayed screening and treatment, prompts an important hypothesis: that pulmonary viral infections increase cancer deaths by triggering the development of metastases from dormant DCCs. We sought to test this hypothesis through a dual approach: examining the effects of viral respiratory infections (influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2) on breast cancer dormancy in mouse models and correlating SARS-CoV-2 infection among cancer survivors to metastatic progression and cancer mortality.

To study the effects of influenza virus infection on the awakening of dormant breast DCCs already lodged in the lung, we used the well-established MMTV-ErbB2/Neu/Her2 (hereafter MMTV-Her2) mouse model of breast cancer metastatic dormancy, in which mice overexpress rat Neu (Erbb2, a paralogue of human HER2) in epithelial mammary gland cells13,14. HER2+ early lesion cells in the mammary glands seed the lungs and other organs with DCCs within 10–14 weeks of life, where they remain largely as dormant single cells for up to one year before progressing to overt metastatic disease15. Thus, this model recapitulates the persistence of dormant DCCs in lungs and bone marrow in individuals who remain in remission for years to decades.

MMTV-Her2 mice (FVB background) were infected with a sublethal dose of the influenza A virus (IAV) (Fig. 1a). Infected mice lost weight and recovered by 11–12 days post-infection (dpi) (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and wild-type and MMTV-Her2 mice showed a similar inflammatory response with increased cellularity of bronchoalveolar lavage (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The kinetics of viral clearance were similar between wild-type and MMTV-Her2 mice, in which IAV RNA copies peaked around 6 dpi, with a 100–1,000-fold reduction in viral load from 9–15 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

The mice were implanted with 2 × 105 (experiment 1) or 1 × 106 EO771 (experiment 2) cells across two experiments, and combined results are shown. Lungs were taken for analysis 18 days (experiment 1) and 17 days (experiment 2) after infection and stained with H&E, and the tumour area and the numbers of lesions were quantified. For each experiment, the average of the quantification of the PBS-treated mouse lungs was set to 1, so that a fold change could be calculated. Significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). All box-and-whisker plots are presented as maximum value (top line), median value (middle line) and minimum value (bottom line), with all data points shown as dots.

The lungs of MMTV-Her2 mice were taken at 3, 6, 9, 15, 28 and 60 dpi (Fig. 1a) and examined for the abundance of HER2+ cells (Fig. 1b,c), as reported previously14. Consistent with previous work14,16, we observed a small number of isolated DCCs or small clusters (fewer than 10 cells) in lungs before IAV infection. Strikingly, metastatic burden increased 100–1,000-fold between 3 and 15 dpi; the number of pulmonary HER2+ cells remained elevated even at 28 days, 60 days and 9 months after infection (Fig. 1b–d). IAV-mediated expansion of HER2+ DCCs was similarly observed in lungs of MMTV-Her2 mice in the C57BL/6J background at 15 dpi (Fig. 1e). Notably, the resultant expanded HER2+ cells exhibited a diffuse non-epithelial-like architecture, unlike the epithelial-like clusters and metastasis (more than 100 cells per cluster) of DCCs observed in lungs of MMTV-Her2 mice that are more than 10 months old14,16 (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Notably, we did not observe changes in the number of Ki67+HER2+ cells in mammary glands (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Furthermore, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of transgenic rat Erbb2 expression in haematopoietic lineage-depleted cells from peripheral blood showed no changes with infection (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Thus, the increased number of HER2+ cells in the lungs does not seem to derive from increased seeding of cancer cells from mammary glands.

We tested MMTV-PyMT mice with mammary-specific expression of polyoma middle T-antigen oncoprotein, which display early dissemination but shorter lung DCC dormancy16. MMTV-PyMT mice demonstrated an increased number of small tumour clusters in lungs after IAV infection (Fig. 1f). We also tested the effect of IAV infection using EO771 breast cancer cells (C57BL/6) implanted in the mammary gland, which seed the lungs and undergo a dormancy phase17. C57BL/6 mice with orthotopically implanted EO771 cells infected with IAV as above exhibited increased lung metastatic burden by 17–18 dpi compared with non-infected mice, in which EO771 cells remained largely dormant (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1h,i) Taken together, these findings show that IAV infection promotes DCC expansion in multiple models of breast DCC dormancy.

When we examined the proliferation of DCCs in the lungs, we found a significant increase in the percentage of HER2+ cells expressing Ki67 (a marker of all cycle phases except G0) beginning at 3 dpi and peaking at 9 dpi (Fig. 2a,b). Similar results were obtained through in vivo incorporation of the thymidine analogue EdU (Fig. 2b). Although the fraction of HER2+ cells that express Ki67 decreased by 15 dpi, the total number of HER2+ cells expressing Ki67 remained highly elevated relative to baseline even at 60 dpi, given the overall increase in DCC burden in the lungs (Fig. 2b). These results show that IAV infection triggers DCC awakening in the lungs, increasing the metastatic burden.

Dormant DCCs in HER2+ and PyMT models maintain a ZFP281-driven mesenchymal-like state (vimentin+) until ZFP281 loss triggers an epithelial shift (EpCAM/E-cadherin+) during dormancy exit16. Consistent with previous results, most dormant DCCs present in uninfected lungs expressed vimentin and not EpCAM (Fig. 2c,d). The percentage of HER2+ cells expressing vimentin was not significantly affected early after infection (3–6 dpi). However, at 9 dpi the percentage of HER2+ cells expressing vimentin was decreased to around 50%, with a further decrease to less than 20% at 28 dpi (Fig. 2c). By contrast, early during IAV infection (3 dpi), a substantial fraction of HER2+ cells acquired EpCAM expression, associated with the awakening of DCCs (Fig. 2d). Most HER2+ cells were EpCAM-negative after 6 dpi, although the percentage of EpCAM+HER2+ cells remained elevated (Fig. 2d). Thus, IAV infection drives sustained mesenchymal marker loss and a transient epithelial shift, with a persistent mixed or hybrid population over time, creating a hybrid phenotype that enables the awakening of dormant cells. To better understand the effect of IAV infection on DCCs, we performed flow cytometry sorting for HER2+ cells from the lungs of uninfected and IAV-infected mice at 9 dpi and performed bulk RNA-seq. As expected, IAV infection induced inflammatory, IFNα, IFNγ, TNF and IL-6–JAK–STAT3 signalling pathways (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Notably, IAV infection also activated pathways in DCCs including collagen-containing extracellular matrix and angiogenesis (Fig. 2e), with increased expressions of many collagens and collagen-crosslinking genes (Lox, Loxl1 and Loxl2) (Fig. 2f), metalloproteinases (Mmp8, Mmp11, Mmp14, Mmp15 and Mmp19) (Fig. 2g) and genes implicated in angiogenesis (Vegf-a, Vegf-c, Vegf-d, Vcam1, Icam1 and Icam2) (Fig. 2h). Collagen-1 abundance and crosslinking into fibrillar collagen has been linked to dormant DCC awakening18 that could be sustained by an angiogenic switch to maintain tumour growth. Indeed, angiogenesis and metalloproteinases have been shown to have a role in sustaining dormant cancer-cell awakening19,20. Notably, we observed striking changes in the expression of genes involved in mesenchymal or epithelial fate (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Although previous studies have shown conversion of DCCs from a dormant mesenchymal state to a more epithelial state after awakening16, we observed a unique and, to our knowledge, previously unrecognized hybrid and proliferative pattern after influenza virus infection, with increased expression of both mesenchymal markers (such as Cdh2, Cdh11, Fn1, Eng and Vim) and epithelial markers (such as Cdh1, Cldn2, Cldn5, Krt19, Klf4 and Ovol2) (all Padj ≤ 0.05; Supplementary Data 1). Notably, expression of Zfp281, which is a key mediator of the dormant mesenchymal state16, actually increased by 9 dpi in DCCs, further highlighting the hybrid state adopted by DCCs after IAV infection that seems to bypass the pro-dormancy function of ZFP281. We also observed increases in Cd274 (which encodes PDL1) and decreases in B2m (which is required for antigen presentation by major histocompatability complex class I), which could contribute to the avoidance of immune elimination (Supplementary Data 1).

Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 are known to promote cancer malignancy and metastases21,22,23. Furthermore, IL-6 produced during acute inflammation resulting from biopsy or chemotherapy contributes to the development of lung metastatic outgrowth of disseminated mammary tumour cells9,10. IL-6 is abundantly produced during IAV infection, partly because of the replication of the virus in lung epithelial cells24. Similarly, we also detected high levels of IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from wild-type and MMTV-Her2 mice after IAV infection, with very low levels of IL-1β (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Moreover, we observed clear activation of the IL-6 signalling pathway in DCCs after IAV infection (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Furthermore, in vitro IAV infection of primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells induced significantly increased secretion of IL-6 (Extended Data Fig. 2g), indicating that epithelial cells are a main source of IL-6 after IAV infection.

To determine whether IL-6 production triggered by IAV infection contributes to the awakening of dormant DCCs, we used MMTV-Her2 mice crossed with Il6-knockout (KO) mice25. MMTV-Her2 and Il6-KO:MMTV-Her2 mice were infected with IAV and lungs taken for analysis at 9 and 28 dpi (at this dose of IAV, all mice recovered without excessive weight loss). Before infection, there was no difference in the number of dormant HER2+ cells between Il6-KO:MMTV-Her2 and MMTV-Her2 lungs (Fig. 3b,c), and these mice developed primary tumours requiring euthanization with similar timing at older ages (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Thus, IL-6 is not required for primary tumour growth or for early cancer-cell dissemination to the lungs. Strikingly, the number of HER2+ cells in lungs of IAV-infected Il6-KO:MMTV-Her2 mice was markedly decreased compared with infected MMTV-Her2 mice at both 9 and 28 dpi (Fig. 3a–c), with substantial reductions in Ki67+HER2+ cells, indicative of maintained DCC dormancy (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer metastasis, IAV-induced proliferation of PyMT+ small lesions and formation of micro-metastases in the lungs was dampened by IL-6 deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Similar IL-6 dependency was found for the increased lung metastatic burden after IAV infection in the EO771 cell model (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Staining for vimentin and EpCAM demonstrated that most HER2+ cells in the lungs of Il6-KO:MMTV-Her2 mice retain vimentin expression and maintain EpCAM-negative status, which together with the failure to enter the cell cycle, as shown through immunofluorescence for Ki67, supports an IL-6 requirement for infection-induced DCC conversion from dormancy to awakening (Fig. 3e,f).

a–c, Lung sections of MMTV-Her2 or IL-6 KO:MMTV-Her2 mice at 9 and 28 dpi with IAV (or PBS) were stained for HER2 (green) and DAPI (blue) (a) and quantified at 9 dpi (b) and 28 dpi (c).

We next digested mammary glands from 3-month-old MMTV-Her2 mice, grew them under organoid conditions and treated them with vehicle or IL-6. Mammary mammospheres treated with IL-6 showed significant increases in overall size (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Similar increases in organoid size were observed for EO771 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Although in vivo solitary DCC dormancy in the lung alveoli16,26 could not be fully replicated in vitro, mammosphere initiation assays from single cells to proliferative clusters have been used to study how perturbations affect single-cell growth initiation or growth arrest14,16. Despite its limitations, this assay confirmed that IL-6 directly affects HER2+ mammary tumour cells in a solitary state, which reproduced the IL-6 response observed in vivo. Overall, these results indicate that IAV infection-triggered IL-6 has a key role in mediating the awakening of dormant DCCs.

Although IL-6 was essential for the awakening and the initial marked expansion of DCCs, minimal levels of IL-6 were detected in BALF of MMTV-Her2 mice 15 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 2e), indicating the presence of other factors that promote persistence after the expansion of DCCs at later times post-infection. Whereas recruitment of neutrophils to the lung occurs by 3 dpi with IAV, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells accumulate in the lung from around 9 dpi in both wild-type and MMTV-Her2 mice (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). Infection with IAV has also been shown to trigger the formation in the lungs of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (iBALTs), which are lymphoid organizations that include primarily CD4+ and B cells. iBALTs can be detected in the lungs long after infection (up to 100 dpi)27. Accordingly, we also detected these CD4+ cell and B cell-enriched lymphoid organizations in the lung sections of wild-type and MMTV-Her2 mice 28 dpi (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4e–h,k). As expected, B cells in these iBALTs are also positive for the germinal centre B cell marker GL7. In contrast to CD4+ cells, very few CD8+ cells were present in iBALT in either wild-type or MMTV-Her2 mice (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4i). Interestingly, co-staining of CD4 with HER2 revealed the selective presence of DCCs in proximity to high-density clusters of CD4+ cells and the near absence of HER2+ cells in regions lacking CD4+ cells (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 4j). Moreover, consistent with the upregulation of many collagen genes in DCC after IAV infection (Fig. 2f), we observed substantial increases in collagen deposition selectively in iBALT after IAV infection in MMTV-Her2 mice relative to wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 4l,m). Collagens have been shown to limit T cell infiltration and activity28.

Source Data

To determine whether CD4+ cells maintain awakened DCCs later after IAV, CD4+ cell depletion was done before infection (−1 dpi) and HER2+ cells were examined in lung sections (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). CD4+ cell depletion reduced the numbers of awakened DCCs at 28 dpi (Fig. 4c–e). However, CD4+ cell depletion did not affect DCC numbers or proliferation at 9 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d), consistent with the accumulation of CD4 cells late during infection (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the number of lung DCCs 28 dpi was also decreased when CD4+ cell depletion was initiated at 10 dpi (Fig. 4d). Thus, CD4+ cells contribute to the maintenance of awakened DCCs later after IAV infection. Together, these data show that IL-6 (but not CD4+ cells) contributes to the initial awakening and expansion of dormant DCCs, but that later during the infection, following the recruitment of T cells, CD4+ cells are required for the maintenance of the awakened DCCs.

Previous studies have shown how neutrophil extracellular traps produced during inflammation can awaken DCCs in lungs29. However, in contrast to CD4+ cell depletion, the depletion of neutrophils with an anti-Ly6G antibody at the time of IAV infection did not alter the numbers or Ki67 positivity of HER2+ cells in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 5b,e–g). Similarly, depletion of CD8+ cells before infection had no effect on the presence of DCCs (Fig. 4e), consistent with the paucity of CD8+ cells in lungs 28 dpi (Fig. 4a). Thus, maintenance of the awakened lung DCCs following IAV infection is selectively dependent on the presence of CD4+ cells.

Interestingly, although only a low number of dispersed CD8+ cells were present in lungs 28 dpi in MMTV-Her2 mice, we found an increased accumulation of CD8+ cells in lungs of infected mice when CD4+ cells were depleted (Fig. 4f). These results indicated that CD4+ cells may repress the recruitment of CD8+ cells to the lung, potentially compromising immune surveillance against awakened DCCs. We therefore tested the effect of depleting both CD4+ and CD8+ cells on the maintenance of lung DCCs following IAV infection. Although CD4+ cell depletion resulted in a marked reduction of HER2+ cells in the lungs of infected mice, the dual depletion of CD8+ cells and CD4+ cells partly restored the numbers of HER2+ cells in the lungs (Fig. 4e). Thus, CD4+ cells maintain awakened lung DCCs after IAV infection, partly by suppressing the CD8+ immune response.

We then examined whether the presence of awakened DCCs in the lungs following IAV infection could reprogram recruited T cells to a more suppressive or suppressed state by performing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of lungs of wild-type and MMTV-Her2 mice 9 and 15 dpi with IAV, at points in which the accumulation of T cells in the lungs is high (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). As expected, multiple immune cell types, such as macrophages, natural killer cells, B cells, effector and memory CD4+ cells and effector and memory CD8+ cells, were present in the lung at both 9 and 15 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). We had two replicates for most conditions, which exhibited very similar gene expression patterns (Extended Data Fig. 6d). IAV infection induced type I and II interferon responses and other innate immune pathways across these cell types, as expected (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Interestingly, there was substantially increased expression of a selective subset of genes in effector CD4+ cells from MMTV-Her2 mice relative to effector CD4+ cells in wild-type mice. In particular, Tnfaip3, Zfp36l2, Dusp5, Dusp1, Cxcr4, Klf6, Pdcd4 and Ctla4 were highly upregulated in effector CD4+ cells from MMTV-Her2 mice relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Data 2). The differential expression of some of these genes was validated at the protein level either by flow cytometry (Cxcr4) or by western blot analysis (Dusp5) (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Tnfaip3, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase A20, suppresses the antitumour activity of CD8+ cells30, whereas Zfp36l2, which regulates RNA stability, restrains CD8+-cell activation and expansion31,32. Dusp5, which encodes a dual phosphatase, suppresses T cell proliferation and promotes their survival33. Klf6 and Dusp1 are markers of central and resident memory T cells34,35. Ctla4 induces Pdcd4 in cytotoxic T cells, and Pdcd4 deficiency enhances their antitumour effector functions36. These results indicated an impaired effector-cell phenotype in CD4+ cells from MMTV-Her2 mice relative to wild-type mice. Furthermore, comparing memory CD4+ cells from MMTV-Her2 mice versus wild-type mice at day 15 after IAV infection revealed similar changes in gene expression, with increased Tnfaip3, Klf6, Dusp1, Dusp5 and Dusp10 (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Similar changes were also observed in CD8+ cells isolated from MMTV-Her2 versus wild-type mice at 15 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). Overall, these data indicated a bias to a more memory phenotype and increased survival with less effector function in CD4+ and CD8+ cells of infected MMTV-Her2 mice. Further analysis confirmed the increase in the ratio of memory to effector cells for both CD4+ and CD8+ cells in infected MMTV-Her2 mice relative to wild type (Extended Data Fig. 7f), consistent with DCC-mediated suppression of T cell effector function.

Moreover, CD4+ cell expression of genes important for T cell activation, including Gadd45b and Slfn2 (refs. 37,38,39), was reduced in CD4+ effector cells in infected HER2+ mice relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Data 2). Interestingly, the expression of multiple mitochondrial genes (including mt-Atp6, mt-Nd1, mt-Co3 and mt-Nd3) was greatly reduced in CD4+ cells from MMTV-Her2 mice, indicating a reduced mitochondrial content in these cells (Fig. 4g). The reduced mitochondrial content could result from increased autophagy mediated by the upregulation of Tnfaip3, because Tnfaip3 deficiency has been shown to increase mitochondrial content in CD4+ cells by promoting autophagy40. Reductions in mitochondrially and nuclear-encoded transcripts crucial for oxidative phosphorylation were observed across T cell types, including CD8 cells, in infected MMTV-Her2 mice by 15 dpi (but not at 9 dpi, before full DCC expansion), consistent with reduced T cell effector function (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Note 1). We validated the reduction in mitochondria content in CD4+ and CD8+ cells from infected MMTV-Her2 mice relative to wild-type mice by Mitotracker staining and flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h).

Pathway analysis further supports a compromised effector function of CD4+ cells from MMTV-Her2 mice. Over-representation analysis (ORA) of scRNA-seq comparing MMTV-Her2 and wild-type mice after IAV infection showed reduced interferon responses in MMTV-Her2 mice across multiple immune cell types (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b), as shown for macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d) and T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a), consistent with the lower levels of type I and II IFNs produced in the lungs of infected MMTV-Her2 mice (Extended Data Fig. 10b; see Supplementary Data 3 for all significant gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results). Moreover, we observed an increase in the ratio of M2 to M1 macrophages in infected MMTV-Her2 mice, accompanied by significant changes in gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 9e). We also observed significant suppression of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in macrophages and T cells from infected MMTV-Her2 mice relative to infected wild-type mice by 15 dpi (Extended Data Figs. 9c,d and 10a). Together, these results indicate that the presence of DCCs skews the macrophage phenotype and impairs CD4+ and CD8+ cell activation in response to IAV infection, favouring tumour-cell persistence.

Crucially, GSEA comparing CD8+ T cells from MMTV-Her2 mice with IAV infection (15 dpi) and CD4 depletion revealed significant increases in pathways involved in CD8+ cell activation, such as IL-2–STAT5, MTORC1 and type 1 and 2 interferon signalling pathways, indicating that both effector and memory CD8+ cells are more proliferative and activated when CD4+ cells are depleted (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 10c). Mitochondrial and respiration phenotypes were also restored in CD8+ cells by CD4+ cell depletion by 15 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 8). Thus, the effect of CD4+ cell depletion on eliminating DCCs seems to be mediated by enhanced CD8+ cell responses against DCCs.

To further determine whether CD4+ cells in MMTV-Her2 mice are suppressing the activation of antitumour CD8+ cells, we isolated lung CD8+ cells from MMTV-Her2 mice or CD4+ cell-depleted MMTV-Her2 mice at 15 dpi with IAV. Increased production of IFNγ was specifically detected in lung CD8+ cells isolated from CD4-depleted infected MMTV-Her2 mice following ex vivo activation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies (Fig. 4i). Moreover, we investigated the ability of these CD8+ cells to kill mammary cancer cells ex vivo using cultures of primary HER2+ cells isolated from the mammary glands of MMTV-Her2 mice. Lung CD8+ cells from CD4-depleted MMTV-Her2 mice after IAV infection had superior killing activity against HER2+ tumour cells compared with lung CD8+ cells from IAV-infected Her2 mice (Fig. 4j and Extended Data Fig. 11a). By contrast, CD8+ cells from IAV-infected wild-type mice had minimal killing activity against MMTV-Her2 tumour cells. Lung CD8+ cells from CD4-depleted Her2 mice were also superior in killing MET-1 cancer cell lines generated from MMTV-PyMT mice that lacked HER2 (Extended Data Fig. 11b). Together, these data demonstrate the specific anti-mammary tumour activity of CD8+ cells from IAV-infected MMTV-Her mice and the suppressive effect that lung CD4+ cells have on antitumour CD8+ cells.

To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection of lungs can promote the reawakening of dormant DCCs, we performed studies (analogous to those in Fig. 1 with IAV) using mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 that recognizes mouse ACE2, termed MA10, obtained by genetic modification of the spike gene41 followed by serial passages in mice42. This SARS-CoV-2 strain induces a COVID-19-like disease in mice including acute lung injury characterized by impaired pulmonary function, diffuse alveolar damage and infiltration of immune cells42. Similar to IAV infection, MA10 infection induced the production of high levels of IL-6 and IFNα in lungs (Extended Data Fig. 11c,d). Lower levels of IFNβ, IFNγ and IL-1β were also detectable in the BALF. Importantly, infection of MMTV-Her2 mice with MA10-SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a striking increase in HER2+ cells by 28 dpi (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 12a). Analyses of earlier time points (3 and 9 dpi) demonstrated a stepwise increase in the number of HER2+ cells and Ki67+ HER2+ cells after MA10 infection (Fig. 5b), with transient increases in EpCAM positivity and reductions in vimentin positivity (Extended Data Fig. 12b), as observed after IAV infection. Notably, we demonstrated that these changes in HER2+ DCC proliferation, expansion and phenotypic transitions require IL-6, because MA10 infection-dependent changes are significantly reduced in Il6-KO:MMTV-Her2 mice, with no detectable change in MA10 virus replication (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Figs. 11f and 12c).

Significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t-test (a,c). For b, we applied a negative binomial model for HER2+ cells per field comparing 9 dpi and PBS control (to accommodate the potential overdispersion); for HER2+Ki67+ cells per field, we determined whether cells per field in infected groups were significantly higher than 0 (all PBS samples were 0) using a negative binomial model.

Source Data

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity to study the effect of pulmonary virus infections on cancer progression because, unlike influenza, data on virus infections and resulting outcomes were systematically collected in the first years of the pandemic. First, we analysed data from the UK Biobank to determine whether a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result, among a population of cancer survivors, was associated with an increased risk of all-cause, non-COVID-19 and cancer mortality (Extended Data Fig. 12d). To reduce potential confounding from vaccination and the use of at-home SARS-CoV-2 tests, we limited the analysis to subjects with PCR tests conducted before December 2020. Stratification of results based on primary tumour type and metastatic disease was not possible, owing to an insufficient number of observations.

In the full study population with follow-up till 31 December 2022, which included 4,837 participants with a cancer diagnosis before 1 January 2015 (indicating inferred remission), we observed 413 deaths (298 in the test negatives and 115 in the test positives), yielding an odds ratio of 4.50 (95% confidence interval: 3.49–5.81) (Fig. 5d). When we excluded 120 deaths directly attributed to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2-positive cases still showed increased mortality with an odds ratio of 2.56 (95% CI: 1.86–3.51). Based on the 128 cancer-related deaths as an outcome, we estimated a nearly twofold increase in cancer mortality in those who tested positive compared with those who tested negative (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI: 1.14–3.02).

Analyses of participants diagnosed with cancer at least 10 years before the pandemic (before 1 January 2010) showed results consistent with the main analyses, although there was some loss of power owing to the reduced number of cases. SARS-CoV-2-positive participants had increased risks for all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 5.24; 95% CI: 3.66–7.48), non-COVID-19 mortality (odds ratio, 2.58; 95% CI: 1.64–4.06) and cancer mortality (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI: 0.85–3.80) compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative participants.

When we reduced the follow-up period from 31 January 2022 to 1 December 2020, the odds ratio increased from 1.85 (1.1.4–3.02) to 8.24 (3.43–19.77) (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Table 2), with decreasing odds ratios across follow-up times reduced by subsequent 6-month intervals. This trend indicates that the strength of the association is greatest shortly after infection and diminishes over time. Some individuals in the test-negative group may have become infected during follow-up. These evolving differences in infection risk over time may have contributed to a weakening of the observed association. Even so, our findings indicate that the increased risk of cancer mortality is greatest in the first few months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, the data indicate a markedly increased risk of death from cancer for cancer survivors who contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We used the Flatiron Health database with 36,845 female patients with breast cancer with complete information to specifically determine whether women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer experienced an increased risk of progression to metastatic disease in the lungs after COVID-19 (Extended Data Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 12e). Crucially, female patients with breast cancer who experienced COVID-19 disease after their initial breast cancer diagnosis exhibited an age, race and ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.05; P = 0.043) for subsequent diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs (red in Fig. 5e and Extended Data Tables 3–5). Because we lack COVID test-negativity data in the Flatiron Health dataset, the COVID-19 negative group may include undiagnosed cases, probably underestimating the hazard ratio. Further adjusting our model for comorbidities and breast cancer subtype (oestrogen receptor (ER) status), we estimated a consistent, although slightly attenuated and not statistically significant, effect of COVID-19 on metastatic progression to the lungs with a hazard ratio of 1.41 (95%CI: 0.97, 2.04) (blue in Fig. 5e). These results indicate that the initial findings from the parsimonious model are robust and that potential confounding by additional covariates has a negligible effect in the Flatiron Health dataset. In all, these data show that COVID-19 increases lung metastasis risk in female patients with breast cancer.

Our results indicate that respiratory virus infections promote the awakening and expansion of previously seeded dormant cancer cells. This process unfolds in two distinct phases. First, an IL-6-dependent switch of DCCs from a mesenchymal phenotype to a hybrid state promotes expansion. Second, this expansion is followed by a return to quiescence and establishment of CD4+ cell niches that inhibit DCC elimination, partly through the suppression of CD8+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 12f). We further show how the presence of HER2+ tumour cells results in a suppressive phenotype for CD4+ cells, and that depletion of CD4+ cells leads to the elimination of influenza virus infection-expanded DCCs, dependent on CD8+ cells with restored effector activity. Importantly, we show that a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus similarly leads to IL-6-dependent DCC expansion in lungs.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential influence of SARS-CoV-2 on cancer progression has been a crucial question in the research community43,44,45. Although species differences warrant caution in interpreting mouse data, UK Biobank analyses show that cancer survivors had increased cancer mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This risk peaked in the months after infection, paralleling mouse models showing greater than 100-fold DCC expansion into metastatic lesions within two weeks. Analyses based on the Flatiron Health database further reveal a marked rise in metastatic lung disease among breast cancer survivors following COVID-19. Collectively, these findings underscore the substantial metastatic risk COVID-19 posed to cancer survivors, with dormant DCC reactivation potentially driving this phenomenon.

Our studies highlight the importance of developing interventions to minimize the risk of lung DCC awakening and metastatic disease in the millions of cancer survivors who experience respiratory virus infections. As well as primary prevention strategies, treatments for managing severe COVID-19 that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration include antagonistic antibodies against IL-6R46 and orally available JAK1/2 inhibitors47, raising the prospect of interventions that could reduce the risk of infection-induced metastatic cancer progression. The effectiveness and safety of these interventions, and the timing of their application to avoid impeding the resolution of the infection, will need to first be tested in preclinical and clinical studies.

In conclusion, our studies reveal how respiratory virus infections can increase cancer recurrence risk and underscore the need for public health and clinical strategies to mitigate the increased risk of metastatic progression associated with SARS-CoV2 and other respiratory virus infections.

Transgenic mouse models of breast cancer, using mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) long terminal repeats, are widely used. In brief, MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-erbB2/neu/Her2 (MMTV-Her2) mice express the oncogenes polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT) and rat Erbb2 (encoding HER2), respectively, upstream of the MMTV promoter, which confers expression in the mammary epithelium, as described elsewhere10,13,48. The MMTV-PyMT transgene is congenic in the FVB mouse background (a gift from William Muller). Given that the MMTV-PyMT mice exhibit substantial lung tumour burden within a few months of life, we limit our analyses to newly awakened DCCs in this model (forming micrometastases, defined as lesions with an area of less than 0.03 mm2). The MMTV-Her2 transgene is congenic in the FVB (Jackson Laboratory, 002376) and C57BL/6 (a gift from Ramon Parsons, congenic in C57BL/6J by backcrossing from the FVB background26) backgrounds. MMTV-Her2 mice (FVB) were crossed with IL-6-knockout (KO) mice9,25. For an orthotopic model of breast cancer, EO771 breast cancer cells49 (a gift from Diana Cittelly) were injected into the fourth right and left mammary fat pads with 2 × 105 or 1 × 106 cells per fat pad.

Eight-week-old MMTV-PyMT and 12- to 14-week-old MMTV-Her2 female mice were infected with 500 EIU Puerto Rico A/PR/8/34 H1N1 IAV through intranasal administration in 50 μl PBS. For viral administration, mice were anaesthetized using 5% induction isoflurane and 2% maintenance, performed with a SomnoFlo Low-Flow electronic vaporizer machine in an induction chamber. After ensuring adequate anaesthesia with slow and deep breathing, droplets of viral fluid were placed on the mouse's nostrils. The mouse inhaled the fluid through the nostrils. Once the fluid had been inhaled, the mouse was placed on a heating pad to recover.

For immune-cell depletion experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with rat IgG as a control (MP Biochemicals, MPBio 0855951), 100 μg anti-CD4 (Bio X cell, clone GK1.5, BP003-1), or 100 μg anti-CD8 (Bio X cell, clone2.43) 1 day before IAV infection and every 6 days afterwards, or 200 μg anti-Ly6G (Bio X cell, clone 1A8, BP0075-1) on the day of the influenza virus infection, then 24 h and every other day afterwards, until being euthanized. For 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, mice were injected with 50 mg per kg EdU (Sigma Aldrich, BCK488-IV-FC-S) 4 h before euthanasia.

For both MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-Her2 mice, as a humane end point, mice were euthanized when the tumour reached 20 mm in any one dimension, tumours were ulcerated or infected, or if there was a major sign of discomfort, as determined by the institutional veterinarian. Mice were monitored every other day during the first week or until the tumour was palpated, and daily afterwards until the mice needed to be euthanized. Veterinary technicians in the institutional facility monitored the mice daily.

All mice were co-housed in specific pathogen-free animal facilities, maintained at 21 °C (±1 °C) and 35% humidity with a 14 h:10 h light:dark cycle (light 06:00–20:00). All the mice were backcrossed in the C57Bl/6J background for more than 10–12 generations. Only female mice were used for the studies. The average age of the mice was 12–24 weeks. An approved measure of CO2 followed by cervical dislocation was used for euthanasia.

The University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) reviewed and approved all animal experiments (including humane end points described above), which were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 (BEI Resources, NR-55329) was propagated in Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) as previously described42. In brief, low-passage Vero E6 monolayers were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 with SARS-CoV-2 MA10. When Vero E6 monolayers exhibited 70–75% cytopathic effect (2–3 dpi), supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation, supplemented with an additional 10% FBS, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. SARS-CoV-2 titres were determined by plaque assay on Vero-E6 cells. Vero-E6 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (DMEM, HyClone 11965-084) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) and 100 U ml−1 of penicillin-streptomycin.

MMTV-Her2 female mice (in both C57BL/6J and FVB backgrounds) at 14–19 weeks of age were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (80 mg per kg) and xylazine (7.5 mg per kg) in a volume of 100–200 μl. Fully anaesthetized mice were inoculated intranasally with 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 MA10 diluted in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine calf serum by administration of 25 μl of inoculum in each nostril for a total volume of 50 μl. Mouse weights were collected daily for 15 days, and mice inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 MA10 exhibited weight loss beginning at 2 dpi, with greatest loss achieved at 3-4 dpi, as previously reported42. As controls, MMTV-Her2 mice were mock inoculated with 50 μl of PBS/1% bovine calf serum.

MA10 viral titre was determined as previously described50. Lung superior lobes were homogenized, serially diluted in DMEM with 2% FBS, HEPES, penicillin-streptomycin and incubated on Vero E6 cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM with 2% FBS at 37 °C for 3 days. Overlays were removed afterwards, and the plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed plates were stained with crystal violet (0.05% w/v) in 20% methanol for 10 min. Infectious viral titres were determined by manually counting the plaques formed.

Lungs and mammary glands were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, transferred to 70% ethanol the next day and then embedded in paraffin. Tissues were sectioned (5 μm) and used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence. Slides were deparaffinized in three incubations of 15 min in Histo-clear (Fisher Scientific, 50-899-90147) then descending 10-min ethanol incubations: three at 100%, followed by 95% and 70% followed by 10 min of H2O incubation. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was done for 10 min in a pressure cooker in citrate buffer (10 mM citric acid, pH 6.0). For IHC, samples were incubated in 1% H2O2 for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Permeabilization was done using 0.1% normal goat serum in 0.4% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 30 min. Sections were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution (Abcam, AB64226) containing MOM blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, MKB2213-1), incubated with primary antibodies (Supplementary Information Table 1) at 4 °C overnight in antibody diluent (Abcam, 64211), then washed 3 times for 30 min each in 0.1% triton-X 100 in PBS. For IHC samples, sections were incubated in ImmPRESS HRP goat anti-rabbit or rat IgG polymer detection kit (Vector Laboratories, MP-7451/MP7404) and ImmPACT DAB substrate, peroxidase HRP (Vector Laboratories, SK4105) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IHC slides were mounted using micromount mounting medium (StatLab, MMC0126). For immunofluorescence, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in antibody diluent (Abcam, 64211). Sections were then washed in 0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS 3 times for 30 min each and were mounted using fluoroshield mounting media with DAPI (Abcam, 104139). Immunofluorescence images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200-m fluorescence microscope. IHC images were collected using a Keyence BZ-X800 microscope. Section staining, image capturing and image analysis were done manually using ImageJ and were carried out by a researcher who was blinded to sample identities. Subsequent grouping and graphing were done by a different lab member who was unblinded after image analyses and quantification were completed.

Collagen deposition was assessed using Masson's Trichrome stain. The intensity of the stained areas was assessed using FRIDA software as described elsewhere51.

Bronchoalveolar lavage was done using 1 ml PBS (ThermoFisher, 14190-144) after mice were euthanized. BALF was collected and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Red blood cells were lysed using haemolytic buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM NaHCO3, 1.1 mM Na2EDTA) for 3 min, flow buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA) was added and cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in flow buffer and counted manually.

Cytokines in the BALF were measured using custom-made high-sensitivity multiplex assays from Meso Scale Discovery according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cells recovered from BALF were stained with antibodies (Supplementary Information Table 1). Alternatively, whole lungs were taken and digested using a method described elsewhere52. In brief, lung digestion mix (1.5 mg ml−1 collagenase A (Sigma Aldrich, COLLA-RO), 0.4 mg ml−1 deoxyribonuclease I (Worthington, LS002139), 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 5% FBS) was injected into the lungs through cannulae and lungs were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 30 min followed by vigorous vortexing. Digested lungs were passed through a 50 μm cell strainer and red blood cells were lysed using haemolytic buffer for 3 min, flow buffer were added and cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. Single cells were resuspended in flow buffer and stained with antibodies (Supplementary Information Table 1) for flow cytometry. For mitochondrial mass analysis, lung cell suspensions were stained with Mitotracker green (Invitrogen, M7514) for 30 min at 37 °C. Staining for CD4 and CD8 was performed for the last 5 min of the incubation at 37 °C, and cells were immediately washed for flow cytometry analysis. Data were collected on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) or Aurora (Cytek) and analysed using FlowJo software v.10. CD4 and CD8 cell populations were well defined (Extended Data Fig. 7h). For cell sorting of DCCs, lung cell homogenates were obtained from PBS or IAV (9 dpi)-infected MMTV-Her2 mice using a Lung Dissociation Kit Mouse according to the manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi, 130-095-927). The single-cell suspensions were treated for red blood cell lysis. Single-cell suspensions were pre-incubated (5 min) with anti-CD16/CD32 Fc-Block (BD Biosciences, 553141) followed by staining for CD45 and HER2 and sorting using an Astrios EQ flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). DCCs were gated on CD45neg HER2+. Sorted DCCs were used for bulk RNA-seq (described below).

CD8+ cells were isolated from digested lungs using positive selection with CD8α (Ly-2) microbeads (Miltenyi, 130-117-044) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For CD8+ cell-mediated cytotoxicity experiments, Her2 cells isolated from mammary glands of MMTV-Her2 mice and expanded in culture, or immortalized PyMT cells (MET-1) isolated from mammary glands of MMTV-PYMT mice, were plated 2 days before the killing assay. Lung CD8+ cells were isolated 15 days after IAV infection from wild-type mice, MMTV-Her2 mice or MMTV-Her2 mice treated with anti-CD4 antibodies (starting the day before infection). Lung CD8+ cells (pooled from 3–4 mice) were added to the cancer cell cultures at a 1:1 effector:target ratio. Then, 48 h later, co-cultures were washed (removal of CD8+ cells), trypsinized and live cancer cells were counted. Isolated lung CD8+ cells were restimulated using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads53, and 20 h later, supernatant was collected and used for detection of IFNγ by ELISA, as previously described54, using anti-mouse IFNγ capture antibody (Biolegend, 505702) and biotinylated anti-mouse IFNγ antibody (Biolegend, 505804).

CD4+ cells were isolated from IAV-infected wild-type and Her2 mice lung cell homogenate using positive selection with CD4 Microbeads (L3T4) (Miltenyi, 130-117-043) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell pellets were used for whole-cell lysates for western blot analysis.

Whole-cell extracts were prepared from CD4+ cells isolated from the lungs of wild-type and MMTV-Her2 mice (FVB) infected with IAV, following methods described elsewhere55. For western blot analysis, the following antibodies were used: β-actin monoclonal antibody (AC-15) (Invitrogen, AM4302), anti-DUSP5 (Invitrogen, PA5-85961), anti-rabbit HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 111-035-144) and anti-mouse HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 115-035-166).

Single cells were generated as described in the section Flow-cytometric analyses. Cells exhibiting greater than 80% viability were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Fixed RNA Sample Preparation Kit (10X Genomics). The whole-transcriptome probe pairs (10X Genomics) were added to the fixed single-cell suspensions to hybridize to their complementary target RNA during an overnight incubation at 42 °C. After hybridization, unbound probes were removed by washing. The fixed and probe-hybridized single-cell suspensions were loaded onto a Chromium X (10X Genomics) microfluidics instrument to generate partitioned nanolitre-scale droplets in oil emulsion. The target was for each droplet to contain a barcoded gel bead, a single cell and enzyme Master Mix (10X Genomics) for probe pair ligation and gel bead primer barcode extension. The droplets in oil emulsion were placed in a thermal cycler for 60 min at 25 °C, 45 min at 60 °C and 20 min at 80 °C. The single-cell barcoded, ligated probe products underwent library preparation using standard 10X Genomics protocols in preparation for Illumina next-generation sequencing. The gene expression library derived from single-cell barcoded, ligated probe product were sequenced as paired-end 150-base pair reads on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) at the University of Colorado Genomics Shared Resource at a target depth of 20,000 reads per cell for all samples.

The scRNA-seq fastq files were processed using Cell Ranger software (v.7.1.0, 10X Genomics)56 to assign reads to genes based on Cell Ranger's Chromium mouse transcriptome probe set (v.1.0.1). The counts were analysed using the Seurat R package57. Genes found in fewer than 10 cells were excluded. Cells were excluded if they contained fewer than 201 genes, more than 7,500 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) or greater than 2.5% of mitochondrial UMIs. The R package scDblFinder58 was used to identify and subsequently remove doublets from the data. As well as removing cells identified as doublets, preliminary clustering was used in sequential fashion to remove clusters with greater than 50% of cells being identified as doublets. After downstream processing, clusters were filtered if they contained canonical markers from multiple cell types. The data were then depth-normalized followed by natural-log transformation. The top 2,000 most variable genes were used to scale the data while regressing out cell cycle S/G2M difference, total UMI and percentage of mitochondrial UMIs.

Principal component analysis was performed using the top 2,000 variable genes. Principal components (n = 30) that captured most of the variation were then included in further data-processing steps. Clusters were identified (at a resolution of 1.5) using the K-nearest neighbours algorithm. Clusters were annotated to cell types using enriched canonical markers and ORA59 with gene sets from the MSigDB60 and the PanglaoDB61. Broad T lymphocytes were identified and subclustered separately to increase cell-type resolution. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the Wilcoxon rank sum test within each of the cell types identified for the indicated comparisons. GSEA was done using the clusterProfiler R package (v.4.0.5)62 and the Benjamini–Hochberg method was used to calculate the adjusted P values. ORA62 was performed on the top 200 differentially expressed genes using the Hallmark, KEGG and GO Biological Processes gene set collections of the MSigDB60. Plots were produced using the Seurat57, ggplot263, ggpubr64 and pheatmap65 R packages.

We analysed the log2(fold change), adjusted P values and raw P values generated from scRNA-seq data to compare the following experimental groups: HER2 + IAV versus HER2 + PBS, HER2 + IAV versus wild type + IAV, and HER2 + IAV +anti-CD4 versus HER2 + IAV. To focus on mitochondrial functions, we used our custom mitochondrial pathway gene lists, originally published in ref. 66. Specifically, we examined overlaps between mitochondrial OXPHOS genes and our curated innate immune pathways associated with mitochondrial activity. The results were visualized as heatmaps using the pheatmap package (v.1.0.12). Pathway analysis was done using fast GSEA67 with custom gene-set files previously curated in ref. 66. All samples were compared with controls, and the ranked list of genes was defined using the −log10(P value) × log2(fold change). Statistical significance was assessed through 1,000 permutations of the gene sets60. Results are reported with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of less than 0.25 and visualized as heatmaps generated with the pheatmap package (v.1.0.12).

RNA was isolated from sorted DCCs (flow sorting described above) with the RNeasy plus micro kit (Qiagen, 74034) and libraries were prepared using the SMART-Seq mRNA LP kit (Takara Bio, 634762) following the manufacturer's instructions. Pooled libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq X (Illumina). The fastq files were processed using the nf-core rnaseq pipeline (v.3.12.0)68. Reads were trimmed with Cutadapt69 and aligned to the mouse transcriptome (GRCm38, Ensembl release 102) using STAR (v.2.7.9a)70 and quantified using Salmon (v.1.10.1)71. Differential expression analysis was done using limma72 with the voom method followed by GSEA as described above.

Whole lung tissue was homogenized and RNA was isolated using TRIzol/chloroform extraction following the manufacturer's protocol (ThermoFisher and MilliporeSigma, respectively). RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the viral load was determined by qPCR for the PR8 acid polymerase gene compared with a standard curve of known PR8 acid polymerase gene copy numbers as previously described73.

FvB-MMTV-Her2/Neu female mice 14–18 weeks old were used as early (‘premalignant') stage mice. Mice were euthanized using isoflurane and cervical dislocation. Whole mammary glands were minced and digested in 0.15% Collagenase 1A (Sigma, C-9891), 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 200 U DNAse I (Stemcell Technologies, NC9007308) solution at 37 °C with agitation for 30 min. Red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience, 4333-57) was used for 2 min at room temperature to remove blood cells. Cells were filtered through a 40-μm filter. Then 3 × 105 cells per well were seeded in six-well ultralow-adhesion plates in 1 ml mammosphere media (DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 11320-082), 1× B27 supplement (Gibco, 17504-044), 10 ng ml−1 EGF (Peprotech, AF-100-15-A), 50 U penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, 15070-063)). An additional 1 ml of mammosphere medium was added 24 h after seeding. At day 4 after seeding, cells were treated with either PBS or 10 ng ml−1 IL-6 (R&D Systems, 406-ML-005) for 3 consecutive days. Using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope, mammospheres were imaged at 4× magnification with two images taken per well at the end of the treatment. The size and number of mammospheres were analysed using QuPath software.

EO771 cells were seeded in a poly-HEMA-coated 12-well low-adhesion culture dish at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 1 ml organoid medium (DMEM/F12, 5% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin 5,000 U ml−1, 20 ng ml−1 FGF2, 10 ng ml−1 EGF, 5 μM Y-27632, 4 μg ml−1 heparin plus 5% Matrigel). Cells were treated with either PBS or 10 ng ml−1 IL-6 (R&D Systems, 406-ML-005) for 3 days. Using an EVOS M7000 microscope, EO771 organoids were imaged at 4× magnification with five images taken per well every other day. The size and number of organoids were analysed using FIJI (ImageJ).

MMTV-Her2 mice 12–14 weeks old were infected with 500 EIU Puerto Rico A/PR/8/34 H1N1 IAV or PBS as described above and euthanized using CO2 at 9 dpi. Blood was collected by intracardiac puncture and placed in heparin solution on ice. Following red blood cell lysis, lineage depletion was performed using a Miltenyi Direct Lineage cell depletion kit, mouse (Miltenyi, 130-110-470) following the manufacturer's instructions. After lineage depletion, RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74034) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) was done using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step RT–qPCR (Bio-Rad, 172-5150) with primers for the MMTV-Her2 rat transgene; forward, 5′-CCCGAGTGTCAGCCTCAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCAGGCTGCACACTGATCA-3′. The RT–qPCR was run on a Bio-Rad thermocycler (CFX Opus 384).

Statistical analyses were done using Prism 10.2.1 software (GraphPad). Investigators were not blinded to allocation during virus (IAV or SARS-CoV-2) inoculation or antibody treatment. Quantification and image analysis were done in a blinded manner; n indicates the number of mice per group. A minimum of three slides per mouse were used for image analysis. Total HER2+ cell counts (Figs. 1c and Fig. 2b), HER2+ cells and HER2+ Ki67+ cells were counted manually using ImageJ. Three lung sections at least 50 µm apart per mouse were counted and summed. We collected and analysed PBS groups at each time point; because no differences in DCC expansion or phenotype were observed at different time points, results for PBS samples were pooled. For other image quantifications, whole-lung images were divided into fields using the ImageJ grid function and 8–10 fields were selected at random per image and counted. For experiments with two groups, a two-tailed Student's t-test was used; for experiments with more than one group, one-way ANOVA tests were used unless otherwise stated. Data were expressed as mean ± s.d. and P values ≤ 0.05 were interpreted as evidence against the null hypothesis (that is, no effect, no difference). Replicates represent different mice or different cultures, not repeated measures of the same sample. Graphs are presented as box and whiskers with dots representing individual values; the three lines represent the maximum (top line), median (middle line) and minimum (bottom line) values of the dataset.

We selected SARS-CoV-2 infections as the driver virus owing to the mandatory reporting of infections and COVID-19 disease during the early stages of the pandemic, allowing the use of real-world data to test the hypothesis that respiratory viral infections promote metastatic disease. Two complementary datasets from different regions of the world were analysed: the UK Biobank, which is a population-based study including 502,356 adult volunteers aged 40–69 years at recruitment from 2006 to 2010 (refs. 74,75), and the Flatiron Health electronic health record (EHR) database, which contains longitudinal data from about 280 US cancer clinics (around 800 sites of care) on patients with cancer and survivors76,77.

Study 1 was an analysis of UK Biobank data including lifestyle, anthropometric, medical history, SARS-CoV-2 testing and mortality data linked to national registries. Previous cancer diagnoses were obtained through consented linkage to the national cancer registry and SARS-CoV-2 test status through linkage to national registers. Mortality data were obtained from the national death registries (NHS Digital, NHS Central Register and National Records of Scotland). We considered all-cause mortality (including both primary and secondary causes), non-COVID-19 mortality (by excluding deaths with ICD codes U07.1 and U07.2 (ref. 78) or any death within one month of the latest recorded positive test result) and cancer mortality (considering cause of death with ICD codes listed in Extended Data Table 1).

To evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 test positivity affected all-cause, non-COVID-19 or cancer mortality, we implemented a rigorous matching strategy. Cancer survivors with a primary cancer diagnosis at least five years before the start of the pandemic and a positive COVID-19 test result were matched to cancer survivors with negative test results with a similar risk profile.

Of the 502,356 UK biobank participants, we excluded two groups: first, those with missing information on sex, age, body mass index, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, education, employment status, household income, self-reported comorbidities, date of SARS-CoV-2 testing when the primary cause of death was COVID-19 and cancer diagnosis date if the primary cause of death was cancer (n = 65,245); and second, participants without any SARS-CoV-2 PCR test record (n = 195,559) (Extended Data Fig. 12d).

This left 241,552 participants, of whom 48,958 had been diagnosed with cancer at the latest follow-up (18 December 2022). From this group, we excluded five groups: participants with inconsistent dates of death (n = 8); those diagnosed with multiple cancers (n = 4,421); participants with a primary cancer diagnosis after the start of the pandemic (defined as 1 January 2020; n = 7,650); those who tested positive for COVID-19 after the UK vaccination rollout (1 December 2020; n = 13,274); and participants with cancer diagnoses less than five years before the pandemic onset (n = 9,969); this was to ensure that participants were, in all likelihood, in full remission and thus any residual metastatic cancer cells were likely to be dormant.

After these exclusions, the final cohort included 13,636 participants, of whom 531 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 13,105 who tested negative before the vaccination rollout (Extended Data Fig. 12d).

We used a non-parametric matching approach (without replacement)79 to identify (up to) ten negative-test participants for each positive-test participant. Matching was performed in two steps. We performed an exact matching based on cancer type and sex. Then, we matched for age, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, education, employment status, household income and cancer diagnosis date (with a maximum allowable difference in cancer diagnosis of five years) using the nearest-neighbour method, an algorithm based on propensity score matching. The resulting matched population included 487 with positive tests (that is, we could not find good matches for 44 of those with positive tests) matched to 4,350 with negative tests.

Using test positivity as the predictor, we ran a series of unconditional logistic regression models for all-cause, non-COVID-19 and cancer mortality. Models were adjusted for all matching factors to account for potential residual confounding. We also repeated the analyses for patients with cancer diagnosed at least ten years before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom to further increase the likelihood that patients were in remission. This was achieved by excluding the positive-test participants who were diagnosed with cancer between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 and re-running the matching procedure, resulting in 266 with positive tests and 2,228 matched individuals with negative tests.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying censoring dates in six-month intervals from 1 June 2020 to 31 December 2022. Longer follow-up periods included more events, whereas shorter periods minimized potential bias from missing infection data and vaccination.

Study 2 used Flatiron Health's nationwide EHR-derived database, including de-identified data from about 280 US cancer clinics (around 800 sites of care). The database is longitudinal, comprising de-identified patient-level structured and unstructured data, curated by technology-enabled abstraction76,77. Most patients in the database originate from community oncology settings, although the community and academic proportions may vary, based on study cohorts. The data were subject to obligations to prevent re-identification and protect patient confidentiality. Institutional Review Board approval of the protocol was obtained before the study was done and included an informed-consent waiver.

Included in our study were women aged at least 18 years old at the time of initial cancer diagnosis, and who had:

early breast cancer; the cohort includes a probabilistic sample of patients with a diagnosis of stage I–III breast cancer on or after 1 January 2011, including those who presented with non-metastatic disease but who subsequently developed recurrent or progressive disease, with at least two visits occurring on or after January 1, 2011;

metastatic breast cancer; the cohort includes a probabilistic sample of patients diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer on or after 1 January 2011 and those who presented with earlier-stage breast cancer but who subsequently developed metastatic disease on or after 1 January 2011, and who had at least two clinic encounters evident in the database occurring on or after 1 January 2011; and

adult female patients aged 18 years or more at the initial diagnosis.

The index date was defined as the date of the initial diagnosis of breast cancer. The COVID-19 status was defined as positive if any COVID-19 diagnosis (ICD codes B97.29, B97.21, J12.81, B34.2 and U07.1) was made after the index date and before the diagnosis of lung metastases or the last follow-up date. The data cut-off date was 31 August 2023. The start date of COVID-19 positivity status was the earliest COVID-19 diagnosis date. Baseline characteristics of gender, race, ethnicity and age at index date were obtained from structured data.

Baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Cause-specific analysis was conducted (death was censored). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 diagnosis on the risk of metastasis to the lungs, in which COVID-19 diagnosis status was treated as a time-varying covariate. The multivariable model was adjusted for patient characteristics considered relevant, including age, race and ethnicity. There were 36,216 COVID-19-negative patients and 532 COVID-19-positive patients (all 532 COVID-19-positive patients were COVID-19 negative at the index date) included in the multivariate analysis (Extended Data Fig. 12e). The median follow-up, the corresponding interquartile range (IQR) and the total number of accumulated person-years, for all patients, were 4.36 years, 6.21 years and 277,788 person-years, respectively. The median follow-up, the corresponding IQR and the total number of accumulated person-years, for patients' COVID-negative period, were 4.35 years, 6.21 years and 277,115 person-years, respectively. The median follow-up, the corresponding IQR and the total number of accumulated person-years, for patients' COVID-positive period, were 0.98 years, 1.08 years and 673 person years, respectively. The unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratio with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval was reported. The two-sided likelihood ratio tests were conducted. The significance level was 0.05. The time to metastases to the lungs was defined as the time from the index date to the date of metastases to the lungs. Patients without a date of pulmonary metastases were censored at the last confirmed activity date or death. Last confirmed activity was defined as the latest date of vitals record, medication administration or reported laboratory tests or results. We performed additional multivariate analyses (MVA) to control for additional potential confounding factors, including comorbidities and breast cancer subtypes as sensitivity analysis. Comorbidity scores using the Elixhauser comorbidity index were computed using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes as previously reported80. The diagnosis codes were included if the diagnosis dates were on or within 365 days after the initial diagnosis date. Cancer subgroups were based on the most recent test results recorded in the Flatiron Health database and the subgroups were defined as follows:

Evidence of an ER-negative, progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-negative test result, in which HER2-negative is defined as negative with the cancer type not otherwise specified (NOS), next-generation sequencing (NGS) negative (ERBB2 not amplified), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative/not amplified, IHC negative (0–1+) or IHC equivocal (2+);

Defined as one or more of the following: positive NOS, IHC positive (3+), FISH positive/amplified, NGS positive (ERBB2 amplification);

ER-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive test result(s).

A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with stratification factors stage, year of diagnosis, age group and cancer subgroup was used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 diagnosis on the risk of metastases to the lungs while adjusting important covariates (age, race, ethnicity and comorbidity) at initial diagnosis. There were 23,876 COVID-19-negative patients and 359 COVID-19-positive patients included in this multivariate analysis. The adjusted hazard ratio with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval was reported. The assumption of proportionality was assessed using the method outlined in ref. 81, indicating that there was no statistically significant evidence suggesting a violation of the proportional hazard assumption.

Transition metal–hydrides have been widely exploited in catalysis for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated moieties, including carbonyls, alkenes and alkynes1. To complement heterolytic metal–hydride bond cleavage, metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) has recently gained attention, as a promising strategy for radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes2, thus enabling late-stage diversification of complex molecules3,4. However, owing to the weak interactions between the prochiral organic radical and the enantiopure catalyst5, asymmetric MHAT6 remains challenging. Here we show that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric MHAT, a new-to-nature reaction. Directed evolution of P450BM3 yielded a triple mutant that catalyses MHAT radical cyclization of unactivated alkenes, producing diverse cyclic compounds—including pyrrolidines and piperidines—with up to 98:2 enantiomeric ratio under aerobic whole-cell conditions. Apart from electron-deficient alkenes, alternative radical acceptors—including hydrazones, oximes and nitriles—were converted by repurposed P450BM3 to enantioenriched cyclization products. Mechanistic investigations support an MHAT mechanism proceeding by homolytic cleavage of a fleeting iron(III)–hydride species2,6. Starting from CYP119, directed evolution afforded a stereocomplementary MHATase, highlighting the potential of repurposed CYPs for MHAT biocatalysis. Our study highlights the prospect of integrating homolytic metal–hydride reactivity into metalloenzymes, thus expanding the scope of asymmetric radical biocatalysis.

Terrestrial ecosystems could contribute to climate mitigation through nature-based climate solutions (NbCS), which aim to reduce ecosystem greenhouse gas emissions and/or increase ecosystem carbon storage. Forests have the largest potential for NbCS, aligned with broader sustainability benefits, but—unfortunately—a broad body of literature has revealed widespread problems in forest NbCS projects and protocols that undermine the climate mitigation of forest carbon credits and hamper efforts to reach global net zero. Therefore, there is a need to bring better science and policy to improve NbCS climate mitigation outcomes going forward. Here we synthesize challenges to crediting forest NbCS and offer guidance and key next steps to make improvements in the implementation of these strategies immediately and in the near-term. We structure our Perspective around four key components of rigorous forest NbCS, illuminating key science and policy considerations and providing solutions to improve rigour. Finally, we outline a ‘contribution approach' to support rigorous forest NbCS that is an alternative funding mechanism that disallows compensation or offsetting claims.

Hadal trenches, some of the Earth's least explored and understood environments, have long been proposed to harbour chemosynthesis-based communities1,2. Despite increasing attention, actual documentation of such communities has been exceptionally rare3,4. Here we report the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth during an expedition to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the western Aleutian Trench using the manned submersible Fendouzhe. The communities dominated by siboglinid Polychaeta and Bivalvia span a distance of 2,500 km at depths from 5,800 m to 9,533 m. These communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches, where methane is produced microbially from deposited organic matter, as indicated by isotopic analysis. Given geological similarities with other hadal trenches, such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated. These findings challenge current models of life at extreme limits and carbon cycling in the deep ocean.

Chemosynthesis-based communities represent a remarkable example of life's ability to adapt and thrive in some of the most extreme conditions on Earth5,6,7,8. Since the initial discovery of these communities at hydrothermal vents9, the detection of chemosynthesis-based communities at cold seeps, supporting highly diverse and abundant chemosymbiotic biota1,3,4,5,6,7,8, has increased and expanded our understanding of deep-sea ecological systems and the biogeochemical processes that underpin them. The communities, typically dominated by Bivalvia and Siboglinidae, and sustained by microbial chemosynthesis, are confined to areas where fluids rich in hydrogen sulfide and/or methane are released through geological fractures6,7.

Despite being found on passive and active margins across a wide range of ocean depths5,6,7,8, cold-seep communities have remained largely unexplored in hadal trenches with depths exceeding 6,000 m. Only two small seep communities at hadal depths have been discovered by submersible and remotely operated vehicle, one dominated by vesicomyid clams at nearly 6,437 m depth and another dominated by thyasirid clams at 7,326–7,434 m in the Japan Trench3,4,10. In addition, probable chemosynthetic mats have been observed at a depth of 10,677 m at the bottom of the Mariana Trench11; however, they are not associated with any seep animal communities. The biogeographical distribution of chemosynthesis-based communities in the deepest parts of the world's oceans, their potential roles in shaping the deep-sea ecosystem and the mechanisms behind the formation of methane seeps at such great depths remain elusive.

The Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the Aleutian Trench are formed by the tectonic interactions between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and meet at the Kamchatka Aleutian Transition connection12. This area is geologically highly active with many seismically and volcanically active sites. The Kuril–Kamchatka Trench is formed by the northwestward subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Okhotsk Plate and extends around 2,100 km from Hokkaido in the south to Kamchatka Peninsula in the north13. The maximum depth of the trench bottom reaches 9,578 m, based on our submersible conductivity–temperature–depth data. Previous research conducted by expeditions aboard research vessel (RV) Vityaz and RV Sonne in the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench shows that the trench is characterized by predominantly heterotrophic benthic fauna14,15. However, some specimens of chemosymbiotrophic taxa15,16, in particular frenulate siboglinids, were also recovered using a trawl, indicating that methane seeps may exist on the trench bottom. The Aleutian Trench is about 2,900 km long, extends from the Alaska and Kenai peninsulas in North America to Kamchatka13 and marks a boundary where the Pacific Plate has been subducting northwestwards beneath the Bering Sea Plate. Both trenches underlie a highly productive boreal region of the North Pacific Ocean and are characterized by distinct spring blooms and high annual primary production17.

Investigations of the trench bottom of the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the western Aleutian Trench from 8 July to 17 August 2024, using RV Tansuoyihao with the full-ocean-depth manned submersible Fendouzhe capable of reaching the deepest part of the ocean at nearly 11,000 m, resulted in the discovery of widespread cold-seep chemosynthesis-based communities in both trenches (Fig. 1). During dive FDZ 271 in the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, we first encountered dense chemosynthetic communities dominated by frenulate siboglinids at a depth of 9,533 m, situated atop black muds at the boundary between the trench bottom and the basement of the accretionary prism. This boundary corresponds to the outcrop of a geological normal fault, a feature formed by bending of the incoming plate, as indicated by regional seismic data18. We have designated this seep site as The Deepest because of its unparalleled depth, marking it as the deepest known seepage location discovered so far (Fig. 2a). Subsequent to this initial discovery, we executed a comprehensive series of 23 dives in geologically analogous settings to determine the spatial distribution, scale and biodiversity of the chemosynthetic communities inhabiting the trench floors. During 19 of these dives (Supplementary Table 1), we observed, recorded and sampled chemosynthesis-based communities, revealing their proliferation in a distinct zone along the basement of the accretionary prism. This zone stretches 2,500 km along the bottom of the trenches, representing a notable ecological feature of these two hadal trenches that has not been recognized or reported despite previous sediment and fauna investigations in these areas.

The study area, situated in the northwest Pacific, is demarcated by a white rectangle in the inset. Orange dots represent dive sites where chemosynthesis-based communities were observed and sampled and crosses indicate dive sites lacking such communities. Open orange circles delineate potential seep sites characterized by black sediments.

The species composition and structure of chemosynthesis-based communities in the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, with depths ranging from nearly 7,000 m to 9,533 m, is distinct from those observed in the Kamchatka Aleutian Transition and the western Aleutian Trench where depths are predominantly less than 7,000 m. In the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, most communities are dominated by frenulate siboglinids (Extended Data Fig. 1). The composition of siboglinid species among communities in the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench seems to differ considerably. The most abundant species are representatives of Lamellisabella, Polybrachia, Spirobrachia and Zenkevitchiana. A notable discovery in the central Kuril–Kamchatka Trench at a depth of 9,120 m (dive FDZ 274) is the Wintersweet Valley site, which is predominantly inhabited by two species of frenulate siboglinids (Lamellisabella and Polybrachia) (Fig. 2b). These frenulate siboglinids were found in great abundance along a substantial portion of a seep field, around 2 km in length, which was explored during a single dive. The colonies consist of thousands of individuals with tubes extending out of the sediment. Associated with the frenulate siboglinids is a suite of species obligate to this particular habitat, including tube-dwelling polychaetes Terebelliformia and numerous Gastropoda that settled on the siboglinid tubes, as well as a variety of heterotrophic benthic fauna including free-moving polychaetes Macellicephaloides, crinoids Bathycrinus, holothurians Elpidia hanseni and amphipods сf. Princaxelia.

In addition, two other large cold-seep fields, the Dead Valley and Cotton Field sites, were observed at depths of 9,522 and 9,566 m during dive FDZ 275. These fields are located roughly 120 km southwest of Wintersweet Field and extend at least 2.2 km along the 9,520 m contour line. In Dead Valley, dense clusters of frenulate siboglinids occur, with tubes covered by white flocculent material and lying almost horizontally (Extended Data Fig. 2). Siboglinids seem to be dead, suggesting cessation of fluid activity in this part of the field. By contrast, Cotton Field (Fig. 2c), situated 50 m southwest of Dead Valley, supports dense populations of living frenulate siboglinids in association with numerous free-moving polychaetes (Macellicephalinae) and Gastropoda. It is noteworthy that frenulate siboglinids were encountered in nine of eleven dives conducted at the base of the accretionary prisms in the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, albeit with varying densities of occurrence. During dive FDZ 278, frenulate siboglinids with a relatively high abundance of thyasirid bivalves (Tartarothyasira cf. hadalis) and tube-dwelling polychaetes (Anobothrus sp.) were discovered at a depth of 8,764 m. Tartarothyasira hadalis (initially described as Maorithyas hadalis10) has been documented in the hadal zone of the Japan Trench at a depth of 7,326–7,434 m (refs. 3,11). The presence of these chemosymbiotrophic bivalves in the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench marks the deepest occurrence of such organisms ever discovered in hadal zones.

In contrast to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, the chemosynthesis-based communities located in the Kamchatka Aleutian Transition are characterized by a high abundance of two species of chemosymbiotrophic vesicomyid clams Abyssogena phaseoliformis and Isorropodon fossajaponicum (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Fields of siboglinids and clusters of bivalves in the Kamchatka Aleutian Transition were located next to each other, but did not overlap. During dive FDZ 284, dense aggregations of bivalves were initially identified in muddy sediments at a depth of 5,988 m. The communities in this field are largely dominated by I. fossajaponicum and tube-dwelling ampharetid polychaetes (Anobothrus sp.). On the subsequent dive, FDZ 297, an expansive seep field termed Clam Bed (Fig. 2d) was discovered, extending roughly 2 km along a steep fault at a depth of 5,800 m. The dominant species in this community is A. phaseoliformis. In addition to clams, the seep field supports a diverse array of fauna, including gastropods Peltospiridae and Provanidae, tube-dwelling polychaetes Ampharetidae and Maldanidae, free-moving polychaetes Polynoidae and Dorvilleidae, amphipods cf. Abyssododecas and actiniarians Sagartiidae. Similar A. phaseoliformis dominated communities have previously been described for the Japan Trench and the eastern Aleutian Trench19,20.

The cold-seep communities in the western Aleutian Trench are dominated by Bivalvia, Siboglinidae or Ampharetidae. During dives FDZ 285 and FDZ 296, we documented the presence of thyasirid (Tartarothyasira cf. hadalis and Axinus sp.) and vesicomyid (I. fossajaponicum) bivalve aggregations (Extended Data Table 1), as well as tube-dwelling polychaetes Anobothrus sp. (Fig. 2e,f), distributed discontinuously along a 5-km stretch of a subducting normal fault between depths of 6,900 and 6,930 m. In addition, during dive FDZ 286, a large field of Tartarothyasira cf. hadalis more than 500 m across was observed at a depth of 6,756 m (Extended Data Fig. 2). Frenulate siboglinids are primarily located around the periphery of areas with aggregations of bivalves. During dives FDZ 294 and FDZ 295, a seep field designated as Blue Marsh (Fig. 2g) extending over at least 2 km, was discovered at a depth of 6,635 m. The central regions of these seeps are commonly dominated by tube-dwelling Ampharetidae, whereas the margins are predominantly inhabited by frenulate siboglinids, Polybrachia, Spirobrachia and Zenkevitchiana. Furthermore, a seep field named Icy River (Fig. 2h) was noted east of the Blue Marsh field at a depth of 6,630 m. This field is characterized by white microbial mats surrounded by frenulate siboglonids. In comparison with the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, the abundance of bivalves and tube-dwelling polychaetes in the western Aleutian Trench is notably higher.

The seep communities identified in this study, akin to those documented in the hadal zone and at shallower depths3,4,20,21,22, are distinguished by their exceptionally high abundance and density of specialized species. We found maximum densities of up to 5,813 ± 1,335 (mean ± s.d.) Siboglinidae and 293 ± 69 Bivalvia per square metre in two trenches (Supplementary Table 1). The composition and structure of the investigated communities exhibit a marked patchiness across various spatial scales. This variability is observed not only in individual trenches and across depth ranges, but also between different trenches. Furthermore, certain species are distributed across a broad latitudinal and bathymetric gradient. The consistent presence of the same chemosymbiotrophic species across the Japan, Kuril–Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches suggests the presence of a connected system of reducing habitats in the hadal zone of the northern Pacific. Connections among the trench-hosted seep communities may extend even farther south to the Japan and Mariana trenches, as suggested by the presence of similar looking clam taxa20,21,22.

The molecular and isotopic compositions of gases associated with cold seeps in the seep sediments provide compelling evidence for a microbial origin of methane (Extended Data Table 2). Analysis of hydrocarbon in head gases and sediments of pushcores showed that methane constitutes 100% of the total hydrocarbons, suggesting a microbial origin for the methane23,24. Analysis of carbon (C) and deuterium (D) stable isotope showed that methane samples exhibited δ13CVPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) values ranging from −78.1‰ to −95.7‰ and δDVSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water) values ranging from −142.2‰ to −188.8‰. These findings further indicate that the methane is derived from microbial carbonate reduction rather than from methyl-based methanogenesis25,26,27,28 (Fig. 3a). These geochemical data collectively indicate that the methane present in the seep sediments is the result of microbial reduction of CO2 derived from sedimentary organic matter.

a, δ13CVPDB and δDVSMOW diagram classifying the source of methane. The base diagram is adapted from previous studies25,26,28, which used field measurements of stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes of methane (CH4) from diverse sedimentary environments to distinguish between different types of microbial and thermogenic methanogenesis. Yellow dots in the CO2 reduction (CR) category represent data from the methane samples analysed in this study. b, Schematic phase diagram of methane hydrate–sea water system. Solid black lines represent the phase boundaries between H+I – H+L and H+L – L+V ; the shaded (grey blue) H+L phase zone and grey lines therein indicate the methane hydrate solubilities in sea water (mCH4, in ppm). Red diamonds represent the temperature and pressure conditions at stations where seeps are present. H + I, methane hydrate + ice; H + L, methane hydrate + liquid; L + V, liquid + vapour; M, methyl-based methanogenesis.

The sediments associated with cold seeps are typically dark grey to black, coloration attributed to the high iron sulfide content present in the sediment matrix. Upon retrieval, sediment cores from these seeps exhibited a distinct hydrogen sulfide odour. The vertical profiles of methane, ammonia \(({{\rm{NH}}}_{4}^{+})\), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), δ13C-DIC, sulfate \(({{\rm{SO}}}_{4}^{2-})\), hydrogen sulfide and salinity in two pushcores showed typical distribution patterns associated with cold-seep environments (Extended Data Fig. 4). These patterns indicate the processes of anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with sulfate reduction5,29,30, organic matter diagenesis5,30 and hydrate decomposition31. In addition, metastable hexahydrate calcium carbonate (ikaite, CaCO3·6H2O), with clusters of euhedral spear-like crystals (Extended Data Fig. 5), are found in association with the black sediments of cold seeps. Ikaite δ13C values range from −17.29‰ to −26.89‰ (Extended Data Table 3), suggesting that they are probably authigenic precipitates from \({{\rm{CO}}}_{3}^{2-}\) supplied from the early diagenetic decomposition of sedimentary organic matter32, preceding microbial methane oxidation.

The modelling of methane phases under hadal zone conditions (Fig. 3b) indicates that at all observed seep sites at depths ranging from 5,662 m to 9,533 m, methane occurs in a dissolved form in pore water and as hydrate, with the absence of a vapour phase. This finding aligns with in situ observations conducted by submersible, which have noted the absence of bubbling and any associated gas phase during dives. Methane concentrations measured in the headspace of sediment pushcore reached 118,882 ppm, substantially exceeding the methane solubility in equilibrium with hydrate at these depths (545 ppm at 9,500 m). Calculation of the hydrate stability zone (Extended Data Fig. 6) indicates the potential presence of hydrates at these profound depths in sedimentary layers. A focused coring and drilling campaign is needed to revisit these seeps to validate this hypothesis.

The formation processes of cold seeps on trench bottoms differ markedly from those located on accretionary prisms at shallower depths. Cold seeps on accretionary prisms are characterized by the ejection of fluids through thrust faults33,34,35, with these fluids originating from subducted sediments and migrating upwards over distances often exceeding 1,000 m (ref. 36). By contrast, this study indicates that the fluids associated with trench-bottom seeps are sourced from trench sediments that have not been subducted. This hypothesis is bolstered by the composition of the fluids, primarily biogenic methane—typically produced through microbial carbonate reduction a few to several hundred metres beneath the seabed37. We propose that these fluids from the deep sediment layers of the trench migrate upwards along bending-related faults or other major fractures that occur at the leading edge of the accretionary prisms.

Figure 4 illustrates a geological model of cold-seep formation in the Kuril–Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches. In these trenches, the V-shaped topography serves as a natural trap, facilitating the rapid accumulation of substantial quantities of organic matter on the trench bottom38,39. This organic matter is introduced from the highly productive ocean surface where phytoplanktonic blooms frequently occur and from the trench slope by means of gravity flows triggered by earthquakes and landslides40,41. Under the anoxic conditions prevalent in the deep sediment layers, microbial reduction of carbon dioxide derived from sedimentary organic material can sustain methanogenesis25,26,27,28. We argue that, over time, this methane accumulates beneath impermeable sediment layers in the form of dissolved methane fluid and methane hydrate. The compression forces associated with incoming plate subduction42 then facilitate the lateral migration of methane fluids in the deep sediment layers at the trench bottom, directing them towards the accretionary prism. Ultimately, methane fluids migrate upwards through large fault zones (for instance, bending-related normal faults) that occur at the basement of the accretionary prism. Upon reaching the sea floor, methane fluids escape as a hadal cold seep and support the observed chemosynthesis-based ecosystems.

a, Schematic geological model presenting the cross-section view of the subducting plate and the overriding plate along the trench, as indicated by seismic survey data18 from these areas. The light green arrows depict the migration of organic matter into the trench, encompassing both downward and lateral movements. The white arrow denotes the direction of subduction, and the dashed line signifies the trench axis, which is nearly parallel to the striped zone of cold seeps. Black triangles point to the trench's axis. Note the prevalence of normal faults developed in the subducting plate. b, Detailed view of the area outlined by the black rectangle in a showing the formation of gas hydrates in deep sediment layers. Methane-rich fluids migrate horizontally towards the accretionary wedge as a result of the compression forces associated with subduction. Normal faults at the leading edge of the accretionary wedge create a pathway that facilitates the upward migration of seep fluids. Figure created using previously published location data18 of subducting bending faults.

Although hadal seeps have been documented before, the depths probed here, coupled with the thriving communities discovered and distribution ranges observed, significantly expand the known habitat, depth and biogeographical distributions for a great many species. Moreover, studies of organisms thriving in these communities can provide clues about physiological boundaries, adaptive strategies and previously unknown animal–microbe interactions shaped by high-pressure conditions1. Our findings also challenge the traditional perspective on the energy sources sustaining hadal fauna, which were predominantly believed to be derived from surface-derived particulate organic matter and carrion fall43. The widespread occurrence of chemosynthesis-based communities suggests an underappreciated role of chemical energy in shaping the hadal ecosystem. The co-existence of chemosynthesis-based organisms with a substantial number of heterotrophic benthic fauna, such as Actiniaria, Echiura, Holothuroidea and Amphipoda (Extended Data Fig. 7), suggests that methane seep production in the trench extends its influence to the broader benthic community44. If such a trophic subsidy for heterotrophic benthic fauna is demonstrated and quantified by follow-up research, this study would have served to highlight a previously unrecognized contribution of chemosynthetic processes to the overall functioning of hadal ecosystems.

The detection of anomalously high methane concentrations and the potential for gas hydrate formation in the hadal zone provide new insights into deep carbon cycling. The widespread methane-rich environments in two hadal trenches, where microbial reduction of CO2 from sedimentary organic matter presumably results in methane production, suggest a vibrant and active microbial community in the hadal sediments. This indicates that the deep-subsurface biosphere may exert a more important influence on biogeochemical processes in subduction zones, representing a previously unrecognized energy supply45,46. The accumulation of methane in sedimentary layers generated by this deep-subsurface biosphere could potentially sequester considerable amounts of sedimentary organic carbon, suggesting a portion of subducting organic carbon can be stored in the trench sediments in a form of methane for prolonged geological time, rather than being subducted to the deep lithosphere. It remains unknown whether the current findings can be extrapolated to other trench systems, but given the geological similarities hadal methane reservoirs may be more widespread, irrespective of the presence of fault zones that could serve as conduits for the release of methane-rich fluids. This hypothesis is supported by the recovery of gas hydrates from drilling sediments in the Middle America Trench47 and the Peru–Chile Trench at depths surpassing 5,000 m (ref. 48), and the presence of similar seep communities in the Japan Trench3,4. These findings underscore the complex nature of carbon cycling in the deep sea and highlight the critical need to integrate hadal processes into global carbon models49,50 to improve the accuracy of predictions about carbon dynamics and climate change responses on geological timescale. Furthermore, the potential presence of methane hydrates at great depths in hadal trenches may enhance global inventory of methane gas hydrate resources.

The investigation was carried out during TS42 cruise between 7 July and 18 August 2024 by RV Tan Suo Yi Hao with the full-ocean-depth human-occupied vehicle Fendouzhe, which was fitted with hydraulically powered manipulators on two swing arms. Under the guidance of operators in the human-occupied vehicle, the arms efficiently acquired the samples and stored them safely in a biological box and a geological box of the vehicle.

Upon retrieval of the submersible, all collected specimens were promptly transferred from the biological collection box and slurp sampler to the shipboard laboratory. The specimens were then sorted into main taxonomic groups of different levels using visual inspection or under stereomicroscopes. Each organism was counted and preserved in pre-cooled, non-denatured 95% ethanol or in a 4% buffered formaldehyde solution depending on the taxon. Following initial preservation, certain taxonomic groups were further transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term storage.

Visual assessment of species identification, density and spatial structure of the macro-epifauna and mega-epifauna of the seep communities was carried out on the basis of the analysis of video footage recorded by two  high-definition cameras mounted on the human-occupied vehicle. For each dive, between three and ten representative screenshots showing the densest cold-seep communities were selected from the video footage. The area of each image was estimated using the submersible's laser scale, which projects two parallel laser points 10 cm apart onto the sea floor. This provided a reliable spatial reference for calculating the area of the sea floor captured in each image. A standardized quadrat (for example, 50 × 50 cm) was drawn near the laser dots by using this laser scale as a reference in the image. The calculated area was then converted into square metres for standardized density calculations. Animals visible in each quadrat were manually counted, and faunal density was expressed as the number of individuals per square metre. For each dive, density values from the selected images were used to calculate the mean faunal density, and the standard deviation was computed to quantify the variability among replicate images.

Up to 0.5 cm3 of fauna tissue was cut into tiny pieces and subjected to DNA extraction using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories). The extracted DNA was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit with Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). A metagenomic library was constructed using the VAHTS Universal DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina v.4 and sequenced on the NovaSeq X Plus platform (Illumina) to generate 2 × 150 bp pair-ended reads. Raw sequencing reads were qualified using Fastp v.0.23.2 and assembly into contigs using MEGAHIT v.1.2.9. The coxI gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I of the fauna was retrieved from metagenomic contigs. The retrieved coxI was searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database for preliminary taxonomy identification.

During each dive, 6–12 sediment pushcores were collected using the manipulators of the submersible. Upon recovery, these pushcores were immediately transported to the ship's cold room, which is kept at around 4 °C, to facilitate subsequent processing. Among them, one or two pushcores were allocated for gas concentration analysis onboard, with only subsamples exhibiting high methane concentrations being prepared for further carbon and deuterium isotope analysis. In addition, one or two pushcores were used to extract pore water samples for geochemical analysis.

Pore-water sampling was conducted using Rhizon samplers (as described in ref. 51). These samplers were inserted into the cores at 2-cm intervals and connected to 50-ml evacuated disposable syringes fitted with three-way Luer-lock stopcocks. The first approximately 1 ml of extracted pore water was discarded to remove any contaminants. Subsequently, around 15 ml of pore water was collected within a 2-h time frame. One portion of the pore water was preserved with a 20% zinc acetate solution for subsequent hydrogen sulfide analysis. The remaining pore water samples were transferred to 15-ml centrifuge tubes and frozen for subsequent ion analysis.

For the analysis of gas composition and isotopes, sediment samples were collected using a 2.5-ml cutoff plastic syringe, which was inserted through pre-drilled holes in the pushcore tube at depth intervals of 4 cm. A 2.5-ml sediment sample was then transferred to a 20-ml gas-tight glass vial, which was filled with 2 M NaOH solution and sealed with a crimp cap containing butyl rubber stoppers. The vials were vigorously shaken and stored in an upside-down position at 4 °C until analysis, which was conducted onboard in a single day. Before analysis, the vials were shaken again, and 2 ml of the NaOH solution was replaced with helium gas to create a headspace. The headspace gas from the push core was also directly extracted using a 20-ml syringe equipped with a three-way stopcock and was immediately transferred to a 12-ml vacuum Labco vial for further analysis.

The concentration of dissolved gases was determined using a gas chromatograph (Trace GC1310; Thermo Scientific) installed onboard the research vessel. Headspace volumes ranging from 100 to 500 μl were sampled and injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. The analytical precision achieved in these measurements is consistently lower than 5%.

The δ13C and δD isotopic compositions of methane were analysed using a gas chromatography–isotope ratio mass spectrometer system, which consisted of a Trace GC1310 connected to a Delta V Advantage Isotope Ratio MS (Thermo Scientific). The analysis was conducted at the Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering (IDSSE), Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Methane was selectively separated from the gas matrix using a gas chromatography column (27 m × 0.3  mm × 20.00 μm; PoraPLOT Q). The separated methane was then combusted in a combustion oven at a temperature of 1,000 °C, which was interfaced with the isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) for subsequent analysis. The resulting CO2 was directly introduced into the IRMS for measurement.

The precision of the repeated analyses, expressed as the standard deviation (1σ), was ±0.5‰ for δ13C and ±2‰ for δD. The isotopic compositions of individual carbon compounds were reported as δ-values (‰) relative to the international standards Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB) for δ13C and Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) for δD.

Hydrogen sulfide concentrations were determined colorimetrically using the methylene blue method (with a limit of detection of approximately 0.5 μM). The concentration of \({{\rm{SO}}}_{4}^{2-}\) in pore water was quantified by ion chromatography using a Dionex ICS-900 system, which was equipped with an AS50 AutoSampler. To ensure that the \({{\rm{SO}}}_{4}^{2-}\) concentrations fell in the optimal analytical range for the ion chromatograph, the anion samples were diluted 70-fold with Milli-Q water. The analytical precision for the determination of \({{\rm{SO}}}_{4}^{2-}\) was ±3.0%. \({{\rm{NH}}}_{4}^{+}\) concentrations were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (LS55, PE) following the procedure reported in ref. 52, with a relative deviation of 0.5%. DIC concentrations and δ13C-DIC values were analysed using a Gas Bench II IRMS at IDSSE. The samples were pretreated with an acid solution on the Gas Bench II; the resulting carbon dioxide, carried by helium, was separated by a constant-temperature chromatographic column and subsequently analysed for isotope abundance using a MAT253 gas stable IRMS. The analytical precision for DIC was ±0.15% and that for δ13C-DIC was ±0.5‰. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were measured by a high-temperature catalytic oxidation method using a Multi N/C 3100 (CLD) analyser at IDSSE. Samples were thawed at room temperature and acidified to pH 2 with 2 mol l−1 hydrochloric acid before injection. Salinity was measured in the laboratory using a handheld digital salinity meter (ATAGO PAL-SALT) after the samples were thawed to room temperature.

The phase boundaries and methane hydrate solubility in the methane hydrate–sea water system were calculated using thermodynamic models53,54. The chemical potential of the hydrate phase was determined through the application of the Van der Waals–Platteeuw hydrate model, in conjunction with angle-dependent ab initio intermolecular potentials, as previously described in ref. 55. The Gibbs–Thomson equation, incorporating appropriately parameterized hydrate–water interface values, was used to account for the capillary effects of porous sediments on the hydrate–liquid–vapour equilibrium and the hydrate–liquid equilibrium. The influence of surface textures and mineral components was neglected in this analysis.

The activity coefficients for water and methane in the methane–sea water system were calculated using the Pitzer model. By applying the Poynting correction to the fugacity of methane dissolved in aqueous solution at the hydrate–liquid equilibrium, where methane gas is absent, the extended model for three-phase equilibrium was adapted to predict the solubility of methane in aqueous solution at the hydrate–liquid equilibrium.

The horizontal black dashed line denotes the 9,533-meter water depth, corresponding to 98.0 MPa of hydrostatic pressure (assuming an average water density of 1.045 g/cm³), above which lies the unconsolidated sub-seafloor sediments. The gray circle denotes the seafloor temperature-pressure conditions at 9,533 meters, with a temperature of 2.25 °C and a pressure of 98.0 MPa. The purple and red lines represent the minimum and maximum geothermal gradients (ranging from 25 to 60 °C/km) within the unconsolidated sediments, respectively. The point of intersection between these geothermal gradients and HLV delineates the vertical limits of the hydrate stability zone (HSZ) within the sediment.

Given the promise of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for HIV-1 prevention2, we hypothesized that neonatal delivery of bNAbs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) could provide durable HIV-1 immunity during infancy. Here, using infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as a model, we show that a one-time administration of an AAV vector encoding bNAb 3BNC117 at birth led to sustained bNAb expression for more than three years without redosing. This approach significantly protected both infant and pre-adolescent rhesus macaques from infection with simian–human immunodeficiency virus in mucosal challenge models that mimic HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse. Age at the time of AAV-3BNC117 administration was a main determinant of success and was inversely correlated with the incidence of host anti-drug antibodies that restricted bNAb expression. Consistent with principles of neonatal tolerance3,4, newborn rhesus macaques exhibited higher levels of bNAb expression than older infants and juveniles following AAV-3BNC117 dosing. Furthermore, in utero exposure to recombinant 3BNC117 suppressed anti-drug antibodies and improved AAV-vectored delivery of this bNAb in older infants. Thus, our results suggest that neonatal and fetal immunological tolerance can be leveraged to improve postnatal AAV delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs in primates. Since years-long HIV-1 immunity can be generated in rhesus macaques from a one-time AAV vector administration at birth, future studies should evaluate the ability of this strategy to prevent perinatal and adolescent HIV-1 infections in humans.

Every year, more than 100,000 children acquire HIV-1, with the majority of cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa due to vertical transmission1. Complex social and economic barriers continue to hinder efforts to eliminate perinatal HIV-1 transmission in the region, with gender power imbalances having a key role5. Many women lack the ability to negotiate condom use with their male partners, leaving them vulnerable to HIV-1 and unintended pregnancies. Compounding these issues, only half of pregnant and breastfeeding women who are living with HIV-1 in western and central Africa were receiving antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in 20231. These regions now account for 41% of all paediatric HIV-1 infections worldwide1. Adherence to ARV therapy often declines postpartum, particularly among young mothers who disengage from care after delivery1. Treatment lapses increase maternal viraemia and the risk of transmission through breastfeeding. Meanwhile, paediatric formulations of ARV therapies, which are used for both prophylaxis and therapy, are limited, difficult to administer and undermined by drug toxicity and resistance6,7. Although long-acting ARV therapies may improve patient compliance, their use in infants remains unproven and constrained by access8.

One promising strategy for averting paediatric HIV-1 infections is passive immunization with recombinant bNAbs9. These antibodies are safe for use in infants and have shown efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies10,11,12. However, their protective effect depends on repeated infusions, which are costly and logistically difficult to implement in low-resource settings. AAV-mediated gene transfer offers a potential ‘one-shot' solution by enabling sustained in vivo bNAb expression from transduced cells13. The genome of the AAV vector persists in the nucleus as episomes and encodes only the transgene product14; as long as the delivered protein is non-toxic and does not induce host immune responses, transgene expression can persist for the entire lifespan of the transduced cell14. Because myocytes are abundant, easily accessible and long-lived15, skeletal muscle is a preferred tissue for AAV-based immunotherapies aimed at achieving durable bNAb expression.

Given that childbirth represents a reliable clinical touchpoint between healthcare providers and the mother–baby pair, a single intramuscular injection of AAV-bNAb vectors at this stage could protect infants from HIV-1 throughout the breastfeeding period. This intervention may be particularly valuable where access to ARV therapy is limited, and could even benefit infants of HIV-negative mothers in high-burden settings. Since the neonatal immune system is characterized by reduced pro-inflammatory signalling16,17,18, high numbers of regulatory T cells19,20 and a predisposition to develop tolerance, rather than immunity, to alloantigens3,21, we hypothesized that infants would be less prone to produce anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and therefore more likely to maintain persistent expression of HIV-1 bNAbs following AAV-mediated gene transfer.

Using infant rhesus macaques as a model, we evaluated the efficacy of neonatal gene therapy with AAV-bNAb vectors against HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding. Our first study comprised nine newborn rhesus macaques that were equally divided into three groups. Monkeys in each group were treated with an AAV serotype-1 (AAV-1) and/or AAV-8 vector encoding ‘rhesusized' (rh) versions of the immunoadhesin eCD4-Ig22 or the bNAb 3BNC11723, both specific for the CD4 binding site of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glyocoprotein. Monkeys in group 1 were treated by intramuscular injection at birth with an AAV-1 vector encoding a rh-IgG2 version of eCD4-Ig containing the pharmacokinetics-enhancing LS mutations (rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS) (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Monkeys in group 2 were first treated intravenously with an AAV-8-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS vector at birth and then intramuscularly with the same AAV-1 construct used in group 1 four weeks later (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Monkeys in group 3 were treated intramuscularly at birth with an AAV-8 vector expressing a rh-IgG1-LS version of 3BNC117 (rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS) (Extended Data Fig. 1c). All AAV vectors were delivered within 24 h of birth. No AAV-associated adverse events were recorded in any of the infants in groups 1–3, which gained weight at the expected rate during their first year of life (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c).

AAV-expressed rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS could be detected in sera from all infants in groups 1 and 2 as early as 2 weeks after the first vector administrations. (Fig. 1a–f). Although monkeys rh1-1 (group 1) and rh2-1 (group 2) developed ADAs, these responses did not abrogate rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS expression (Fig. 1a,d). In group 3, two infants developed persistent levels of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (Fig. 1g,h), but the third, rh3-3, produced an ADA response that promptly shut down bNAb expression (Fig. 1i). Notably, in vivo-produced rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS and rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS were biologically active, as serum concentrations of each molecule were directly proportional to their reciprocal neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres against the simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-AD8EO clone (Extended Data Fig. 3). As the 9 infants in groups 1–3 approached 20 weeks of age, a per-protocol transition to paired housing necessitated the removal of a monkey from the study. As serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS had fallen below detection limits in the group 3 infant rh3-3 after week 12, this monkey was removed from the study.

To mimic HIV-1 exposures through breastfeeding, the eight remaining monkeys in groups 1–3 and six age-matched AAV vector-naive control infant monkeys (group 4) were subjected to weekly oral challenges with SHIV-AD8EO beginning at postnatal weeks 30–34 (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). It took 12 consecutive challenges with escalating doses of SHIV-AD8EO to infect all control monkeys (Fig. 1j). By contrast, all AAV-treated infants, except for rh1-1 in group 1, remained uninfected, even after being challenged with undiluted (329,728 pg Gag p27) virus at the 12th–14th exposures. The differences in SHIV-AD8EO acquisition between group 4 and groups 1, 2 and 3 were statistically significant (P = 0.03, 0.01 and 0.04, respectively; Fig. 1j). Following SHIV-AD8EO infection, the group 1 monkey rh1-1 maintained persistent expression of rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS, which coincided with partial control of viraemia compared with the group 4 controls (Fig. 1k,l). Thus, in this proof-of-principle experiment, neonatal gene therapy with HIV-1 IgG biologics was safe and protected infant macaques against oral SHIV acquisition.

Most juvenile and adult rhesus macaques treated with AAV-bNAb vectors mount ADAs that reduce or eliminate bNAb production in vivo24,25. This is not a macaque-specific phenomenon, as AAV-mediated delivery of human HIV-1 bNAbs can also induce anti-bNAb antibody responses in adult humans26,27. By contrast, only one out of the nine AAV-treated newborn macaques in groups 1–3 developed ADAs that inhibited transgene expression (Fig. 1a–i). To directly address the hypothesis that AAV-delivered bNAbs are less immunogenic in neonates than in older monkeys, we enroled six infants (group 5) and six juvenile (group 6) rhesus macaques in a second study. Both groups were inoculated intramuscularly with the same AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector used in group 3, since AAV-expressed rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS consistently elicits ADAs in most older monkeys24,25. The group 6 juveniles were approximately 2 years old at the time of the vector inoculation, whereas all but one group 5 infants were treated within 48 h of birth (Extended Data Table 1). The group 5 infant rh5-6 was born below the pre-specified weight criterion to be enroled in the study and thus did not receive the AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector until it had met the minimum size requirement at four weeks of age. Because rh5-6 was one month older than its group 5 counterparts at the time of the AAV vector administration, this monkey was not considered a newborn for analysis purposes. Notably, all five group 5 newborns developed increased serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS that persisted for at least 20 weeks (Fig. 2a), with little or no ADAs detected (Fig. 2b). Monkey rh5-6 was unique in that it produced the highest levels of ADAs in group 5 and exhibited a biphasic pattern of transgene expression, characterized by a small wave of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS production ending at week 6, followed by a rebound in bNAb concentrations that continued to increase over the ensuing months (Fig. 2a,b). By contrast, two-thirds of the group 6 juveniles experienced a transient wave of bNAb expression that ended by week 10 (Fig. 2c). In those monkeys, the clearance of AAV-expressed rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS from circulation was temporally associated with the emergence and maintenance of ADAs (Fig. 2d). Surprisingly, persistent expression of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS and no ADAs were observed in two juveniles, one of which (rh6-6) developed bNAb levels resembling those in the group 5 newborns (Fig. 2c,d). In spite of this outlier in group 6, the serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS at week 20 after intervention were higher in newborns than in juveniles, whereas the opposite pattern was true for the cumulative levels of ADAs measured over the 20-week follow-up period (Fig. 2k,l). Moreover, the incidence of macaques exhibiting durable bNAb expression following AAV-bNAb gene therapy was significantly higher among newborns (5 out of 5) than juveniles (2 out of 6) (P = 0.02, Fisher's exact test). Of note, the reduced frequency of ADAs in group 5 was not due to a general deficit in humoral immune responses in early life, as all infants seroconverted to AAV-8 following the AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS inoculation, albeit at a significantly delayed rate compared with the group 6 juveniles (Extended Data Fig. 4). In sum, these results suggest that developmental age can affect the outcome of AAV-bNAb therapy by increasing (in the case of juveniles) or limiting (in the case of newborns) the frequency of ADA responses.

The results obtained from groups 5 and 6 were consistent with our hypothesis that newborns are less prone to producing ADAs and, consequently, can develop greater and more durable levels of bNAb expression than juveniles following AAV-bNAb gene therapy. However, it remained unclear whether this pattern would also apply to older infants. The observation that the 4-week-old infant macaque rh5-6 produced higher levels of ADAs than its newborn counterparts in group 5 hinted that the immunogenicity of AAV-delivered bNAbs increases proportionately with postnatal age. To address this possibility, we enrolled 8 infant rhesus macaques born to AAV-8 seronegative dams (group A; Extended Data Tables 1 and 2) in a third study and treated them intramuscularly with the AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector at 4 weeks (group 7; n = 3), 8 weeks (group 8; n = 3) or 12 weeks (group 9; n = 2) after birth (Extended Data Fig. 5). Of the three infants in group 7, two did not produce ADAs and developed steadily increasing concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS that plateaued at 61–85 µg ml–1 serum (Fig. 2e,f). By contrast, the remaining monkey in group 7 (rh7-2) produced an ADA response that curbed bNAb production after week 4 (Fig. 2e,f). In group 8, the only monkey to have detectable rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS in serum at week 20 was rh8-2, but this monkey still made ADAs and displayed the same two-phase pattern of bNAb expression seen in rh5-6 (Fig. 2g,h). AAV-driven bNAb expression in the other two monkeys in group 8 was short-lived and quelled by ADAs within the first few study months (Fig. 2g,h). Of the two 12-week-old infants in group 9, one monkey developed sustained bNAb expression and no ADAs, and the other one displayed the opposite pattern (Fig. 2i,j).

Next, we subdivided the 20 monkeys in groups 3 and 5–9 into 3 categories based on their age range at the time of the AAV vector inoculation and compared the serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS measured at week 20 between each subgroup. This analysis revealed that neonates (aged 0–4 weeks) exhibited higher bNAb expression levels than older infants (aged 8–12 weeks; P = 0.025) and 2-year-old juveniles (P = 0.058; Fig. 2m). We also observed an inverse correlation between the age of the monkeys at the time of AAV vector administration and their serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS at week 20 (P = 0.029, r = –0.46; Fig. 2n). Collectively, these results suggest that the first four weeks after birth comprise an optimal period for achieving high and sustained levels of AAV-driven bNAb expression in rhesus macaques. Beyond this period, AAV-mediated bNAb gene transfer can still induce durable HIV-1 immunity in older infants and juveniles, but with lower success rates owing to the induction of ADAs.

To investigate why the neonatal immune system tolerates AAV-delivered bNAbs, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on whole blood collected from the monkeys in groups 5 and 6 on day 0, day 3 and week 4 after AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS administration. Owing to limited blood volumes from infants, we used bulk transcriptomics for this analysis. Reads were pseudoaligned with Kallisto, and differential gene expression was assessed using Sleuth.

Minimal transcriptomic changes were observed at day 3 (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). By week 4, however, both infants and juveniles showed marked shifts from baseline, though the magnitude and nature of these changes differed by age. For instance, the juvenile volcano plot contained significantly more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than the infant plot (P = 10–10; Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). In infants, pathway enrichment pointed to altered B and T cell signalling, including upregulation of immunoglobulin light chains and co-stimulatory molecules (Extended Data Fig. 6e,g). By contrast, juveniles showed broader changes involving cellular housekeeping functions such as RNA processing and protein synthesis but lacked transcriptional signatures of lymphocyte activation (Extended Data Fig. 6f,h).

We applied the same RNA-seq strategy to blood samples from groups 7–9. Groups 8 and 9 were pooled, while group 7 was analysed independently. At week 4, both datasets showed enrichment in B cell receptor signalling pathways (Extended Data Fig. 7a,c). However, the younger monkeys (group 7) displayed additional changes in platelet activation and coagulation genes, whereas the older ones (groups 8 and 9) showed enhanced expression of protein synthesis machinery (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). Together, these data demonstrate that developmental age influences the transcriptional response to intramuscular AAV-bNAb gene therapy. However, because of limited resolution in bulk transcriptomics and small cohort sizes, we were unable to identify DEGs that consistently differentiated monkeys with or without persistent bNAb expression.

The inverse relationship between age at the time of AAV-bNAb inoculation and bNAb expression levels makes a strong argument for treating infants at risk of vertically acquiring HIV-1 as close to birth as possible. However, children might miss this window of opportunity for a variety of reasons, which would reduce their odds of benefiting from AAV-vectored bNAb gene transfer. Considering that even older infants and toddlers can acquire HIV-1 through breastfeeding28, we sought ways to limit ADAs in cases where AAV-bNAb gene therapy might occur beyond the neonatal period. Seminal work by Medawar and colleagues in the mid-twentieth century showed that prenatal exposure to allogeneic cells enabled adult mice and chickens to accept skin grafts from the same strain or donor that provided the cells for the fetal injection3,4. Guided by these findings, we hypothesized that monkeys exposed to recombinant forms of the AAV-encoded bNAb in utero would acquire tolerance to the bNAb, thereby improving the success rate of AAV-bNAb therapy later in infancy through inhibition of ADA responses. To address this possibility, we designed a fourth study in which eight AAV-8-seronegative female rhesus macaques were treated with recombinant forms of rh-3BNC117-IgG1 during late pregnancy (groups B and C; Extended Data Table 2). Because the placenta actively transfers maternal IgG antibodies to the fetus in a neonatal Fc receptor-dependent way, a maternally delivered IgG bNAb would be expected to reach the fetus shortly after the infusion. The group B and group C dams were identified in the same birth season and were housed in the same facility as the group A mothers of the infants in groups 7–9 (Extended Data Fig. 5). When the selected dams approached the end of their third trimesters (approximately gestational week 22), they were treated intravenously with 30 mg kg−1 of recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (group B; n = 4) or the same dose of rh-3BNC117-IgG1 (group C; n = 4) lacking the pharmacokinetics-enhancing LS mutations (Extended Data Fig. 5). The bNAb infusions were well tolerated and resulted in typical pharmacokinetics profiles of systemically administered monoclonal antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 8a–h). Two weeks after each bNAb infusion, pregnancies in both groups reached term, the dams underwent caesarean section and their offspring were immediately transferred to the nursery for rearing. The eight newborns were then assigned to new groups, depending on whether they received the AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector at postnatal week 8 (group 10; n = 4) or week 12 (group 11; n = 4) (Extended Data Fig. 5). Of note, groups 10 and 11 contained equal numbers of infants born to the group A and group B mothers (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). At the time of caesarian section, both rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS and rh-3BNC117-IgG1 were detected in newborn circulation, demonstrating successful transplacental bNAb transfer (Extended Data Fig. 8i). Of note, following intramuscular administration of the same AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector described above, all 8 monkeys in groups 10 and 11 developed persistent bNAb expression, with virtually no ADAs detected throughout the 20 weeks of follow-up (Fig. 3a–d). By comparison, sustained production of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS was observed in only two out of the five age-matched infants without prior fetal bNAb exposure in groups 8 and 9 (Fig. 2g,i). This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.035; Fisher's exact test). We also compared the cumulative serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS and cumulative levels of ADAs between infants with (groups 10 and 11) and without (groups 8 and 9) prior fetal bNAb exposure. This analysis revealed significantly higher bNAb amounts and markedly lower ADA levels in sera from the prenatally bNAb-exposed monkeys in groups 10 and 11 compared with their bNAb-naive counterparts in groups 8 and 9 (Fig. 3e,f). Together, these results suggest that fetal exposure to recombinant forms of an AAV-encoded bNAb can tolerize rhesus macaques to this molecule, effectively inhibiting ADAs and improving bNAb expression following postnatal AAV-mediated delivery of the same bNAb at 8–12 weeks of age.

While the macaques in groups 10 and 11 were in their final weeks of gestation, their mothers were treated intravenously with recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS or rh-3BNC117-IgG1, leading to transplacental transfer of these molecules. The macaques that were prenatally exposed to the bNAb were delivered two weeks later and then treated with the AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector at 8 weeks (group 10) or 12 weeks (group 11) of age. a,c, Serum rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS concentrations in group 10 (a) and group 11 (c).

Bars correspond to medians. All P values were two-sided and calculated using the Mann–Whitney U-test.

Although breast milk is a major route of HIV-1 transmission in sub-Saharan Africa28, the World Health Organization (WHO) still recommends mothers living with HIV-1 who cannot access ARV therapies to practice exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of their child's life29. This guidance is based on evidence that formula-fed or mixed-fed infants face higher risks of death from malnutrition, pneumonia or gastrointestinal infections compared with exclusively breastfed infants30. Since breastfeeding can last beyond two years in sub-Saharan Africa28, an important endpoint for neonatal HIV-1 immune interventions is how long they can provide protective immunity to nursing infants. With this mind, we continued to follow four of the seven monkeys in groups 1–3 that remained uninfected after the oral SHIV-AD8EO challenge phase for three to four years, during which time these monkeys were not re-dosed with AAV vectors. Both group 3 monkeys (rh3-1 and rh3-2) maintained stable expression of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS for at least 157 weeks, with serum concentrations in the 11–20 µg ml–1 range (Fig. 4a,b). In the case of rh1-2 (group 1) and rh2-3 (group 2), both monkeys had 12–48 µg ml–1 of rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS in serum at 4 years of age (Fig. 4c,d). All four monkeys continued to exhibit detectable anti-SHIV-AD8EO NAbs throughout the three to four years of follow-up, indicating sustained antiviral activity of the in vivo-produced IgG biologics. Thus, infant primates treated with AAV vectors at birth can continue to produce functional IgG HIV-1 biologics for at least four years, significantly longer than the duration of breastfeeding recommended by the WHO.

Four out of the seven AAV-treated macaques in groups 1–3 that resisted oral challenges with SHIV-AD8EO were kept alive for up to four years, and AAV-driven transgene expression in serum was monitored. These macaques were not re-dosed with AAV vectors after the neonatal period. a–d, Serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (a,b) or rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS (c,d) and NAb titres against SHIV-AD8EO for rh3-1 (a), rh3-2 (b), rh1-2 (c), and rh2-3 (d).

Given the years-long transgene expression observed in the four macaques above, we investigated whether neonatally AAV-treated monkeys would be protected against mucosal SHIV challenges later in life, as they approached sexual maturity. We investigated this possibility by reassigning the monkeys in group 5 to a fifth study nearly three years after they were dosed with the AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector in their first month of life. In keeping with the results above, all monkeys in group 5 continued to express rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS and display neutralizing SHIV activity in serum throughout the extended follow-up period (Fig. 4e,f). Beginning at weeks 133–140 after intervention, the six group 5 monkeys and six age- and sex-matched monkeys without prior AAV vector exposure (group 12) were subjected to weekly intrarectal challenges with a marginal dose (3.8 ng Gag p27) of SHIV-AD8EO to mimic sexual HIV-1 exposures during adolescence. After five intrarectal SHIV challenges, all six group 12 controls but only one group 5 monkey became infected (Fig. 4g). This difference in SHIV acquisition between groups 5 and 12 was statistically significant (P = 0.001). The only group 5 macaque to acquire infection was rh5-2, which became viraemic after the fifth intrarectal SHIV exposure. After infection, rh5-2 experienced lower acute phase viraemia than the control monkeys in group 12, probably owing to rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS expression persisting after SHIV acquisition (Fig. 4h,i). In sum, our studies suggest that, at least in rhesus macaques, the persistent HIV-1 immunity afforded by neonatal AAV-bNAb gene therapy is sufficient to confer significant protection against rectal acquisition of a neutralization-sensitive SHIV for at least three years without redosing.

Here we show that rhesus macaques can develop durable HIV-1 bNAb immunity after receiving a single intramuscular dose of AAV-bNAb vectors at birth. Critically, as the monkeys matured from infancy into adolescence, the AAV-encoded IgG molecules continued to be produced in vivo and retained their antiviral functions, successfully blocking SHIV infection in models designed to simulate vertical and sexual transmission of HIV-1. Our data also illustrate how developmental age and prenatal exposure to the AAV-encoded bNAb can modulate postnatal immune responses to AAV-bNAb therapy and, consequently, its success rate in primates. Collectively, these findings hold promise for improving HIV-1 prophylaxis, especially in places with high HIV-1 prevalence. Because childbirth is one of the most consistent times of interaction between healthcare providers and the mother–child dyad, treating at-risk babies at this stage could offer sustained protection against perinatal HIV-1 infection even if the infant is lost to follow-up. Our data also offer the tantalizing possibility that the HIV-1 immunity afforded by neonatal gene therapy with AAV-bNAb vectors might last until adolescence or beyond, potentially safeguarding against sexually transmitted HIV-1.

The tolerance-prone immune system in early life makes a strong argument for advancing neonatal AAV-bNAb gene therapies for averting postpartum HIV-1 infections. It is well established from transplantation studies that neonates, unlike adults, are predisposed to developing tolerance, rather than immunity, to alloantigens3,4,21. Although the success of AAV-bNAb therapies in adults is often limited by the induction of host anti-bNAb antibody responses, we show here that this is not the case in newborn rhesus macaques. Indeed, following administration of an AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector, newborns displayed lower incidence and magnitude of ADAs than older monkeys and, consequently, developed and maintained higher bNAb concentrations in serum. Notably, this ability to acquire tolerance to the AAV-delivered bNAb diminishes with age, as infant macaques aged 8–12 weeks exhibited lower serum bNAb concentrations than their neonate (aged 0–4 weeks) counterparts. Note that these timeframes may not translate directly to humans given that rhesus macaques age approximately three times faster31. Nonetheless, our findings are still relevant for designing future clinical trials of paediatric AAV-bNAb gene therapies since they suggest that the age of the participants at the time of the vector administration might affect treatment success rates.

Paediatric AAV-bNAb gene therapies would have the greatest impact in preventing vertical HIV-1 transmission if they could be administered to breastfeeding children of all ages without eliciting ADAs. In this regard, our finding that prenatal exposure to recombinant versions of rh-3BNC117-IgG1 prevented ADA responses in AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS-treated older infants is encouraging, since it demonstrates that a classical tolerization strategy can suppress the immunogenicity of an AAV-encoded bNAb. This experimental paradigm was established in the 1950s by Medawar and others who showed that rodents injected in utero with allogeneic cells were later capable of accepting skin grafts from donors of the same lineage as the prenatally injected cells3,4. The theory underpinning these results is that antigens encountered under non-inflammatory conditions during intrauterine life are perceived as ‘self' by the fetal immune system, leading to the deletion or functional inactivation of antigen-reactive lymphocytes19,32. Although leveraging prenatal tolerization as a strategy for avoiding ADAs in AAV-bNAb-treated children may seem challenging at first, it would not be impossible considering that pregnant women living in regions of high HIV-1 prevalence are among the key populations that the WHO is prioritizing for receiving passive immunizations with bNAbs for HIV-1 prevention33.

Notably, the ability to develop tolerance to foreign antigens is not an intrinsic property of the immune system in early life. In mice, the same allogeneic cells that can induce tolerance in neonates can also do so in adults when larger doses are used34. Similarly, in the context of living donor renal transplantation, perioperative infusions of donor-derived haematopoietic cells to the organ recipient can improve allograft survival through the induction of tolerance35. These observations from transplantation immunology have parallels with the long recognized but poorly understood phenomenon of high zone tolerance (HZT)—that is, the ability of systemic injections of large amounts of soluble non-aggregated and non-adjuvanted antigens to induce a state of immune unresponsiveness specific to the delivered antigen36,37. HZT has shown efficacy in the context of replacement therapy with recombinant factor XIII in patients with haemophilia A38. This clinical precedent raises the intriguing possibility that HZT could be used to tolerize older children or even adults to recombinant HIV-1 bNAbs. Given the excellent safety and efficacy records of passive immunizations with HIV-1 bNAbs in children, future studies should evaluate the extent to which prior administration of large doses of recombinant versions of the same HIV-1 bNAbs encoded by AAV vectors can prevent ADAs following AAV-bNAb gene therapy.

Because wild-type AAV is endemic in humans39, pre-existing cross-reactive NAbs against AAV vectors pose a significant obstacle to the clinical deployment of these gene therapies. Although nearly nothing is known about the seroprevalence of AAV vectors in African children, Calcedo et al. have reported that less than 20% of North American newborns display AAV-8 NAb titres greater than 1:20 and this figure eventually drops to 0% by the seventh month of life, consistent with the clearance of maternal anti-AAV IgG NAbs40. Although pre-existing serum titres of 1:20 can abrogate AAV-8-mediated liver transduction following systemic delivery41, this threshold is less severe when vectors are administered directly to skeletal muscle. Indeed, intramuscular gene therapy with AAV-8 can result in unabated transgene expression in monkeys with AAV-8 NAb titres of up to 1:160 at the time of vector inoculation42. Given the high rates of perinatal HIV-1 transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, more work is needed to characterize the seroprevalence of muscle-tropic AAV serotypes in the region so that appropriate capsids can be selected to maximize coverage of AAV-bNAb therapies among infants with greater likelihood of acquiring HIV-1.

Our investigation into infant responses to AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS gene therapy suggests a diminished capacity for acquiring tolerance to AAV-encoded bNAbs with increasing age, as evidenced by a positive correlation with increasing frequency of ADA responses and a corresponding negative correlation between the age at vector administration and bNAb expression levels. This aligns with the transition of the neonatal immune system from a tolerogenic state, which is crucial for not reacting against maternal antigens in utero, to an active immunity mode for defence against postnatal infections. Elucidating the immunological mechanisms of this early-life transition may uncover new strategies for dampening unwanted immune responses, including the ADAs that undermine the efficacy AAV-bNAb therapies in adults. To explore these mechanisms, we characterized the transcriptional signatures elicited by the AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector administration in groups 5–9. Our analysis uncovered substantial differences in how rhesus macaques respond to AAV-bNAb therapy during early infancy compared with later stages. However, we were unable to identify a specific set of DEGs associated with the development or suppression of ADA responses. This limitation may be due to the use of bulk transcriptomics, which relies on averaged transcript abundances in whole blood and lacks resolution at the cellular level. Single-cell RNA-seq could have provided higher resolution, but its application was constrained by the limited blood volume obtainable from infant macaques at each time point. Moreover, the small group sizes and high intra-group variability in DEGs further reduced the statistical power of our analysis.

In sum, here we show that newborn and prenatally bNAb-exposed older infant macaques can develop persistent bNAb expression lasting for years after a single intramuscular administration of AAV-bNAb vectors. If these results are reproduced in humans, AAV-vectored delivery of HIV-1 IgG biologics could provide a practical and scalable tool for combating paediatric HIV-1 infections in the developing world. The appeal of this approach is further bolstered by the thermostability of AAVs43 and the simplicity of intramuscular injections, which could facilitate the deployment of AAV-bNAb vectors to remote areas where cold chains may be difficult to maintain. In addition to HIV-1, insights gained from this study are also potentially applicable to other intractable infectious diseases that disproportionately affect paediatric populations. For example, malaria is a leading cause of death among children below five years of age in developing countries44. Although the WHO has recently approved two vaccines for the prevention of malaria in children, the protection that they afford is short-lived and requires multiple booster doses to sustain efficacy45. Since plasmodium-specific monoclonal antibodies capable of preventing malaria infection in adults and children have been isolated45, AAV-vectored delivery of these molecules at birth could afford potent malaria prophylaxis for years without the need for redosing. Thus, successful deployment and uptake of intramuscular gene therapies with pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies could simplify efforts to prevent and treat communicable diseases in low-income countries.

This study has several limitations. First, we evaluated AAV-delivered HIV-1 bNAbs using a single bNAb-sensitive SHIV strain, which does not reflect the genetic diversity of circulating HIV-1 variants in humans. Second, species differences in body size and the uncertain allometric scaling of intramuscular AAV doses limit extrapolation to human infants, who may develop different bNAb concentrations in serum, especially as they grow. Third, we did not determine the cellular sources of transgene expression in macaques with sustained bNAb production. However, prior studies46,47 suggest that the majority of bNAb production in vivo originates from long-lived myocytes that were transduced with the AAV vectors at the time of intramuscular dosing. Fourth, AAV-based gene therapies remain prohibitively expensive and largely inaccessible in low- and middle-income countries, due in part to profit-driven regulatory frameworks that influence pricing. Despite this, ongoing advances in AAV vector production48, capsid engineering49 and cell and gene therapy manufacturing capacity in low- and middle-income countries, along with evolving policy initiatives and calls to reform the current business model50, hold promise for making these therapies more affordable and globally available.

A total of 65 rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) of Indian origin were utilized in this study (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). All macaques were born and raised at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). The maintenance and handling of the animals adhered to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Welfare Act and regulations, as well as the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal care and use programme of The University of California, Davis, which oversees the CNPRC, is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, registered with the USDA, and maintains a Public Health Services Assurance. All procedures and experiments conducted for this study received approval from the University of California-Davis's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol numbers 21768, 21884, 20609, and 22373).

The primary criterion for enroling macaques in experiments involving gene therapy with AAV vectors was seronegativity for the relevant AAV capsid. To identify eligible macaques, pregnant adult females were screened for serum IgG antibodies against AAV-1 and/or AAV-8 by ELISA (see ‘Estimation of serum anti-AAV antibodies' section) and those that were seronegative for the capsid(s) of interest were placed on hold. Dams with a history of prior live births were prioritized. The infants in groups 1–5 were vaginally delivered by dams in the outdoor colony. Those that were assigned to groups requiring AAV vector administrations at birth were removed from their mothers within 48 h of delivery and transferred to the nursery for specialized care and monitoring. Nursery-reared infants were fed a nutritionally balanced formula (Enfamil Lipil + Iron) and provided with surrogate companions, such as soft toys and blankets, to promote social and emotional development. Trained animal care staff closely monitored the infants' health, growth and behaviour, ensuring that their physical and psychological needs were met. The infants received regular veterinary check-ups and were gradually introduced to solid foods and social housing with age-matched peers as part of their normal developmental process. The CNPRC nursery-rearing standards are designed to minimize stress and maximize the infants' well-being, in accordance with current best practices for nonhuman primate husbandry and care in research settings. Nursery-reared infants also received high-protein chow as a supplement to formula. The diet converged over time to high-protein chow at the age of six months. All monkeys received seasonal fruits as part of the CNPRC feeding enrichment programme. Group sizes were dictated by the limited availability of AAV-8 seronegative monkeys. At least six AAV-treated and six control macaques were used in each SHIV challenge study. Efforts were made to balance groups for sex, so allocation of monkeys to each group was not random. Animal staff were not blinded to group assignments.

To identify the mothers of the infants that would be assigned to groups 7–11, we used ELISA to screen archived sera and sera collected during bi-annual physical exams for anti-AAV-8 antibodies. AAV-8 seronegative mothers-to-be were identified and their status was confirmed by a second ELISA. Monkeys that remained AAV-8 seronegative after the second ELISA were moved to indoor housing. At the time of this relocation and four weeks later, additional serum samples were collected for confirmatory AAV-8 ELISAs. If a monkey seroconverted during this quarantine screening period, it was excluded from the cohort and returned to the colony. Following three rounds of AAV screening, 16 pregnant dams remained AAV-8 seronegative and were ultimately assigned to groups A–C (Extended Data Table 2). These monkeys were then transferred to an ABSL-2 environment with specific personal protective equipment requirements to avoid transmission of wild-type AAV from the outside.

The 16 AAV-8 seronegative pregnant dams in groups A–C were scheduled to undergo caesarian section when their pregnancies reached term (approximately gestational week 24), but two dams (rhA-1 and rhA-3) delivered their babies vaginally ahead of time (Extended Data Table 2). The remaining 14 dams underwent caesarian section, which was performed by experienced veterinarians boarded by the American College of Laboratory of Animal Medicine. Initially, inhalant anaesthesia was administered, followed by surgical preparation. A laparotomy incision was made at the caudal ventral abdominal midline, and the uterus was then exteriorized. A uterotomy incision was carefully made to avoid placental sites, and the neonate was delivered. Neonatal resuscitative procedures were initiated, and the neonate was transferred to a warm workstation for monitoring. The uterotomy and the abdominal wall were closed using absorbable sutures in layers. Oxytocin was administered as needed during or after uterine closure. Following surgery, the dams were monitored in the recovery room or home cage until they maintained an upright posture. Post-surgical analgesics were administered according to standard protocols.

To deliver the recombinant bNAbs to the pregnant dams in groups B and C, the monkeys were sedated and the site over the vein where the catheter was to be placed was shaved. The area was then cleaned with gauze soaked in alcohol. During this preparation, sterility of the catheter end, which was to be inserted into the vein, was maintained. The catheter, with its stylette-bevel up, was placed on the skin. The skin was punctured with the catheter stylette, which was then introduced into the vein. While holding the stylette stable, the catheter was advanced into the vein. The stylette was then withdrawn while the catheter was held in place. An injection cap or flush syringe was attached to the catheter. The placement of the catheter was checked by flushing with a small volume of flush or fluid solution, and careful observation was made to ensure the fluid flowed into the vein without any leakage into the subcutaneous area. The catheter was then taped to the limb to secure it. For the slow infusion procedure, 30 mg kg−1 of recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1 or rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS proteins was delivered through the intravenous catheter at a rate of approximately 2.0 ml min−1. The intravenous line was flushed with saline at the end of the infusion to ensure the full amount of the bNAbs was delivered.

Monkeys had to weigh at least 0.5 kg to be eligible for AAV vector inoculations. The group 1 infants were injected intramuscularly with a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing weight-adjusted amounts of two AAV-1 vectors: one expressing rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS (2.0 × 1012 genome copies (GC) per kg; VCAV-05105) and the other encoding rhesus tyrosine-protein sulfotransferase-2 (TPST-2; 5.0 × 1011 GC kg−1; VCAV-05102). TPST-2 is needed during cellular synthesis of eCD4-Ig to sulfate the tyrosines in its co-receptor mimetic peptide. The sulfopeptide in the AAV-encoded rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS molecule was mim6 (GGGGGDYYDYDGGYYYDGD). Each monkey received 400 μl of this vector inoculum, which was split evenly between 2 injections into each quadriceps muscle. The group 1 infants were treated with the aforementioned AAV-1 vectors within 24 h after birth.

The group 2 infants were treated intravenously with an AAV-8-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS (5.0 × 1012 GC kg−1; VCAV-05106) vector within 24 h of birth. Because the majority of intravenously administered AAV particles end up in the liver, where TPST-2 is constitutively expressed, no TPST-2-expressing AAV vector was delivered at this stage. The AAV-8-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS inoculum consisted of 500 μl of PBS containing a weight-adjusted dose of the vector. At postnatal week 4, the group 2 infants were treated intramuscularly with the same doses of the same AAV-1-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS and AAV-1-TPST-2 vectors given to the group 1 infants. This AAV-1 inoculum was formulated and administered as described above for group 1.

The group 3 infants were treated intramuscularly with 400 µl of a PBS solution containing 2.0 × 1012 GC kg−1 of an AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (VCAV-04757) vector within 24 h of birth. The AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS inoculum was formulated and administered as described above for group 1. The group 3 monkey rh3-3 was euthanized at postnatal week 21 so that the remaining infants in groups 1–3 could be transitioned to paired housing.

Beginning at postnatal weeks 30–34, the monkeys in groups 1–4 (except for rh3-3) were subjected to weekly oral challenges with escalating doses of a SHIV-AD8EO stock produced in HEK293T cells. The concentration of this SHIV-AD8EO stock was 6.6 × 105 pg ml–1 of Gag p27. For the first oral challenge, each macaque was exposed to 129 pg Gag p27, which corresponded to a 5,000-fold dilution of the stock. The appropriately diluted virus inoculum was loaded into syringes without needles in a final volume of 0.5 to 1.0 ml. The challenge dose was doubled after each exposure. Beginning at the 12th exposure, the challenge inoculum consisted of 0.5 ml of the undiluted SHIV-AD8EO stock. Plasma was collected at the time of each challenge and tested for the presence of viral RNA (vRNA). Monkeys that remained aviraemic continued to be re-challenged in the next week. However, once a macaque experienced two consecutive episodes of positive viraemia, it was deemed to be infected and did not receive additional virus challenges. Plasma viral loads were then monitored for up to ten weeks post-infection.

The macaques in groups 5 and 6 were treated intramuscularly with the same dose of AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS given to the group 3 infants, but the vector lot was different (VCAV-06302). The AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS inoculum was formulated in PBS as described above and split into four and eight separate muscle sites for the group 5 and group 6 monkeys, respectively. Of note, the group 5 infant rh5-6 was born below the pre-specified weight criterion (≥0.5 kg) to be inoculated with an AAV vector. It took four weeks for monkey rh5-6 to gain enough weight to meet this criterion, so rh5-6 was treated with AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS one month after its group 5 counterparts.

The macaques in groups 7–11 were treated intramuscularly with 2.5 × 1012 GC kg−1 of the same lot of AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (VCAV-06302) given to groups 5 and 6. The AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS inoculum was formulated in PBS and split into four separate muscle injections, as described above.

When the group 5 macaques reached ~2.5 years of age, they were subjected to weekly intrarectal challenges with a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived stock of SHIV-AD8EO. The six rhesus macaques in group 12 served as controls for this experiment. The SHIV-AD8EO stock used for this experiment was amplified in concanavalin A-activated rhesus PBMCs for 7 days. The Gag p27 concentration of the resulting stock was 96 ng ml–1 and each monkey in groups 5 and 12 was challenged intrarectally with 3.8 ng of Gag p27 of this stock. The challenge inoculum for each macaque consisted of 1.0 ml of PBS containing 0.5% of fetal bovine serum and 1:25 dilution of the aforementioned SHIV-AD8EO stock. This volume was loaded into 3-ml syringes and applied intrarectally (without needle) to each macaque. Plasma was collected at the time of each challenge and tested for the presence of vRNA. Monkeys that remained aviraemic continued to be re-challenged in the next week. However, once a macaque experienced two consecutive episodes of positive viraemia or a single episode with a viral load greater than 1,000 vRNA copies ml–1 of plasma, it was deemed to be infected and did not receive additional virus challenges. Plasma viral loads were then monitored for 10 weeks after infection.

Three hundred and fifty-microliter EDTA plasma samples were collected from the infant macaques in groups 1–4 during the oral SHIV-AD8EO challenge phase. These samples were diluted 1:1 with TRIS buffer and then RNA was extracted and analysed as previously described51. The threshold of detection on an input volume of 0.35 ml of plasma was 29 vRNA copies ml–1.

Plasma viral loads from rhesus macaques in groups 5 and 12 were measured using 0.5 ml of EDTA-anticoagulated plasma based on a modification of a previously published method51. The threshold of detection on an input volume of 0.5 ml of plasma was 15 vRNA copies ml–1.

The recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1 and rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS proteins used in groups B and C were expressed by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1SP cell lines stably expressing each molecule. Both cell lines were developed and authenticated by Genscript, but they were not tested for Mycoplasma contamination. In sum, linearized plasmids encoding each molecule were transfected into CHO-K1SP cells, followed by cell pool screening and selection. The selected pools were then subjected to single clone screening using the limiting dilution method, followed by single clone batching in six-well plates. After the first batch of single clones was identified, the top six were selected for fed-batch. Based on their growth performance and productivity, the top three clones were selected for final delivery. Both molecules were purified from supernatant by affinity chromatography, followed by cation exchange and ultrafiltration–diafiltration. Both molecules were formulated in citrate buffer (20 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.0, 0.02% Tween-80) at a concentration of ~10.5 mg ml–1. The endotoxin level was less than 1.0 endotoxin units per mg of protein, as determined by the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL)/tachypleus amebocyte lysate (TAL) assay. The rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS molecule (lot U086PGG21009/202201) was produced and purified by Genscript, and the rh-3BNC117-IgG1 protein (RRID: AB_2895627, lot JH21-08) was produced and purified by MassBiologics.

Three single-stranded AAV transfer plasmids were used to produce the recombinant AAV vectors described in this study. The first one encoded rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS and was used to prepare the AAV-8 vector used in group 3 and groups 5–11. Transgene expression was under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. A simian virus 40 (SV40) intron was placed between the promoter and the rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS transgene. To reduce the immunogenicity of this vector, the promoter and transgene sequences lacked CpG motifs that can serve as ligands for TLR952. The rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS transgene was bicistronic; that is, both heavy and light chains of IgG1 were expressed from one open reading frame using an F2A ‘self-processing' peptide from foot-and-mouth disease virus. The cleavage sequence RKRR for the cellular protease furin is added for removal of amino acids that were left on the heavy chain C-terminus following F2A self-processing. The peptide linker SGSG is added for improved furin enzyme-mediated cleavage. Additionally, the 3′ untranslated region contains multiple binding sites for conserved endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) that are specifically expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs). These miRNA binding sites were included to render the monoclonal antibody transcripts sensitive to translational inhibition by the miRNAs expressed in pAPCs. The second AAV expression cassette encoded a rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS molecule and was used to prepare the AAV-1 and AAV-8 vectors used in groups 1 and 2. Additional relevant features about the rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS protein include an I39N substitution in the CD4 domains intended to increase HIV neutralization potency and the use of mim6 (GGGGGDYYDYDGGYYYDGD) as the carboxyl-terminus co-receptor mimetic peptide. Transgene expression was under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter with a CMV enhancer and an SV40 intron. Downstream from the rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS transgene was the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element, which was intended to increase transgene expression. The third AAV expression cassette encoded rh-TPST-2 and was used to prepare the AAV-1-rh-TPST-2 construct that was co-delivered with the AAV-1-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS vector during the intramuscular inoculations of the group 1 and group 2 monkeys. The promoter structure of this vector consisted of the CMV promoter and CMV enhancer, followed by the SV40 intron. All AAV expression cassettes used in this study contained the SV40 poly-adenylation signal and were flanked by AAV-2 inverted terminal repeats. All recombinant AAV vectors used in this study were produced at the Horae Gene Therapy Center and Vector Core at the UMass Chan Medical School as described previously53. In brief, HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, authenticated and tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination) were co-transfected with each transfer plasmid, a plasmid co-expressing the AAV-2 Rep protein with the AAV-1 or AAV-8 capsid, and a helper plasmid encoding adenovirus genes. After collecting lysates of transfected cells, AAV was purified through three sequential CsCl centrifugation steps. The vector GC number per ml was determined by quantitative PCR. The purity of the AAV preparations was verified by silver-stained SDS–PAGE.

Following collection of peripheral blood (~0.5 ml per time point) in BD PAXgene tubes, the tubes were gently inverted 8–10 times and stored vertically at room temperature for a minimum of 2 h. The tubes were then transferred to a −80 °C freezer where they were stored until the time of the RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using a Paxgene Blood miRNA kit (Qiagen 763134), following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA was eluted in buffer BR5 (supplied in the kit), incubated at 65 °C for 5 min for RNA denaturation, and stored immediately at −80 °C. RNA samples were shipped on dry ice to Novogene for RNA quality control, library preparation and RNA sequencing. cDNA libraries were prepared at Novogene from total RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB E7770L). Sequencing was performed on a Novaseq 6000 instrument (Illumina).

After initial quality control, the sequence data were quantified using Kallisto54, to obtain transcript level abundances using Mmul_10 (Ensembl) as reference. Following quantification, DEGs and differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were identified using Sleuth55. The DETs were identified in samples collected on day 3 and week 4 vs. baseline (day 0) post-AAV vector administration in group 5 and group 6, respectively. We performed a similar analysis in infants in group 7 and in those in groups 8 and 9. Significant DETs were defined using a q-value (Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value) threshold of <0.05. Over-representation analysis was performed using the Clusterprofiler56,57 tool to identify enrichment of the genes in specific pathways described in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)58 and Reactome59 databases. The gene counts for groups 5–9 in Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7 ranged from 20,515 to 28,321.

Concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS in macaque serum were quantified by ELISA as follows: 384-well high binding polystyrene plates (Corning 3700) were coated with 4.0 μg ml–1 of the anti-idiotype antibody 1F1 (Protein Production Facility, The Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University, NC) diluted in Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (DPBS) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The plate was washed twice with 10× diluted commercial 0.5% Tween-20 solution (BioWorld 40120769-3) and blocked with 5.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DPBS (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. The blocking buffer was aspirated off the plate and serum samples, serially diluted in the blocking buffer, were loaded onto the plate. Each assay contained serial dilutions of recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS to generate a standard curve. These serial dilutions were performed with blocking buffer and the first well of the series was spiked with macaque serum to a final dilution of 1:2,000. The samples and the standard curve dilutions were incubated in the plate for 1.5 h. The plate was then washed five times. Next, a (Fab)2 fragment conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) specific for the human Fcγ domain (Jackson Immuno 109-036-008) was diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. This solution was added to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was washed 10 times and developed using 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate solution (Thermo Fisher 34028). The reaction was stopped using Liquid Stop Solution for TMB (Surmodics LTSP-1000-01). Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a BioTek Synergy LX spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). To obtain an ELISA standard curve, the recorded absorbance values were plotted on the y axis, while the concentrations of the standard protein, namely rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS, were plotted on the x axis. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed with GraphPad Prism software, employing a four-parameter logistic or sigmoidal curve model. Subsequently, this model was used for the estimation of unknown concentrations of the analyte within the serum samples via interpolation. Interpolated values derived from the linear region typically in mid to low concentration ranges of the standard curve were utilized for further analyses. The same methodology was used to determine serum concentrations of rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS, except that plates were coated with 4.0 μg ml–1 of a mouse anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone MEM-241; Millipore Sigma SAB4700059) and serial dilutions of recombinant rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS were used to generate the standard curve of the assay.

Serum reactivity to rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS was monitored by ELISA using 384-well high binding polystyrene plates (Corning 3700). These plates were coated with a DPBS solution containing 2.0 μg ml–1 of purified recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS, which uses a κ light chain. Each plate was washed twice with 10× diluted commercial 0.5% Tween-20 solution and blocked with 5.0% (w/v) BSA in DPBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The blocking buffer was aspirated off the plate and serum samples, diluted 1:200 in the blocking buffer, were loaded onto the plate. Samples were incubated in the plate for 1.5 h. The plate was then washed five times. Next, a goat polyclonal antibody preparation specific for human IgG λ light chain and conjugated to HRP (Southern Biotech 2070-05) was diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. This solution was added to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was washed 10 times and developed using 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate solution (Thermo Fisher 34028). The reaction was stopped using Liquid Stop Solution for TMB (Surmodics LTSP-1000-01). The same 384-well ELISA plate was used to screen all the group 5 and group 6 samples for anti-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS antibodies. A separate plate was used for groups 7–11.

The same methodology was used to measure anti-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS antibody responses. However, because rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS does not have light chains, reactivity was assayed with detector antibodies against both κ (Southern Biotech 2060-05) and λ light chains, both diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. All serum samples from monkeys in groups 1 and 2 were tested at a fixed serum dilution of 1:20. Reactivity against each AAV-delivered molecule was plotted as background- and baseline-subtracted absorbance values measured in each assay.

TZM-bl neutralization assays were performed as described60. In brief, rhesus serum was serially diluted, mixed with SHIV-AD8EO Env-pseudotyped SG3.1 pseudovirus, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Program; not authenticated) were then added to each well and the plate was incubated for an additional 48 h. DEAE dextran was added to the cell containing media before its addition to the plate, such that the final concentration in each well was 15 μg ml–1. Plates were developed using Britelite reagent (PerkinElmer 6066761) and luciferase activity, measured as total luminescence, was quantified using a Synergy LX plate reader (Agilent Technologies). Raw luminescence values were converted to ‘per cent neutralization' using the formula [1 − (sample luminescence − background luminescence)/(virus control − background luminescence)] × 100 and plotted in GraphPad Prism software. ID50 titres were calculated by fitting each neutralization curve with a 4-parameter logistic non-linear regression, and then interpolating 50% neutralization onto each curve. The TZM-bl cell line tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination.

ELISA plates (384-well high binding polystyrene plates; Corning 3700) were coated with rAAV-8 viral particles by adding 30 µl of AAV-8, diluted to 1.55 × 1010 GC ml–1 in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+, to each well. Coating was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then washed twice with a commercial wash buffer (BioWorld 40120769-3) and blocked by adding 90 µl of 5.0% Blotto (Rockland Immunochemicals B5010500) in DPBS followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was aspirated and serum samples, diluted by a factor of 200 in the same blocking buffer, were loaded onto the plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed 5 times. A Fab fragment conjugated to HRP, specific for human Fcγ (Jackson Immuno 109-036-008) was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was then washed 10 times and developed using 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate solution (Thermo Fisher 34028) and Liquid Stop Solution for TMB (Surmodics LTSP-1000-01). All samples in the study were measured on the same ELISA plate, so that valid relative comparisons could be made using raw absorbance values.

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to determine whether the rate of SHIV-AD8EO acquisition differed between AAV-treated and control macaques following oral or intrarectal challenges with SHIV-AD8EO. The P values for these comparisons were calculated using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Differences between serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS, anti-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS antibody responses (that is, ADAs) and other immune parameters were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U-test.

For comparisons of ADAs between groups, we determined the cumulative levels of these responses for each monkey. Specifically, we calculated the AUC of absorbance values measured during the 20 weeks of follow-up after the AAV vector administration. To avoid confounders related to inter-assay variability in ADA values, only absorbance values measured in the same 384-well ELISA plate were used to calculate AUC values. For these assays, the developing reagents were added to the plates within seconds using an automated 96-channel pipette in order to minimize time differences in well development.

The Spearman rank correlation method was used to search for associations between the age of monkeys at the time of AAV-bNAb vector administration and bNAb serum concentrations and the cumulative levels of anti-bNAb antibody responses measured over time. The incidence of macaques that developed persistent bNAb expression following AAV-bNAb therapy was compared between experimental or age groups using Fisher's exact test. A significance threshold of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. All P values reported here are two-tailed.

a, The three infants in Group 1 were treated intramuscularly (IM) at birth with the indicated dose of an AAV-1 vector expressing rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS. b, The three infants in Group 2 were treated intravenously (IV) at birth with the indicated dose of an AAV-8 vector expressing rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS. Four weeks later, the Group 2 macaques were injected IM with the same dose of the same AAV-1/rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS vector administered to the Group 1 animals. c, The three infants in Group 3 were injected IM at birth with the indicated dose of an AAV-8 vector expressing rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS. As the nine infants in Groups 1–3 approached 20 weeks of age, a per-protocol transition to paired housing necessitated the removal of one animal from the study. Because serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS had fallen below detection limits after week 12 in the Group 3 infant rh3-3, this animal was removed from the study. d, The six AAV vector-naïve infants in Group 4 were matched in age to those in Groups 1–3. Beginning at postnatal weeks 30–34, all the AAV-treated RMs in Groups 1–3 (except for rh3-3) and the Group 4 controls were subjected to weekly oral challenges with escalating doses of SHIV-AD8EO.

Weight (kg) increased at an expected rate in the AAV vector-treated infant macaques in Group 1 (a), Group 2 (b), and Group 3 (c) during the first year of life. The timing of each AAV vector inoculation is indicated by vertical dotted lines and color-coded hexagons.

Source Data

Sera from the macaques in Group 1 (a-c), Group 2 (d-f), and Group 3 (g,h) were tested for their ability to neutralize the in vitro infectivity of SHIV-AD8EO in TZM-bl cells. Neutralizing titers [i.e., inhibitory dilutions at which 50% of neutralization (ID50) was observed] were derived from these assays and plotted against the right y-axis of each panel. As a reference, the serum concentrations of rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS (a-f) or rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (g,h) were plotted against the left y-axis. Sera from the Group 3 macaque rh3-3 were not assayed for anti-SHIV-AD8EO neutralizing antibodies because this animal was euthanized before the start of the oral SHIV challenge phase (gray shaded boxes).

Source Data

Total IgG reactivity to the AAV-8 capsid was measured by ELISA using a fixed dilution (1:1,000) of serum collected at baseline (day 0) and every two weeks thereafter until the last follow up at week 20. All samples from the Group 5 (n = 6; a) and Group 6 (n = 6; b) animals were tested in the same 384-well ELISA plate and the absorbance values measured at 450 nm for each sample were plotted against time. c, Geometric means of absorbance values measured for Group 5 (yellow hexagons) and Group 6 (gray hexagons) were plotted against time. The two-sided P value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test and resulted from comparing Groups 5 and 6 in terms of their cumulative levels of anti-AAV-8 IgG reactivity (area under curve analysis of absorbance values) measured over the 20 weeks of follow-up.

Source Data

Sixteen pregnant female rhesus macaques at similar gestational stages were selected on the basis of having little or no serum reactivity to AAV-8 by ELISA. These animals were then divided into three groups depending on whether they were treated with recombinant forms of rh-3BNC117-IgG1. The Group A dams (n = 8) received no bNAb infusion and underwent cesarean (c)-section when their pregnancies reached term at gestational week 24. The only exceptions were dams rhA-1 and rhA-3, which delivered their babies vaginally ahead of schedule. The dams in Groups B and C (n = 4 each) were treated intravenously with 30 mg/kg of recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS or rh-3BNC117-IgG1, respectively, at gestational week 22 and then underwent c-section two weeks later. The offspring of the dams in Groups A-C were transferred to the nursery after birth and then assigned to Groups 7–11. The infants in Groups 7–11 were treated intramuscularly (IM) with 2.0 × 1012 genome copies ml–1 of an AAV-8/rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS vector at postnatal weeks 4, 8, or 12, as depicted.

Hidden Lake Bursts through Greenland Ice in ‘Extremely Surprising' Event

Water usually flows downward, but something strange happened under Greenland's ice sheet when a deluge punched through the surface to scour an area nearly twice the size of New York's Central Park

A subglacial flood in Greenland burst upward through tens of meters of ice, pushing up blocks the size of five-story buildings and scouring clear an area nearly twice the size of Central Park in New York City, according to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

This occurrence of water fountaining up instead of flowing down along the base of Greenland's ice sheet was “extremely surprising,” says Winnie Chu, an assistant professor of geophysics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the paper but studies the country's ice. “Having meltwater basically forcing its way up from the bed, that requires some extremely unique conditions,” Chu says.

The event occurred in 2014 near Harder Glacier in far northern Greenland—a spot where a flash flood wouldn't get noticed on the ground. Mal McMillan, a professor of Earth observation at Lancaster University in England, and his colleagues discovered the flood a decade later while searching for signs of lakes beneath the ice in satellite imagery.

These lakes are important because they affect the overall water cycle and ice movement in Greenland. Typically, they form from meltwater on the surface that drains down and gets trapped between the ice and the bedrock. On occasion, they rapidly empty, sending water flowing between the ice and rock, sometimes to the sea and sometimes under glaciers, where they grease the skids and help glaciers flow faster.

These lakes are small, however, so accounting for their impact in models of the Greenland ice sheet has been difficult so far. Increasingly good imagery has enabled researchers to see upwellings or divots in the ice that indicate that a subglacial lake is filling or draining. When looking at this historical data near Harder Glacier, the new study's team noticed a two-square-kilometer area of ice that had collapsed into an 85-meter-deep sinkhole. “We dug deeper into it, and what we found, which was even more interesting..., was this fracture zone downstream, which we had totally not expected to see,” McMillan says.

Beyond the fracture zone were six square kilometers of smooth ice, wiped clean by a giant deluge. The researchers realized that the collapsed area was a subglacial lake that had rapidly drained. About a kilometer downstream, however, the water hit some kind of obstacle. Instead of flowing down, it pushed up, creating an upheaval of ice blocks and crevasses and what must have been a dramatic gush of 90 million cubic meters of water, or the amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls in nine hours. This all happened within the span of about 10 days.

The water then drained back under the ice sheet and may have ended up beneath Harder Glacier, which—coincidentally or not—saw a large calving event, in which a chunk of ice plopped into the sea, during that same 10-day period. The glacier also saw unusual changes in its flow rate that summer, suggesting that the flood had an impact on its dynamics, the researchers reported in the new paper.

“This is another piece in the puzzle of how big pieces of ice on our planet work,” says Robin Bell, a professor of marine and polar geophysics at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who was not involved in the research. The next question is how this puzzle piece fits in with the overall story of Greenland's rapid warming, McMillan says: “We need to understand whether this has happened on other occasions.”

Yasa, a small British engineering company, built an over-730-horsepower beast that weighs just under 30 pounds.

Here's what you'll learn reading this story.

No less than a week ago, a small British company called Yasa unofficially set the world record for the highest power density in an electric motor. Its prototype electric motor—weighing in at just 28.8 pounds—was able to output an eye-popping 737.5 horsepower. The brand's CTO, Tim Wooler, released more details in a follow-up LinkedIn post celebrating the record.

The biggest news here is that the motor is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and can be easily mass-produced, as Yasa claims it doesn't use any exotic materials like cobalt-iron laminations or litz wire. The British company claimed that production could easily be scaled up to produce up to 50,000 units per year. 

While Yasa's prototype motor took the crown for most power density, it technically isn't the most powerful electric motor on the planet. The Swedish engineers at Koenigsegg have Yasa beat with their Dark Matter electric motor, capable of producing 800 hp and 921 lb-ft of torque. But while the extra 70 horsepower is nice, the Dark Matter is roughly 60 lbs heavier than the British prototype. If we compare the power density between the two, Yasa's unit is capable of 42 w/kg, while Koenigsegg's lags well behind at 15 w/kg. 

Koenigsegg's Dark Matter disc is still incredibly impressive, as it's nearly two years. It was designed to be part of the performance hybrid system in Koenigsegg's Gemera (as the Swedish automaker isn't interested in fully electric vehicles), and is capable of producing up to 2,300 horsepower in its most powerful configuration. 

Many high-profile Italian automakers have noticed the performance benefits of Yasa tech over the years. Mercedes-Benz acquired the company in 2021, but the Italians were first to deploy the technology into many hybrid supercars; the Ferrari SF90 Stradale, Ferrari 296 GTB, Lamborghini Temerario, and Lamborghini Revuelto. (Somewhat surprisingly, the Lamborghini Urus SE we drove earlier this year featured an electric motor sourced from Volkswagen Group.)

Mercedes is the only non-Italian automaker to use Yasa's electric motors in an EV, squeezing three of them into its latest 1,360 hp AMG GT XX Concept.

Countless manufacturers have claimed to have an affordable EV on the way, and that makes us wonder: If Yasa's prototype motor cranks out 700 horsepower, how small could it make a motor that produces the mere 350 hp necessary to run a run-of-the-mill car? And how much would it cost?

Many EV manufacturers are getting carried away with horsepower and torque figures, and the resulting horsepower arms race continues to worsen exponentially. The near-instant acceleration that electric powertrains deliver is a great party trick, but it's likely unnecessary overall. A J.D. Power study from 2022 showed that the average horsepower for commuter vehicles sits around 180. Perhaps an even lighter, more modest electric motor from Yasa could be a catalyst for the next ultra-affordable, ultra-efficient EV.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

As soon as we're born, we start aging, but scientists are quickly learning that not all aging is exactly the same.

A new study, led by a team of scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and published in the journal Cell, details how humans experience accelerated aging after the the age of 50. The study identified that certain tissues (i.e. blood vessels) experience this aging faster than others, and the scientists also identified the proteins responsible for this accelerated process. 

“Based on aging-associated protein changes, we developed tissue-specific proteomic age clocks and characterized organ-level aging trajectories,” the authors write. “Temporal analysis revealed an aging inflection around age 50, with blood vessels being a tissue that ages early and is markedly susceptible to aging.”

In the study, scientists collected tissue samples across the body's major organ systems from 76 individuals of Chinese ancestry—aged 14 to 68—who all died from accidental brain injury. The tissues showed that certain organs aged at different rates. The adrenal gland—one of the body's hormone factories—showed accelerated aging at around the age of 30, and also saw an increase in 48 disease-related proteins as tissue samples trended older.

The scientists also spotted large changes in protein levels around the ages of 45 and 55. One of the biggest shifts was in the aorta, and scientists suspect that blood vessels carry these age-accelerating molecules throughout the body. 

This isn't the first study to surmise that aging isn't quite as linear as we once thought. Last year, a study from Stanford University similarly confirmed that humans largely experience a period of accelerated aging at around 44 and the early 60s, which Stanford University's Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics and the study's senior author, surmised at the time could be related to aging. Speaking with Nature about this new study, Snyder says that the findings largely align with his own scientific conclusions. 

“It fits the idea that your hormonal and metabolic control are a big deal. That is where some of the most profound shifts occur as people age,” Snyder said. “We're like a car. Some parts wear out faster.”

Understanding what those parts are will help human mechanics (AKA doctors) to keep things under the hood running for longer. As scientists continue exploring the mechanics of aging, findings will likely converge and begin tell the story of how the body more generally experiences aging throughout a lifetime. 

“Together, our findings lay the groundwork for a systems-level understanding of human aging through the lens of proteins,” the authors write.

Visceral rhythms orchestrate the physiological states underlying human emotion. Chronic aberrations in these brain–body interactions are implicated in a broad spectrum of mental health disorders. However, the relationship between gastric–brain coupling and affective symptoms remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the relationship between this novel interoceptive axis and mental health in 243 participants, using a cross-validated machine learning approach. We find that increased frontoparietal brain coupling to the gastric rhythm indexes a dimensional signature of poorer mental health, spanning anxiety, depression, stress and well-being. Control analyses confirm the specificity of these interactions to the gastric–brain axis. Our study proposes coupling between the stomach and brain as a factor in mental health and offers potential new targets for interventions remediating aberrant brain–body coupling.

Quantum mechanics is one of the most successful theories in science — and makes much of modern life possible. Technologies ranging from computer chips to medical-imaging machines rely on the application of equations, first sketched out a century ago, that describe the behaviour of objects at the microscopic scale.

But researchers still disagree widely on how best to describe the physical reality that lies behind the mathematics, as a Nature survey reveals.

Quantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution

Quantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution

At an event to mark the 100th anniversary of quantum mechanics last month, lauded specialists in quantum physics argued politely — but firmly — about the issue. “There is no quantum world,” said physicist Anton Zeilinger, at the University of Vienna, outlining his view that quantum states exist only in his head and that they describe information, rather than reality. “I disagree,” replied Alain Aspect, a physicist at the University of Paris-Saclay, who shared the 2022 Nobel prize with Zeilinger for work on quantum phenomena.

To gain a snapshot of how the wider community interprets quantum physics in its centenary year, Nature carried out the largest ever survey on the subject. We e-mailed more than 15,000 researchers whose recent papers involved quantum mechanics, and also invited attendees of the centenary meeting, held on the German island of Heligoland, to take the survey.

The responses — numbering more than 1,100, mainly from physicists — showed how widely researchers vary in their understanding of the most fundamental features of quantum experiments.



As did Aspect and Zeilinger, respondents differed radically on whether the wavefunction — the mathematical description of an object's quantum state — represents something real (36%) or is simply a useful tool (47%) or something that describes subjective beliefs about experimental outcomes (8%). This suggests that there is a significant divide between researchers who hold ‘realist' views, which project equations onto the real world, and those with ‘epistemic' ones, which say that quantum physics is concerned only with information.



The community was also split on whether there is a boundary between the quantum and classical worlds (45% of respondents said yes, 45% no and 10% were not sure). Some baulked at the set-up of our questions, and more than 100 respondents gave their own interpretations (the survey, methodology and an anonymized version of the full data are available in supplementary information at the foot of this page).



“I find it remarkable that people who are very knowledgeable about quantum theory can be convinced of completely opposite views,” says Gemma De les Coves, a theoretical physicist at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.

Nature asked researchers what they thought was the best interpretation of quantum phenomena and interactions — that is, their favourite of the various attempts scientists have made to relate the mathematics of the theory to the real world. The largest chunk of responses, 36%, favoured the Copenhagen interpretation — a practical and often-taught approach. But the survey also showed that several, more radical, viewpoints have a healthy following.

Asked about their confidence in their answer, only 24% of respondents thought their favoured interpretation was correct; others considered it merely adequate or a useful tool in some circumstances. What's more, some scientists who seemed to be in the same camp didn't give the same answers to follow-up questions, suggesting inconsistent or disparate understandings of the interpretation they chose.

“That was a big surprise to me,” says Renato Renner, a theoretical physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. The implication is that many quantum researchers simply use quantum theory without engaging deeply with what it means — the ‘shut up and calculate' approach, he says, using a phrase coined by US physicist David Mermin. But Renner, who works on the foundations of quantum mechanics, is quick to stress that there is nothing wrong with just doing calculations. “We wouldn't have a quantum computer if everyone was like me,” he says.



Over the past century, researchers have proposed many ways to interpret the reality behind the mathematics of quantum mechanics, which seems to throw up jarring paradoxes. In quantum theory, an object's behaviour is characterized by its wavefunction: a mathematical expression calculated using an equation devised by German physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926. The wavefunction describes a quantum state and how it evolves as a cloud of probabilities. As long as it remains unobserved, a particle seems to spread out like a wave; interfering with itself and other particles to be in a ‘superposition' of states, as though in many places or having multiple values of an attribute at once. But an observation of a particle's properties — a measurement — shocks this hazy existence into a single state with definite values. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘collapse' of the wavefunction.

Physicists should revel in the diversity of ways to understand quantum mechanics

Physicists should revel in the diversity of ways to understand quantum mechanics

It gets stranger: putting two particles into a state of joint superposition can lead to entanglement, which means that their quantum states remain intertwined even when the particles are far apart.

The German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who helped to craft the mathematics behind quantum mechanics in 1925, and his mentor, Danish physicist Niels Bohr, got around the alien wave–particle duality largely by accepting that classical ways of understanding the world were limited, and that people could only know what observation told them. For Bohr, it was OK that an object varied between acting like a particle and like a wave, because these were concepts borrowed from classical physics that could be revealed only one at a time, by experiment. The experimenter lived in the world of classical physics and was separate from the quantum system they were measuring.

Heisenberg and Bohr not only took the view that it was impossible to talk about an object's location until it had been observed by experiment, but also argued that an unobserved particle's properties really were fundamentally unfixed until measurement — rather than being defined, but not known to experimenters. This picture famously troubled Einstein, who persisted in the view that there was a pre-existing reality that it was science's job to measure.

Decades later, an amalgamation of Heisenberg's and Bohr's not-always-unified views became known as the Copenhagen interpretation, after the university at which the duo did their seminal work. Those views remain the most popular vision of quantum mechanics today, according to Nature's survey. For Časlav Brukner, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna, this interpretation's strong showing “reflects its continued utility in guiding everyday quantum practice”. Almost half of the experimental physicists who responded to the survey favoured this interpretation, compared with 33% of the theorists. “It is the simplest we have,” says Décio Krause, a philosopher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who studies the foundations of physics, and who responded to the survey. Despite its issues, the alternatives “present other problems which, to me, are worse”, he says.

But others argue that Copenhagen's emergence as the default comes from historical accident, rather than its strengths. Critics say it allows physicists to sidestep deeper questions.

Do our observations make reality happen?

Do our observations make reality happen?

One concerns the ‘measurement problem', asking how a measurement can trigger objects to switch from existing in quantum states that describe probabilities, to having the defined properties of the classical world.

Another unclear feature is whether the wavefunction represents something real (an answer selected by 29% of those who favoured the Copenhagen interpretation) or just information about the probabilities of finding various values when measured (picked by 63% of this group). “I'm disappointed but not surprised at the popularity of Copenhagen,” says Elise Crull, a philosopher of physics at the City University of New York. “My feeling is that physicists haven't reflected.”

The Copenhagen interpretation's philosophical underpinnings have become so normalized as to seem like no interpretation at all, adds Robert Spekkens, who studies quantum foundations at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. Many advocates are “just drinking the Kool-Aid of the Copenhagen philosophy without examining it”, he says.

Survey respondents who have carried out research in philosophy or quantum foundations, studying the assumptions and principles behind quantum physics, were the least likely to favour the Copenhagen interpretation, with just 20% selecting it. “If I use quantum mechanics in my lab every day, I don't need to go past Copenhagen,” says Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France. But as soon as researchers apply thought experiments that probe more deeply, “Copenhagen is not enough”, he says.

In the years after the Second World War and the development of the atomic bomb, physicists began to exploit the uses of quantum mechanics, and the US government poured cash into the field. Philosophical investigation was put on the back burner. The Copenhagen interpretation came to dominate mainstream physics, but still, some physicists found it unsatisfying and came up with alternatives (see ‘Quantum mechanics: five interpretations').



In 1952, US physicist David Bohm resurfaced an idea first touted in 1927 by French physicist Louis de Broglie, namely that the strange dual nature of quantum objects made sense if they were point-like particles with paths determined by ‘pilot' waves. ‘Bohmian' mechanics had the advantage of explaining interference effects while restoring determinism, the idea that the properties of particles do have set values before being measured. Nature's survey found that 7% of respondents considered this interpretation the most convincing.

Then, in 1957, US physicist Hugh Everett came up with a wilder alternative, one that 15% of survey respondents favoured. Everett's interpretation, later dubbed ‘many worlds', says that the wavefunction corresponds to something real. That is, a particle really is, in a sense, in multiple places at once. From their vantage point in one world, an observer measuring the particle would see only one outcome, but the wavefunction never really collapses. Instead it branches into many universes, one for each different outcome. “It requires a dramatic readjustment of our intuitions about the world, but to me that's just what we should expect from a fundamental theory of reality,” says Sean Carroll, a physicist and philosopher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who responded to the survey.

In the late 1980s, ‘spontaneous collapse' theories attempted to resolve issues such as the quantum measurement problem. Versions of these tweak the Schrödinger equation, so that, rather than requiring an observer or measurement to collapse, the wavefunction occasionally does so by itself. In some of these models, putting quantum objects together amplifies the likelihood of collapse, meaning that bringing a particle into a superposition with measuring equipment makes the loss of the combined quantum state inevitable. Around 4% of respondents chose these sorts of theories.

How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago

Nature's survey suggests that ‘epistemic' descriptions, which say that quantum mechanics reveals only knowledge about the world, rather than representing its physical reality, might have gained in popularity. A 2016 survey1 of 149 physicists found that only around 7% picked epistemic-related interpretations, compared with 17% in our survey (although the precise categories and methodology of the surveys differed). Some of these theories, which build on the original Copenhagen interpretation, emerged in the early 2000s, when applications such as quantum computing and communication began to frame experiments in terms of information. Adherents, such as Zeilinger, view the wavefunction as merely a tool to predict measurement outcomes, with no correspondence to the real world.

The epistemic view is appealing because it is the most cautious, says Ladina Hausmann, a theoretical physicist at the ETH who responded to the survey. “It doesn't require me to assume anything beyond how we use the quantum state in practice,” she says.

One epistemic interpretation, known as QBism (which a handful of respondents who selected ‘other' wrote down as their preferred interpretation), takes this to the extreme, stating that observations made by a specific ‘agent' are entirely personal and valid only for them. The similar ‘relational quantum mechanics', first outlined by Rovelli in 1996 (and selected by 4% of respondents), says that quantum states always describe only relationships between systems, not the systems themselves.

This Summer's Extreme Weather Explained: Flash Floods and Corn Sweat

Extreme weather is front-page news. But what are the phenomena behind the headlines?

By Rachel Feltman, Andrea Thompson, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

With summer heat domes slamming down on parts of the U.S. and hurricane season ramping up, you've no doubt seen plenty of extreme weather stories in your feed over the last few weeks. Joining me today to demystify a few of those headlines is Andrea Thompson, a senior news editor for sustainability at Scientific American.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us.

Andrea Thompson: Thanks for having me.

Feltman: So let's go over some of the topics that people might see trending in the headlines a lot, you know, during this time of year.

We'll start with flash flooding. Could you tell us a little bit about what happened in Texas and how it was possible for these floods to become so dangerous so quickly?

Thompson: Yeah, so flash flood, it's, you know, sort of in the name—it happens really quickly and often takes people by surprise. It happens when you have really intense rains over a fairly small area, usually, over a relatively short time span. And that's basically what happened in Texas. There was between six to 10 inches of rain in three hours, which is [laughs] a lot of rain. And basically, the ground just can't absorb that much water that quickly.

And it can be exacerbated by other aspects. You know, in cities you have a lot of pavement and a lot of asphalt, and those are impermeable to water, so water is going to collect even more than it would on, you know, soil. And then topography can play a role, too, and in Texas this was an area with a lot of riverbeds, a lot of steep topography that basically funnels all that water down into one area. And in this case, you know, in one spot, in Hunt, Texas, the water rose 26 feet in 45 minutes on the Guadalupe River ...

Feltman: Wow.

Thompson: Which is just an incredible amount. And that's because there's just so much rain and it's all being funneled into sort of this one riverbed. And people just don't expect water to rise that much that quickly. And, you know, for reference, 26 feet is more than two stories in a building.

And water is also extremely powerful. Just six inches of quickly moving water can knock a person off their feet.

Feltman: Mm.

Thompson: And the faster the water is moving—the force increases faster than the water's actual velocity ...

Feltman: Mm.

Thompson: So it's not exponential, but you're getting much more force even for every little step in velocity ...

Feltman: I see, yeah.

Thompson: They're really hard to forecast, and that also takes people by surprise. So we can say, “It's gonna rain in this area on this day, and pockets will have, potentially, big downpours like this,” but you can't even say, usually, a few hours out, “It's going to bring exactly this much in exactly this place,” because these are such small features in the atmosphere that, you know, weather models just can't pick them out that far in advance. So that also is an aspect in terms of people sort of being caught unawares.

Feltman: Well, let's end on—not a fun note for people who are experiencing it but something that at least [laughs] feels more fun to talk about. Everyone is Googling “corn sweat.” Everybody was talking about corn sweat last summer, and now corn sweat is back. So what is corn sweat actually [laughs]?

Thompson: Yes, and it's, it's not just the actor who's in the new Superman movie [laughs], which—I've had lots of jokes about that [laughs].

So basically, there are heat waves in the summer. They happen all the time. And some heat waves, especially if you're in, say, the western half of the country, they tend to be a drier heat; in the eastern half of the country, where it's wetter, you have a lot more humidity.

Feltman: Swampy.

Thompson: Yes [laughs]. You know, this is especially true around the Gulf Coast, where you have this really abundant source of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. You know, the level of humidity can be affected by how wet a season has been—so we've had a pretty wet summer in the East, so everything is just really saturated with water, so when it's hot there's a lot of water to evaporate, or transpire, from plants.

And that's what's happening with corn and some other crops in the Midwest. You know, these crops cover huge amounts of land, and when there's heat they transpire water vapor into the air, and that raises the humidity, and they call it “corn sweat,” which is a very funny term but [laughs] very grabby. But the Midwest is kind of notorious for these really high humidity levels, whereas when we think of humidity, we think of, like, “Oh, Florida,” or places like that ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Thompson: But no, the Midwest can get really humid in the summer because of this phenomenon.

Feltman: Well, and I feel like I ask you about this almost every time you come on, but it hasn't stopped [laughs] being important and useful: What can people do to keep cool in the summer and stay safe?

Thompson: Absolutely, so one of the keys is sort of being aware of the level of risk for you or your loved ones, neighbors. Young children, older people, people who take certain medications or have certain illnesses, especially heart disease, are more susceptible. People who work outside are much more susceptible to heat illness. So it's important to be particularly aware for those people.

Generally, you want to avoid any strenuous activity outside in the middle of the day, when the sun is at its highest and temperatures are at their highest. Staying hydrated, wearing loose clothing, light-color clothing is really helpful. Being in the shade as much as possible. You know, if you have access to air-conditioning, being in that [laughs] as much as possible.

And we actually also have a story on how to keep your home cool that includes—you know, air-conditioning is obviously kind of the gold standard in terms of keeping things comfortable; it also has the added benefit of pulling humidity out of the air. But there's a lot you can do with fans in terms of keeping a home relatively cool, and part of that is because the motion, the air currents that it generates, means there's more air moving over the surface of your skin, so that is carrying heat away from your body, and it's also carrying sweat away, which sweat is basically the way our body naturally cools itself. So it's helping that process along.

You can also do things like making sure to seal any drafts, making sure your, like, your windows are very nice and sealed. You can put up blackout blinds, or if you don't even have those, you can even just do good old-fashioned aluminum foil on the outside to reflect some of the solar heat. I've done a little bit of that myself in my apartment [laughs]. You know, and there are other tips like that to basically just minimize the amount of heat coming into your apartment and maximize the amount of cooling that is happening for you.

Feltman: Well, thank you for that advice and for filling us in on these important issues in weather, and thanks so much for coming on to chat.

Thompson: Thanks for having me!

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. If you have any questions about the weather you'd like Andrea to answer for us in a future episode, let us know by sending us an email at ScienceQuickly@sciam.com. We'll be back on Friday with a fascinating conversation on the future of artificial intelligence—and why you shouldn't freak out if your favorite chatbot starts talking about its own sentience.

Peroxisomes are metabolic organelles essential for human health. Defects in peroxisomal biogenesis proteins (also known as peroxins (PEXs)) cause devastating disease. PEX7 binds proteins containing a type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) to enable their import from the cytosol into peroxisomes, although many aspects of this process remain enigmatic. Utilizing in vitro assays, yeast and human cells, we show that PEX39, a previously uncharacterized protein, is a cytosolic peroxin that facilitates the import of PTS2-containing proteins by binding PEX7 and stabilizing its interaction with cargo proteins containing a PTS2. PEX39 and PEX13, a peroxisomal membrane translocon protein, both possess an (R/K)PWE motif necessary for PEX7 binding. Handover of PEX7 from PEX39 to PEX13 via these motifs provides a new paradigm for peroxisomal protein import and biogenesis. Collectively, this work reveals how PEX39 and (R/K)PWE motifs facilitate the import of PTS2-containing proteins and advances our understanding of peroxisomal disease.

Present in nearly all eukaryotes, peroxisomes are organelles that house important biochemical processes, such as fatty acid oxidation1. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins essential for peroxisomal biogenesis, with multiple peroxins facilitating the import of enzymes from the cytosol into the peroxisomal matrix (that is, lumen)2. Defects in peroxins cause devastating human diseases, such as Zellweger spectrum disorders3.

The import of peroxisomal enzymes occurs via a remarkable mechanism through which even folded proteins and large protein complexes can reach the organellar matrix4,5,6. Peroxisomal enzymes harbour a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1; that is, a carboxy (C)-terminal tripeptide SKL sequence or a variant of it) or, less commonly, a PTS2 (that is, an amino (N)-terminal R–(L/V/I/Q)–X–X–(L/V/I/H)–(L/S/G/A)–X–(H/Q)–(L/A) sequence, where X can be any amino acid)7,8. Although few in number, PTS2-containing proteins serve crucial roles in cellular metabolism, with defects in the PTS2-containing proteins phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH; required for fatty acid α-oxidation) and alkyl-DHAP synthase (AGPS; required for myelin synthesis) causing human diseases9,10. In the cytosol, the receptors PEX5 and PEX7 bind cargo through their PTS1 and PTS2, respectively, to initiate the import cycle. Notably, cargo-loaded PEX7 also requires the binding of a co-receptor (for example, Pex18/Pex21 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the long isoform of PEX5 in humans) to engage the downstream import machinery7,8. Cargo-loaded PEX5 or PEX7–co-receptor complexes are then recruited to the peroxisomal docking/translocation module containing the membrane proteins PEX13 and PEX14 (refs. 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19), and in yeast Pex17 (refs. 20,21,22). Notably, it has been proposed that PEX13 forms the conduit through which peroxisomal matrix proteins are translocated23,24. However, our understanding of various aspects of peroxisomal protein import remains incomplete. In this Article, we demonstrate that the previously uncharacterized S. cerevisiae (yeast) protein Yjr012c and human protein C6ORF226 are orthologues of a peroxin we have named PEX39, which facilitates the import of PTS2-containing proteins.

To better understand the import of PTS2-containing proteins, we examined PEX7 in the interactome databases BioGRID25 and BioPlex26,27. Our analysis revealed that two proteins of unknown function—S. cerevisiae Yjr012c and human C6ORF226—interact with PEX7 orthologues despite lacking a PTS2. The C6ORF226 interactome data also contain PHYH and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (ACAA1), two PTS2-containing proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 1a)28.

The circles represent proteins and the arrows point from purified proteins to interactors. For Yjr012c, only interactions found in at least two independent studies were considered. For C6ORF226, the combined interactome from HCT116 and HEK293T cells is shown. b, Domain analysis and alignment of Yjr012c and C6ORF226.

Source data

A comparison of the C6ORF226 and Yjr012c sequences revealed notable similarities, such as the presence of a domain of unknown function (DUF5572) and an (R/K)PWE motif at the DUF5572 C terminus, indicating that they are orthologues (Fig. 1b). An examination of numerous organisms revealed that the most conserved feature of Yjr012c/C6ORF226 orthologues is the (R/K)PWE motif (Extended Data Fig. 1a, left). Despite lacking a DUF5572 domain, PEX13 also possesses a conserved KPWE motif at its N terminus, as observed previously29. Notably, Yjr012c/C6ORF226 orthologues occur in all eukaryotic kingdoms, suggesting a similar evolutionary age to known peroxins (Extended Data Fig. 1a, right). Interestingly, orthologues are absent from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, which lack the PTS2-containing protein pathway30,31, as well as from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which does not import cargo proteins containing a PTS2 (ref. 32). Remarkably, outside of opisthokonts (for example, fungi and animals), Yjr012c-/C6ORF226-related sequences are fused to PEX14. Collectively, these data suggest that Yjr012c/C6ORF226 are peroxins involved in protein import. Hereafter, we refer to Homo sapiens C6ORF226 as HsPEX39 and S. cerevisiae Yjr012c as ScPex39.

Next, we explored the interactions reported for ScPex39 and HsPEX39 (Fig. 1a). In S. cerevisiae, quantitative affinity purification–mass spectrometry experiments using Pex18 fused C terminally with the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site and protein A (TPA) tag (Pex18-TPA) as bait revealed ScPex39 as a specific interactor, along with Pex7, other peroxins and the PTS2-containing protein ACAA1 (Pot1) (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1b–d and Supplementary Table 2). In the human cell lines HCT116 (Fig. 1d) and HEK293T (Fig. 1e), PHYH, ACAA1 and PEX7 tagged with FLAG-HA co-immunoprecipitated endogenous HsPEX39, whereas an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) control did not. HsPEX39-FLAG-HA also co-immunoprecipitated endogenous PEX7 and the three PTS2-containing proteins PHYH, ACAA1 and AGPS. In addition, PHYH, ACAA1 and AGPS co-immunoprecipitating with HsPEX39-FLAG-HA or PEX7-FLAG-HA migrated at the expected molecular weights of their precursor forms, consistent with PEX7 only being able to bind precursor PTS2-containing proteins due to removal of the PTS2 when the protein is converted to the mature form in the peroxisomal lumen; of note, this maturation process for PTS2-containing proteins does not occur in yeast8. In agreement with the interaction between Pex18 and ScPex39 in yeast (Fig. 1c), HsPEX39-FLAG-HA also co-immunoprecipitated PEX5 from human cell lysates (Fig. 1f). Consistent with PEX39 interacting with PEX7, PEX5/Pex18 and cargo proteins containing a PTS2, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the fusion protein ScPex39-mNeonGreen localized to both the cytosol and peroxisomes (Extended Data Fig. 1e), whereas cellular fractionation revealed that endogenous HsPEX39 is cytosolic (Extended Data Fig. 1f).

To further explore the observed interactions, we utilized native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native PAGE) to monitor complex formation between radiolabelled human [35S]H6PEX7 and different recombinant proteins, as reflected by changes in the migration of [35S]H6PEX7 (that is, gel shifts)33. Gel shifts revealed that PEX7–HsPEX39 (hashtag in Fig. 1g), PEX7–PHYH–HsPEX39 (ampersand in Fig. 1g) and PEX7–PEX5–PHYH–HsPEX39 (dollar sign in Fig. 1g) complexes are formed. Utilizing recombinant human FLAG-tagged PEX7 instead of [35S]H6PEX7 in our native PAGE assays, we observed the same complexes, as well as the previously reported PEX5–PEX7–PHYH complex33 (Extended Data Fig. 2a, top). Immunoblotting confirmed the composition of all of these complexes (Extended Data Fig. 2a, bottom). We also used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to demonstrate the formation of these complexes (Extended Data Fig. 2b). HsPEX39 could not complex with either PEX5 or PHYH alone, per native PAGE (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and SEC (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Extended Data Fig. 2d provides the purities of the recombinant proteins.

For a protein to be considered a peroxin, it must participate in a process required for peroxisomal biogenesis, such as the import of peroxisomal proteins32,34. To explore the functional importance of PEX39 in peroxisomal biogenesis, we generated loss-of-function models in both yeast and human cells. We first assessed the growth of Scpex39-null (Scpex39Δ) and pex7Δ yeast in liquid media with glucose or oleic acid as the primary energy source. With oleic acid, peroxisomal biogenesis is stimulated and cellular proliferation requires β-oxidation of fatty acids, which occurs exclusively in peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae35. Because the PTS2-containing protein Pot1 is necessary for β-oxidation, defects in the import of PTS2-containing proteins impair the fitness of oleic acid-grown cells but not glucose-grown cells36. Consistent with this, Scpex39Δ and pex7Δ cells had reduced growth in oleic acid medium (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a) but similar fitness in glucose medium (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Importantly, the poor growth of Scpex39Δ cells could be rescued by introduction of the Scpex39 gene under the control of its native promoter (Fig. 2a).

Source data

Cellular fractionation of Scpex39Δ yeast revealed a redistribution from the organellar pellet to the cytosol of Pot1 and, to a lesser extent, the PTS2-containing protein glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd1), which localizes to the cytosol, nucleus and peroxisomes37. In contrast, no changes were noted for the PTS1-containing protein Cta1 or the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3 (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 3c). As expected, Pot1 was redistributed to the cytosol in pex7Δ yeast (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Fluorescence microscopy also revealed a redistribution of Pot1 fused to mNeonGreen from peroxisomes to the cytosol in Scpex39Δ yeast, albeit to a lesser degree than in pex7Δ yeast (Fig. 2d).

Interestingly, quantitative proteomics on Scpex39Δ yeast demonstrated that Pex7 was greatly decreased but PTS2-containing proteins and other peroxins, including Pex5 and Pex18, were not (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 3). This decrease in Pex7, which was confirmed by immunoblotting (Extended Data Fig. 3e, lanes 1, 2 and 4), probably contributes to the impaired import of PTS2-containing proteins seen with ScPex39 loss. Consistent with this, Pex7 overexpression in Scpex39Δ yeast facilitated the import of PTS2-containing proteins, but to a lesser extent than in pex7Δ cells, suggesting that ScPex39 facilitates import beyond just the modulation of Pex7 levels (Extended Data Fig. 3e (lanes 1, 7 and 8) and Extended Data Fig. 3f).

To explore the consequences of HsPEX39 loss, we used CRISPR–Cas9 to generate HsPEX39 knockouts (KOs) and matched controls in human CAKI-2 and NCI-H1792 cells (see Methods for rationale). Loss of HsPEX39 did not affect PEX7 and PEX5 levels (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4a). The lack of a decrease in PEX7 levels contrasts with what we observed in yeast. Importantly though, loss of HsPEX39 increased precursor PHYH and reduced mature PHYH, consistent with a defect in the peroxisomal import of PHYH (Fig. 2f,g). However, no changes in ACAA1 or AGPS were seen (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Consistent with our observations in yeast (Fig. 2d), loss of HsPEX39 impaired the import of PTS2-containing proteins to a lesser degree than loss of PEX7 (Fig. 2h). Partial depletion of HsPEX39 via lentiviral CRISPR–Cas9 with additional independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) corroborated our findings (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Importantly, cellular fractionation revealed that HsPEX39 loss led to an accumulation of precursor PHYH in the cytosolic fraction and a decrease of mature PHYH in the organellar fraction, thus demonstrating impaired import of PTS2-containing proteins (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

Having assessed the consequences of depleting PEX39, we next investigated the effects of increasing it. Surprisingly, overexpression of HsPEX39 in wild-type HEK293T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a) increased the precursor forms and decreased the mature forms of all three PTS2-containing proteins (Fig. 3a,b), with cellular fractionation revealing an accumulation of the precursor forms in the cytosolic fraction and a decrease of mature forms in the organellar fraction (Extended Data Fig. 5b), thus demonstrating impaired import for all three PTS2-containing proteins. Similar to loss of HsPEX39, overexpression did not alter PEX5 or PEX7 levels (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

To investigate further, we used an established in vitro peroxisomal protein import system, in which a radiolabelled reporter protein (for example, a matrix protein containing a PTS1 or PTS2, or the co-receptor PEX5) is incubated with post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) containing cytosol and peroxisomes38. Specific import of radiolabelled matrix proteins is assessed by the acquisition of an organelle-associated and protease-resistant status. For PTS2-containing proteins, the appearance of radiolabelled mature forms also reflects successful import, as proteolytic processing occurs only in the peroxisomal matrix39.

Consistent with our observations in human cells, exogenous addition of recombinant HsPEX39 strongly inhibited in vitro import of [35S]ACAA1 at low nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, this inhibition could be ameliorated by the addition of excess PEX7 (Fig. 3d). In contrast with the import of PTS2-containing proteins, recombinant HsPEX39 had no effect on the import of PTS1-containing proteins in vitro, as assessed by import of the PTS1-containing protein SCP2 (Extended Data Fig. 5d) and monoubiquitination of radiolabelled PEX5 at the peroxisome and its extraction back into the cytosol (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Given that excess HsPEX39 can potently inhibit the import of PTS2-containing proteins, we wondered whether cells may maintain low levels of the protein. Indeed, in human cell lines originating from various tissues, this appears to be the case as HsPEX39 was undetectable by whole-cell proteomics of cells from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia40, even though HsPEX39 messenger RNA was present (Extended Data Fig. 5f).

Consistent with our findings in human cells, yeast overexpressing ScPex39 had reduced growth in oleic acid medium (Fig. 3e), but not in glucose medium (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Notably, Pex7 levels were not altered in yeast overexpressing ScPex39 (Extended Data Fig. 3e, lane 1 versus 5). Interestingly, cellular fractionation of yeast overexpressing ScPex39 revealed increased Pex7 in the organellar fraction relative to wild-type yeast, but no such effect was observed for the PTS2-containing proteins Pot1 and Gpd1 or the PTS1-containing protein Cta1 (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 5h). Based on these findings, we reason that a fraction of Pex7 with its PTS2-containing protein cargo is stalled at the peroxisomal membrane (and not imported) in the presence of excess ScPex39. To further investigate this, we conducted sodium carbonate extraction and sequential treatment of organellar pellets with low- and high-salt buffer (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Although Pot1 and Pex7 were not carbonate resistant (that is, not integral membrane proteins), they remained in the organellar pellet after extraction with low-salt but not high-salt buffer. Thus, we conclude that the stalled fraction of Pot1 and Pex7 is anchored at the peroxisomal membrane via protein–protein interactions when ScPex39 levels are elevated.

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the biology of PEX39, we utilized our native PAGE assays. Using radiolabelled PEX7, we observed that the interactions between PEX7 and PEX5 or PEX7 and PHYH are too weak to be detected by native PAGE (Fig. 4a, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), whereas the PEX7–PEX5–PHYH complex is stable and readily detected (asterisk in lane 4). Similar observations were made using recombinant FLAG-PEX7 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Of note, the fact that the addition of recombinant HsPEX39 allowed for a PEX7–PHYH–HsPEX39 complex to form (Fig. 4a, ampersand in lane 7) demonstrates that HsPEX39 stabilizes the weak PEX7–PHYH interaction.

Using this native PAGE assay, we next determined the apparent dissociation constants (Kd,app values) for the HsPEX39–PEX7 interaction in the presence or absence of PHYH. Although these Kd,app values are not direct measurements of PEX7 and HsPEX39 binding, they can qualitatively offer valuable information. Both the PEX7–HsPEX39 and PEX7–PHYH–HsPEX39 complexes exhibited Kd,app values for HsPEX39 in the nanomolar range, reflecting high-affinity interactions (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, the PEX7–PHYH–HsPEX39 complex formed at lower HsPEX39 concentrations (Fig. 4b, right) than those seen for formation of the PEX7–HsPEX39 complex (Fig. 4b, left), supporting our observation that HsPEX39 stabilizes the interaction between PEX7 and PTS2-containing proteins.

To gain further insights, we used AlphaFold41,42 to predict the structure of HsPEX39 in complex with human PEX7, PHYH(1–24) (the PTS2-containing portion) or PEX5(179–266) (PEX7-binding residues43) (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6b). These structural predictions corroborate our experimental finding that HsPEX39 stabilizes the PEX7–PHYH interaction by predicting that HsPEX39 binds the base of PEX7 via the conserved KPWE motif and the N-terminal half wraps around PEX7 to interact with the PTS2, thereby potentially acting as a clamp to strengthen the PEX7–PHYH interaction. Notably, beginning with the model of the PEX7–HsPEX39 complex, the addition of PHYH(1–24) is predicted to introduce a new binding surface for the N-terminal region of HsPEX39, which agrees with the observed increase in binding affinity between PEX7 and HsPEX39 (that is, decreased Kd,app) when PHYH is present (Fig. 4b). PEX5(179–266) is also predicted to interact with the PTS2 and displace the N-terminal portion of HsPEX39 but still allow for HsPEX39 to bind PEX7 via the KPWE motif, consistent with our observations of a PEX7–PHYH–HsPEX39–PEX5 complex. AlphaFold modelling of ScPex39 in complex with yeast Pex7, Pot1(1–30) (the PTS2-containing portion) or Pex18(192–283) (Pex7-binding residues43) revealed similar predictions (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6c).

Importantly, the AlphaFold predictions are consistent with the crystal structure of a yeast complex between Pex7, Pex21 and a PTS2-containing protein44 (Fig. 4d). As in PEX5 (human) and Pex18/Pex21 (yeast), the N terminus of human and yeast PEX39 covers the PTS2 bound to Pex7. Of note, we identified the conserved N-terminal hydrophobic residues L21 (HsPEX39) and Y9 (ScPex39) as being positioned over the PTS2 similarly to residues of yeast and human co-receptors, namely F236 (Pex21), F232 (Pex18) and F215 (PEX5) (Fig. 4d, insets). Pex21 F236 is critical for stabilizing the interaction between Pex7 and a PTS2-containing protein44, suggesting a similar role for the aforementioned residues in PEX39. Collectively, our data indicate that PEX39 stabilizes the interaction between PEX7 and PTS2-containing proteins, thereby providing a mechanism by which PEX39 facilitates the import of PTS2-containing proteins.

The evolutionary conservation of the (R/K)PWE motif in PEX39 orthologues (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and the AlphaFold prediction of this motif being a PEX7-binding site (Fig. 4c) suggested that it contributes to PEX39 function. To investigate this, we utilized an HsPEX39 variant with the KPWE motif changed to AAAA (HsPEX39(4A)), as well as different variants of HsPEX39 with designs influenced by insights gained from the AlphaFold predictions. Using our native PAGE assays with [35S]H6PEX7, we examined the ability of these HsPEX39 variants to complex with PEX7, PHYH and PEX5 (Fig. 5a). HsPEX39(4A) could not interact with PEX7 and failed to stabilize the interaction between PEX7 and the PTS2-containing protein PHYH, as the only detectable species were PEX7 alone or the PEX7–PHYH–PEX5 complex (lanes 6–10). A C-terminally truncated version of HsPEX39 containing residues 1–70 (HsPEX39(ΔC)) could still complex normally (lanes 11–15), consistent with the deleted residues not being involved in the formation of the corresponding complexes per AlphaFold (Fig. 4c). Using an N-terminally truncated variant containing residues 48–101 ((HsPEX39(ΔN)), we observed the formation of a PEX7–HsPEX39(ΔN) complex (Fig. 5a, lane 17) but not a PEX7–HsPEX39(ΔN)–PHYH complex (lane 18 versus 17), indicating that the missing N-terminal region stabilizes the weak PEX7–PHYH interaction, consistent with the AlphaFold predictions (Fig. 4c). Within this N-terminal region, we identified L21 to be potentially needed for stabilizing the interaction between PEX7 and PTS2-containing proteins (Fig. 4d). Indeed, alanine replacement of L21 (HsPEX39(L21A)) was sufficient to abolish the interaction with PHYH (Fig. 5a, lanes 2 and 3 versus 27 and 28). Both HsPEX39(ΔN) and HsPEX39(L21A) interacted with the PEX7–PHYH–PEX5 complex (lanes 18–20 and 28–30), suggesting that the KPWE motif is sufficient for this interaction. Indeed, HsPEX39(ΔN) with the KPWE motif changed to AAAA (HsPEX39(ΔN,4A)) failed to interact with PEX7, PHYH and PEX5 (lanes 21–25). Further underscoring the importance of the KPWE motif, all exogenously added HsPEX39 variants with an intact KPWE motif and the ability to bind PEX7 in vitro (Fig. 5a) almost completely inhibited in vitro import of [35S]ACAA1 (Fig. 5b, lanes 2, 4 and 5), whereas variants with the KPWE motif changed to AAAA and an inability to bind PEX7 in vitro did not affect import (lanes 3 and 6).

Next, we extended our investigations into yeast and human cells. Expression via the endogenous promoter of an N-terminally truncated variant of ScPex39 that retains the RPWE motif and comprises residues 40–132 (ScPex39_ΔN) failed to restore both Pex7 levels (Extended Data Fig. 3e, lane 4 versus 6) and the import of PTS2-containing proteins in Scpex39Δ yeast (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Similar experiments using ScPex39 with the RPWE motif mutated to AAAA (ScPex39(4A)) also failed to restore Pex7 levels (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 7b) and the import of PTS2-containing proteins (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 7c). ScPex39(4A) failed to rescue the fitness defect of Scpex39Δ cells grown in oleic acid medium (Fig. 5e), whereas growth in glucose medium remained unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Using HEK293T cells, we observed that alanine replacement of any single residue within the KPWE motif generally had a deleterious effect on the ability of HsPEX39 to interact with its binding partners, with the W61A variant most impaired and the E62A variant least impaired (Fig. 5f). The AlphaFold prediction of the PEX7-binding site and KPWE motif corroborates the importance of the motif residues by illustrating how conserved PEX7 residues with matching biochemical properties are positioned to interact (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Furthermore, whereas overexpression of wild-type HsPEX39 increased precursor forms and decreased mature forms of PHYH, ACAA1 and AGPS, overexpression of HsPEX39(4A) did not (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 7f). Cellular fractionation confirmed that overexpression of HsPEX39(4A) did not inhibit the import of PTS2-containing proteins (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Lastly, overexpression of the wild type or HsPEX39(4A) did not alter the levels of PEX7 or PEX5 (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 7h).

A conserved KPWE motif is also present in the N terminus of PEX13 (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Fig. 6a), but has not been experimentally characterized. Interestingly, the presence or absence of PEX39 is mirrored by the presence or absence of the PEX13 KPWE motif across eukaryotes (Extended Data Fig. 1a), strongly suggesting a functional connection between PEX39 biology and the PEX13 KPWE motif throughout evolution. In addition, among PEX7 interactors in yeast and humans, the (R/K)PWE motif is exclusively found in PEX39 and PEX13 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). These insights are notable for several reasons: PEX13 is essential for peroxisomal protein import45 and is thought to form a conduit for proteins to translocate across the peroxisomal membrane23,24; residues 1–55 of Pex13, which contain the KPWE motif, can bind Pex7 and are essential for the import of PTS2-containing proteins in yeast46; and recently, computational predictions suggested that the PEX13 KPWE motif could bind PEX7 (ref. 47). We thus hypothesized that the PEX13 KPWE motif is necessary for binding PEX7 and plays an important role in PEX13 function.

To test this hypothesis, we assayed a recombinant protein comprising residues 1–36 of the HsPEX13 N terminus fused to the small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (Sumo1) with a hexa-histidine tag (NtPEX13) and a variant with the KPWE motif substituted with AAAA (NtPEX13(4A)) in our native PAGE assay and observed that [35S]H6PEX7 can indeed interact with NtPEX13 (Fig. 6b, lanes 5 versus 1 and 10 versus 9). The formation of a PEX7–NtPEX13 complex could also be detected by SEC (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Importantly, NtPEX13(4A) failed to interact with PEX7 (Fig. 6b, lane 10 versus 11), demonstrating the necessity of the KPWE motif for PEX7 binding. The PEX7–NtPEX13 complex was unchanged by the presence of PEX5(1–324) or PHYH (Fig. 6b, lanes 5–7) and only if both were present did we observe the appearance of a slower migrating complex, although we could not discern whether this was PEX7–PHYH–PEX5 alone or with NtPEX13 bound as well (Fig. 6b, lane 4 versus 8). However, replacing [35S]H6PEX7 with recombinant FLAG-PEX7 allowed us to observe the binding of NtPEX13 to the PEX7–PHYH–PEX5 complex, which again depended on the presence of the PEX13 KPWE motif (Fig. 6c).

We also determined Kd,app for the PEX7–NtPEX13 interaction to be in the low micromolar range (Fig. 6d), which was larger than that observed for the PEX7–HsPEX39 interaction (Fig. 4b, left). However, interpretation of this value should be with the understanding that we did not use full-length HsPEX13 and did not reconstitute the complete peroxisomal docking/translocation module, in which PEX13 should be present in multiple copies16,48. Consistent with our in vitro data, AlphaFold modelling predicted that the PEX13 KPWE motif binds to the bottom of PEX7 (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 8c). Interestingly, as for HsPEX39, NtPEX13 inhibited the import of [35S]ACAA1 in vitro in a KPWE-dependent fashion (Extended Data Fig. 8d), but not the import pathway of PTS1-containing proteins (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

Next, we investigated the PEX13 KPWE motif in yeast and human cells. Expression of ScPex13 with the KPWE motif substituted with AAAA could not fully rescue the fitness defect of Scpex13Δ yeast grown in oleic acid medium (Fig. 6f). Interestingly, cellular fractionation of these yeast revealed an increased amount of Pex7 in the organellar fraction relative to control yeast (Fig. 6g and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Protein extraction experiments revealed that organellar Pex7 and Pot1 were not carbonate resistant and remained in the organellar pellet after extraction with low-salt but not high-salt buffer (Extended Data Fig. 9b). These results resemble those for yeast overexpressing ScPex39 and we similarly conclude that a fraction of Pex7 with its PTS2-containing protein cargo is stalled at the peroxisomal membrane and anchored there via protein–protein interactions (but not imported) upon loss of the ScPex13 KPWE motif. In HsPEX13-KO human cells, whereas the expression of wild-type HsPEX13 or a variant with the KPWE motif substituted with AAAA (HsPEX13(4A)) increased the ratio of mature to precursor forms of the PTS1-containing protein ACOX1 to a similar degree, HsPEX13(4A) was notably worse at increasing the ratios of mature to precursor forms for all PTS2-containing proteins (Fig. 6h,i), thus indicating that substitution of the KPWE motif selectively impairs the import of PTS2-containing proteins, but not that of PTS1-containing proteins.

AlphaFold predicts that the (R/K)PWE motifs of PEX39 and PEX13 bind the same site on PEX7 in both human and yeast (Fig. 7a) and that E77 in human PEX7 can form a salt bridge with the K59 residue of the KPWE motif (Fig. 7b), thus suggesting a critical role for E77, which is also conserved in yeast and other organisms (Fig. 7c and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Consistent with this, PEX7 harbouring an E77A substitution (PEX7(E77A)) did not interact in our native PAGE assays with HsPEX39 (Fig. 7d, lanes 1–4) or NtPEX13 (Fig. 7e). Importantly, PEX7(E77A) still interacted with PEX5 and PHYH (Fig. 7d, lane 5 versus 6), indicating that it was correctly folded. Using HEK293T cells, we also observed that PEX7(E77A)-FLAG-HA was unable to co-immunoprecipitate HsPEX39 and HsPEX13, but still interacted with PEX5, PHYH and AGPS (Fig. 7f).

The prediction that the (R/K)PWE motifs of PEX39 and the PEX13 N terminus bind the same PEX7 site (Fig. 7a) suggests that the interaction between these motifs with PEX7 is mutually exclusive. Consistent with this, HsPEX39-FLAG-HA did not co-immunoprecipitate HsPEX13 in HEK293T cells, whereas FLAG-HA-tagged PEX7, ACAA1 and PHYH did (Fig. 8a). Using our native PAGE assay to assess the time-dependent displacement of NtPEX13 from a PEX7–NtPEX13 complex by HsPEX39 tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST-HsPEX39), we observed that NtPEX13 was readily replaced by HsPEX39 even at the first time point (Fig. 8b, lane 3 versus 4), whereas in the absence of HsPEX39, the PEX7–NtPEX13 complex was unchanged during the 20-min incubation (lane 3 versus 8), indicating mutually exclusive binding. These results suggest that PEX39 must dissociate from PEX7 to allow PEX7 to bind the N terminus of PEX13 at the peroxisome, a handover mechanism that would be facilitated if the PEX39–PEX7 interaction were labile. To address this, we assessed the time-dependent replacement of wild-type HsPEX39 in PEX7–HsPEX39 or PEX7–PHYH–HsPEX39 complexes with an electrophoretically distinguishable variant, the aforementioned N-terminally truncated HsPEX39(ΔN) (Fig. 8c). For the PEX7–HsPEX39 complex, HsPEX39 was completely replaced by HsPEX39(ΔN) at the first time point (lane 2 versus 3), thus indicating that the interaction of HsPEX39 with PEX7 is labile. For the PEX7–PHYH–HsPEX39 complex, the switching of HsPEX39 species was slower (lanes 8–12), consistent with the lower Kd,app for this complex.

In this work (described previously in our preprint49), we identify and characterize human and yeast PEX39, an ancient and hitherto unknown component of the peroxisomal protein import machinery. In addition, we elucidate a new paradigm in peroxisomal import and biogenesis, namely the sequential engagement of PEX7 by two (R/K)PWE-containing peroxins, PEX39 and PEX13. Based on the results of this study, we propose a handover model for how PEX39 facilitates the import of PTS2-containing proteins, as well as the sequelae of PEX39 loss or overexpression (Fig. 8d). Under physiological conditions, PEX39 can directly bind PEX7 via the (R/K)PWE motif (step 1) and then stabilize the interaction between PEX7 and PTS2-containing protein cargo via an interacting N-terminal region (step 2). The fact that PEX39 can bind at two sites suggests that avidity would promote its retention within the complex between PEX39, PEX7 and PTS2-containing protein cargo. However, this avidity is lost upon co-receptor binding (for example, PEX5 or Pex18) as the co-receptor displaces the N-terminal region of PEX39 but independently stabilizes the interaction between PEX7 and PTS2-containing protein cargo (step 3). Because of the labile nature of the PEX39–PEX7 interaction via the (R/K)PWE motif, PEX39 can now be exchanged with the PEX13 N terminus, which also contains a KPWE motif (steps 4 and 5), thus handing PEX7 over from PEX39 to PEX13. PEX13 can now fully participate in the remaining steps required for PTS2-containing protein cargo translocation. A recent study investigating PTS2-containing protein cargo import in yeast supports our model50. In our work, in the setting of PEX39 loss or substitution of its KPWE motif, the import of PTS2-containing protein cargo is impaired due to destabilization of the interaction between PEX7 and PTS2-containing protein cargo, with an additional contribution in S. cerevisiae being the decreased abundance of Pex7, which suggests that ScPex39 stabilizes Pex7, potentially as a consequence of stabilizing the interaction between Pex7 and PTS2-containing protein cargo and promoting pre-import steps. The reason for HsPEX39 loss not decreasing PEX7 levels might stem from different structural properties of the yeast and human orthologues, such as the presence of three loops in yeast Pex7 but not human PEX7 (Extended Data Fig. 10). In the setting of PEX39 overexpression or substitution of the PEX13 KPWE motif, PTS2-containing protein cargo import is also impaired because even though cargo-loaded, co-receptor-bound PEX7 can be recruited to PEX13, the PEX13 N terminus cannot bind PEX7 and facilitate the translocation of PTS2-containing protein cargo. The observation that PEX39 impairs import when depleted or overexpressed is surprising and is, to the best of our knowledge, unique among cytosolic peroxins; by extension, our results suggest that PEX39 levels must be well controlled to maximize the import of PTS2-containing proteins.

We envision multiple important areas for future investigation. Structural determination of the PEX39, PEX7 and PEX13 complexes investigated here will provide valuable insights. PEX7 belongs to the large family of WD40-domain proteins, which have three potential interaction sites: the top and bottom face and the circumference51. Indeed, the crystal structure of yeast Pex7 reveals that the PTS2 binds to the top face44, but an interactor for the bottom face has yet to be identified. Our work strongly suggests that the function of the bottom face is to allow PEX7 to interact with the (R/K)PWE motifs of PEX39 and PEX13 and thereby cycle between these two peroxins.

Additional investigation of the physiological consequences of PEX39 loss will also be of value. HsPEX39-KO cells have impaired import of PHYH, whose deficiency causes adult Refsum disease52. That HsPEX39 loss only affects PHYH and not ACAA1 or AGPS is surprising and may suggest that the interaction between PEX7 and the PTS2 of PHYH benefits the most from the stabilizing effect of HsPEX39. Given the role of PHYH in human physiology, it will be important to examine the consequences of PEX39 loss in mice and search for pathogenic human alleles.

In conclusion, almost all known peroxins were identified using forward genetic approaches in yeast53 and mammalian cells54. Although these approaches were extremely successful, they were not designed to identify genes with more subtle loss-of-function phenotypes32. Perhaps for this reason, after the identification of PEX26 more than 20 years ago55, no new human peroxin had been discovered. The work described here breaks this long pause by using functional proteomics instead of functional genomics, and demonstrates both the power of alternative approaches for studying peroxins and the abundance of mysteries still surrounding the import of peroxisomal proteins.

Yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C and 160 r.p.m. in synthetic complete medium (pH 6.0) containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (lacking amino acids), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.3% glucose, 0.002% histidine, methionine, adenine and uracil, 0.003% tryptophan, isoleucine and tyrosine, 0.005% arginine, lysine and phenylalanine, 0.01% leucine, 0.015% valine and 0.02% threonine (percentage values represent wt/vol in all instances) unless stated otherwise. Depending on the selection markers, uracil, histidine or both were omitted. To induce peroxisome proliferation, cells were grown in synthetic complete medium until an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.0–1.5 was achieved, shifted to YNO medium (synthetic complete medium containing 0.1% oleic acid (27728-1L-R; Sigma–Aldrich) and 0.05% Tween 40; percentage values represent vol/vol) and cultivated for a further 12–16 h or as indicated. For metabolic labelling using stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)63, the medium contained stable isotope-coded heavy arginine (13C6/15N4; Arg10; CNLM-539-H; Eurisotop) and lysine (13C6/15N2; Lys8; CNLM-291-H; Eurisotop) instead of the unlabelled light counterparts (12C6/14Nx; Arg0/Lys0).

For growth assays, strains were pre-cultured in synthetic complete medium containing 0.3% glucose. Cells were cultivated for 16 h and then shifted to either glucose (2%) or oleic acid media, adjusting the OD600 to approximately 0.1. Aliquots of the cultures were taken at distinct time points, as indicated, and the OD600 was determined. Cells grown in YNO medium were washed twice with ultrapure water and resuspended in an appropriate volume of ultrapure water before the OD600 was measured.

Yeast cells used for transformation (that is, in complementation studies and sedimentation assays) were grown overnight in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 0.002% uracil and 0.002% adenine; percentage values represent wt/vol in all instances) at 30 °C and 160 r.p.m., diluted with YPD medium to an OD600 of 0.1 in 20 ml and incubated for a further 4–5 h at 30 °C and 160 r.p.m. until an OD600 of 0.4–0.7 was reached.

The following plasmids were used:

The oligonucleotides used to generate yeast strains and plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The yeast strains are listed in Supplementary Table 4. All modified plasmids and yeast strains were confirmed by sequencing of the respective region of interest. Genomic manipulation of yeast cells was performed by homologous recombination following transformation of the cells with the respective PCR product. For genomic C-terminal tagging of Pex18 with the TEV protease cleavage site and protein A (that is, the TPA tag), the DNA sequence coding for the TPA tag followed by the selection marker kanMX4 was inserted at the 3′ end of the pex18 gene64. To generate the Scpex39 and pex7 deletion strain, the respective gene was replaced with the URA3 marker cassette65.

To generate plasmid P797, the Scpex39 open reading frame (ORF) plus promoter and terminator regions were amplified from yeast genomic DNA using the primer pair SF1/SF2 and cloned into pRS313 (ref. 66) using the SalI restriction enzyme. P798 was generated by inserting the ORF of Scpex39 (amplified using the primers SF3 and SF4) into a modified pRS313 backbone comprising the TEF2 promoter and ADH1 terminator. To generate P799, the pex7 ORF was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers SF10 and SF11 and inserted via the restriction enzymes XbaI and AscI into P798. To generate P815, the amino acids of the RPWE motif of ScPex39 in P797 were substituted with AAAA by site-directed, ligase-independent PCR-mediated mutagenesis67, using two primer pairs (O2145/O2143 and O2144/O2142) to amplify the P797 plasmid DNA by PCR. P801 and P807 were generated as described for P797 and P815 using the following primer pairs: SF5/SF6 (introducing a XhoI restriction site), as well as O2181/O2179 and O2180/O2178. P820 was generated by a deletion PCR using the primers SF12 and SF13 on P797.

Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium as described above in the section ‘Yeast culture conditions and metabolic labelling', harvested by centrifugation (5 min; 500g; room temperature) and washed first with 20 ml ultrapure water and then with 10 ml SORB (100 mM lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 M sorbitol). The cell pellet was resuspended in 360 μl SORB, mixed with 40 μl denatured salmon sperm and directly used for transformation, applying the heat-shock method64.

To generate whole-cell lysates from oleate-induced yeast cells, 30 mg (wet weight) freshly harvested cells were precipitated using 12% (vol/vol) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in 36 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 16 h at −80 °C. Precipitated proteins were thawed on ice, pelleted by centrifugation (10 min; 15,871g; 4 °C) and washed twice with 80% (vol/vol) ice-cold acetone. Residual acetone was removed by evaporation and dried proteins were resuspended in 80 µl 0.1 M NaOH/1% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). For sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), 5× SDS buffer was added and samples were boiled for 8 min at 95 °C.

Native Pex18 complexes were affinity purified using Pex18-TPA-expressing yeast cells grown under peroxisome-proliferating conditions, as described before but with minor modifications16,68. Isogenic cells expressing the native, non-tagged version of Pex18 grown under the same conditions served as a control. Cells were lysed using glass beads (G9268; Sigma–Aldrich) and an MM 400 mixer mill (Retsch) at 20 Hz and 4 °C for 8 min. All subsequent steps were performed as described previously68 for soluble complexes and without immobilization of the TEV protease.

Oleate-induced Scpex39Δ and isogenic wild-type cells, labelled with light or heavy arginine and lysine, were harvested by centrifugation (2 min; 1,600g; 4 °C) and washed twice with ultrapure water. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl lysis buffer (8 M urea, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)), and equal amounts of differentially labelled Scpex39Δ and wild-type cells were mixed based on the cell wet weight. Cells were lysed using glass beads (300 mg) and a Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies), applying two cycles of 4 min at 5,000 r.p.m. with at least 2 min of cooling on ice between cycles. Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (5 min; 15,000g; 4 °C). The protein concentration of the cell lysates was adjusted to 1 μg μl−1 using urea buffer (8 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate). The experiment was performed in four independent replicates with a light/heavy label switch.

Affinity-purified Pex18 protein complexes and proteins of the control purifications were acetone precipitated and resuspended in 0.1 M NaOH/1% (wt/vol) SDS. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, lanes were cut into 11 slices and proteins were processed for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis, as described previously69 with slight modifications. Tryptic peptide mixtures of each sample were combined, dried in vacuo, desalted using StageTips (2215; 3M Empore)70 and dried again in vacuo.

Proteins (300 μg) of yeast whole-cell lysates prepared from SILAC-labelled Scpex39Δ and wild-type cells were digested in solution using Lys-C (125-05061; FUJIFILM Wako) and trypsin (V5111; Promega) as described before69. Peptides were subsequently desalted using C18-SD 7 mm/3 ml extraction disc cartridges (4215SD; 3M Empore) as described previously71, dried in vacuo and further fractionated by high-pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography.

Peptide fractionation by high-pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography72 was performed essentially as described before71. Dried peptides were reconstituted in 200 μl 1% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (ACN)/10 mM NH4OH (pH 10) by sonication, followed by centrifugation (5 min; 12,000g; room temperature) to remove insoluble material, then further purification using a 0.2-μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane syringe filter (AF0-3202-12; Phenomenex). Peptides were separated using an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated with an NX 3-μm Gemini C18 column (150 mm × 2 mm inner diameter; particle size of 3 μm; pore size of 110 Å; 00F-4453-B0; Phenomenex) at 40 °C and a flow rate of 200 μl min−1. Peptide elution was performed using a binary solvent system comprising 10 mM NH4OH (solvent A1) and 90% (vol/vol) ACN/10 mM NH4OH (solvent B1). Peptides were loaded onto the column at 1% solvent B1 for 5 min and separated by increasing B1 from 1–40% in 37 min and from 40–78% in 3 min, followed by 5 min at 78% B1, before the column was re-equilibrated with 1% solvent B1. Starting at 1.5 min until 65.5 min, 45-s fractions were collected in a concatenated manner, resulting in a total of eight fractions per sample. Peptides were dried in vacuo, desalted using StageTips70 and dried again.

Before LC–MS analysis, dried peptides were resuspended in 0.1% (vol/vol) TFA and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000g; 5 min; room temperature). Peptides were analysed by nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS using a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RSLC system was operated at 40 °C with C18 trapping columns (μPAC; 10 mm × 2 mm inner diameter; PharmaFluidics) at a flow rate of 10 μl min−1 and a C18 endcapped analytical column (μPAC; 500 mm × 0.3 mm; PharmaFluidics) at a flow rate of 300 nl min−1. A binary solvent system comprising 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid (solvent A2) and 86% (vol/vol) ACN/0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid (solvent B2) was employed for peptide separation. For the analysis of peptides from the Pex18-TPA affinity purification experiments, peptides were loaded onto the pre-column, washed and pre-concentrated for 3 min at 1% solvent B2 and eluted by applying the following gradient: 1–4% B2 in 2 min, 4–25% B2 in 20 min, 25–44% B2 in 11 min, 44–90% B2 in 2 min and 4 min at 90% B2. The same solvent system was used for the analysis of samples from the Scpex39Δ-versus-wild-type SILAC experiments. Peptides equivalent to 1 μg protein were loaded, washed and pre-concentrated for 5 min using 1% solvent B2. For peptide elution, a gradient ranging from 1–5% B2 in 3 min, 5–22% B2 in 103 min, 22–42% B2 in 50 min and 42–80% B2 in 5 min was applied.

Mass spectrometric data were acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode. Mass spectrometry spectra were recorded in a mass-to-charge (m/z) range of 375–1,700 with a resolution of 70,000 (at m/z 200). The automatic gain control was set to 3 × 106 and the maximum injection time was set to 60 ms. The 12 most intense precursor ions (z ≥ +2) were selected for fragmentation by higher-energy collisional dissociation, applying a normalized collision energy of 28%, a resolution of 35,000, an automatic gain control of 105, a maximum injection time of 120 ms and a dynamic exclusion time of 45 s.

Proteins present in Pex18-TPA pulldowns were identified using the Andromeda search engine73 implemented in MaxQuant (version 2.0.1.0)74 through comparison with the UniProt reference proteome of S. cerevisiae (including isoforms; released February 2024; 6,079 entries), extended by the sequences of the TEV protease and immunoglobulins used in this study. Trypsin/P (no cleavage before proline) was specified as digestion enzyme, oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification. Identifications were transferred between samples using match between runs with standard settings. Protein mass spectrometry intensities were normalized to intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values. The minimum number of unique peptides per protein group was set to 1.

The autoprot Python module (version 0.2)75 was used for data analysis and processing. Decoy and contaminant entries, as well as protein groups without quantitative information, were removed. Moreover, protein groups with a sequence coverage of <10% were removed. For protein groups from each gel slice of Pex18-TPA-expressing or control cells, the median log10[iBAQ value] was calculated. The mean of medians between Pex18-TPA and control cells was calculated for each corresponding gel slice pair and subtracted from all iBAQ values of both slices. The median-corrected iBAQ values were exponential transformed to gain non-log values, and iBAQ values for protein groups of all slices of a replicate were summed. Protein groups with fewer than two valid values in the Pex18-TPA replicates were removed. Missing intensity values were imputed by drawing random values from a distribution matching the intensity distribution of the existing values but shifted by 1.8 standard deviations and scaled to 30% width. The statistical significance of differences in protein group intensity was computed using the rank-sum test implemented in the R package RankProd76 and the results were visualized in autoprot. The data analysis was documented using Jupyter Notebook and is available from https://github.com/ag-warscheid/Pex39_Manuscript and ref. 77.

For protein identification and SILAC-based relative quantification in the Scpex39Δ-versus-wild-type experiments, MaxQuant (version 2.4.4.0) was employed. Tandem mass spectrometry data were searched against the S. cerevisiae reference proteome provided by the Saccharomyces Genome Database (http://sgd-archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/orf_protein; downloaded August 2023) using default parameters with the following exceptions: Arg10/Lys8 was selected as the heavy label; the multiplicity was set to 2; trypsin and Lys-C were set as proteolytic enzymes, allowing a maximum of three missed cleavages; and the options match between runs and requantify were enabled. A false discovery rate of 1% was applied at the peptide and protein levels. Protein quantification was based on unique peptides and at least one ratio count. Autoprot was used for further data analysis and visualization, considering only proteins quantified in at least three out of four replicates, except for ScPex39, which was quantified in only one replicate. To include ScPex39, which is only present in wild-type cells, in our data analysis and visualization, missing ScPex39 ratios were imputed by randomly drawing values deviating ±0.05 from the single log2-transformed value reported by MaxQuant. The normalized protein abundance ratios calculated by MaxQuant were log2 transformed, followed by sequential imputation of missing values and cyclic loess normalization78. To identify proteins with differences in protein abundance between wild-type and Scpex39Δ cells, the linear models for microarray data (limma) approach was employed. This method is a moderated two-sided t-test that adjusts a protein's variance in ratios between replicates towards the average ratio variance of the entire dataset79,80. P values were corrected for multiple testing according to Benjamini and Hochberg81. The data analysis was documented using Jupyter Notebook and is available from https://github.com/ag-warscheid/Pex39_Manuscript and ref. 77.

STRING network analysis was performed using the STRING web application (version 12; https://string-db.org/)82. A multiple-protein search was performed using gene names as identifiers and setting ‘Saccharomyces cerevisiae' as the organism. Under ‘active interaction sources' in the basic setting, ‘Experiments' and ‘Databases' were selected as sources and the ‘minimum required interaction score' was set to 0.4 (medium confidence). Interactions without experimental or biochemical data or those based on putative homologues in other organisms were filtered out.

Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis of proteins exhibiting a minimum Q value of <0.05 for the Pex18-TPA complexes dataset (related to Fig. 1c) were performed using the g:Profiler application (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost)83. False discovery rate P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Gene Ontology terms with corrected P values of <0.05 in the Pex18-TPA complexes dataset were considered enriched.

Freshly harvested oleate-induced yeast cells (5 g per experiment) were resuspended in 25 ml dithiothreitol (DTT) buffer (10 mM DTT in 100 mM Tris) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and 60 r.p.m. in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min; 600g; room temperature), resuspended in fresh DTT buffer and incubated again as described above. Cells were harvested and washed three times with 20 ml 1.2 M sorbitol pre-heated to 37 °C. To prepare spheroplasts, cells were then resuspended in 35 ml 1.2 M sorbitol buffer (1.2 M sorbitol in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), pre-heated to 37 °C) containing 1,000 U lyticase (L4025; Merck/Sigma–Aldrich) per gram of cell wet weight and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 60 r.p.m. The digestion was stopped by incubation on ice for 10 min. Spheroplasts were washed three times with 15 ml pre-cooled 1.2 M sorbitol and collected by centrifugation (10 min; 600g; 4 °C) after each washing step. Spheroplasts were resuspended in 5 ml homogenization buffer (5 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM KCl and 0.6 M sorbitol (pH 6.0)) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors16,68 using a Dounce homogenizer operated at 2× 100 r.p.m. (2 min each), 3× 300 r.p.m. (1 min each), 3× 500 r.p.m. (1 min each) and 3× 800 r.p.m. (1 min each). Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (2× 10 min; 600g; 4 °C). Protein concentrations of the resulting PNSs obtained from different strains within given experiments were adjusted using homogenization buffer. The PNS (1 ml) was loaded on top of a 200-μl sucrose cushion (0.5 M sucrose in homogenization buffer) and separated into an organellar pellet and a cytosolic fraction by centrifugation (20 min; 25,000g; 4 °C). The organellar pellet was resuspended in 1 ml homogenization buffer. Equal volumes of PNS, cytosolic fraction and organellar pellet were analysed by SDS-PAGE and semi-dry immunoblotting.

Sodium carbonate and salt extraction experiments were performed as described previously84 with slight modifications. In brief, for carbonate extraction, organellar pellets were resuspended in 300 µl homogenization buffer (as described for cellular fractionation), whereas for salt extraction experiments organellar pellets were resuspended in low-salt buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). Equal aliquots were taken and mixed with SDS buffer, which served as the total (T) sample. For carbonate extraction, 100 µl organelle suspension was mixed with 100 µl 0.2 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), incubated for 30 min on ice and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation (30 min; 100,000g; 4 °C). Supernatants were taken and proteins precipitated using TCA, whereas the membrane pellet was directly resuspended in 40 µl homogenization buffer and subsequently mixed with 10 µl 5× SDS buffer.

For salt extraction, 200 µl organelles in low-salt buffer were incubated for 30 min on ice and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation (30 min; 100,000g; 4 °C). Soluble proteins in the supernatant were precipitated as described for the sodium carbonate extraction and insoluble proteins in the pellet fraction were resuspended using 200 µl high-salt buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.5 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). Next, 100 µl of this fraction was removed and the proteins were precipitated as described above and served as sample P of the low-salt treatment. The residual 100 µl of the fraction was incubated for 30 min on ice and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation (30 min; 100,000g; 4 °C). The supernatant and pellet fractions resulting from this centrifugation are referred to as S and P of the high-salt treatment. Before immunoblot analysis, proteins in the supernatant were precipitated using TCA and the membrane pellet was directly resuspended in 40 µl homogenization buffer and subsequently mixed with 10 µl 5× SDS buffer.

SDS-PAGE and semi-dry immunoblotting were performed following standard protocols unless otherwise specified. The antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follows: goat polyclonal anti-Cta1 (S. cerevisiae; 1/20,000 dilution)85; rabbit polyclonal anti-Pex7 (S. cerevisiae; 1/2,000 dilution)46; rabbit polyclonal anti-Pex3 (S. cerevisiae; 1/3,000 dilution; from the Erdmann group at Ruhr University Bochum); rabbit polyclonal anti-Pex18 (S. cerevisiae; 1/10,000 dilution)86; rabbit polyclonal anti-Pot1 (S. cerevisiae; 1/10,000 dilution)87; rabbit polyclonal anti-Gpd1 (S. cerevisiae; 1/10,000 dilution)88; rabbit polyclonal anti-protein A (S. aureus; P3775; Sigma–Aldrich; 1/10,000 dilution); goat HRP-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit (A0545; Sigma–Aldrich; 1/10,000 dilution); rabbit HRP-conjugated polyclonal anti-goat (A8919; Sigma–Aldrich; 1/10,000 dilution); rabbit HRP-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse (A9044 Sigma–Aldrich; 1/10,000 dilution); mouse monoclonal anti-Por1 (S. cerevisiae; 459500; Invitrogen; 1/5,000 dilution); mouse monoclonal anti-Pgk1 (S. cerevisiae; 459250; Invitrogen; 1/1,000 dilution); and mouse monoclonal anti-Dpm1 (S. cerevisiae; A-6429 Invitrogen; 1/2,000 dilution).

Immunoblot signals were quantified using the software ImageJ (version 1.54d)89. Signal intensities were corrected for background intensities.

Yeast were grown in synthetic media containing 6.7 g l−1 yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate (1545; Conda Pronadisa) and 2% glucose (SD media) or 0.2% oleic acid (O1008; Sigma–Aldrich) + 0.1% Tween 80 (P4780; Sigma–Aldrich) with a complete amino acid mix (oMM composition)90. When Geneticin antibiotic was used, the media contained 0.17 g l−1 yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate (1553; Conda Pronadisa) and 1 g l−1 monosodium glutamic acid (G1626; Sigma–Aldrich). The strains were selected using a dropout mix (the same composition as for the SD media described above, but without the specific amino acid for selection) or with antibiotics using the following concentrations: 500 mg l−1 Geneticin (G4185; Formedium) and 200 mg l−1 Nourseothricin (also known as ClonNAT; AB-102-25G; WERNER BioAgents).

Genetic manipulations were performed using PCR-mediated homologous recombination with the lithium acetate method91. The correct tagging or deletion was verified in all strains by PCR. The primers in this study were either designed using the web tool Primers-4-Yeast92 or manually constructed in the case of the deletion of Scpex39. All of the relevant primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Supplementary Table 4 contains descriptions of the yeast strains.

The plasmids used included:

pFA6a-NAT-MX6 (a KO-mediated plasmid with a Nat cassette with a TEF2 promoter and terminator; pMS49; M.S. group)

mNG C-terminal tagging plasmid (plasmid for C-terminal tagging with mNeonGreen; pMS1190; M.S. group)

Freshly grown yeast cells were picked from agar plates and suspended in PCR tubes containing 50 μl 20 mM NaOH with 0.1 mg ml−1 RNaseA. The suspension was then boiled at 100 °C for 20 min in a PCR machine and spun down in a microcentrifuge for 3 min. The supernatant was used as template DNA for a PCR reaction (2 μl), alongside 2× GoTaq Green Master Mix (5 μl; M7122; Promega), forward primer (0.2 μl from 10 μM concentration), reverse primer (0.2 μl from 10 μM concentration) and double-distilled water up to a final volume of 10 μl. The DNA was amplified using the following thermocycling steps: 98 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 98 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 90 s, 72 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s. The resulting PCR product was then run on a 1% agarose gel and examined for the correct size of the amplicon.

Yeast strains were grown overnight in an SD-based medium supplemented with amino acids in 96-well polystyrene plates and then transferred to oleic acid for 4 h (for the experiment shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e) or 8 h (for the experiment shown in Fig. 2d). The strains were then manually transferred into 384-well glass-bottom microscope plates (MGB101-1-2-LG-L; Matrical Bioscience) coated with concanavalin A (C2010; Sigma–Aldrich). After 20 min, the wells were washed twice with DDW to remove non-adherent cells and obtain a cell monolayer. Imaging was performed in DDW. Images were taken using the Olympus IXplore SpinSR system, comprising an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope scanning unit (SCU-W1) operated by ScanR (version 3.2.0). When high-resolution images were taken (that is, Fig. 2d), a high-resolution spinning disk module (a Yokogawa CSU-W1 SoRa confocal scanner with double microlenses and 50-μm pinholes) was used. Cells were imaged using an ×60 oil lens (numerical aperture = 1.42) and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 camera. Images were recorded in two channels: mNeonGreen (excitation wavelength = 488 nm) and mScarlet (excitation wavelength = 561 nm). For all micrographs, a single, representative focal plane was imaged and shown.

For routine culturing and experiments, all human cell lines were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and in media supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; 100-106; GeminiBio). HEK293T (CRL-3216; ATCC) and HCT116 cells (CCL-247; ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium with high glucose (D5796; Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (S8636; Sigma–Aldrich). CAKI-2 cells (a gift from G. Wyant and W. Kaelin Jr) were grown in McCoy's 5A (Modified) Medium (16600-082; Gibco) and NCI-H1792 cells (CRL-5895; ATCC) were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (R8758; Sigma–Aldrich). All complete media was passed through a 0.22-μm filter before use. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma.

Materials were obtained from the indicated sources: puromycin (ant-pr-1; InvivoGen); doxycycline hyclate (446060050; Thermo Scientific Chemicals); antibodies to ACAA1 (HPA006764; Sigma–Aldrich), AGPS (HPA030211; Sigma–Aldrich), C6ORF226 (HPA045350; Sigma–Aldrich), PEX5 (HPA039260; Sigma–Aldrich), HsPEX13 (HPA032142; Sigma–Aldrich), ACTB (sc-69879; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PEX7 (20614-1-AP; Proteintech), PHYH (12858-1-AP; Proteintech), SCP2 (23006-1-AP; Proteintech), CANX (2433; Cell Signaling Technology), citrate synthase (14309; Cell Signaling Technology), GAPDH (2118; Cell Signaling Technology), HA (3724; Cell Signaling Technology), Histone H3 (3638; Cell Signaling Technology) and RPS6KB1 (2708; Cell Signaling Technology); HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (7074; Cell Signaling Technology); and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for IP (ab131368; Abcam).

pHAGE vectors encoding the following were obtained as follows. C-terminally FLAG-HA-tagged human ACAA1, PHYH, PEX7 and HsPEX39 were obtained from the Human ORFeome collection (version 8). C-terminally FLAG-HA-tagged human GAPDH, the KPWE variants of HsPEX39 and the E77A variant of human PEX7 were generated by cloning gblocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) containing the corresponding complementary DNA (cDNA) into a pHAGE vector containing a C-terminal FLAG-HA tag (linearized with BsrGI-HF (R3575; New England Biolabs (NEB)) via NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly (E2621; NEB). N-terminally FLAG-HA-tagged eGFP was a gift from A. Ordureau. Human GAPDH, wild-type HsPEX39 and HsPEX39 with a substituted KPWE motif were generated by cloning gblocks containing the corresponding cDNA into a pHAGE vector (linearized with BsrGI-HF) via NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly. Three independent sgRNAs against HsPEX39 (sgHsPEX39_1–3) and sgRNAs against PEX7 (sgPEX7) and AAVS1 (sgAAVS1) were cloned into a lentiCRISPR v2 vector (TLCV2; doxycycline-inducible Cas9; 87360; Addgene; ref. 93) linearized with BsmBI-v2 (R0739; NEB) by ligation of annealed oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) with Quick Ligase (M2200; NEB). The oligonucleotide sequences used for the sgRNAs are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

For the production of lentivirus, each of these constructs was transfected with the lentiviral packaging vectors psPAX2 and pMD2.G into HEK293T cells using PolyJet DNA transfection reagent (SL100688; SignaGen Laboratories). The media was changed 24 h after transfection. The virus-containing supernatant was collected 48 h after transfection and passed through a 0.45-μm filter to eliminate cells.

The desired cell lines were then infected with lentivirus added to complete culture media containing 8 μg ml−1 polybrene (TR-1003; Sigma–Aldrich). At 24 h after infection, the media was changed. At 48 h after infection, cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg ml−1 for all cell lines except CAKI-2, for which 2 μg ml−1 puromycin was used) until an uninfected control was completely dead, at which point infected cells were freed from selection.

CAKI-2 and NCI-H1792 cells transduced with lentivirus harbouring TLCV2 with sgAAVS1 (negative control) or sgPEX7 or the three independent sgRNAs sgHsPEX39_1–3 were used for our lentiviral, doxycycline-inducible CRISPR–Cas9 system. After puromycin selection, these cells were treated with 1 μg ml−1 doxycycline hyclate, which stimulates the production of Cas9 and eGFP. Cells were treated with doxycycline hyclate for 9 d to achieve substantial depletion of PEX7 and HsPEX39 across the population before the drug was removed.

To generate HsPEX39 KOs with matched controls, we took CAKI-2 and NCI-H1792 cells with sgAAVS1 or sgHsPEX39_1 on the ninth day of treatment with doxycycline hyclate and sorted single-cell clones into wells with conditioned media using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on eGFP signal. The composition of this conditioned media was a 1:1 mixture of fresh and spent complete culture media with no doxycycline hyclate that was supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin (P0781; Sigma–Aldrich) and additional FBS to achieve a final concentration of 20%. Single-cell clones were expanded for 2–3 weeks and visible colonies for cells with sgHsPEX39_1 were screened by immunoblotting for the absence of HsPEX39. Equal amounts of cells originating from eight HsPEX39-KO clones were then pooled together to make the final KO line (that is, diversifying the population of cells). Equal amounts of cells originating from eight clones with sgAAVS1 were also pooled together to make the final matched controls. CAKI-2 and NCI-H1792 cells were chosen for their excellent performance in our workflow for isolating and expanding single-cell clones, and for their greater expression of HsPEX39 and/or PHYH, ACAA1 and AGPS compared with HCT116 and HEK293T cells.

To generate PEX7 knockdowns with matched controls, we took CAKI-2 cells with sgPEX7 or sgAAVS1 (control) on the ninth day of treatment with doxycycline hyclate and sorted Cas9-expressing cells into complete culture media supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin using FACS based on eGFP signal.

The immunoprecipitation workflow was done at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise indicated and low-retention microcentrifuge tubes (3448; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used. Fully confluent 10-cm dishes of HCT116 or HEK293T cells stably expressing FLAG-HA-tagged proteins were washed once with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium (pH 7.4) (DPBS; 21-031-CM; Corning) and immediately scraped into 500 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40 alternative (492016; Millipore), one tablet of cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (04693116001; Roche) per 25 ml lysis buffer, one tablet of PhosSTOP (04906837001; Roche) per 10 ml lysis buffer and 1 mM DTT (43816; Sigma–Aldrich)). Lysates were incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C before being cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g and 4 °C for 10 min. Protein quantification was performed on the clarified lysate using the DC protein assay (500-0116; Bio-Rad). Anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (M8823; Millipore) were washed three times with a 10× packed bead volume of bead wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40 alternative). A DynaMag-2 magnet (12321D; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for collecting beads. Clarified lysate containing ~3 mg protein was then added to a 10-μl packed bead volume of the anti-FLAG beads for each immunoprecipitation, with the total solution volume brought up to 500 μl by adding lysis buffer. Samples were incubated with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. Following immunoprecipitation, beads were washed three times with a 20× packed bead volume of lysis buffer containing 400 mM NaCl. Proteins were eluted from beads using 1× Laemmli sample buffer (1610747; Bio-Rad) containing 2.5% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol (M3148; Sigma–Aldrich) and then heated at 72 °C for 10 min for SDS-PAGE. For the preparation of cell lysate samples for SDS-PAGE, clarified lysates were adjusted to have equal protein concentrations across samples and then mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration and then heated at 72 °C for 10 min.

Cellular fractionation was performed using the Cell Fractionation Kit (9038; Cell Signaling Technology), generally according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wide Bore P1000 tips were used to manipulate solutions containing cells and organelles to minimize damage. All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C, except those involving the kit's nuclear isolation buffer, which were performed at room temperature to avoid precipitation. One-quarter of a tablet of cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail per 5 ml of the kit's cytosolic isolation buffer, organellar isolation buffer and nuclear isolation buffer was used instead of the kit's protease inhibitor cocktail.

Cellular fractions from HCT116 cells were generated by first preparing a suspension of 5 million live HCT116 cells in 500 μl ice-cold DPBS. From this, 100 μl of the cell suspension (that is, whole cells) was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration. The sample was then sonicated and heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 3 min at room temperature; then the supernatant was taken for SDS-PAGE. The remaining 400 μl of the cell suspension in DPBS was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of the cytosolic isolation buffer, vortexed for 5 s, left on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of the supernatant (that is, cytosolic fraction) was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration, then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 3 min at room temperature before the supernatant was taken for SDS-PAGE. The remainder of the cytosolic fraction was aspirated off and the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl organellar isolation buffer, vortexed for 15 s, left on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 8,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of the supernatant (that is, organellar fraction) was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration, then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 3 min at room temperature before the supernatant was taken for SDS-PAGE. After aspiration of the remaining organellar fraction, the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl nuclear isolation buffer (that is, nuclear fraction), sonicated and mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration, then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 3 min at room temperature before the supernatant was taken for SDS-PAGE. The same volumes—and thus the same whole-cell equivalents—of the whole-cell sample, cytosolic fraction, organellar fraction and nuclear fraction were loaded on the SDS-PAGE gel.

CAKI-2 cells did not perform well using the aforementioned protocol for HCT116 cells, so modifications were made. A suspension of 3 million live CAKI-2 cells in 500 μl ice-cold DPBS was prepared. From this, 200 μl of the cell suspension (that is, whole cells) was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended with 200 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40 alternative, one-quarter of a tablet of cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail per 5 ml lysis buffer and half a tablet of PhosSTOP per 5 ml lysis buffer), incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the clarified lysate was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration, then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 3 min at room temperature before the supernatant was taken for SDS-PAGE. The remaining 300 μl of the cell suspension in DPBS was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of the kit's cytosolic isolation buffer, vortexed for 5 s, left on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the supernatant (that is, cytosolic fraction) was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration, then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 3 min at room temperature before the supernatant was taken for SDS-PAGE. The remainder of the cytosolic fraction was aspirated off and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl lysis buffer, incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the clarified lysate (that is, organellar fraction) was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration, then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 3 min at room temperature before the supernatant was taken for SDS-PAGE. The same volumes—and thus the same whole-cell equivalents—of the whole-cell samples, cytosolic fractions and organellar fractions were loaded on the SDS-PAGE gel.

HEK293T cells did not perform well using the aforementioned protocol for HCT116 cells, so modifications were made. A suspension of 6 million live HEK293T cells in 600 μl ice-cold DPBS was prepared. From this, 200 μl of the cell suspension (that is, whole cells) was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended with 200 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40 alternative, one-quarter of a tablet of cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail per 5 ml lysis buffer and half a tablet of PhosSTOP per 5 ml lysis buffer), incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the clarified lysate was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration and then heated at 72 °C for 10 min for SDS-PAGE. 300 μl of the cell suspension in DPBS was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of the kit's cytosolic isolation buffer, vortexed for 5 s, left on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the supernatant (that is, cytosolic fraction) was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration and then heated at 72 °C for 10 min for SDS-PAGE. The remainder of the cytosolic fraction was aspirated off and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl lysis buffer, incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the clarified lysate (that is, organellar fraction) was mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration and then heated at 72 °C for 10 min for SDS-PAGE. The same volumes—and thus the same whole-cell equivalents—of the whole-cell samples, cytosolic fractions and organellar fractions were loaded on the SDS-PAGE gel.

Preparation of cellular lysates from human cells was done at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise indicated. Fully confluent 10-cm dishes were washed once with ice-cold DPBS and immediately scraped into 500 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40 alternative, one tablet of cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail per 25 ml lysis buffer and one tablet of PhosSTOP per 10 ml lysis buffer). Lysates were incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C before being cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein quantification was performed on the clarified lysate using the DC protein assay. For the preparation of samples for SDS-PAGE, clarified lysates were adjusted to have equal protein concentrations across samples, mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol to achieve a final 1× concentration and then heated at 72 °C for 10 min.

Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE via 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (456-1096; Bio-Rad) and then transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (1704158 and 1704159; Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (1704150; Bio-Rad). Membranes were then blocked for 45 min at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk (1706404; Bio-Rad) prepared in 1× TBST (40120065-2; bioWORLD) and incubated with primary antibodies in 1× TBST overnight at 4 °C at the following dilutions: ACAA1 (1/250), AGPS (1/1,000), C6ORF226 (1/1,000), PEX5 (1/1,000), PEX13 (1/1,000), ACTB (1/2,500), PEX7 (1/1,000), PHYH (1/1,000), SCP2 (1/500), CANX (1/1,000), citrate synthase (1/1,000), GAPDH (1/5,000), HA (1/1,000), histone H3 (1/1,500) and RPS6KB1 (1/1,000). Afterwards, membranes were washed three times with 1× TBST and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/5,000) in 1× TBST for 45 min at room temperature. Membranes were then washed three more times with 1× TBST and subsequently visualized using film or a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad) in conjunction with enhanced chemiluminescence via Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (32106; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or, if increased sensitivity was needed, SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (34096; Thermo Fisher Scientific). If membranes needed to be stripped and re-probed after enhanced chemiluminescence, they were washed twice with 1× TBST, incubated with Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (46430; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at room temperature, washed once more with 1× TBST and then blocked and immunoblotted as described already.

Densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed using the software ImageJ (version 1.54d)89 and background signals were corrected for. For the quantification of immunoblots, band intensities were used as indicated in the respective figures and figure captions.

HeLa cells (CCL-2; ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (41966-029; Gibco) plus 25 mM of HEPES buffer (J848; VWR) containing 10% FBS (FBS-12A; Capricorn Scientific), 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin (15140-122; Gibco), under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma.

HsPEX13-KO cells were generated by CRISPR–Cas9, as described previously94. HeLa cells were transfected with the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP vector (48138; Addgene) containing an sgRNA against HsPEX13 using jetPRIME (114-15; Polyplus Transfection). The oligonucleotide sequences used for the sgRNA are provided in Supplementary Table 1. eGFP-expressing cells were sorted by FACS and cells were plated at one cell per well in 96-well plates and cultured at 37 °C as described above. After 6–8 weeks, HsPEX13 KOs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the expanded cell clones. After PCR amplification of exon 2 of HsPEX13 using the gene-specific primers HsPEX13_F and HsPEX13_R, the PCR products were sequenced with −21M13 or M13rev primers using the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (4337449; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed on an ABI 3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences used are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Three clonal HsPEX13-KO cell lines were selected for follow-up studies with the following genotypes:

HsPEX13-KO_1 (c.142_143del (p.Leu48TyrfsX18)/c.142_143del (p.Leu48TyrfsX18))

HsPEX13-KO_2 (c.129_147del (p.Gly44GlnfsX19)/c.142_143del (p.Leu48TyrfsX18))

HsPEX13-KO_3 (c. 126_151del (p.Arg42SerfsX16)/c.142_143del (p.Leu48TyrfsX18))

The three clonal HsPEX13-KO cell lines were transfected independently in duplicate with pcDNA3.1 (V79020; Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing wild-type HsPEX13 or a variant with a K10PWE-to-AAAA substitution (HsPEX13(4A)) using jetPRIME (114-15; Polyplus Transfection) followed by 48 h of culturing at 37 °C, as described above. pcDNA3.1 containing HsPEX13(4A) was generated using GeneScript. 48 h after transfection, cells were taken for lysis and immunoblotting.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (R0278; Sigma–Aldrich) plus cOmplete Mini protease inhibitors (11836153001; Roche). Proteins were separated on 10% NuPAGE gels (WG1203BX10; Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies against ACAA1 (HPA007244; Sigma–Aldrich; diluted 1/2,000), ACOX1 (ab184032; Abcam; diluted 1/2,000), AGPS (described previously95; diluted 1/3,000), HsPEX13 (PAB22801; Abnova; diluted 1/2,000), PHYH (12858-1-AP; Proteintech; diluted 1/1,000) and TUBA4A (T6199; Sigma–Aldrich; diluted 1/2,000). After incubation with the secondary antibodies IRDye 800CW anti-rabbit (926-32211; LI-COR Biosciences) or IRDye 680RD anti-mouse (925-68070; LI-COR Biosciences) (both diluted 1/5,000), blots were imaged and band intensities quantified via an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).

For routine culturing and experiments, HEK293 cells (CRL-1573; ATCC) were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (M2279; Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 2 mM l-alanyl-l-glutamine dipeptide (35050061; Gibco), 10% FBS (GA3160802; Gibco) and MycoZap Plus-CL (195261; Lonza). All complete media was passed through a 0.22-μm filter before use. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma.

The plasmids pET28a-PEX7 (encoding an N-terminally histidine (His)-tagged version of human PEX7)58, pET23a-PEX5(C11K) (encoding a version of the large isoform of human PEX5 possessing a lysine at position 11, which improves the detection of ubiquitination under reducing conditions)96, pET28a-PEX5(1–324) (encoding a His-tagged protein comprising residues 1–324 of the large isoform of PEX5)97, pQE30-PEX5(315–639) (encoding a His-tagged protein comprising residues 315–639 of the large isoform of PEX5)98, pQE30-PEX14(1–80) (encoding an N-terminally His-tagged version of the first 80 residues of human PEX14 (NDPEX14))98, pGEM4-ACAA1 (encoding the precursor form of human ACAA1)58, pGEM4-PHYH (encoding the precursor form of human PHYH)33, pQE31-PHYH (encoding a His-tagged version of PHYH)99 and pGEM4-MmSCPx (encoding mouse Sterol carrier protein 2)100 were all described before.

The following plasmids were produced:

pET28a-HsPEX39 (encoding an N-terminally His-tagged version of HsPEX39). The HsPEX39 cDNA was amplified from total genomic DNA from HepG2 cells using the primers Hs.C6ORF226_EcoRI_Fw and Hs.C6ORF226_NotI_Rv. The amplified fragment was inserted into EcoRI/NotI-digested pET28a.

pGEX-HsPEX39 (encoding an N-terminally GST-tagged version of HsPEX39). The HsPEX39 DNA fragment described above was inserted into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-6-P1 (GE HealthCare).

pGEX-HsPEX39(1–70) (encoding an N-terminally GST-tagged HsPEX39 containing residues 1–70). This was generated by introducing two stop codons by site-directed mutagenesis with the primers ORF70stop2x_Fw and _ ORF70stop2x_Rv.

pGEX-HsPEX39(48–101) (encoding an N-terminally GST-tagged HsPEX39 comprising residues 48–101). The corresponding DNA fragment was obtained by PCR with the primers Hs.C6ORF226_Glu48_EcoRI_Fw and Hs.C6ORF226_NotI_Rv and inserted into EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-6-P1 (GE HealthCare).

pGEX-HsPEX39(KPWEmut) (encoding an N-terminally GST-tagged version of HsPEX39 in which the KPWE motif is replaced by AAAA). This was obtained by overlap extension PCR. Two overlapping regions of HsPEX39 cDNA, both encoding the KPWE-to-AAAA substitution, were obtained by PCR with the primer pairs Hs.C6ORF226_EcoRI_Fw/P2_KPWE-Ala_Rv and P3_KPWE-Ala_Fw/Hs.C6ORF226_NotI_Rv. The resulting PCR products were denatured, annealed and used in a third PCR with the primers Hs.C6ORF226_EcoRI_Fw and Hs.C6ORF226_NotI_Rv. The amplified fragment was digested and inserted into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-6-P1 (GE HealthCare).

pGEX-HsPEX39(48–101,KPWEmut) (encoding an N-terminally GST-tagged HsPEX39 protein comprising residues 48–101 in which the KPWE motif is substituted with AAAA). This was obtained by PCR amplification of pGEX-HsPEX39(KPWEmut) with the primers Hs.C6ORF226_Glu48_EcoRI_Fw and Hs.C6ORF226_NotI_Rv. The resulting fragment was digested and inserted into EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-6-P1 (GE HealthCare).

pET23a-NtPEX13.Sumo.His. cDNA encoding residues 1–36 of HsPEX13 appended to the TEV recognition sequence SENLYFQG, followed by residues 2–101 of human SUMO-1 protein with a C-terminal His-tag, was synthesized and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI restriction sites of pET23a (Novagen) by GenScript.

pET23a-NtPEX13(KPWEmut).Sumo.His. This was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the pET23a-NtPEX13.Sumo.His construct from GenScript.

pGEX-HsPEX39(L21A) (encoding an N-terminally GST-tagged version of HsPEX39 with the L21A substitution). This was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX-HsPEX39 using the primers Hs.C6ORF226_L21A_Fw and Hs.C6ORF226_L21A_Rv.

pET28a-PEX7(E77A) (encoding an N-terminally His-tagged version of human PEX7 with the E77A substitution). This was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of pET28a-PEX7 with the primers PEX7_E77A_fw and PEX7_E77A_Rv.

pACEBac1-FLAGPEX7 (encoding an N-terminally FLAG-tagged version of human PEX7). The coding sequence for FLAG-PEX7, optimized for eukaryotic expression, was synthesized (GenScript Biotech) and cloned into the pACEBac1 plasmid.

Recombinant His-PEX5(1–324) and His-PEX5(315–639) (both ref. 98), as well as NDPEX14 (ref. 98) and His-PHYH99, were expressed and purified exactly as described before.

The N-terminally His-tagged and GST-tagged versions of HsPEX39 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (AGLS230245; Agilent) for 3 h at 37 °C with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and purified using either Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (17-5318-01; Cytiva) or Glutathione Sepharose 4B (17-0756-01; Cytiva) affinity chromatography resins, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All proteins were stored in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH (pH 8.0) and 1 mM DTT at −80 °C.

Where indicated, GST-HsPEX39 variants were treated with His-tagged HRV-3C protease to remove the GST tag. Briefly, GST-tagged proteins were incubated with 3C protease (30:1 (wt/wt)) for 16 h at 4 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH (pH 8.0) and 1 mM DTT. The His-tagged protease was removed from the preparation by affinity chromatography using Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin and collecting the flow through.

For FLAG-PEX7 expression in insect cells, bacmids were produced in DH10EMBacY E. coli cells and purified by lysing cells with the A1, A2 and A3 buffers of the Plasmid Miniprep Kit (740588.50; Macherey-Nagel), followed by isopropanol precipitation. Briefly, 700 μl isopropanol was applied to 800 μl cell lysate and centrifuged at 16,000g and 4 °C for 10 min. Pellets were washed with 200 μl 70% (vol/vol) ethanol, dried and solubilized in sterilized water.

To generate the virus stocks, 10 μg of each bacmid were added to 250 μl Sf-900 II serum-free medium (10902088; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4 μl FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (E2311; Promega). The mixtures were transfected into 3 ml of 0.7 × 106 cells per ml Sf9 cells and the supernatants—namely the V0 virus stocks—were collected after incubation at 27 °C for 72 h. To obtain the virus stocks at higher titration and in larger amounts, a V1 virus stock was generated by suspension culture of 1.0 × 106 cells per ml Sf9 cells infected with 0.2% (vol/vol) V0 virus at 27 °C and 100 r.p.m. for 96 h and the supernatants were stored at 4 °C with 10% FBS (AU-FBS/PG; CellSera Australia).

For large-scale expression, 1.0 × 106 cells per ml Hi5 cells were infected with 0.2% (vol/vol) V1 virus and cultured at 27 °C and 100 r.p.m. for 72 h. Hi5 cells were pelleted and resuspended with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 250 µl BioLock per 400 ml culture). Cells were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 58,540g and 6 °C for 60 min. The supernatant was collected and applied to a gravity-flow column filled with 2 ml anti-FLAG M2 Beads (A2220; Millipore) for affinity chromatography. Protein was eluted with 0.2 mg ml−1 FLAG Peptide in storage buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol). Elution fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and fractions containing FLAG-PEX7 were pooled, concentrated and stored at −80 °C.

Radiolabelled proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (L1170; Promega) in the presence of EasyTag l-[35S]methionine (specific activity > 1,000 Ci mmol−1; NEG709A; PerkinElmer) for 90 min at 30 °C, according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception of PEX7, which was synthesized for 4 h. Unlabelled (cold) PEX7 was synthesized in the same way, but using unlabelled methionine provided in the kit. Aliquots of the rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing the synthesized proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

In vitro peroxisomal import reactions using HEK293-derived PNSs were performed as previously described38. Briefly, the rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRLs) containing the radiolabelled reporter protein (0.2–1.0 μl RRL per import reaction) was diluted in 10 μl import buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, 2 μg ml−1 E-64 and 48 μg ml−1 methionine, final concentration). For improved import yields, the diluted [35S]ACAA1 RRL also contained 70 nM His-PEX5(1–324) and 1 μl RRL containing unlabelled PEX7 to form a pre-import complex between PEX5, PEX7 and the PTS2-containing protein. Radiolabelled proteins were added to import reactions containing 600 μg HEK293 PNS (previously primed by incubating at 37 °C for 5 min with 0.3 mM ATP (A2383; Sigma–Aldrich)) in import buffer supplemented with 5 μM bovine ubiquitin, 2 mM reduced glutathione and either 3 mM ATP or 3 mM AMP-PNP (NU-407; Jena Bioscience) (100 μl final volume). Where specified, in vitro reactions were supplemented with 2 μM ubiquitin aldehyde, His-PEX5(315–639) (5 μM), NDPEX14 (10 μM), NtPEX13.Sumo.His (up to 20 μM) and His.HsPEX39 or untagged HsPEX39 variants (up to 1 μM). Import reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Import reactions with radiolabelled PTS2- or PTS1-containing proteins were treated with trypsin (400 μg ml−1 final concentration) to degrade non-imported reporter protein. After a 40-min incubation on ice, proteases were inhibited with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (500 μg ml−1, final concentration). When monitoring radiolabelled PEX5, the protease treatment was omitted. Reactions were diluted with ice-cold SEMK (20 mM MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2), 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH (pH 8.0) and 80 mM KCl). Organelles, and soluble fractions (if required), were collected by centrifugation (20 min; 16,000g; 4 °C). Proteins were precipitated with 10% (wt/vol) TCA and washed with acetone and the resulting organelle and/or soluble fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting, Ponceau S staining and autoradiography.

The reticulocyte lysate containing radiolabelled His-PEX7 (0.4 μl) was incubated in the absence or presence of recombinant HsPEX39 variants (4 μg), His-PEX5(1–324) (1 μg), His-PHYH (100 ng) and NtPEX13.Sumo.His variants (4 μg), as specified in the figures, in 20 μl 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM DTT and 0.025% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin. After adding 5 μl loading buffer (0.17% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue and 50% (wt/vol) sucrose), 6 μl of the samples were loaded onto Tris non-denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels using a discontinuous buffer system101 and run at 250 V and 4 °C for ~1 h. For native PAGE assays using only recombinant proteins, approximately 5 µg FLAG-PEX7, GST-HsPEX39, His-PEX5(1–324) and His-PHYH were analysed in the same way.

To determine the half-lives of protein complexes, [35S]His-PEX7 complexes were formed with 50 nM and 5 μM GST-HsPEX39 and NtPEX13.Sumo.His and then incubated for 20 min with 5 μM GST-HsPEX39(48–101) and 25 μM GST-HsPEX39, respectively. Control samples (0 and 20 min, without an HsPEX39 competitor) were incubated with corresponding amounts of GST-Ub. Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were individually thawed and loaded in the gel from the longest to shortest time points.

Gels were stained with Coomassie or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, stained with Ponceau S and subjected to autoradiography. For immunoblotting analysis of protein complexes detected by native PAGE, bands were excised from the wet stained nitrocellulose membranes, finely cut into smaller pieces and thoroughly destained with water. Proteins were eluted from the membrane slices with Laemmli sample buffer (30 min at 37 °C followed by 30 min at 65 °C) and analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies directed against HsPEX39 (HPA045350; Sigma–Aldrich; diluted 1/3,000) and PHYH (12858-1-AP; Proteintech; diluted 1/3,000) and antibodies raised in rabbit against human PEX7 (ref. 58; diluted 1/2,000) and PEX5 (ref. 102; diluted 1/6,000), as described elsewhere. Primary antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (A9919; Sigma–Aldrich; diluted 1/20,000).

SEC was performed on an ÄKTA pure system using a Superdex 200 Increase 3.2/300 equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA at a flow rate of 0.075 ml min−1. Proteins (10–15 µg), alone or mixed together, were incubated for 15 min at 23 °C before injection. Fractions of 70 µl were collected and analysed by SDS-PAGE. Ferritin (440 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) were used as molecular weight markers.

Sequences with a significant relationship to human C6ORF226 were initially established by BLAST103 searches in the UniProt database using P < 0.001 as a significant threshold. The sequence set was further expanded by three rounds of iterative refinement using the generalized profile method104 and P < 0.001 as a threshold for including protein hits in the next iteration. Protein alignments were calculated using the L-INS-i algorithm of the MAFFT package (version 7.490)105. In the second and third iteration cycles, significant hits in members of the PEX13 family were picked up, based on conservation of the KPWE motif. Subsequently, the PEX13 family was analysed by a separate set of generalized profiles, as described for the C6ORF226 family. The final hit lists after three rounds of iterative refinement were used to compile Extended Data Fig. 1a.

The conserved KPWE core region and five flanking residues on either side were extracted from the final C6ORF226 and PEX13 family alignments and used for sequence logo generation using WebLogo version 2.8.2 (https://weblogo.berkeley.edu)106,107. The final hit lists and alignment files for the C6ORF226 and PEX13 families are available from the corresponding authors upon request.

For the structural predictions of protein complexes, the amino acid sequences of the proteins were downloaded from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/) and indicated parts were used for web-based predictions (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb), as described previously42,108. The highest-ranking model of each prediction was visualized using ChimeraX (version 1.7.1.0)109. Parameters and output files of the predictions are available from the corresponding authors upon request.

Structural models deposited in the AlphaFold database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) were downloaded as .pdb files using the accession codes AF-O00628-F1-v4 (HsPEX7) and AF-P39108-F1-v4 (ScPex7). The respective .pdb files were loaded into ChimeraX (version 1.7.1.0)109 and superimposed using the matchmaker command (Extended Data Fig.  10).

Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 10 and Microsoft Excel, unless otherwise specified. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. Definitions of central and dispersion or precision measures, as well as the statistical tests used are included in the figure captions. A significance threshold of 0.05 was used for all of the statistical tests in Figs. 1c, 2c,e,g, 3b and 6i and Extended Data Figs. 4a, 5c and 7f,h. For the limma approach used in Fig. 2e, we formally assessed the equality of variances using Levene's test and found them to be equal at a 1% significance level. Although formal tests for normality (Shapiro–Wilk and D'Agostino–Pearson tests) indicated deviations from perfect normality, the distributions were manually inspected and found to be sufficiently close to normality to justify the use of the limma approach. The data distribution in our study was otherwise assumed to be normal and was not formally tested. All of the experiments were performed independently at least twice with similar results (that is, two biological replicates), except for those shown in Extended Data Figs. 3d, 5i (right side; extractions with low- and high-salt buffers) and 9b (bottom panel), for which only one biological replicate was performed. For Fig. 6i, data from two independent experiments utilizing the three independent HsPEX13-KO clones transfected with the indicated plasmids are presented in aggregate accordingly (that is, six biological replicates). For all instances for which n replicates are reported (for example, n = 3), these are biological replicates. No data points were excluded from the analyses except for the OD600measurement of one of the replicates for wild-type yeast cells grown for 96 h in oleic acid medium (Fig. 6f), which was excluded because the sample had visible microbial contamination that would have rendered the OD600 measurement inaccurate. SILAC labelling of Scpex39Δ and wild-type yeast cells was switched between biological replicates to avoid bias introduced by the SILAC label, but randomization was otherwise not performed in this study because it was not relevant (for example, control and KO cells were already defined). Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments, but were performed without bias.

a, Examination of [R/K]PWE motifs and Yjr012c/C6ORF226 orthologs across eukaryotes. Left: Sequence logos for the regions containing [R/K]PWE motifs in the indicated proteins. At each position, stack height indicates sequence conservation, while symbol height indicates the relative frequency of each residue. Right: Domain architecture of the indicated proteins across major eukaryotic taxa. Colored boxes indicate regions typical for PEX14 (green), Yjr012c/C6ORF226 orthologs (purple), and PEX13 (orange). Red boxes denote [R/K]PWE motifs. Grey boxes indicate additional domains only found in some taxa. In most fungi, invertebrates and fishes, Yjr012c/C6ORF226 orthologs possess an additional region of unknown function (“X”) that is distinct from the DUF5572. SAR, Stramenopiles-Alveolata-Rhizaria. b, Immunoblots of eluates (E) and bead (B) samples of the soluble fractions of wild-type (WT) yeast cells and cells expressing Pex18-TPA. TEV-protease was added to beads to cleave the TPA tag and elute Pex18 complexes. c, STRING network analysis representing network of proteins (nodes) from Pex18-TPA complexes dataset with a Q-value of < 0.05. The network is based on data received from curated databases and experiments and was filtered by a “minimum required interaction score” of 0.4 (medium confidence). Interactions without experimental/biochemical data or those that are based on putative homologues in other organisms were not considered. d, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of proteins with a Q-value of < 0.05 for the domains “biological process” (BP) and “cellular component” (CC). Listed are selected terms with an adjusted P value (Padj) of < 0.05. GO term enrichment analysis was performed using the g:Profiler application (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost)83 and adjusted P values determined via the Benjamini-Hochberg method. e, Fluorescence microscopy of ScPex39-mNeonGreen in yeast grown in medium with oleic acid as the primary energy source, a condition that stimulates peroxisomal biogenesis35. Peroxisomes were visualized with Pex3-mScarlet. Scale bar: 5 μm. f, Immunoblots of cellular fractions from wild-type HCT116 cells. In parentheses are the subcellular compartments that GAPDH, SCP2, and Histone H3 are markers for. SCP2 represents the ~15 kDa protein that results from transcription of a downstream promoter for the SCP2 gene and has been used previously as a marker of peroxisomes111,112.

Source data

a, Determination of protein composition of complexes identified by native-PAGE assays. Top: The indicated recombinant proteins, alone or mixed together, were analyzed by native-PAGE and Coomassie/TCA staining. In-gel positions of PEX7 alone (PEX7), PEX5 alone (PEX5), HsPEX39 alone (HsPEX39), and protein complexes A-D are indicated. Bottom: Bands for complexes A-D in the native gel (top) were excised from a Ponceau S-stained membrane, eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to verify the protein composition of the complexes. b, Recombinant FLAG-PEX7, GST-HsPEX39, H6PHYH, and H6PEX5(1-324) were analyzed alone or in the indicated mixtures using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (top). The corresponding area of the chromatogram is also shown (bottom). The elution volumes of the protein complexes, individual recombinant proteins, and molecular weight standards (Ferritin and BSA) are indicated. c, Recombinant GST-HsPEX39, H6PHYH, and H6PEX5(1-324) were analyzed alone or in the indicated mixtures by SEC. Collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (top). The corresponding area of the chromatogram is also shown (bottom). The elution volumes of the species of interest and molecular weight standards (Ferritin, BSA) are indicated. d, The purity of FLAG-PEX7, GST-HsPEX39, H6PHYH, and H6PEX5(1-324) was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The asterisk indicates an Escherichia coli contaminant that co-purifies with recombinant HsPEX39. L, protein ladder.

Source data

a, Growth of the indicated yeast strains in oleic acid medium. Data are mean ± standard deviation (SD) (n = 4). b, Growth of the indicated yeast strains in glucose medium. Data are mean ± SD (n = 3). c, Immunoblots of the two additional biological replicates used for quantification of the subcellular distribution of proteins in Fig. 2c. Experiments performed as described in Fig. 2b using the indicated strains. d, Immunoblots of cellular fractions from wild-type and pex7Δ yeast. Experiment performed as described in Fig. 2b. e, Immunoblot analysis of Pex7 levels in the indicated yeast strains. Wild-type, Scpex39Δ, pex7Δ yeast and deletion strains transformed with plasmids containing Scpex39 or pex7 under the control of endogenous promotors or a strong TEF2 overexpression promotor (_OE) were cultured in oleic acid medium. pPEX39_ΔN, plasmid encoding for an N-terminally truncated variant of ScPex39 (amino acids 40-132) that retains the RPWE motif. Detection of endogenous Pex7 levels was accomplished by covering intense signals detected for overexpressed Pex7. Shorter and longer exposures denoted by s.e. and l.e., respectively. L, protein ladder. f, Immunoblots of cellular fractions from Scpex39Δ and pex7Δ yeast transformed with a plasmid containing pex7 under the TEF2 promoter (pPEX7_OE). Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 2b. An asterisk indicates a non-specific band. Two biological replicates are shown. c,d,f, PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; S, cytosolic supernatant; OP, organellar pellet.

Source data

a, Quantification of mature ACAA1, mature AGPS, PEX7, and PEX5 in HsPEX39-knockout cells using band intensities of immunoblots prepared per Fig. 2f. Loading-control intensities were used to normalize protein abundance across samples and the normalized abundances were then divided by the mean value of the corresponding control cells. The names of quantified proteins are shown on the bottom. Precursor forms of ACAA1 and AGPS were undetectable and thus not quantified. Data are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) (n = 3), and P values were calculated using unpaired, two-tailed t-tests. b, Immunoblot analysis of cells generated via lentiviral transduction of Cas9 and multiple independent sgRNAs against HsPEX39 (sgHsPEX39_1-3) or a negative control sgRNA against the AAVS1 gene (sgAAVS1) in the CAKI-2 and NCI-H1792 cell lines. Note that the residual HsPEX39 signal in these cells is because not all cells in the population will have complete loss of the protein.

As Earth's climate warms, surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has intensified, increasing rates of sea-level rise. Observations and theory indicate that meltwater generated at the ice sheet surface can drain to its bed, where it flows relatively unhindered to the ocean. This understanding of water movement within and beneath ice sheets underpins the theoretical models that are used to make projections of ice sheet change. Here we present evidence of a destructive mode of meltwater drainage in Greenland. Using multiple satellite sources, we show that a 90-million-cubic-metre subglacial flood forced its way upwards from the bed, fracturing the ice sheet, and bursting through the surface. This phenomenon was triggered by the rapid drainage of a subglacial lake and occurred in a region where the ice bed was predicted to be frozen. The resulting flood caused a rapid deceleration of the downstream marine-terminating glacier. Our observations reveal a complex, bi-directional coupling between the ice sheet's surface and basal hydrological systems and demonstrate that extreme hydrological forcing may occur in regions of predicted cold-based ice. Such processes can impact the ice sheet's dynamics and structural integrity but are not currently considered in ice sheet models.

Over the past three decades, the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an average of ~169 billion tonnes of ice annually, contributing a total of ~14 mm to global sea-level rise1,2. Approximately one-half of this mass loss originated from surface mass balance processes2,3, driven primarily by enhanced melting and run-off from the ice surface. As Arctic warming continues4, the intensity and extent of Greenland surface melting are projected to increase5, leading to greater ice mass loss6,7, and increased liquid water atop, within and beneath the ice sheet.

Understanding the passage of meltwater from its origin to the ocean is critical for assessing Greenland's future contribution to sea-level rise and its impact upon the wider Arctic system. It is well established that meltwater generated at the ice sheet surface penetrates to the bed via moulins and crevasses8,9,10. Observational studies, mainly in southwest Greenland, have shown that the subglacial hydrological system rapidly responds to water input and that temporal variability in subglacial water flow exerts a key control on the overlying ice dynamics9,11,12,13,14,15. As such, it is necessary to determine both the mode (continuous versus episodic) and pathways (surface, englacial or subglacial) of water drainage and the extent to which meltwater is stored during this journey16,17. These factors affect many processes, including ice dynamics, thermodynamics, ice–ocean interactions, fjord circulation, primary productivity and rates of sediment and nutrient transfer to the ocean18.

One of the most recently discovered, yet poorly understood, components of Greenland's subglacial hydrological system is its network of active subglacial lakes19,20,21,22,23,24. These are primarily fed by surface meltwater penetrating to the ice sheet base20,21,22,23,25 and have the potential to force large volumes of water through the subglacial system when they drain, altering its morphology and also the dynamics of the surrounding ice26,27,28,29. Currently, however, detailed observations of Greenland subglacial lake drainage events are rare, and process understanding of their drivers and impacts is limited. Indeed, basal thermal conditions, a key control on subglacial water distribution and dynamics, still remain uncertain across a substantial proportion of the ice sheet30. Against a backdrop of enhanced run-off during the twenty-first century31,32 and expected increases in the frequency and extent of subglacial lake drainage23,33, the consequent impact of these poorly understood events upon the ice sheet remains uncertain. Here we present observations of a destructive mode of Greenland subglacial lake drainage and analyse its impact upon the surrounding ice sheet.

We use very high-resolution ArcticDEM digital surface models (DSMs)34 and satellite imagery to identify and monitor a previously undetected subglacial lake in northern Greenland, close to the marine-terminating Harder Glacier (81.5° N, 44.48° W) (ref. 35). During a 10-day period in the summer of 2014 (22 July–1 August), a 2 km2 region of the ice surface dropped by 85-m elevation, forming a deep collapse basin in the ice surface (Fig. 1). This rapid deflation, which occurred ~25 km inland, on slow-flowing ( < 10 m yr−1) ice adjacent to the main glacier, followed shortly after the seasonal run-off maximum (Extended Data Fig. 1). Before this event, the basin surface had been rising, to form a ~10–15 m high dome above the surrounding ice (Figs. 1 and 2). Following the 2014 surface collapse, uplift of the ice within the basin resumed, before it subsided by ~10 m between 2017 and 2019 (Fig. 2). We interpret this dynamic behaviour to be the surface expression of an active subglacial lake, similar to those observed previously in Greenland and Antarctica20,21,22,23,29,36,37,38.

Assuming that the volume of water discharged by the subglacial lake is approximated by the volume displaced by the newly created surface feature, we estimate that 9 × 107 m3 of water drained from the lake during the 10-day period. Contemporaneously, a neighbouring supraglacial lake (abutting the adjacent nunatak) also drained, suggesting a direct connection between the surface and basal hydrological systems. Modelling of upstream surface and basal melting suggests that the subglacial lake was primarily fed from locally sourced surface meltwater, with more than 99% of water generated within its catchment originating from surface melt and 73% of all meltwater being generated within 2 km of the collapse basin itself (Extended Data Fig. 2). During the 10-day drainage window between satellite acquisitions, water drained from the lake at a mean rate of 100 m3 s−1, with peak discharge probably much higher if drainage occurred over a shorter period. As such, the water flux was two orders of magnitude higher than that from an Antarctic lake of similar volume33 and one of the largest events recorded beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet to date25,33. Notably, the estimated discharge rate represented an ~ 30-fold increase in the daily meltwater run-off flux generated across the entire Harder Glacier catchment at that time, suggesting that lake drainage exerted a substantial perturbation on the downstream subglacial system.

Theory and observations of lake drainage suggest that floodwater is routed subglacially, according to gradients in the hydraulic potential. As such, subglacial floods in Greenland form part of a broader unidirectional hydrological system, whereby surface meltwater is routed from the surface to the bed and, eventually, to the ocean. Here, however, we find evidence of a contrasting mode of ice sheet drainage pathway. Approximately 1 km downstream of the collapse basin, a newly formed zone of fractures appeared in the ice surface, consisting of crevassing and uprooted ice blocks with a combined height (crevasse depth plus ice block height) of 40 m (Figs. 1 and 2). Downslope of the fracture zone, an ~6-km2 region of the ice surface had been scoured clean. Together, these observations indicate that a substantial volume of water broke up through the ice at this location and flooded across the surface (Fig. 1). Indeed, the hydraulic potential difference between the lake and the fracture site indicates that the floodwater had sufficient hydraulic head to reach the surface at the fracture location. Notably, estimates of the longitudinal strain rate indicate a transition from compressional to extensional flow at the fracture site (Extended Data Fig. 3), which may have promoted fracturing through the ice column at this location.

Inspection of satellite imagery spanning 36 years shows that the distinctive oval-shaped surface feature above the subglacial lake has existed since at least 1985. Within this record, we find evidence for a single drainage event before 2014, which occurred between 21 June and 1 August 1990 (Extended Data Fig. 4) when the ice was more than 10 m thicker. In contrast to 2014, however, the 1990 drainage event did not drive downstream surface fracturing, implying that the floodwater ran entirely along the basal interface. Thus, we conclude that the 2014 surface outburst was unprecedented within the observational record.

The area of flood-scoured ice ended abruptly after several kilometres, at a site where a supraglacial lake (denoted SL1 in Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 4) also drained. The absence of surface scouring beyond this feature indicates that the floodwater, having burst upwards through the ice and flowed across the surface, then re-entered the englacial and subglacial system at this location, to flow onwards beneath the main trunk of the Harder Glacier. The synchronicity of the subglacial and surface lake drainage events suggests that the surface flood may have triggered the latter, most likely through a process of hydrofracture at the lake bed. Analysis of the basal hydropotential suggests that the floodwater was then routed beneath the Harder Glacier, to exit at the glacier's main (northern) terminus (Extended Data Fig. 5). Within the same 10-day period, the terminus experienced a large calving event (500–600 m ice front retreat, the seventh largest event in the past 32 years; Extended Data Fig. 6). Whether there was a direct link to the lake outburst remains uncertain; however, these observations are consistent with a theory that a rapid pulse of water drove such a response, either by impacting the stress regime at the ice front, or by enhancing ocean-driven melting and undercutting39,40.

Our observations have shown that the lake drainage caused a substantial perturbation to the ice sheet's hydrological system. To evaluate any associated impact upon downstream glacier dynamics, we computed 5,800 maps of ice velocity spanning 1985–2020 (Extended Data Fig. 7). These show that the dynamics of the Harder Glacier exhibit a pronounced seasonal cycle, superimposed upon a longer-term acceleration since 2014–2015. Whether lake drainage and the onset of acceleration in 2014 are causally linked (for example, due to a calving-induced reduction in buttressing) remains unclear, given the sparsity of data before 2013 and the numerous factors affecting marine-terminating glacier flow41,42. However, in the weeks following the outburst flood, there is evidence of a substantial shorter-term disturbance to the glacier's dynamics, with a rapid deceleration of 80 m yr−1 (measured ~5 km inland from the ice front; Extended Data Fig. 7). Whereas late-summer deceleration is usual, in 2014 it was ~300% greater than normal, such that by 12 September, the glacier had lost 63% of its peak summer velocity, compared with an average reduction of 37% in other years. These observations are consistent with the theory that a rapid injection of floodwater increased the efficiency of the subglacial system, lowering basal water pressures and, ultimately, ice speed43. Such a mechanism is well established for supraglacial lake drainage and has been proposed for subglacial lake drainage beneath land-terminating ice29. Our observations suggest that it can impact fast-flowing, marine-terminating glaciers too.

Determining the broader implications of this destructive and poorly understood subglacial flood process requires an understanding of the physical characteristics of the system, including the basal conditions immediately downstream of the lake, which will have impacted the mechanism of flood initiation, propagation and outburst. Specifically, although our observations indicate that upwards-propagating hydrofracture occurred at the outburst location, it remains unclear whether subglacial lake drainage also initiated via hydrofracture along the basal interface (that is, basal hydrofracture44) or whether an initiation process associated with temperate ice masses (as inferred for exponentially growing jökulhlaups45) prevailed. In the latter case, ice-dam floatation or migration of a hydraulic divide may have occurred, with discharge then growing exponentially according to classical theory (widening of a pre-existing conduit due to frictional heating exceeding viscous closure). Although commonly invoked for lake drainage under temperate ice bodies, the second hypothesis assumes a thawed bed along the drainage pathway and does not explain the subsequent switch to upwards hydrofracture-driven propagation that is observed here. Conversely, although a hypothesis of basal hydrofracture is less established, its theoretical feasibility has been demonstrated44, and it places no dependency upon the presence of a temperate bed.

To assess these two hypotheses, we modelled ice temperature along the slow-flowing ( < 10 m yr−1) section of the flood path between the surface depression and flood outburst site. These simulations were designed to better understand how climatic and geometric conditions (for example, surface temperature and ice thickness) might control the basal thermal state along this section. As ice thickness and geothermal heat flux are poorly constrained in this region, we assessed a wide range of plausible configurations46,47. In all cases, modelled basal temperatures remained below −5 °C, indicating that the climate and geometry favoured the presence of a frozen bed before lake drainage (Fig. 3). Indeed, based upon the available ice thickness information (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 8), it is likely that similar thermal conditions persisted until the thicker, faster-flowing ice of the Harder Glacier was reached further downstream. Thus, we infer that either (1) the lake was surrounded and sealed by largely cold-based ice (with basal hydrofracture required to initiate lake drainage, and the lake maintained by latent heat from locally sourced meltwater) or (2) an additional heat source sustained a temperate bed immediately downstream of the lake, despite the prevailing climatic and geometric conditions (thereby enabling a drainage initiation process associated with a classical jökulhlaup model48). Although persistent and widespread penetration of surface meltwater could provide this additional heat source, it represents an additional requirement to maintain the necessary basal conditions and does not explain the subsequent switch to upwards-propagating hydrofracture. In contrast, although it is unprecedented within an ice sheet setting, a purely hydrofracture-driven process provides a simpler and theoretically plausible44 mechanism, with analogies to the observed role of a frozen bed in driving floodwater to the surface of the John Evans Glacier in the Canadian Arctic49.

The black solid and dashed curves plot the corresponding temperature boundary conditions at the edge of the lake basin, for H = 300 m and H = 50 m, respectively, which are defined as a parabolic vertical temperature profile to account for the proximity of the subglacial lake.

If correct, the hypothesis of basal and bed-to-surface hydrofracture represents a new type of ice sheet response to extreme hydrological forcing and poses the question as to why a crack initially propagating along the frozen basal interface subsequently deflected upwards to reach the surface. Whereas various stress regimes can drive hydrofracture through an ice column, it is unusual for surface fractures to be displaced from the source of the fracturing itself. For example, increasing tensile stresses induced by the upwards pressure of a filling lake would drive radial fractures above the lake itself. Such a pattern is not observed here. Instead, we propose a conceptual model of hydrofracture driven initially by increasing shear stresses along the ice-bed interface, as the force exerted outwards by the growing subglacial lake was resisted by ice frozen to the bed (Fig. 4). Such a regime has the capacity to drive in-plane (mode II) shear parallel to the bed and notably, under high stresses, to produce an upwards deflection in the angle of crack propagation50. Combined with the observed transition to extensional flow (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 8), which may have further encouraged ice fracturing at this location, this provides a tentative hypothesis as to why hydrofracture may have propagated upwards here. Conversely, the absence of surface fracturing during the 1990 drainage event suggests that the stresses may have been insufficient to propagate fractures in a secondary plane. Testing this conceptual model requires further dedicated observations and modelling to advance our process understanding of this event and, more broadly, the role of hydrofracture within an ice sheet setting.

This conceptual model of bed-to-surface hydrofracture through cold-based ice represents a mechanism that is currently absent from subglacial hydrological models, which have largely been developed using theory and observations relating to a warm basal interface18. Specifically, whereas existing work focuses on the dynamics and impacts of subglacial water flow in regions where there is high confidence that the bed is thawed, here we show that in regions where the bed is predicted to be frozen, or its thermal state remains uncertain, it is possible to subglacially store and rapidly release large volumes of locally sourced surface meltwater. Currently, an estimated 68% of Greenland's bed has either a frozen (40%) or uncertain (28%) basal thermal state30. Furthermore, our observations suggest that in contrast to a classical model of lake drainage through temperate basal ice48, a more destructive process of hydrofracture may occur where the bed is frozen. As demonstrated here, this mechanism can damage the structural integrity of the ice and alter the dynamics of fast-flowing downstream glaciers. As Greenland's climate undergoes future warming, surface melting will intensify and expand inland. Consequently, it is likely that meltwater will increasingly penetrate thin, cold-based ice at the margin and also access new areas of the bed that have previously exhibited a frozen or unknown thermal state. Within this context, our work highlights the need to fully understand the underlying theory of subglacial water flow and fracture mechanics in such systems and to better constrain the distribution and the dynamics of water beneath Greenland in its entirety.

We present evidence of a subglacial flood forcing its way upwards through the Greenland Ice Sheet in a region of predicted cold-based ice. This phenomenon was triggered by the rapid drainage of a subglacial lake, which was fed primarily by locally sourced surface meltwater. After initially flowing along the ice bed, the floodwater propagated upwards through the ice via hydrofracture, breaking through the surface and uprooting large ice blocks. Having flooded across the surface, the water re-entered the subglacial system, driving a substantial perturbation to the dynamics of the Harder Glacier. Such an outburst event is unprecedented in the observational record and demonstrates a high level of complexity and interconnectedness between the basal and surface hydrological systems of an ice sheet. These findings challenge the classical model that meltwater flow is always unidirectional from the ice sheet surface to its base, instead demonstrating that water can travel from the surface to the bed, and back again, over short spatial and temporal scales. Whether this phenomenon reflects an emerging response to increased surface meltwater penetration in regions of cold-based ice remains unclear. As such, our study highlights the need for better process understanding of the drivers and impacts of extreme perturbations to Greenland's hydrological system.

We used repeat measurements of surface elevation derived from timestamped ArcticDEM DSMs and from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) laser altimeter to study the evolution of the Harder subglacial lake. Two-metre-resolution ArcticDEM DSMs34 were generated by the ArcticDEM project, using stereoscopic WorldView and GeoEye satellite imagery51. We co-registered all the ArcticDEM stripfiles in the study area with seasonally aligned (March–May) ICESat-2 ATL06 data52, which was obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center for the period 2019–2020. Points scattered by cloud, blown snow or aerosols, or flagged as low quality, were discarded before analysis. Artefacts in the ArcticDEM stripfiles, together with dynamic surfaces such as the collapse basin, were masked before performing a least-squares planar fit to the residuals to model the vertical offset between the ICESat-2 and ArcticDEM elevations53,54:

Here, x and y are the horizontal coordinates, ∆z is the ArcticDEM–ICESat-2 elevation difference and a, b and c are the coefficients determined from the least-squares fit. We then removed the plane from the z component (elevation) of each DSM. A total of 1,352 ICESat-2 points were used for co-registering the 14 DSMs in the study area. To compute volume changes associated with the drainage of the subglacial lake, we first computed the area of the collapse basin, by differencing the pre-collapse and post-collapse ArcticDEM DSMs from 2014 and 2015, respectively. We then defined the extent of the collapse basin, based upon those pixels where the average elevation change between these dates was greater than the 1σ elevation variability38.

We used daily 2-m temperature, precipitation, melt and run-off from the 1-km downscaled version of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) version 2.3p2 (RACMO2.3p2)55, which combines the dynamical core of the High-Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) and the physics of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts-Integrated Forecast (ECMWF-IFS cycle CY33r1). RACMO2.3p2 is forced by ERA5 reanalyses (1990–2020) and includes a 40-layer snow module that simulates melt, run-off, water percolation, retention and refreezing in firn. Snow layers were initialized using vertical temperature and density profiles from the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research Utrecht-Firn Densification Model. Full details are provided in Noël et al.55,56.

We generated 5,800 maps of ice surface flow velocity between 1988 and 2020 by tracking the displacement of features in satellite optical57,58 (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)59 (Sentinel-1A/B, ENVISAT, RADARSAT-2, ALOS and ERS-1/2) imagery. To assess temporal changes in the Harder Glacier velocity, including anomalies in the 2014 seasonal evolution, we first extracted the average ice flow velocity within a 4 × 4 pixel box ~5 km inland from the terminus of the glacier (at 81.81° N, 45.40° W) for all image pairs and then we extracted weekly averaged time series. Finally, we computed the change in velocity in each calendar week, both before and after the 2014 drainage event, and also the trend in ice velocity over the six calendar weeks following the drainage event using linear regression.

To assess the strain regime in the vicinity of the outburst site, we calculated longitudinal, transverse and shear strain rates60:

where α is the flow angle defined counterclockwise from x axis (positive in the x direction) and \({\dot{\varepsilon }}_{x}\), \({\dot{\varepsilon }}_{y}\) and \({\dot{\varepsilon }}_{{xy}}\) are the components of the strain rate tensor defined according to Nye61:

Here u and v are the two horizontal components of the observed surface flow velocity field. To perform this calculation in practice, we averaged surface flow velocity over the period 2013–2019 to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and lower the uncertainties in ice flow direction compared with a single image-pair calculation60. Measuring any temporal change in the strain regime and also the strain regime at the time of the historical 1990 lake outburst was not possible, due to the precision of the feature tracking methods, the lack of coherence required for interferometry and the limited historical data availability.

To assess the thermal conditions at the ice bed, we solve an energy equation for ice temperature, T(y, z), in the 2D glacier section between the collapse basin edge (y = 0 km) and the fracture zone (y ≈ 1 km), where y is the horizontal distance from the basin edge and z is height within the ice column:

Our model assumes steady state (∂T / ∂t = 0) as it is designed to simulate the long-term conditions before outburst and accounts for advective and conductive heat transport, together with viscous dissipation. In this model, η is the ice viscosity, \(\tau\) is the effective stress and v and w approximate the velocity field. The parameters κ, ρi and cp represent known ice properties, and we impose the surface temperature in 2014 as a boundary condition. The material constants used are the thermal diffusivity κ (36.1 m2 yr−1), density ρi (916 kg m−3) and specific heat capacity cp (2 × 103 J kg−1 K−1) of ice. Given that ice velocity increases from ~ 0 m yr−1 at the basin edge to about 20 m yr−1 several kilometres downstream, both downward advection of cold ice and viscous dissipation are possible, and so our model accounts for both processes. Specifically, the flow configuration resembles flank flow off an ice divide, and so we specify the velocity field v ≈ v(y) = \(y{\dot{\varepsilon }}_{{yy}}\) and w ≈ w(z) = \(\mbox{-}z{\dot{\varepsilon }}_{{yy}}\) (which satisfies the continuity equation under plane flow) to capture the thermal advection to leading order. For the horizontal strain rate, we assume \({\dot{\varepsilon }}_{{yy}}=0.0035\) yr−1, which equates to the mean surface value over the first 1.5 km, as determined from our velocity observations. In the dissipation term of the model, the ice viscosity \(\eta={[2\,A({T})\,{{\tau}^{n-1}}]}^{-1}\) is evaluated using Glen's law exponent n = 3 and published62 values of the temperature-dependent factor A. The effective stress \(\tau\) is calculated by Newton–Raphson iteration via \({\tau}^{2}={{\tau}_{yy}}^{2}+{{\tau_{yz}}^2}\) = (\({\dot{\varepsilon }}_{{yy}}/A{\tau }^{n-1}\))2 + (ρi g(H – z)sin αs)2, where sin αs = 0.02 is the ice surface slope and g = 9.81 m s−2 is gravitational acceleration.

Regarding the model boundary conditions, we specify T to be the surface temperature at z = H, ∂T / ∂y = 0 at y = 2 km and the geothermal heat flux condition −ki∂T/∂z = G at z = 0, where ki = 2.1 W m−1 K−1 is the ice thermal conductivity and G is geothermal heat flux. The latter condition presumes a cold base with no sliding, which is consistent with our simulations that show Tb to be below the melting point. At the upstream boundary, y = 0, no information about the temperature in the ice column is available. In this regard, it is important to note that y = 0 locates the collapse basin edge and not necessarily the potentially dynamic margin of the subglacial lake; with lake water probably located at y < 0 while the lake was growing. As a conservative measure, we therefore account for the potential presence of relatively warm ice at the interface with the subglacial lake (which could serve as an additional source of heat to the downstream ice), by prescribing a parabolic temperature profile T(0, z) that decreases from the melting point at the bed to Ts at the surface. This boundary condition represents a stringent test for the existence of a cold bed further downstream because it prescribes the ice to be near the melting temperature for a considerable section of deep ice at the boundary (that is, it favours overestimation of Tb). Internal model consistency is also established for alternative (less stringent) simulations where we replaced this boundary condition with ∂T / ∂y = 0 at y = 0 (based on the symmetry of an ice divide), which resulted in predicted Tb values that were uniformly more negative than those reported here.

Our simulations require knowledge of the ice thickness H and geothermal heat flux G at the study site, both of which are uncertain. Notably, H in the region of interest (within 1–2 km downstream of the collapse basin) has not been surveyed by in situ or geophysical methods. Although the proximity of a nunatak and bedrock to the northwest may suggest relatively thin ice, direct observational evidence is lacking. The ice thickness from BedMachine lies in the approximate range 30–50 m, with a nominal uncertainty of ~ ± 20 m. However, this uncertainty is itself uncertain, given the thickness is derived from bed topography interpolated by kriging from the nearby ice margin and the bed beneath the southern branch of Harder Glacier. G is also poorly constrained. A recent map of basal melt rates63 indicates G < 0.05 W m−2 for the catchments near Victoria Fjord, but our region lies just beyond the edge of its gridded data. Given these uncertainties, we perform multiple simulations across the parameter space 25 ≤ H ≤ 500 m and 0.01 ≤ G ≤ 0.1 W m−2 (bearing in mind that low H and low G in these ranges are most probable), to ensure the robustness of our conclusion of a frozen bed interface. For all simulations, we solve the energy equation by adding a relaxation time derivative to its left-hand side and evolving the temperature field to steady state, with Ts fixed at −13.2 °C (the mean surface temperature of the recent decade) and ignoring sub-annual temperature variations. This approach ensures conservative results, because accounting for (1) the reduction in heat retained in the ice column due to latent heat loss associated with any surface meltwater production during summer and (2) historically colder conditions (–14.6 °C in the 1960s) alongside contemporary glacier thinning (~13 m since 1990) within a time-dependent model would result in a colder ice column and, consequently, reduced Tb. Finally, we test whether initially warm-based conditions beneath the surface outburst site could be self-sustainable under high geothermal flux supplemented by the heat released from basal sliding, by using a one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction model:

where Hmin is the minimum thickness for sustaining a warm base. The final term in the equation describes the heat dissipation from sliding. Because of its inclusion, this model directs the heat sources maximally to the basal interface; the model also ignores downward advective cooling and latent heat loss to basal melting, so it severely underestimates Hmin to give a conservative test. Setting Ts = –13.2 °C (the higher of the decadal mean surface temperatures corresponding to the 1990 and 2014 drainage years), G = 0.1 W m−2 and vs = 10 m yr−1 yields Hmin = 243 m, which rules out a warm base between the lake and the 2014 outburst site unless the ice is much thicker than expected.

To investigate whether the conditions required to force water from the subglacial lake to the surface at the fracture zone were met, we assessed whether the lake hydraulic potential exceeded the hydraulic potential at the fracture site. If zL and zR denote the ice surface elevation above the lake (pre-outburst) and at the fracture zone, respectively, and HL is the ice thickness above the lake, then this entails that ρi gHL + ρwg(zL – HL) > ρwgzR, where ρw = 1,000 kg m−3 is the density of water. Hence:

where zL ≈ 690 m and zR ≈ 655 m based upon the ArcticDEM surface elevation model. Equation (8) therefore constrains HL to be less than 420 m. As the ice above the lake is probably thinner than this value, it is probable that this condition is met, in which case water from the lake can be forced to the surface at the fracture zone.

We modelled the surface and basal meltwater fluxes over both the subglacial lake's and the Harder Glacier's surface and basal upstream catchments, using estimates of (1) surface melt from the 1-km downscaled version of the RACMO2.3p2 (ref. 55) and (2) basal melt due to geothermal heat flux, frictional heating and the heat released by surface meltwater reaching the bed63. This analysis was designed to assess (1) the sources of water feeding the lake (via an assessment of the meltwater generated across the lake's upstream catchment) and (2) the extent to which the drainage overloaded the Harder Glacier's subglacial system (via an assessment of the melt generated over the entire Harder Glacier catchment itself). The derived run-off estimates represent an upper bound on the water available because they assume that (1) all surface water was routed to the bed (that is, no water is stored on top or within the ice) and (2) no refreezing occurred at the ice base. Where surface storage or basal refreezing does occur, this will reduce the background volume of water flowing through the subglacial system and hence the relative size of the perturbation caused by the lake drainage would have been even higher.

The routing of subglacial water was modelled using the Shreve hydraulic equation64:

where \(\varnothing\) is the hydropotential, \({\rho }_\mathrm{w}\) and \({\rho }_\mathrm{i}\) are the densities of water and ice, respectively (1,000 and 916 kg m−3), \({z}_\mathrm{b}\) and H are the bed elevation and ice thickness46 and k is a ‘flotation factor'. We do not estimate routing at the time of the 1990 lake drainage because the spatially resolved ice thickness downstream of the lake site remains uncertain at that time. The flotation factor is the ratio between the subglacial water pressure and the ice overburden pressure, where k > 1.0 suggests the subglacial water pressure exceeds overburden and \(k < 1.0\) suggests that subglacial water pressure is less than overburden. Because subglacial water pressure is unknown, we compute downstream routing pathways for the subglacial flood using a range of plausible k values (0.8, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1) to account for this uncertainty65. Specifically, we calculate the hydropotential using equation (9), remove sinks, determine the number of upstream cells contributing to each cell (to identify flow paths) and retain all cells which are connected to more than 100 cells upstream (to remove small tributaries). For all four values of k, our analysis indicates that subglacial water flow from the subglacial lake basin is routed to the northern lobe of the Harder Glacier. To delineate the upstream catchments used to compute the surface and basal meltwater fluxes, the ArcticDEM 100-m mosaic34 was used to define the surface catchments, and the subglacial catchments were estimated by calculating the hydropotential (equation (9)) using the surface and bed topography from BedMachine v346, assuming that the subglacial water was at overburden pressure, and then delineating the resulting drainage basin by following the steepest gradients in the hydropotential.

Ice thickness change between the 1990 and 2014 drainage events was computed in the vicinity of the lake site, based upon ICESat (2003–2009) and CryoSat-2 (2010–2020) observations, together with RACMO2.3p2 (ref. 55) simulations (1990–2020). CryoSat-2 Baseline-D Level-2I Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric (SARIn) altimeter observations were used to compute height evolution time series at 60-day epochs between October 2010 and October 2020, using a model fit method66,67, which was applied on a 5 × 5 km grid. This processing included a backscatter correction68 and filtering using the following statistical thresholds: a minimum of 70 data points, a minimum time series length of 2 years, a maximum root mean square difference of 12 m, a maximum elevation rate magnitude of 10 m yr−1 and a maximum surface slope of 5°. We then computed time series of height evolution by averaging the gridded elevation anomalies within 60-day intervals for the northern sector of the ice sheet where the subglacial lake is located (specifically, between elevations of 500 and 800 m above sea level, according to ArcticDEM69). ICESat laser altimeter measurements were used to compute elevation changes between 2003 and 2009. We used release 34 of the GLAS/ICESat Level-2 GLAH12 product70 processed with a plane-fitting method71 to obtain estimates of the temporal evolution of the ice surface. These data were pre-processed to remove the intercampaign bias72 and the saturation biases provided in GLAH12. RACMO2.3p2 simulations were used to compute 1990–2020 height change as a result of surface mass balance processes.

To estimate the volume of water stored in the supraglacial lake adjacent to the subglacial lake immediately before the 2014 subglacial lake drainage, we manually delineated the lake boundary to determine its extent, using a Landsat-8 scene acquired on 22 July 2014. We then estimated lake depth using a radiative transfer approach73, applied to the green band, which is expected to provide an upper bound on the lake volume74:

Here z is the lake depth, Ad is the underlying lake bed reflectance, R∞ is the reflectance from optically deep water, Rw is the reflectance measured by the satellite and g is the coefficient for spectral radiance loss in the water column. To estimate Ad, we used the mean reflectance values from the lake bed, using an image acquired on 1 August 2014 immediately after the lake had drained. R∞ was assumed to be 0, which represents a conservative lower bound, and g was estimated as 2kd, where kd is the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling light75,76. Finally, to compute lake volume, depth estimates were integrated spatially over the lake area.

Terminus positions of the Harder Glacier were manually digitized from all Landsat and Sentinel-2 optical imagery acquired between 1988 and 2020, using the Google Earth Digitization Tool77. Images obscured by cloud, or where ice mélange made it difficult to identify the calving front, were excluded. Changes in the calving front location were estimated using the centreline method in the Margin change Quantification Tool77.

A University of Florida research team has developed a more accurate way to count wildlife using drones -- an innovation that helped confirm the world's largest known nesting site for a threatened turtle species.

By combining aerial imagery with statistical modeling, the researchers documented more than 41,000 Giant South American River Turtles gathered along the Amazon's Guaporé River. Their findings, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, offer a new tool for conservationists seeking to monitor vulnerable animal populations with greater precision.

"We describe a novel way to more efficiently monitor animal populations," said lead study author Ismael Brack, a post-doctoral researcher within the UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences' (UF/IFAS) School of Forest, Fisheries and Geomatics Sciences. "And although the method is used to count turtles, it could also be applied to other species."

The project began with Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) researchers in Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia. One of the species the New York-based organization monitors is the Giant South American River Turtle, which is threatened by poachers who sell its meat and eggs. The turtles are exceptionally social creatures, and females congregate each year in July or August to nest in the Guaporé River sandbanks between Brazil and Bolivia.

Brack met WCS scientists at a conference, and they shared how they use drones to count the turtles, he said. They create orthomosaics, which are highly detailed, high-resolution composite images made by stitching together hundreds of overlapping aerial photographs.

Counting the animals shown in orthomosaics is a quicker, more accurate and less-invasive approach than counting animals from the ground. The method alone, however, doesn't account for the fact that animals sometimes move during observation.

Together, researchers from UF and the WCS developed a method that improves counting accuracy by eliminating multiple sources of error, including double counts (the same individual counted multiple times) and missed individuals.

Researchers used white paint to mark the shells of 1,187 turtles gathering on an island sandbank within the Guaporé River, according to the study. Over 12 days, a drone flew overhead on a meticulous, back-and-forth path four times a day and snapped 1,500 photos each time. Using software, scientists stitched the photos together, and researchers reviewed the composite images.

They recorded each turtle, if its shell was marked and whether the animal was nesting or walking when photographed. Equipped with this data, they developed probability models that account for individuals entering and leaving the area, observed turtle behaviors and the likelihood of detecting an identifiable shell mark.

The models revealed several potential sources of error that could arise from traditional orthomosaic-based counts, according to the study. Only 35% of the turtles that used the sandbank, for example, were present during drone flights. And, on average, 20% of the those detected walking appeared multiple times in orthomosaics -- some as many as seven times.

Observers on the ground counted about 16,000 turtles, according to the study. Researchers who reviewed the orthomosaics but didn't account for animal movement or shell markings counted about 79,000 turtles. When they applied their models, however, they estimated about 41,000 turtles.

"These numbers vary greatly, and that's a problem for conservationists," Brack said. "If scientists are unable to establish an accurate count of individuals of a species, how will they know if the population is in decline or whether efforts to protect it are successful?"

The study describes ways to adapt and apply the approach to conservation efforts involving other species surveyed by drone-derived orthomosaics. Past monitoring studies, for example, have involved clipping seals' fur, attaching high-visibility collars to elk and marking mountain goats with paintball pellets to keep track of animal movement during counts.

The research team plans to perfect monitoring methods by conducting additional drone flights at the Guaporé River nesting site and in other South American countries where the Giant South American River Turtle gathers, including in Colombia and possibly Peru and Venezuela, Brack said.

"By combining information from multiple surveys, we can detect population trends, and the Wildlife Conservation Society will know where to invest in conservation actions," he said.

Tsunami warnings were issued around the Pacific Ocean after a magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula in the late morning local time on July 30. Waves 5.7 feet above normal reached Hawaii, flooding parking lots and streets, and wave heights reached up to eight feet in parts of California, the Guardian reported.

The U.S. Tsunami Warning System has transitioned coastal areas from Hawaii to Alaska to the mainland Pacific Coast to a Tsunami Advisory, which means that “a tsunami with the potential to generate strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is imminent, expected, or occurring” but that significant inundation is not expected. Under this advisory, people should stay out of the water and away from beaches and coastal waterways. Officials have cautioned that the first waves to arrive may not be the largest, however, and that there is still risk over the next 24 hours. Surge of some three to 10 feet could still hit areas, including the coast of South America.

This earthquake may be the eighth largest on record globally, wrote seismologist Alice-Agnes Gabriel of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, on Bluesky. It is likely the largest since the 2011 earthquake off the coast of Japan, which triggered a devastating tsunami that killed thousands and caused the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The magnitude was upgraded from 8.7; a magnitude 8.8 earthquake releases about 40 percent more energy than a magnitude 8.7 one.

Evacuations were initially ordered in Japan and Hawaii after the July 30 earthquake. The first waves had begun to hit Japan around 10 A.M. local time, several hours after the earthquake.

The earthquake happened in a subduction zone at the Kuril-Kamchatka Arc, where the Pacific plate is being subducted under the Okhotsk plate. The epicenter is located 45 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of where a magnitude 9.0 temblor struck in 1952 and caused “a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami,” according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

A magnitude 7.4 earthquake that struck in the same region on July 20, 2025, was a foreshock to this July 30 quake, the USGS says.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture says it'll launch crypto billionaire Justin Sun on a suborbital space trip on Sunday, four years after he put in a precedent-setting $28 million bid for a ticket.

Sun and five other people will be participating in Blue Origin's NS-34 mission, which will be the company's 14th crewed spaceflight. The launch window at Blue Origin's Launch Site One in West Texas opens at 7:30 a.m. CT (5:30 a.m. PT) Sunday, and BlueOrigin.com will stream coverage of the countdown starting at T-minus-30 minutes, the company said today.

In a posting to the X social-media platform, Sun said he was “proud to join Blue Origin's NS-34 mission and continue encouraging youth to pursue their dreams in science and space.” And in a follow-up posting, Sun claimed the title of “the youngest Chinese commercial astronaut.”

It's been a long and not-always-smooth road to space for Sun, the 35-year-old founder of the Tron blockchain venture.

Until recently, Sun was the subject of a federal investigation over alleged market manipulation and unregistered sales of crypto asset securities. That case was put on hold in February, and a couple of months later, Sun earned a place of prominence at a crypto dinner with President Donald Trump by purchasing the biggest share of the $TRUMP meme coin.

It's not clear what impact Sun's travails have had on the timing of his spaceflight. Back in 2021, Sun was the winning bidder in an auction for a seat on Blue Origin's first crewed flight, which was set for later that year. However, Blue Origin said soon afterward that the winner — who at that time was anonymous — had to pass up the first flight due to scheduling conflicts.

When Sun was revealed as the winning bidder in late 2021, Blue Origin said that he'd fly in late 2022. At the time, Sun said he would bring along five hand-picked “space warriors” for a mission he called “Sea of Stars,” but that part of the plan apparently went by the wayside (along with the timeline that Sun originally had in mind).

Sun's five crewmates for NS-34 reflect varied backgrounds. Here's the list:

If all goes according to plan, Blue Origin's autonomously controlled New Shepard rocket ship will send the NS-34 crew members on what's expected to be a 10-minute-long suborbital space odyssey. They'll experience a few minutes of zero gravity and get an astronaut's-eye view of Earth beneath the black sky of space. At the end of the ride, they'll make a parachute-assisted touchdown not far from their launch pad.

Blue Origin doesn't typically reveal how much its customers are paying for their flights. Sun's case is the rare exception, due to the fact that the 2021 auction was conducted publicly. Blue Origin said the $28 million from Sun's bid went to its nonprofit foundation, the Club for the Future. The foundation, in turn, selected 19 space-focused nonprofits to receive grants amounting to $1 million each.

Sun isn't the only controversial crypto figure to take a trip on New Shepard. In February, Blue Origin withheld the identity of one of its spacefliers on the NS-30 mission. An analysis of photos and references to the flier in public records, including the Federal Aviation Administration's list of spaceflight participants, suggested that the mystery man was an Australian crypto entrepreneur named Russell Wilson (not to be confused with the former Seahawks quarterback).

In response to emailed inquiries, a Blue Origin representative told GeekWire that the company works with a third party to accept crypto payments for spaceflights.

This report was originally published on July 21 and has been updated to reflect Blue Origin's announcement of the NS-34 launch date.

Google's newest AI model is going to scour the Earth and, ideally, help it out. That's the plan, anyway. The mission is to find out once and for all, in fine detail, what we are doing to our planet. Crucially, once the model has supposedly done this it will also, apparently, explain where we might be able to best put things in place to help our world.

AlphaEarth Foundations, an offshoot of Google's DeepMind AI model, aims to leverage machine learning and all the gobs and gobs of data that Google has absorbed about our planet over the last two decades, in order to understand how specific areas are changing over time.

The model uses a system called “embeddings” that takes terabytes of data collected from satellites every day, analyzes it, and compresses it down to save storage space. The result is a model of different filters overlaid over maps that are color coded to indicate material properties, vegetation types, groundwater sources, and human constructions such as buildings and farms. Google says the system will act as a sort of “virtual satellite,” letting users call up on demand detailed information about any given spot on the planet.

The goal, Google says, is for users of the service to be able to better understand how specific ecosystems on the planet work, including how air quality, sunlight, groundwater, and even human construction projects vary and change across a landscape. Ultimately, the company wants the model to help answer questions from paying governments and corporations that wish to know, for example, which ecosystems may have more access to sunlight or groundwater that can help determine the best spots to grow a certain crop. Alternatively, it may aid in identifying areas to plop down solar panels with maximum payoff, or build structures in more climate resilient locations.

Google's new model has already mapped a complex surface in Antarctica—an area notoriously difficult to capture due to irregular satellite imaging—in clear detail. It has also supposedly outlined variations in Canadian agricultural land use that are invisible to the naked eye.

Google's new model assigns colors to AlphaEarth Foundations' embedding fields. In Ecuador, the model sees through persistent cloud cover to detail agricultural plots in various stages of development.

Chris Brown, a research engineer at Google DeepMind, says that historically, there have been two main problems for making reliable information about the planet more accessible: Getting overloaded with too much data; and that information being inconsistent. “Before, the challenge was getting a look at it all,” Brown said in a press briefing. “Now, the challenge is to unify all the ways that we have to observe and model our planet and get a complete picture.”

Google, of course, has been at this for a while. While AlphaEarth isn't a broader consumer-facing application, Google Earth has had its own similar timelapse feature since 2021 that shows how global geography has changed over decades—largely due to climate change. Google has also gotten into the game of putting more specific types of satellites into orbit, such as ones that are designed to spot wildfires from space.

The models aren't perfect. Google, in its frenzied push to build robust AI models, has hit a few snags with the accuracy of its AI generations, mostly when its AI overviews in Search have gone off the rails. But sucking up petabytes of satellite images and finding the trends is, weirdly, a more straightforward task for AI.

Google says the models can generate accurate enough data about an ecosystem down to an area of 10 meters—and while it may get some things wrong, it is apparently 23.9 percent more accurate than similar AI models. (Goggle didn't name which ones it was talking about, but companies such as Privateer have been at this for years.)

How AlphaEarth Foundations works: by taking non-uniformly sampled frames from a video sequence to index any position in time, the model creates a continuous view of the location while outlining measurements.

Google has worked with partners to test the new system, such as MayBiomas in Brazil and the Global Ecosystems Atlas, which aim to better classify undermapped ecosystems including dense rainforests, deserts, and wetlands.

“It's very difficult to compress all the information available for a piece of land in a traditional way, which is spent literally hours and hours and hours of preparing,” said Tasso Azeved, founder of MayBiomas. After working with Google to test AlphaEarth for the past 18 months or so, Azeved says the software has made it easier to analyze great swathes of rainforest yet keep that data from overwhelming their storage capabilities. “We were not even scratching everything that would be possible,” Azeved says.

AlphaEarth is also being added in a more limited capacity into Google Earth Engine, the cloud-based platform that first launched in 2010 and is used for mapping by agencies and companies such as NASA, Unilever, and the Forest Service. It's worth noting here that this is separate from the more consumer-friendly Google Earth.

Previously, Google's Earth Engine processes and analyzes satellite data that has then been used to create interactive, high-resolution maps of deforestation across the world and compile detailed views of bodies of water—rivers, lakes, oceans, and seas—and how these had changed over time. Now, annual snapshots of AlphaEarth's embeddings will be available as a dataset to track long-term trends, which a company rep says can be used to do more advanced custom mapping if users have a “light coding background.”

No stranger to privacy concerns, Google is eager to wave off any worries people might have about this new system scouring pictures from the sky. The company says the AlphaEarth dataset cannot capture individual objects, people, or faces.

Trade organizations across the games industry and gamers are speaking out against censorship campaigns taking place across Steam and Itch.io in an effort to help developers who have been unfairly impacted. The push against adult content is being driven by Australian conservative group Collective Shout, whose pressuring of payment processors has forced platforms to mass deindex NSFW content. In the wake of these delistings, which remove games from search, developers are scrambling to understand if their games have been impacted and why.

On platforms like Bluesky, users are compiling lists of “censored artists” with NSFW pieces and unsearchable Itch pages, whether it's games or comics, many of whom identify their work as LGBTQ+ or kink friendly. WIRED was able to find several of these pages via Google, all of which were tagged by their creators in that document as LGBT and NSFW, but not with Itch's search tools.

According to the International Game Developers Association, a nonprofit that supports game developers, this kind of censorship disproportionately affects developers who are queer, trans and people of color, on top affecting a creator's income and reputation.

“The right to make mature games with legal adult content is a creative right, just like the right to tell stories about war, death, or love.”

In a statement given to WIRED, executive director Jakin Vela says that the IGDA is “seriously alarmed” by the delistings and payment disruptions of adult-themed games on Steam and Itch. “Globally and politically, we are at a crossroads for developer rights, creative freedom, and platform accountability,” he says. “The right to make mature games with legal adult content is a creative right, just like the right to tell stories about war, death, or love.”

Over the past few months, Collective Shout has been campaigning to get “rape and incest” games removed from online platforms. The group began applying pressure to payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard; Valve removed hundreds titles, some of which included incest.

Other developers, however, such as the creators of horror game Vile: Exhumed, say their games did not violate these standards. “Vile: Exhumed was not banned for its use of gore in storytelling, or violent themes,” wrote developer Cara Cadaver in an update. “It was banned for ‘sexual content with depictions of real people,' which, if you played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse. I refuse to censor or make changes to the game, I will not retell a story about these topics in a way to make people who don't understand feel more comfortable.” Valve did not respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Itch has deindexed all adult NSFW content. According to GameFile, that applies to over 20,000 games. “Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform,” founder Leaf Corcoran wrote at the time. “To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.”

In an email to WIRED, Corcoran said the company needed to finish conversations with payment processors “to understand where they stand so that we can make the right decisions going forward. We have been making good progress this week so hopefully we'll have some updates to publish soon”.

The company has suspended its Stripe payments on 18+ content “for the foreseeable future” and is “actively reaching out to other payment processors that are more willing to work with this kind of content.”

Reached for comment, Stripe spokesperson Casey Becker said that the company does not comment on users. “Generally speaking, we take action when we conclude that users violate our terms of service,” Becker says. “We do not support adult content." The company has a longstanding policy of not working with adult content services.

In a previous statement to WIRED, Collective Shout campaigns manager Caitlin Roper said the organization had had “no communication with payment processors” outside of an open letter. In a blog posted July 28, however, Collective Shout says it “approached payment processors because Steam did not respond to us.” Corcoran told WIRED that Collective Shout had not spoken to Itch.

According to experts, this is a powerful tactic known as financial censorship that weaponizes financial institutions' aversion to anything controversial. It essentially sidesteps a platform's own rules for what it will allow and puts that decision directly in the hands of payment processors, which impacts what companies are allowed to sell.

“Platforms have long had terms of service restricting content such as non-consensual acts, rape, incest, and material that violates payment processor guidelines,” says Vela. “The concern today is not the existence of these rules, but rather that their enforcement is adversely impacting games that do not actually violate these restrictions, often without warning or explanation.”

In response to one developer on Bluesky, Corcoran said the team is considering “adding an update to the dashboard to more explicitly show indexing status when the dust settles.”

Corcoran told WIRED that he believes the confusion stems from Itch not providing clear information on users' dashboard about indexing eligibility of pages. “A handful of devs incorrectly assumed their pages were affected by our July 24th change and posted statements on social media,” he said. “Press publications picked up these posts without any further verification which led to an incorrect narrative being spread further.” Corcoran said that pages that were incorrectly assumed delisted were “due to our existing indexing eligibility rules outlined in our indexing guide, related to missing requirements like files uploaded, cover images, or in a few cases a ‘first time seller' review process.”

The German games industry association, game, has called developers' artistic freedom “fundamental to games as a cultural medium.” Managing director Felix Falk said in a statement that restrictions from payment service providers and gaming platforms should not override what's legally allowed, and that service providers like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal's terms and conditions should not conflict with free expression. “Creative forms of expression or certain themes as games, such as diversity, must not be targeted by individual interests or campaigns from particularly vocal groups, as is currently being observed on Steam or Itch.io,” Falk said.

The Entertainment Software Association, which represents the game industry in the US, declined to comment. The UK's trade organization for games and interactive entertainment, Ukie, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In response to the Collective Shout's campaign and the subsequent fallout, the IGDA is gathering information from affected developers, which it says will guide its future actions. “Games that feature consensual adult content, including queer, kink-positive, or romantic narratives, are easily targeted under vague or overly cautious enforcement, often forcing developers into silence or self-censorship because platforms fear perceived risks associated with hosting legal adult content,” says Vela.

The IGDA is advocating for concerned parties to contact financial institutions like Mastercard and Visa directly, as well as support online petitions that ask these companies to stop interfering with entertainment and sex work. “Mastercard and Visa have increasingly used their financial control to pressure platforms into censoring legal fictional content,” reads the campaign for a Change.org petition with over 185,000 signatures. “Entire genres of books, games, films, and artwork are being demonetized or deplatformed—not because they're illegal, but because they offend the personal values of executives or activist groups”

Mastercard and Visa did not respond to requests for comment.

Since the delistings, gamers have been organizing on Bluesky, X, and Reddit, encouraging people to call companies like Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe to protest. One artist who makes adult content, who asked to remain unnamed out of fear of their financial accounts being affected, tells WIRED that they were “hung up on twice by Visa” on Tuesday. “The first time I was left on hold for about 10 minutes only to have the call suddenly disconnect. The second time I was told by a clearly frustrated rep that he would not connect me to a supervisor, and that Visa is no longer answering questions about policy.”

The artist says that while they're approaching these calls as a consumer, because they sell comics on Itch, they're also directly impacted by the new policies. “My audience, my friends, and my colleagues are all LGBTQ+, and are being overwhelmingly affected by this kind of censorship, where merely existing as a queer person is seen as inherently pornographic and fetishistic,” they say. “I also want to stress that all of us are working and creating art well within the bounds of the law."

The artist describes Collective Shout and Morality in Media as “puritanical groups using the very real and legitimate fears of child exploitation to push through their right-wing policies.”

In the adult entertainment industry, platforms have faced similar pressures involving anti-porn groups claiming to fight sexual exploitation by using payment processors to get content banned. Visa and Mastercard previously cut off payments to Pornhub; OnlyFans briefly banned, and then reversed a stance on sexually explicit content due to bank influence. Just this week, new child online safety laws in the UK kicked in that now require millions of adults to submit to ID document uploads, face scans, credit card checks, and more to access pornography; similar age-verification laws have been implemented in over 20 states. Critics say although these measures are aimed at protecting kids, they open the door for a mountain of privacy and surveillance problems.

On its website, Itch has added an additional FAQ to address complaints, including addressing the difference between Itch and Valve's responses. Because Itch is not a closed platform like Steam, the post reads, it has minimal barriers to platform users publishing content. “We could not rely on user-provided tagging to be accurate enough for a targeted approach, so a broader review was necessary to be thorough” the post reads. “…If we lose our ability to accept payments from a partner like PayPal or Stripe, we impact the ability of all creators to do business. Losing PayPal, for instance, would prevent us from sending payouts to many people.”

The company says it is still waiting for final determinations from its payment processors. “Itch.io can definitely have more transparency here,” says Corcoran, “and we're sorry for the stress we caused to any developers who were caught up in the confusion.”

Update: 7/30/2025, 3:39 PM EDT: WIRED has updated the article with a comment from Itch.io

Intelligence goes super, then personal.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Mark Zuckerberg has spent the better part of a decade chasing new computing frontiers, from VR to the metaverse. But today, the Meta CEO staked his next big bet on what he calls “personal superintelligence.” Unlike past efforts, this one isn't just about virtual spaces or avatars: It's about building AI that feels like an extension of yourself, and it's going to require some of the most powerful hardware stacks on the planet.

In an open letter published just hours before Meta's Q2 2025 earnings call, Zuckerberg laid out his AI vision in deliberately human-centric terms. “This is not about automating all valuable work,” he wrote. “It's about empowering individuals with intelligence tailored to their lives.”

That's a subtle jab at OpenAI's and Google's increasingly centralized AI strategies — ones that push AGI as a force of mass replacement rather than augmentation. But make no mistake: despite the philosophical packaging, Zuckerberg's latest pivot is as much about compute as it is about ideology.



In the past few months alone, Meta has funneled billions into AI R&D, recruiting top talent from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The new Meta Superintelligence Labs — headed by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang — will reportedly be responsible for developing foundation models such as Llama, alongside deeper research into AI architecture and inference. Of course, running those models at scale requires more than talent: it demands infrastructure. Lots of it.Sources close to Meta's datacenter expansion say the company is already deploying custom accelerators in limited workloads alongside traditional NVIDIA H100s and A100s. Meanwhile, there's speculation that Meta may be co-developing AI silicon in-house for future iterations of its Llama-based models, echoing Google's TPU strategy. At the very least, Meta has ramped up its own MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) program, with next-gen silicon rumored to be taped out later this year.Whether these chips will directly power "personal superintelligence" experiences remains unclear. But if Meta plans to deliver real-time, private AI companions at the edge or in VR devices, rather than purely cloud-delivered interactions, the hardware stack will need to be both extremely fast and extremely efficient.



This isn't Zuckerberg's first grand vision, by far. Back in 2021, he published a similar letter pitching the metaverse as the next evolution of social computing. Since then, Meta's Reality Labs division has racked up over $60 billion in losses, much of it spent on hardware such as Quest headsets, haptic gloves, and AR displays that are still struggling to gain traction. These are numbers that make Intel's gloomy present and future look acceptable in comparison.That said, unlike the metaverse, AI has immediate product-market fit. LLMs and chatbots are already reshaping productivity, education, and entertainment as we speak. The only constraint now is how fast the hardware can scale — and whether Meta can compete with Nvidia, AMD, and custom players such as Tenstorrent or Cerebras, in pushing the performance-per-watt frontier.Zuckerberg's tone was optimistic, but measured. “The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take,” he wrote. The subtext is that Meta doesn't want to be just another tenant in the AI data center. It wants to build the foundation itself, both in terms of algorithms and the hardware that runs them.For now, the personal superintelligence he promises may still be a philosophical idea. But behind the scenes, it's quickly becoming a material one — with all the heat, silicon, and supply chain pressure that comes with it.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon's infrastructure investments and cloud business will go under the microscope Thursday when the company reports second-quarter financial results — with Wall Street looking for signs that the tech giant's big bet on artificial intelligence is translating into growth.

The company disappointed investors in May with a softer-than-expected forecast for Q2 operating profits, but analysts are more optimistic heading into the earnings report. 

Wedbush analysts cited “encouraging US retail data, healthy advertiser sentiment, strong AWS demand, and continued efficiency gains across the business that should drive upside to margin expectations,” in a July 30 research report previewing Amazon's earnings. 

Here are the latest Wall Street estimates, according to Yahoo Finance:

Analysts' projections would put Amazon near the midpoint of its prior revenue forecast and toward the high end of its projected operating income range.

One reason for the optimism: The tariff outlook has improved since last quarter, contributing to a more bullish tone from analysts. For example, Morgan Stanley raised its 2026 earnings estimate for Amazon from $7.35 to $8.00, citing a “more manageable” trade environment.

Amazon still generates the largest portion of its net sales from online stores, which accounted for about $57 billion or 37% of total net sales in the first quarter of this year. 

The annual Prime Day sales event took place after the quarter ended, from July 8-11, so the results won't be included in the numbers, but Amazon executives are likely to provide a few additional details potentially indicating how the results will impact third-quarter earnings.

The company makes most of its operating profits from Amazon Web Services — about $11.5 billion in the first quarter, or 63% of Amazon's total operating profits of $18.4 billion.

AWS revenue rose 16.9% to $29.3 billion in Q1, taking the cloud unit's annual revenue run rate to a record $117 billion. 

The growth “speaks to the durability of the business even through GPU-related supply constraints that are expected to ease in 2H,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, referring to shortages in the key chips for training and running AI models.

Like other tech giants, Amazon is spending big to build out infrastructure for AI and cloud services. Morgan Stanley raised its 2025 and 2026 Amazon capital expense forecasts to $111 billion and $134 billion, respectively — up 6–7% from prior estimates — with the majority going toward technology and infrastructure. 

Other areas to watch: Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite internet venture, its partnership and investment in AI startup Anthropic, and whether the company signals further increases in capital spending as it races to build out infrastructure for the next phase of generative AI.

What is the future of cars? For one thing, after substantial government support and poaching of top Western talent, China's car industry is about to dominate globally with charging rates, ranges, luxury design, technology, and sheer volumes. Moreover, it's no longer content with serving its own enormous market as Chinese brands make serious inroads across Australia and Europe.

In May, it was reported that, for the first time, Chinese automaker BYD sold more cars in Europe than Tesla in the previous month. Meanwhile in the US, the affordable car is about to go extinct. With President Donald Trump's back-and-forth tariffs, it may well be time to say goodbye to the sub-$30,000 car.

WIRED senior editor and auto obsessive Jeremy White hosted a Reddit AMA earlier this month to directly answer your questions about the future of cars and EVs as the global market dramatically shifts. Here's what you need to know.

Questions and responses have been edited for clarity.

Musk's horrific journey into politics aside, do you think Tesla has a future, with pressure from BYD and its failure to develop a cheaper model, among other challenges?

Yes, I do think Tesla has a future—it was only last year that they lost the top slot of the biggest-selling car in the world (to Toyota). So let's keep in mind that Tesla still sells a lot of cars. That said, Tesla has an aging fleet, it has a CEO with his attention diverted very much elsewhere, and, most of all, right now it has a brand and reputation problem. Musk's DOGE antics have directly hit the company—even their finance chief Vaibhav Taneja was forced to admit so on its April earnings call, saying “unwarranted hostility towards our brand and our people had an impact in certain markets.”

And the Cybertruck has been an unmitigated disaster.

Tesla desperately needs a win. It needs a new cheap electric car, and no amount of dressing up the Model Y in new clothes is going to cut it. It also needs to look at its autonomous tech, because Chinese brands all favoring Lidar are beating it there too.

Let's face it, the Chinese brands have learned a great deal from Tesla and are now coming for Elon's lunch—and, right now, Tesla is not really in a position to compete. How long can this go on? How long can the board put up with these dismal sales figures? We shall see. But one thing is for sure: it cannot carry on like this.

Will China really be able to make inroads into the European market given the combination of tariffs and European consumer preference for their own homegrown brands?

Yes, and they already are. Chinese automaker BYD now outsells Tesla in Europe, and it is now launching its premium brand, Denza, there too—think Audi or BMW level. Xpeng is there, too, as is Nio.

There's also MG and Omoda, and don't forget the Geely-owned brands like Volvo and Polestar, too. More are on their way of course, but the consumer preference has not seen people turning away from China EVs so far, it seems. If anything, buyers have been attracted by the value and the specs of Chinese cars, making the EU-own offerings look like poor value. This has happened in Australia, too.

What do you think about the expansion of EV infrastructure in countries like the US or in the EU? Will Chinese EVs be viable as a realistic option for the majority of the landmass?

Well, the charging infrastructure in the US and EU needs to be much better than it is. Remember, it was the ubiquity of the Ford Model T that played a pivotal role in the development of the gas station network, and we need that same trick to be turned for the EV age.

At the end of 2024, over 75 percent of the European highway network had chargers that were at most 50 km apart, whereas only just over a third of the US interstate highways achieved this. There's so much work to be done here, and the scale gap is absolutely enormous: the US will supposedly need 28 million EV charging ports by 2030 to support 33 million EVs. Meanwhile, Europe needs 8.8 million chargers by 2030—and to put that in perspective, that would require more than 23,000 installs per week in that region.

What will be the difference between the modern Chinese version of the export-to-the-world-market versus how the Japanese did it?

The key difference is Japanese expansion took 30-plus years, while China is trying to do it in under a decade. Japan also arguably started with economy cars and moved up, while China is trying to compete across all segments, from budget (see Xiaomi's new answer to the Model Y) to luxury (see BYD's Yang Wang!).

The tech approach is different, too. Japan perfected existing internal combustion engine technology, as well as production of course; China is betting on next-gen platforms.

China's speed-over-patience approach seems to be working, apart from in one key area: as Japan took much longer to build its industry, it had much longer to develop lasting brand loyalty and premium positioning. Chinese auto brands are going too fast to do that right now, I'd say.

How are the Japanese and Korean automakers reacting to China? Is it any different given their proximity? Or is it mostly the same as most Western manufacturers?

One could say their reaction has been more desperate and aggressive, maybe because of their proximity and the threat they face. Honda and Nissan's $58 billion merger that was floated, then called off, is a good example. Hyundai has cut its long-term vehicle sales targets as it gears up for aggressive marketing by Chinese rivals. But, ultimately, they face the same problem of the rise of China EV companies as North American and European carmakers do.

The US auto sector has increasingly relied on a heavily integrated supply chain between Canada and Mexico, which Trump's tariff regime has thrown into chaos. Does a disunited North American auto sector have any real hope of mounting a challenge to Chinese auto makers? Or do you anticipate they will shrink in relevance until they're only servicing an insulated US market?

We've covered the tariff disruption loads on WIRED, and the hit is clearly significant. Some estimate car prices will increase by as much as nearly $5,000.

The Chinese challenge isn't primarily about supply-chain efficiency though—it's about tech, pricing, and what buyers think of China's cars. BYD now has nearly one third of China's EV market compared to Tesla's 6 percent, and now Chinese brands are coming for global markets (take a look at Europe and Australia) with pricing that Tesla just can't match unless it has another Model 3 moment. And the Model Y refresh hasn't worked.

But it's not all bad news. If American automakers ramp up development on their EV tech, like GM and Ford are trying to do right now, reduced battery costs will happen for sure and they can compete. Leveraging US strengths in trucks, luxury, and long-established brands will be key, too.

Basically it all comes down to whether American automakers can innovate fast enough. The tariffs may actually slow that innovation by increasing costs and complexity.

So what exactly can we expect coming on the market?

Loads of new EVs with better batteries that can go even further than you can wish for. Lucid's Air Grand Touring just set a Guinness World Record for the longest EV drive, powering along for 749 miles on a single charge. Astonishing. And we're still in Model T Ford country really with battery tech, if we're being honest. This is why residual value of EVs is so bad—the tech keeps getting better so quickly that cars like the Porsche Taycan plummet in value after just a year because better incoming tech is making these models look old at a frightening pace.

(From an Italy-based EV owner.) One of the challenges that I see being hard to overcome is the distribution. With a fuel car you will easily find a gas station, drop there, refuel and pay. Is anything going on related to converting fuel gas stations into EV charge stations? Are any of the new Chinese brands addressing this, like Tesla did with Superchargers but on a bigger scale?

I hear you. Dealing with charging point apps is horrendous and would make anyone think twice about getting a full EV as opposed to a hybrid. Legislation is needed to make these companies play nice with each other, and not just in one country but globally—but you can imagine just how tough that is going to be.

I remember a BMW executive telling me that converting a gas station into a charging station was a huge operation. If I remember correctly, it basically requires turning it into a substation, which costs millions. So that might explain the slow conversion we are seeing.

Apparently, last year the US had nearly 9,000 public fast-charging stations, or about one fast-charging station for every 15 gas stations. So we need loads more, but also need them far more widely distributed.

As for what China is doing, well, it's being smarter. BYD supposedly wants to build more than 4,000 new ultra-fast charging stations across China, with flash-chargers that can provide a full charge in just 5 to 8 minutes. Zeekr and Huawei are announcing 1.2-megawatt and 1.5-megawatt chargers.

Basically, Chinese brands are attempting to leapfrog the entire existing infrastructure with ultra-fast charging networks that make the Tesla Supercharger look slow. This could be a much bigger change than retrofitting gas stations.

In Europe, there's a company called Dacia that's managed to gain a lot of market share by producing cars that are consistently the cheapest in the market, and it does that by using trailing-edge hardware (a lot of it older Renault parts). I'm curious, why isn't there something similar in the US?

I can't say too much here as we're working on a piece right now on this very subject—so keep an eye on WIREDs Gear channel where we put all our auto coverage.

Dacia is an interesting example as they have managed to be cheap through a couple of ways: First, the brand offers few to no options, the cars basically come as you find them, and they are not top spec by any means (but they are well-designed). The new design duo they have there are excellent. Second, Dacia also produce some of their cars in China to keep costs down, like the ridiculously cheap Spring, which I tested out and was mighty impressed by. It costs just $19,000 new.

The US needs to get much more into this budget EV space, and that's what Jeff Bezos is trying to do with Slate, of course.

This is entirely Google's issue to fix. Yes, YouTube has amazing educational content. I'd really like to make it available for my kids to see.YouTube, however, makes it completely impossible to permanently filter/hide/disable the bane that is YouTube Shorts. I don't let my kids on TikTok not because it's Chinese, but because it's trash. I don't allow them near Instagram either.The chances of kids growing an attention span by seeing interesting stuff in installments of 30 seconds approaches zero really, really fast. Yes there's the possibility telling a fun joke, demonstrating an optical illusion, or some interesting curiosity in under a minute. But it's far more likely that it's trash, and teaching kids (and adults) that if they don't get a kick of something within the first 10 seconds, it should be skipped.And it's not necessarily age/quality rating of content; UX matters. It's totally different to find that your kid wasted an hour of their life doom scrolling over 150 videos of which they didn't even complete half, or that they spent it seeing half a dozen things videos of dubious quality: if it's half a dozen it's at least feasible to discuss with them why some are better than others.So, I'm very close to just banning YouTube (at the DNS level if required). Which is a shame, because I then can't share the interesting stuff with them, and neither can their teachers.

Social media, as used to refer to any practical service in the real world, has always been about one-sided content being shared to a mostly consumer-only audience.> increasingly viewed on TV screensAre people digging old Trinitrons out of the trash, or what?

Zhaoxin, one of China's top fabless semiconductor companies, has announced the company's next-generation KaiXian KX-7000N and Kaisheng KH-50000 processors at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) 2025. The former is a new consumer chip for AI PCs, while the latter is a server chip with specifications that rival AMD's EPYC portfolio.

The Kaisheng KH-50000, the successor to the Kaisheng KH-40000, will feature up to 96 cores, aligning with AMD's EPYC 9004 (codenamed Genoa) series. The forthcoming server processors provide three times the number of cores compared to Zhaoxin's current models. Nevertheless, the company has not disclosed whether the Kaisheng KH-50000 will incorporate simultaneous multithreading (SMT) or continue to operate without SMT, as is the case with the Kaisheng KH-40000.

While the Kaisheng KH-40000 employs Zhaoxin's Yongfeng architecture, the company has not disclosed which architecture is utilized for the Kaisheng KH-50000. However, considering the significant upgrades in specifications and features, it is reasonable to assume that the Kaisheng KH-50000 adopts a new architecture. Zhaoxin just didn't want to reveal which one yet.

In terms of clock speed, Zhaoxin may achieve a range between 2.2 GHz and 3.0 GHz for the Kaisheng KH-50000. This may be higher or lower than the Kaisheng KH-40000, which operates at 2.5 GHz. The increase in core count is also associated with an expansion of the L3 cache. Zhaoxin has officially confirmed that the Kaisheng KH-50000 is equipped with 384MB of L3 cache, a capacity that is six times greater than that of the Kaisheng KH-40000.

You may be aware that AMD's Genoa processors include 384MB of L3 cache. Indeed, the Kaisheng KH-50000 could potentially be an identical counterpart to Genoa. Similar to Genoa, the Kaisheng KH-50000 provides 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes and support for 12-channel DDR5 ECC memory, in addition to embracing the Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnect.

The Kaisheng KH-50000 supports ZPI (Zhaoxin Processor Interconnect) 5.0, allowing partners to install two or four chips on one motherboard. This enables systems with up to 384 cores.

Zhaoxin is riding the AI PC trend. The company revealed the upcoming KaiXian KX-7000N processor at WAIC. This chip is likely based on the KaiXian KX-7000 but features an added NPU for AI tasks, which is probably what the "N" signifies in its name.

The KaiXian KX-7000N marks a significant milestone for Zhaoxin, as it is the company's first chip to feature an NPU. Several AI PCs featuring the KaiXian KX-7000N were showcased at the WAIC 2025 event. However, Zhaoxin did not provide detailed specifications for the KX-7000N, only mentioning that it will have more cores and enhanced support for PCIe 5.0, unlike the current KaiXian KX-7000, which is limited to PCIe 4.0.

Companies such as Zhaoxin and Lisuan Technology are making significant advances in hardware. Although Chinese-made processors and graphics cards haven't yet challenged industry giants like Intel, AMD, or Nvidia, that remains a future objective. Currently, their focus is on creating reliable products that deliver a decent enough computing experience. Each progress, big or small, moves China closer to achieving technological independence from the West.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon's deal to license some content from The New York Times for use on the tech giant's artificial intelligence platforms will cost at least $20 million annually, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

The Journal cited “people familiar with the matter” in reporting the figure, which hadn't been publicly disclosed since the two companies announced their plans in May. The report said the yearly payment — as high as $25 million — amounts to nearly 1% of the Times's total 2024 revenue.

The multi-year licensing agreement will bring Times editorial content “to a variety of Amazon customer experiences,” the Times previously said. Content will include “real-time display of summaries and short excerpts” of news articles and items from NYT Cooking (food and cooking) and The Athletic (sports). 

Amazon could also use Times original content in the Alexa software on its smart speakers and to train its proprietary AI models.

The generative-AI focused licensing arrangement is a first for the Times.

“The [Amazon] deal is consistent with our long-held principle that high-quality journalism is worth paying for,” Meredith Kopit Levien, chief executive of the Times, previously said in a note to staff.

The New York Times Co. filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against both OpenAI and its partner Microsoft in December 2023, accusing the tech companies of “using The Times's content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and steal audiences away from it.”

The suit alleges that the companies wrongly used vast amounts of copyrighted material from the newspaper to train the large language models that power ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence models.

A federal judge rejected parts of OpenAI and Microsoft's motion to dismiss the suit in April, writing that the Times' produced “numerous” and “widely publicized” examples of ChatGPT producing material from its articles.

OpenAI has licensing deals with other publishers, including The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, and NewsCorp.

Elon Musk scored a small win in court on Tuesday in his case against Sam Altman, but the judge wasn't impressed with either side's tactics, reprimanding them for “gamesmanship.”

Calling out both sides for having “repeatedly over-litigated the case,” U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers granted Musk's motion to strike several of Altman's defenses.

This is the latest in Musk's ongoing feud with Altman. Musk originally filed the lawsuit last year in a federal court in Northern California, accusing Altman and OpenAI of fraud. Musk claims he was misled into co-founding and funding OpenAI in 2015 under the belief that it would remain a non-profit.

The lawsuit claims that Altman built a secretive network of for-profit OpenAI affiliates, took control of the non-profit's board, engaged in self-dealing, and diverted the non-profit's talent and tech for financial gain. The resulting corporate structure, the suit says, is now worth an estimated $100 billion.

The filing frames Musk's case as “a textbook tale of altruism versus greed.” Notably, Musk dropped a similar suit against OpenAI earlier last year.

Altman's team responded by filing 55 affirmative defenses, introducing new facts not mentioned in Musk's original complaint. In a December blog post, OpenAI claimed that when Musk was still with the organization, he actually wanted it to become for-profit with himself at the helm.

On Tuesday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers trimmed that list of 55 defenses, ruling that some were “irrelevant, redundant, insufficient, or immaterial.” She also criticized Musk's legal team for trying to strike all the defenses, saying they failed “to take the high ground.” Instead, the judge slimmed down the defenses by 16, leaving 39 in the case. “The Court will not waste precious judicial resources on the parties' gamesmanship,” Judge Gonzalez Rogers wrote.

“OpenAI's deflective strategy of wild distraction is wearing thin on everyone,” said Marc Toberoff, Musk's lead lawyer in the case, in a statement emailed to Gizmodo. “We look forward to prosecuting this case on the real issues: OpenAI's ongoing fraud and complete betrayal of its charitable mission.”

Attorneys representing Altman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

This isn't the first time the judge has seemed unimpressed with the case. Business Insider reported in February that Judge Gonzalez Rogers expressed doubt about Musk's claim of “irreparable harm,” saying, “I have billionaires versus billionaires.”

Jury selection for the case is scheduled to begin on March 30.

Musk helped start OpenAI with Altman and others back in 2015, but he left in 2018 after disagreements about where the company was headed. Since then, he launched his own AI for-profit company, xAI, to go head-to-head with OpenAI. The rivalry between them has only gotten more intense, even extending into the world of politics.

Earlier this year, Musk stepped down from his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and got into a public back-and-forth with President Donald Trump on social media.

Around the same time, Altman joined Trump for a long one-on-one meeting. Shortly after, Trump publicly praised Altman's AI infrastructure efforts, which Musk has not been shy about criticizing.

Personally, I've got some fatigue from most AI solutions being less than half baked. I'd love to see a long form video of letting frigade loose on something like Survey Monkey or whatever. Like... what does indexing look like? Does it produce artifacts? Can I see what users are asking? etc

And we haven't really seen security or privacy issues in terms of competitor leakage. There is more concern around customer data and privacy, and in that regard, we invest heavily in security and have safeguards to help minimize the risk of any customer data issues.

Building a startup in the AI era presents a paradox: early stage companies can scale rapidly — but they're also more vulnerable than ever. 

“It's never been a more disruptive time. That's the good news,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona. “The bad news is, it's never been a less durable time.”

McIlwain joined his former colleague Greg Gottesman, managing director at Pioneer Square Labs, on stage at Seattle Venture Day on Tuesday as the two longtime venture capitalists shared a clear message to founders: the AI era is rewriting the startup playbook, and sticking to old rules could leave even fast-growing companies behind.

New moats

In a world where large language models and open-source tools are widely accessible, defensibility looks different. 

McIlwain described a concept he calls “reasoning flywheels” — a new type of moat where startups use data, engagement, and tailored workflows to build value.

The pattern works like this: 

Gottesman noted that traditional defensibility based on ideas or basic IP is less reliable in this environment. “You have to think beyond where we typically thought about ways to build a moat,” he said. That includes exploring new pricing structures, delivery models, and user experiences — not just product features.

Unprecedented pace

The Seattle VCs drew comparisons to the dot-com era, when they began their investing careers. But AI, they said, is evolving at a breakneck speed that makes the internet revolution look slow.

“Even having done this for almost 30 years, I'm unfamiliar with this pace of change,” Gottesman said, adding: “The level of change and advance, and your ability to sort of envision what that future might look like, is unlike anything I've ever seen.”

McIlwain noted how models become obsolete rapidly, asking the crowd if anyone still uses GPT-2 — which was state-of-the-art not so long ago. 

“The models, in and of themselves, depreciate — but intelligent applications and agentic workflows tend to have a flywheel effect,” he said.

McIlwain noted the critical importance of customer feedback in navigating such rapid change. “The customer is always smarter than the venture capitalists,” he said. “Listen to your customers.”

Gottesman encouraged founders to be “intensely, insanely curious” and stressed the value of a team. “Surround yourself with the most incredible people you can and try to fill holes for yourself,” he said. “Don't just hire people that are exactly like yourself. Look for people that hopefully like you want to work with, but also that have different perspectives that bring in something new to your team.”

Bullish on Seattle

Both investors agreed that Seattle is well-positioned to lead the next wave of innovation, particularly in AI.

“I just feel like we have such incredible talent in the right areas — that infrastructure layer, as well as at the application layer around AI,” Gottesman said. “I think that puts us in a really good position to create one of the next great iconic companies.”

McIlwain said that if you believe the “reasoning revolution” will happen faster than previous technological revolutions — “how can we not, in the next 10 years, do incredible, transformative, daring things here in the greater Seattle ecosystem?”

In early February, Edward “Big Balls” Coristine was one of two operatives for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) granted potentially wide-ranging access to a number of systems at the Small Business Administration (SBA). Through that foray, DOGE gained access to the National Finance Center (NFC), a sensitive system that provides human resources and payroll functions for the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), among other agencies.

This access has not been previously reported. And new reporting from WIRED, including the review of hundreds of pages of documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, offers insight into the comprehensive access DOGE operatives were able to gain to federal systems in the early days of the second Trump administration—and just how quickly they got it.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

Coristine is a 19-year-old who was one of DOGE's earliest hires and was brought on as a permanent government employee at the General Services Administration (GSA) before resigning and then resurfacing as a special government employee at the Social Security Administration. He and Donald Park, a Brazilian jiujitsu enthusiast and private equity investor, have previously been identified as DOGE operatives at the SBA who sought access to HR, contracting, and payment systems and information. Neither replied to requests for comment.

Records reviewed by WIRED show that within five hours of a request from the office of the SBA's chief information officer that they be given access to SBA systems, Park and Coristine—who went by the online name “Big Balls” and had reportedly been fired from an internship at a network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers, after being suspected of leaking internal information—were granted entrance to the agency's core financial and loan systems. Not long after that, Coristine had access to NFC systems not even housed within the SBA, the agency to which he had been detailed.

The mechanical process of granting access appears to have started just past noon on February 3, when Stephen Kucharski, the director of the SBA's Office of Performance Systems Management, an office in the SBA's Office of Capital Access, emailed 19 colleagues with an urgent request. Two DOGE affiliates, he said, were to be given the digital keys to the agency immediately.

Under the subject line “system access for Edward Coristine” Kucharski wrote, “Please help me and my OCIO colleagues as we mobilize to provide Edward Coristine and Donald Park Admin access to all SBA systems. This action has been cleared and we are on a very short time frame. Doug will be arranging a call to answer questions and I will add Edward to this distribution list as soon as we create his SBA account. His account should be completed very shortly.” The two biggest priorities, he added, were the SBA's human resources system and its contract system, to include “detailed data on all active procurements.”

Four minutes after sending his initial request, Kucharski followed up to add the SBA's chief information security officer. At 12:33 pm, Elias Hernandez, the associate administrator for the Office of Veterans Business Development, followed up with a message titled "URGENT REQUEST FROM SBA!" to a smaller group addressed to Michael Jackson, the director of the NFC. (Kucharski, Hernandez, and Jackson did not reply to requests for comment.)

“Please help me get this request to the right NFC leaders who can make this happen ASAP,” Hernandez wrote. “We need the NFC to grant Admin access to the reporting center, insights, and the NFC Mainframe for all SBA Personnel Office Identifiers (POIs) to the following SBA DOGE employees.”

The NFC is an agency nested inside the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) that handles payroll for 650,000 government employees—over a fifth of the federal workforce—across more than 170 agencies, including the SBA, according to a source familiar with it who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the press. The information contained in the NFC's systems includes the Social Security numbers, banking information, addresses, and dates of birth for federal employees, including members of the FBI and DOJ. “We can and have managed the complexities of law enforcement pay for decades,” says the source. (The USDA referred a request for comment from WIRED to the SBA. The SBA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

According to the source familiar with the NFC, requests for access, especially for sensitive systems, normally go through a vetting process. The request is evaluated and, if granted, only permits the lowest level of access required. “We were being told,” they believed, “to give them unlimited access.”

According to emails viewed by WIRED, an IT manager at the NFC requested that Coristine and Park be granted “admin authority” to the mainframe and access to two other applications: Insight, which includes detailed employment records, and the Reporting Center, which includes payroll data. The requests for Insight and the Reporting Center were for “read only” access, meaning that Coristine and Park could see data in the system but not change it. Within roughly three hours of Kucharski's email, the DOGE operatives had mainframe access, giving them—according to the source—the power to see sensitive information like an employee's “salary, banking, address, deductions, debt and other vital employment information” at the NFC.

In an email timestamped 4:15 pm, less than an hour after this access was granted, Coristine wrote to Hernandez and the SBA's deputy chief human capital officer, with another request: “Could you please send me the NFC CIO's phone number?”

All of this was quite unusual by normal government standards, though not those prevailing at the time: As Coristine and Park were gaining access to the NFC mainframe, another DOGE operative, Marko Elez, had gained read-write access to the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

The speed at which DOGE operatives were able to access these datasets, says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, was highly concerning, because it indicates they likely did not go through the regular screening and security clearance processes required of government employees who handle sensitive information.

“As far as we know, these people don't have real security background checks,” he says. Experts WIRED previously spoke to doubted that Coristine could have obtained a clearance.

SBA spokesperson Caitlin O'Dea says, “As federal employees, all personnel are subject to a rigorous clearance protocol prior to interacting with agency data. SBA is grateful to those who have helped uncover millions in fraud, waste, and abuse on behalf of American taxpayers and small businesses.”

“Oversight Democrats demand to know if this kid—and any of the DOGE employees shuffling through Americans' sensitive data—have passed the required background checks and clearances. DOGE continues to put the whims of the White House over the safety, security, and well-being of the American people and our nation,” Stephen Lynch, a member of the House Oversight Committee, tells WIRED in a statement.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Shortly after Kucharski's initial request, Park sent an email to Coristine with the subject line “List of systems.” Coristine then forwarded this request to Kucharski. An hour after that, Coristine emailed another SBA employee with the subject line “RE: Access to Oracle & SQL Server Databases.”

This appears to have put Coristine in position to potentially access significant amounts of sensitive personal information. The SBA supports small businesses and entrepreneurs by helping them access loans, government contracts, and business counseling and educational resources. As part of its routine processes, according to a current SBA employee who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press, “we collect a lot of data, like employer identification numbers (EINs), North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) numbers, and Social Security numbers.”

Coristine would likely have had access to this sort of information because he was, according to emails obtained by WIRED, granted access to records and systems including the Capital Access Financial System, the SBA's main portal for submitting and servicing loans His access further encompassed several CAFS subsystems that can contain granular information on loans and loan applications.

“Each one on its own doesn't have boatloads of information, but added together, the CAFS system as a whole, if you flip between the tabs, has all of the information from loan applications, street addresses, tax IDs, additional notes from SBA investigations and holds, etc.,” says a second SBA source familiar with some of the systems Coristine and Park had sought to gain access to, also on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Additionally, the source says, CAFS does have fields for citizenship status and for an alien registration number for noncitizens, as well as, the street address of the business, race, gender of the person listed as principal.

Though agencies will sometimes loan staffers to each other for specific projects or to share particular expertise, Moynihan says that a single person or group of people “operating in multiple agencies, accessing multiple data sets at the same time, is really unusual.”

“I can't think of another example like this,” he says.

While the emails reveal little about the purpose of DOGE's access to these systems at SBA and NFC, Moynihan says, “the sensitivity of the data leads us to worry about the worst-case scenario.”

In April, WIRED reported that DOGE was marrying datasets across several agencies to support the Trump administration's immigration agenda and to particularly target immigrants for removal or other forms of law enforcement.

“We're left speculating what the intention was here, given the information vacuum created by DOGE,” says Moynihan.

It's been just shy of a week since Marvel's latest installment in its ever-expanding cinematic universe, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, released in theaters. While much of the hubbub about the film is generally favorable, verging on “we're so back,” some online fans lamented over the movie seemingly leaving a lot of content from its trailer on the cutting room floor for their liking. Now, director Matt Shakman has come forward to discuss the rigorous editing process behind the Marvel film.

In an interview with Collider, Shakman was asked if First Steps, which clocks in at a little under two hours, initially had a longer cut of the film. To ensure everything happens in a sequential manner that will satisfy folks, the film, as with most modern blockbusters, has its fair share of deleted scenes. While not unique to the genre, Fantastic Four became a focal point to fans online who've compiled moments from First Steps trailers that didn't make it to the final cut, giving birth to rumors that the film was purportedly missing at least 30 minutes of content.

While Shakman admits that making the film was tricky, forgoing a traditional origin story, but giving viewers enough pieces of Marvel's First Family to understand its quartet and tell a new story with the likes of new cataclysmic threats in the Silver Surfer and Galactus, it's still released as he wanted it to.

“By the time you end up cutting it, you're doing it for a reason,” Shakman told Collider. “You're looking at the larger picture, and you're able to make those cuts, because they make sense. And, ultimately, you know it's for the greater good. It's always, in the post process, hard to—you know, the forest and the trees, right? You have to constantly think about the bigger picture. This cast is amazing, and all of the supporting cast is amazing, and the work of the design team, and cinematography, these are tons of great scenes that would be wonderful to have in the film, but ultimately, just didn't contribute to the best possible narrative.”

As GamesRadar+ notes, Shakman added that Marvel gave him freedom to make the movie without the rumored executive meddling fans tend to point a finger at whenever they need to explain why it might feel off (especially so in Marvel's case, as the studio has become infamously known for its messy, fix-it-in-post process in recent years).

“No, [there] was never anything I had to fight for. That's a great thing about Marvel. I feel like we're all making the same movie, working really hard to tell the same story. It was clear what we were trying to tell from the beginning,” Shakman said.

Ahead of his Collider interview, it was already made public that iconic actor John Malkovich had all of his scenes as the Fantastic Four's longtime rival, Red Ghost, cut from the film. Speaking with Variety, Shakman lamented Malkovich's absence in the movie, which became more apparent to fans because he was showcased in the movie's trailers. As with other elements cut from First Steps, Red Ghost's ghosting of the film boiled down to the movie already having too many spinning plates, including a world-eating villain, a surfing harbinger, legacy cameos, a tangle with Mole Man, and a superpowered baby, to make room for Red Ghost.

“It was heartbreaking not to include him in the final version of the movie because he's one of my very favorite humans and one of my biggest inspirations,” Shakman told Variety. “As a person who walks the line between theater and film and television, there's no one who is more inspiring than the founder of Steppenwolf Theater Company. What he's done on stage as an actor and what he's done as a director in theater as well as in film, and as just a film actor of incredible ability—I was honored he came to play.”

Fantastic Four is playing in theaters.

The fight for AI continues.

When Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) announced its intent to acquire Juniper Networks for $14 billion back in January of 2024, it sparked the usual buzz around consolidation in enterprise tech. But what looked at first like a classic case of portfolio expansion—HPE growing its edge-to-cloud stack by folding in Juniper's networking business—may have had far higher strategic stakes behind the scenes.

New reporting from Axios reveals that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) actually had internal conflict over whether to block the deal, with multiple officials arguing it posed competitive concerns. What changed? According to sources close to the matter, senior White House and intelligence officials intervened, emphasizing that national security interests overrode any antitrust objections.

That intervention seems to have tipped the scales. Just last week, the DOJ formally signed off on the deal, allowing it to proceed with no major conditions. But according to Axios, at least two DOJ staffers who raised red flags about the merger were pushed out during internal disputes, adding weight to speculation that this wasn't just a regulatory approval, but a calculated strategic move.

The deal itself isn't just another high-value acquisition between two legacy tech firms. While HPE and Juniper overlap in networking, the merger is more about aligning U.S. infrastructure players against what national security officials see as an encroaching threat from Chinese-designed networking stacks. In internal meetings, U.S. intelligence officials reportedly argued that Huawei's dominance in global infrastructure isn't just a trade issue, but rather a strategic vulnerability.



For many developing countries, Huawei's tightly integrated ecosystem offering networking hardware, cloud services, and AI-backed management software comes at a fraction of the cost of its Western rivals. The concern from Washington was that if U.S. vendors kept competing independently, they'd fail to match Huawei's scale, and American influence in digital infrastructure would continue to erode.

That's where the HPE-Juniper combination comes in. Juniper's strength in carrier-grade routing and Mist AI network automation complements HPE's enterprise footprint and GreenLake's growing cloud presence. Together, the merged company could offer a vertically integrated stack—not unlike Huawei's—targeted toward U.S. allies and sectors with sensitive data flows. It's no coincidence that the deal was finalized just as the U.S. has been urging partner nations to diversify away from Chinese tech across telecom and cloud.

Internally, the Justice Department didn't reach this decision lightly. According to Axios, the department's antitrust division initially had reservations, fearing that the consolidation could reduce competition in enterprise networking and edge infrastructure. But after meetings with the intelligence community and senior White House staff, the narrative shifted. National security, not market concentration, became the dominant concern.

Two DOJ officials who pushed back on the decision were reportedly dismissed during the process, underscoring the weight of the political and strategic considerations in play. The message from the executive branch was clear: regulatory friction shouldn't get in the way of countering Huawei's lead in global digital infrastructure.



That shift in tone is reflective of a broader trend where traditional antitrust arguments are increasingly being sidelined in favor of geopolitical strategy. It's a pattern we've seen take shape in semiconductors with the CHIPS Act, and now it's reaching into networking. The HPE-Juniper merger isn't being sold as a growth story or a revenue synergy play as much as it's being framed as a necessity. A way to ensure that Western tech firms don't just survive but remain relevant in a world where infrastructure dominance is increasingly tied to soft power and national leverage.

If executed well, the merger could give the U.S. a more credible alternative to Huawei's offerings, especially in friendly but vulnerable markets like Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe. Ultimately, the success hinges on more than just consolidation. HPE and Juniper still have to unify their roadmaps, streamline overlapping products, and make the combined stack attractive not just on paper, but in cost, performance, and manageability. That's a tall order—but in this case, Washington seems to have decided that not trying would be riskier.

Looks like the iPhone 17 Pro won't come in sky blue after all. Long-time iPhone leaker Sonny Dickson has shared what he claims are dummy models for the entire iPhone 17 lineup expected to be announced in September. Notably, there's a new non-boring orange color for iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. God, please be real!

As you can see in his X post, there's an orange shade of the iPhone 17 Pro/17 Pro Max alongside the less flashy black, white, and navy blue. As I've said before, Apple desperately needs to bring some of the more fun colors to the iPhone Pros and orange would be the brightest yet, though dummy models don't always accurately depict colors. For example, dummy leaks suggested the iPhone 16 Pro's Desert Titanium would look copper/bronze, or as I called it, “poop brown.” The actual Desert Titanium iPhone 16 Pros that shipped are more of a champagne/beige gold (and sometimes pink-ish in warmer lighting).

It's not the first time a phone maker has made an orange phone. Google blessed the Pixel 4 with a vivid “Oh So Orange” colorway way back in 2019. Cue all the “orange is the new black” jokes.

Dickson's X post also offers a preview for the skinny iPhone 17 Air. If accurate, the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will come in what appears to be black, white, gold, and light. Not the most eye-catching colors if I'm being honest. Sure, most people will throw a case over their iPhone, but still—if there's any iPhone that you won't want to cover up with a case, it's the one that tells everyone you've got the newest and thinnest iPhone ever made.

The regular iPhone 17 could pick up the slack if you're looking for more color pop—supposedly coming in pink, lime green, light blue, white, and black. RIP teal iPhone 16… we hardly knew ye. Orange for the iPhone 17 Pros would be striking. All rumors point to Apple switching from a titanium frame back to aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro/17 Pro Max, which may not only make the devices lighter but also open the door to more vibrant colors in the future. Anodizing titanium with dyes is a much harder process to achieve compared to aluminum.

We're *checks calendar* about a month and a half away from Apple announcing the new iPhone 17 family, likely the new Apple Watch Series 11, and possibly even AirPods Pro 3. If you're on the fence about buying Apple products, especially any of the ones I just mentioned, you really should hold off unless you absolutely need a device to function.

Neutrinos are everywhere. About 100 trillion neutrinos pass through our bodies every second, but they're so weakly interacting we never notice them. It's this spooky feature of neutrinos that earned them the nickname “ghost particles.” Antineutrinos, their antimatter counterpart, are also everywhere. Both are notoriously difficult to detect, but physicists are getting better at circumventing their ghostly tendencies, as a recent record-setting measurement demonstrates.

When a low-energy neutrino bounces off the entire nucleus of an atom, the resulting scattering produces sufficient signals for physicists to capture at a nuclear reactor. Using this concept, physicists successfully measured the lowest-ever energy levels recorded in neutrino events, reporting their results in a Nature paper published today. For the experiment, the Coherent Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CONUS+) collaboration, based in Leibstadt, Switzerland, effectively “hatched” antineutrinos from inside a nuclear reactor. 

“This was a big experimental challenge,” Christian Buck, study co-author and physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, told Gizmodo.

This detector picks up signals from the recoil energy created when antineutrinos bounce off an atomic nucleus. Since matter and antimatter share most fundamental properties, the same measurements can be used to characterize the energy levels of neutrinos. The main detector weighs just 6.6 pounds (3 kilograms), which is tiny compared to typical ton-scale neutrino detectors. Having such a compact neutrino detector offers tantalizing opportunities for more mobile investigations into neutrinos and atomic structures in general, according to the researchers. 

Formally, neutrinos bouncing off an entire nucleus is called coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), first predicted in 1974. Physicists surmised that CEvNS should feature interaction rates 100 to 1,000 times higher than the typical approach of waiting for a neutrino to brush past one of the millions of particles zipping inside giant detectors. In contrast, CEvNS is like “a tiny neutrino giving the nucleus just a gentle bump, like a ping-pong ball hitting a car, and now we have to detect the movement of the car,” Buck explained.

It wasn't until 2017 that the COHERENT experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory confirmed this was possible using a particle accelerator. CONUS+ and its predecessor, CONUS, build on that result with some significant modifications: measuring CEvNS using a nuclear reactor as a source to demonstrate an entirely new interaction channel to study neutrinos. 

“For the reactor operators, this is just an unnecessary side product that they do not need to care about,” Buck said. “For us, the reactor is a free, point-like source of the antineutrinos—a reactor like the one in Leibstadt emits 10 to the power of 21 antineutrinos each second! Almost all of them pass matter without any effect (like a ghost), but we try to catch a few of them per day.”

“After two decades of experimental efforts, the search for CEvNS has progressed into the era of precision measurements,” Henry T. Wong, a physicist at the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, in Taiwan, wrote in an accompanying News & Views article for Nature. The latest results from CONUS+ will “raise high hopes among neutrino-physics researchers,” Wong, who wasn't involved in the study, added.

As an important next step, CONUS+ will attempt to increase the precision of its device even further and apply its findings to practical real-world applications. Its unique location inside a nuclear reactor has already garnered interest from major organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, according to Buck.

“In principle, such a detector can be used to monitor the thermal power or the evolution of the reactor fuel over time,” he explained. “We have now made the first step…but for sure there are still several years and steps ahead of us before the technology is ready for commercial applications.”

More importantly, the new technique may potentially turn up some phenomena at odds with what we know of the Standard Model, Buck said. If so, “this could be a hint that our understanding is not complete and that new particles or so far not-known interactions are at play,” he said.

When I first came across this result, my editor and I had a quick discussion about the nature of antineutrinos. If neutrinos are popularly referred to as “ghost particles,” would that make antineutrinos…anti-ghost particles? What does that even mean?

I had to ask Buck for his thoughts. His answer: “Since antineutrinos are very similar to neutrinos, an antineutrino is more or less like a neutrino in a mirror. I see them in one category. There are conservation laws in physics that allow some reactions only for the one or the other, but they are both of similar importance.” 

Though, he added, one hot topic in the field concerns whether there's a fundamental difference between neutrinos and antineutrinos. If physicists are able to answer this question, perhaps we'll know for sure if antineutrinos are ghosts in the mirror or (although unlikely) something else altogether.

AI-powered marketing automation startup Conversion, founded five years ago by two UC Berkeley dropouts, has raised a $28 million Series A led by Abstract, with participation from True Ventures and HOF Capital.

The company's founding story sounds like it could have been an episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley.”

The story begins all the way back when co-founder and CEO Neil Tewari, now 24, was in high school. He got busted one day watching a TechCrunch Disrupt livestream during class, was sent to the principal's office, and had to stay late.

Afraid to call his parents and tell them why they had to pick him up, he instead called one of their close friends. On the drive home, Tewari explained to the friend what got him in trouble. “I told him I had this interest [in entrepreneurship], and four years later, he was actually the first person to write us a check into the company,” Tewari told TechCrunch.

James Jiao, Tewari's college roommate at Berkeley — now Conversion's co-founder and CTO — also dreamed of founding his own company, so the two tried building various products, like one for helping marketeers buy product placement ads. They stumbled on the idea for Conversion when they signed up for HubSpot to help them with marketing tasks and decided to build a few extra automation features to layer on top of it.

“It was originally for us,” Tewari said of his startup's tech. The co-founders enjoyed building their internal marketing tool so much, they wondered if they could sell it and began reaching out to marketing executives for “customer discovery” interviews.

“We actually spent like two months doing like 160 customer interviews with VPs of marketing, 50- to 500-employee businesses, and got a much more positive response than we could have imagined,” Tewari said. 

Marketing teams had these tools deeply embedded in their workflows, but everyone had similar complaints about the parts they couldn't automate.

The duo had found their idea. The family friend introduced them to more marketing execs, which helped them raise a $2 million seed round. At age 19, they dropped out of college to work full time on Conversion.

The founders treated their raised funds so frugally they lived in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with five other roommates: two people to a room, with people sleeping on the couches and in the closet. 

As they built their product, ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Many legacy marketing automation tools are adding various AI and chat integrations into their wares, but not all of their features support these integrations. Marketing teams wanted “to be able to enrich contacts, [be] able to automate workflows,” for instance, Tewari said. Conversion has baked AI in, which means it can do things like organize leads and automate personalized follow-up emails.

As AI interest has soared, so has the company's prospects. Conversion is nearing $10 million ARR over the past two years, Tewari said, and about 90% of its customers are midsize businesses that have yanked out a legacy app.

Of course, Conversion is also in a crowded field. Besides the legacy marketing automation tools like HubSpot, Adobe Marketo, or Salesforce Pardot, there are other AI native startups like Jasper, Writer AI, Iterable, Copy.ai, and many others.

But Tewari also has the classic Silicon Valley confidence of a founder in a crowded market. His game plan calls for targeting businesses that use the older marketing tools. Conversion is not, for instance, targeting startups choosing a tool for the first time.

The company has raised a total of $30 million between its seed and Series A, the CEO says, and is doing well enough that the founders have each moved into separate apartments where they have their own rooms, and none of their roommates sleep in a closet.

Since February, multiple news reports have alleged that a significant number of agents at Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)—the Department of Homeland Security's investigative wing that focuses on transnational crimes like child exploitation, human trafficking, and drug cartels—have been pulled from child exploitation cases and reassigned to immigration enforcement and arrests.

US senator Ron Wyden urged DHS inspector general Joseph Cuffari on Tuesday to “promptly” launch an investigation into the veracity and extent of these reports about HSI, in a letter shared exclusively with WIRED. Inspector General Cuffari has the authority to conduct audits or investigations into any activities or operations at DHS.

“Instead of locking up rapists, child predators and other violent criminals, [US president Donald] Trump appears to be diverting investigators to target cooks, farm workers and students,” Wyden says in the letter. “Congress and the American people will not tolerate the Trump administration ignoring the ongoing sexual abuse of vulnerable children. Accordingly, we urge you to promptly investigate these troubling reports.”

Wyden told WIRED in a written statement that there is “no excuse for pulling investigators away from the most heinous cases involving child exploitation,” adding that “nothing should be a higher priority than protecting kids in danger.”

WIRED contacted several US-based child welfare and advocacy organizations to provide a comment for this article, but they did not reply or declined to comment on the record. An official from one of these organizations, who requested anonymity, claimed that their organization could not provide a comment for this story due to fear of retribution from the Trump administration.

In February, USA Today reported that the "entire investigations division" of HSI would be shifting its focus primarily to immigration arrests and deportations, as opposed to its typical range of work. Then, Reuters in March reported that HSI agents had been actively “reassigned” from cases they had been working on related to child exploitation, money laundering cases, drug trafficking, and tax fraud. They were then tasked with immigration enforcement. At the time, Democratic senator Dick Durbin told the outlet that this shift was “wasteful, misguided diversion of resources” that was “making America less safe."

The Atlantic reported in July that a veteran HSI agent said the division was putting major criminal investigations on hold and sometimes choosing not to take on new cases—including drug cases, human trafficking cases, and child exploitation cases—in order to make agents available for routine predawn raids for immigration enforcement.

HSI's reported shift in priorities comes after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said that it had received 20.5 million tips of suspected child sexual exploitation in 2024.

The risk to children involving AI-generated abuse material—which is also the domain of HSI—could also be reaching crisis levels. In 2024, the NCMEC received about 67,000 tips about suspected AI-generated abuse material—a 1,325 percent increase from 2023, when it received 4,700 of these tips.

“We are inundated with victims, with offenders,” Detroit-based HSI special agent Dave Alley, who has historically focused on child exploitation cases, told his local ABC news outlet in January. “There is just so much more access to both the internet and to materials.”

(When reached by phone by WIRED, Alley declined to comment for this story.)

According to its website, HSI has more than 10,000 employees and more than 7,000 “special agents” charged with leading criminal investigations. Its work has been housed under Immigration and Customs Enforcement since 2003. In the 2024 fiscal year, ICE said that HSI had “made 32,608 arrests, identified and/or assisted 1,783 victims of child exploitation, and assisted 818 human trafficking victims.”

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin did not answer questions about how many arrests have been made in connection to child exploitation in 2025 or how many agents have been assigned to such cases.

“HSI is leading efforts to conduct welfare checks on these children to ensure that they are safe and not being exploited,” McLaughlin tells WIRED. “The Trump administration has located 13,000 children who were released into the country and either lost or placed with unvetted sponsors under President Biden.” McLaughlin did not provide evidence to back up this figure ahead of publication.

When reached for comment, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the US border with Mexico is “more secure than it's ever been, which means fewer children are being trafficked and exploited,” Jackson says. “Anyone who claims to care about ending child exploitation and smuggling should be celebrating President Trump's historically secure border.”

HSI has not entirely halted its work on child exploitation investigations and other cases. On a news page published in April, ICE said that HSI had identified and rescued 56 victims of child exploitation in spring of 2025. The rescues were made as part of Operation Renewed Hope, an annual initiative in which HSI goes through child sexual abuse material in which victims and offenders have not been identified. The goal is to “create lead packages” that HSI or other law enforcement agencies can use to arrest offenders and bring victimized children to safety.

In recent years, HSI has requested that DHS separate its operations from ICE, a change that would also require congressional approval. The majority of special agents in charge of HSI sent a letter to then-DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen asking her to divorce the agency from ICE in 2018. HSI agents made another request to detach from ICE in a 2021 internal report submitted to then-DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Both requests cited ICE's poor reputation and the divisiveness of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, claiming that ERO is politicized and fuels a lack of public trust in HSI.

I procrastinated flying anywhere with my son until he was almost 3. There were so many things needed—a car seat! Stroller! In-flight entertainment! His own luggage! A crib when we landed!—that it felt like too much to coordinate. And who can blame me? It's just parenting in a new location, after all, rather than a vacation.

Still, a trip we wanted to take finally presented itself. We booked a long weekend in San Francisco and the nearby wine country to see family and friends we haven't seen since I was pregnant, and to relive a family tradition (though sans my grandmother, since she passed in 2020) for the first time since before the pandemic. Just in time, the perfect gadget presented itself to make the trip feel a little more manageable: the TernX Carry-On Luggage Stroller.

The TernX is both a small carry-on suitcase and a travel stroller built into a single device. One less thing to carry as a parent is always a godsend, and being able to tote my son and his clothes with one device felt heaven-sent. The TernX was founded by two parents who brought the company to Shark Tank, so it's no surprise it has a parent-minded design, though the compact size makes it best for younger (or shorter) kiddos. It was no problem to wheel this around the airport and San Francisco streets as a stroller, and as a suitcase onto a plane (which not all travel strollers can do!).

As a travel stroller, the TernX is pretty solid. It's easy to unfold, has a five-point harness, and sports a storage basket underneath that fits a small bag (I stuffed my kid's backpack underneath it while we walked through the airport). The TernX is always 14 inches wide, while reaching 38 inches tall and 35 inches long in stroller mode, compared to 22 inches tall and just 9 inches long in luggage mode. This stroller can also hold kids up to 48.5 pounds—almost as much as a regular stroller. When it's empty, it weighs 17 pounds, only adding 3 pounds compared to my favored Nuna TRVL stroller.

It's really best for small children since the seat is under 12 inches wide. It was a fine size for my tall, almost-3-year-old to sit in, but bigger kids won't fit into this. I also didn't realize on my trip that I could extend the height of the back of the seat. He's nearly 40 inches tall with a particularly tall torso, and his head and shoulders tower above the TernX's lowest setting. Mom-fail for not spotting I could raise that for him (but if that's the worst I did on my trip, I'll take it!).

Still, being tall didn't seem to leave my toddler uncomfortable. He happily sat in the stroller both in the airport and while we walked around Sonoma and San Francisco. The wheels are small and can't handle rough terrain, so I recommend sticking to the smooth airport floors and well-paved sidewalks.

The luggage portion of the TernX sticks out the back between the two wheels while it's in stroller mode. I was surprised that it wasn't in my way at all—in comparison, the Uppbaby Vista V2 has an underseat basket that sticks out towards the parent, and even at 5'4", I'd find myself kicking it. No such issue with the TernX, though, for either my husband or me. The luggage backing was actually super handy: We turned it into our baby bag while we were on the go, easily packing all of my son's essentials and backup outfits for the day ahead of us without needing a separate bag.

You won't get the same range of motion with this luggage stroller compared to regular travel strollers. It swerved if you were on an incline, specifically if the left and right sides of the stroller were at different inclines on a driveway. I also didn't love the brake at the center of the stroller, but I got used to it quickly. We also basically abandoned the canopy in my husband's luggage for the entirety of the trip, since you have to remove it every time you break down the stroller. The canopy does fit into the luggage if you want to bring it along, and it was easy to click on and off, but we really didn't need it for the amount of time we were walking around.

Since the TernX is a hard-shell carry-on suitcase, it was no problem rolling it through the airport and onto the plane. It's shorter and smaller than my Beis carry-on, but it was a good size to fit four days of my son's 5T outfits (plus backup items), his jacket, and a handful of overnight diapers for the trip ahead of us.

You can only pull this luggage in one direction, because the stroller brake is in your way in the other direction. It's not the way you'd expect to pull it based on where the handle is positioned, either. It's, again, something I could get used to, but it was a little annoying. It doesn't really roll on the four wheels while standing, which in some ways is nice, but mostly means you need to make sure you're intentionally pulling it the right way if you need to move around.

Since it's a smaller suitcase, it didn't feel too heavy or obtrusive to lift up and stick into a car trunk or the overhead compartments on the airplane. We didn't run into any issues or questions with this suitcase coming onto the plane, though we always broke it down into luggage mode before starting to board so that the flight attendants wouldn't suggest we gate check it like a stroller.

I'd say it's easy to get from luggage mode into stroller mode, but when converting from stroller into luggage mode, it takes some serious effort to click it back into place. My best method to reunite the two halves—the luggage half and now-folded stroller half—together was by intentionally slamming them into the ground or into the trunk of the car. Sometimes I was able to pull it off with just my arm strength, but that was the biggest frustration when converting the stroller. My other complaint is that the handle does have a few heights, but it's not easy to get the handle to lock into place beyond the topmost height. It is possible, you just have to be careful and intentional to pull it off.

So, who is the TernX for? If I were planning to take a ton of short trips with a 1- or 2-year-old, this luggage stroller would be perfect to use again and again. It really is incredibly convenient for a long weekend trip that includes a flight, and is best for kiddos who can sit up and face forward but aren't at preschool age yet. (Or if your kiddo is on the shorter side, they could use it for longer—my son is tall, but I was a 10th-percentile kind of kid.) The bag size is great for both a weekend's worth of kid clothes and your day-to-day essentials, and it could be nice on a longer trip too, though you'll likely need another bag for everything your little one will need.

Overall, I'd use this stroller again. We haven't reached for it since being at home, but I'm certainly going to wish my kiddo were shorter for my next flight. I guess it'll be time to get one of these. The TernX has sold out a few times already, but this handy suitcase is currently available for preorder to ship in August.

One of the strongest earthquakes in recorded history struck off the coast of Russia on Tuesday, July 29, triggering a tsunami that sent waves into Japan, Hawaii, and the U.S. west coast.

The magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit offshore of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia's far east on the evening of Tuesday, July 29, at a depth of about 13 miles (21 kilometers), according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The epicenter was located roughly 74 miles (120 kilometers) west-northwest of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, home to nearly 200,000 people.

The powerful quake triggered tsunami warnings and advisories for a wide swath of the Pacific, including Alaska, Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and as far south as New Zealand, though warnings were being downgraded in most areas Wednesday morning, the Associated Press reports. As of 8:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, several tsunami advisories remained in place along the West Coast, including in parts of Alaska, Oregon, and California due to the potential for aftershocks, according to the U.S. Tsunami Warning System. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the threat of a major tsunami on the U.S. coast had “passed completely” just before 11:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.

Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, told Reuters that high-intensity aftershocks are currently ongoing. The regional branch of Russia's Emergency Ministry said scientists expect aftershocks as powerful as magnitude 7.5, the AP reports.

In Kamchatka, officials recorded a tsunami height of 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters), according to the AP. Some building damage and evacuations were reported in areas closest to the quake's epicenter, and several people were injured. Much of Japan's eastern seaboard, which was devastated by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in 2011, was ordered to evacuate, Reuters reports. Officials said waves over 4 feet (1.2 meters) high hit the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido, but no deaths or significant damages have been reported, according to NBC News. Japan's warnings have since been downgraded.

No tsunami damages or injuries had been reported in the U.S. as of 9:45 a.m. ET Wednesday, July 30. Following the mainshock, Hawaii braced to take the brunt of the tsunami impact and issued evacuation orders, but the tsunami warning was downgraded to an advisory after the first waves reached Kauai around 7:30 p.m. local time, the Washington Post reports. Tsunami waves nearly 6 feet (1.8 meters) high barreled into Kahului, Maui, following the quake, according to NBC News. Waves were as high as 5 feet (1.5 meters) in Hilo, 4 feet (1.2 meters) in Hanalei, and 1 foot (0.3 meters) in Honolulu, NBC reports.

During a Tuesday evening press conference, state officials said there were reports of flooding on the Big Island but no reports of widespread damage. The state's Department of Transportation said there had been no reports of damage to highways  and all counties had issued the all clear to return to evacuation areas just before 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, NBC reports.

In California, Crescent City recorded wave heights of nearly 4 feet (1.2 meters), while other coastal cities reported more modest waves ranging from half a foot to just over 1 foot (0.1 meters to 0.3 meters), according to the Los Angeles Times. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned late Tuesday that waves could continue to impact the California coast for 10 to 36 hours. As of 10:20 a.m. ET Wednesday, officials cancelled tsunami warnings in some parts of coastal California from the Mexico border to Rincon Point, located 15 miles southeast of Santa Barbara. This area includes Los Angeles.

Tuesday's earthquake occurred near the Kuril-Kamchatka Arc, one of the most seismically active regions in the world. It stretches roughly 1,300 miles (21,00 kilometers) from Hokkaido, Japan to its intersection with the Aleutian arc south of the Commander Islands in Russia, according to the USGS. The Kuril-Kamchatka Arc marks the region where the Pacific tectonic plate subducts, or slides beneath, the Okhotsk microplate. As these plates move against each other, the buildup and subsequent release of stress generates earthquakes.

Based on the current evaluation of this earthquake's magnitude, it is tied for the sixth largest quake in recorded history, according to the USGS. It is also the world's largest since 2011, when the magnitude 9.1 Tōhoku earthquake stuck off the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan. That quake also triggered a far-reaching tsunami. The combined impact of the quake and massive wave decimated Japan's Pacific Coast, killing more than 18,000 people.

Not all large earthquakes trigger tsunamis. Tsunami formation depends on the location, magnitude, and depth of the quake, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). When a powerful earthquake occurs close enough to the ocean floor—like Tuesday's quake did—it causes the seafloor to rise and then drop. This sudden vertical displacement of the ocean floor is what creates a tsunami.

Tsunami preparedness and warning systems have improved significantly in the last 20 years, largely spurred by the devastating Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004. This event revealed major gaps in global preparedness, prompting greater international cooperation, improvements to early warning systems, and mobilizing public safety efforts. Still, tsunamis are highly dangerous, largely unpredictable events. Experts have advised people living in tsunami-prone areas to know their risk, heed official warnings, and have an emergency evacuation plan in place.

N1X is coming along nicely.

Nvidia's upcoming N1X SoC has made a fresh appearance—this time in FurMark's benchmark database—offering a first look at the chip's performance running natively on Windows 11. While the numbers will certainly not grab headlines, they provide valuable insight into where the chip currently stands in its development cycle.

Identified as “JMJWOA” by FurMark, the N1X reportedly scored 4,286 points in the 720p stress test, averaging 71 FPS. That's not even as good as some RTX 2060 scores, despite the N1X reportedly featuring 6,144 CUDA cores, more than the RTX 5070. On the surface, that may seem like underperformance, especially considering the sizable core count, but there's more nuance to the situation.

This is clearly not a finished product. Nvidia's N1X is expected to debut in 2026, and the version tested here is almost certainly an early engineering sample. Running at a modest 120W power budget and paired with pre-release 590.22 drivers—drivers that are still in transition away from legacy GPU architectures like Kepler and Maxwell—it's unrealistic to expect full-fledged performance at this point.



Moreover, FurMark itself is more of a stress test than a benchmark, often throttled or deprioritized by power and thermal management systems, especially in pre-release silicon. In this run, the N1X reportedly only hit 63% utilization and 59°C, possibly indicating built-in protections that prevent full ramp-up under synthetic loads. Whether it's firmware, BIOS restrictions, or driver immaturity, this result doesn't reflect the chip's actual, real-world potential.

That being said, the bigger takeaway here is the fact that Nvidia has the N1X running on Windows 11 at all. That signals a critical step in software enablement, and the ongoing validation process across operating systems is a prerequisite for broader deployment. Nvidia has been aggressive in positioning the N1X as a versatile compute platform, targeting AI and workstation workloads rather than raw gaming performance. After all, every leak points toward it being a cut-down GB10.

With a year to go before release, the N1X's FurMark outing should be seen less as a definitive performance indicator and more as a milestone in its evolving development journey. If anything, it shows Nvidia is steadily laying the groundwork for its most ambitious ARM-based SoC to date, something that will only stir up the competition in this market space.

Wyoming is the least populous U.S. state, with around 590,000 people, and currently exports two-thirds of its generated energy.

Plans are afoot to create a massive new data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, that would consume more power than every home in the state combined, a staggering milestone in the ongoing race to meet the excruciating power requirements of AI. The project is expected to kick off with a 1.8 gigawatt facility that would be scalable to 10 gigawatts in the future, as reported by AP.

As the report about this colossal investment in AI computing notes, generally, a single gigawatt is enough to power as many as a million homes, but the population of Wyoming, the least populous state in the U.S., is a mere 590,000 residents. According to calculations by Ars Technica, the plant would consume 15.8TWh annually, five times that of the state's residents. The full 10GW expansion would consume more than double the state's entire electricity generation each year.

Wyoming is already one of the U.S.'s top energy exporters, ranking only behind the likes of Texas, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania for its mainly oil, coal, and gas-fired energy output. EIA figures indicate the state exports almost three-fifths of the electricity it produces.

Which tech giant is behind the new Cheyenne data center plans isn't made clear by AP, or the local politicians quoted welcoming the project. We know that the energy infrastructure is being created by a company called Tallgrass, and the AI data center will be in the hands of a developer called Crusoe.

Several tech giants already have a foothold in Wyoming – obviously a great location for power-hungry computing infrastructure, and benefiting from a cool climate. The AP says Microsoft has had data centers in the state since 2012. However, Meta has also nearly completed an $800 million data center in Cheyenne, gaining a technological anchor in the region.

The AP source report also seems to hint that ChatGPT developer OpenAI might be the new data center ‘tenant.' A Crusoe spokesperson refused to confirm or deny that the Cheyenne location will be part of OpenAI's ambitious ‘Stargate' data center plans, which the ChatGPT maker is known to be actively scouting for.

Crusoe already has an established relationship with OpenAI from working on “the largest data center ... in the world” in Abilene, Texas, according to OpenAI's chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane.

The upcoming huge AI data center is so big that it will need its own dedicated energy production using a mix of gas and renewables. Despite this, and the positive spin from local politicians, some experts still think regular households could see their bills increase due to the AI industry's unquenchable thirst for energy.

If you thought the age of Christian missionaries traveling the world to spread the word of God and evangelize locals was over, think again—they've just gotten sneakier.

A recent investigation by The Guardian and the Brazilian newspaper O Globo reveals that missionaries have left solar-powered audio devices in Brazil's Javari valley, near the Peruvian border, in an attempt to evangelize isolated or recently contacted Indigenous Amazonian people. The devices play biblical readings in Portuguese and Spanish.

For example, a device identified by The Guardian announces, “Let's see what Paul says as he considers his own life in Philippians chapter 3, verse 4: ‘If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.'”

The Javari Valley Indigenous Territory has the highest concentration of uncontacted human groups in the world. To protect the indigenous tribes, Brazil's National Foundation for the Indian (FUNAI) made it illegal to enter Javari Valley in 1987. Nevertheless, locals have reported up to seven audio devices, though the investigation secured photo and video evidence of just one—a yellow and gray phone-sized gadget that materialized in a Korubo village and plays audios spoken by an American Baptist.

The Korubo are members of a recently contacted group of indigenous people known for their war clubs. According to the investigation, the device is now in the hands of a Korubo woman named Mayá.

The device is reportedly called “Messenger,” and the Baptist organization In Touch Ministries donates them to “unreached” people around the world, as reported by the investigation. In fact, their website clearly features what seems to be a version of the device, along with a whole host of similar gadgets.

“What began with a solar-powered audio player containing the Bible and Dr. Stanley's messages is now much more than a device,” reads the website. “Wherever we go, we look for the right solution at the right time—whether it's one of our proprietary devices or another tool—to make sure the message of salvation in Jesus Christ is accessible to those who have never heard.”

In Touch Ministries' chief operating officer Seth Grey, however, told The Guardian that while he knew of missionaries from other organizations who bring Messengers to regions where it is illegal to do so, “we [In Touch staff] don't go anywhere we're not allowed.”

In case anyone forgot since the last time we reported on Westerners trying to contact isolated tribal people, such contact could transmit devastating diseases to communities with little to no immunity to them. Of course, this risk is higher in the case of direct physical contact, as opposed to leaving gadgets outdoors, but it's still in violation of Brazil's public policy for the protection of isolated indigenous peoples of not establishing contact.

Good news for the American semiconductor industry.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The trade agreement signed by the U.S. President and the President of the European Commission earlier this week imposes a 15% tariff on virtually all goods made in Europe and shipped to America, except several groups of products that include semiconductor production equipment, which will be subject to zero-for-zero tariffs. As a result, tools made by companies like ASML will not get more expensive in the U.S.

"We have also agreed on zero-for-zero tariffs on a number of strategic products," a statement by the European Commission reads. "This includes all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generics, semiconductor equipment, certain agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials. And we will keep working to add more products to this list."

If the U.S. imposed a 15% tariff on equipment produced by ASML, which includes DUV and EUV lithography tools, metrology tools, and inspection tools, this would have a serious impact on chipmakers in the U.S., specifically on Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung, Texas Instruments, and TSMC. We've reached out to ASML for comment on the situation.

For example, one of ASML's advanced immersion DUV (ArF) tool used for sub-10nm process technologies costs $89.615 million per unit on average (based on the company's Q2 2025 results), whereas a Low-NA EUV machine is priced around $265 million depending on configuration (based on the company's Q1 2025 results*). An additional 15% tariff would increase the costs of these systems to $103 million and $305 million, respectively. In fact, as the U.S. dollar has fallen quite significantly against the euro since early February, this has already made EU-made fab tools more expensive for American semiconductor producers, so an additional 15% tariff would be quite impactful.

If the U.S. had imposed a 15% tariff on ASML's lithography, metrology, and inspection equipment, it would have significantly raised costs for domestic chipmakers — adding roughly $13 million to each DUV tool and up to $40 million per EUV machine — meaning hundreds of millions of additional costs per advanced fab, such as those built by Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. While GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments do not buy EUV systems, they would still have to invest significantly more money in new fabs than they expected originally.

This would have made U.S.-based semiconductor production less competitive globally, potentially discouraging investment in American fabs, and either eating margins of companies that produce chips in the U.S., or shifting advanced manufacturing back to Asia. The tariff exemption included in the trade agreement preserves the cost-effectiveness of U.S. fab expansion.

In July 1925—exactly a century ago—famed physicist Werner Heisenberg wrote a letter to his equally famous colleague, Wolfgang Pauli. In it, Heisenberg confesses that his “views on mechanics have become more radical with each passing day,” requesting Pauli's prompt feedback on an attached manuscript he's considering whether to “complete…or to burn.”

That was the Umdeutung (reinterpretation) paper, which set the foundation for a more empirically verifiable version of quantum mechanics. For that reason, scientists consider Umdeutung's publication date as quantum mechanics's official birthday. To commemorate this 100th anniversary, Nature asked 1,101 physicists for their take on the field's most fiercely debated questions, revealing that, as in the past, the field of quantum physics remains a hot mess.

Published today, the survey shows that physicists rarely converge on their interpretations of quantum mechanics and are often unsure about their answers. They tend to see eye-to-eye on two points: that a more intuitive, physical interpretation of math in quantum mechanics is valuable (86%), and that, perhaps ironically, quantum theory itself will eventually be replaced by a more complete theory (75%). A total of 15,582 physicists were contacted, of which 1,101 responded, giving the survey a 7% response rate. Of the 1,101, more than 100 respondents sent additional written answers with their takes on the survey's questions. 

Participants were asked to name their favored interpretation of the measurement problem, a long-standing conundrum in quantum theory regarding the uncertainty of quantum states in superposition. No clear majority emerged from the options given. The frontrunner, with 36%, was the Copenhagen interpretation, in which (very simply) quantum worlds are distinct from classical ones, and particles in quantum states only gain properties when they're measured by an observer in the classical realm.

It's worth noting that detractors of the Copenhagen interpretation scathingly refer to it as the “shut up and calculate” approach. That's because it often glosses over weedy details for more practical pursuits, which, to be fair, is really powerful for things like quantum computing. However, more than half of physicists who chose the Copenhagen interpretation admitted they weren't too confident in their answers, evading follow-up questions asking them to elaborate. 

Still, more than half of the respondents, 64%, demonstrated a “healthy following” of several other, more radical viewpoints. These included information-based approaches (17%), many worlds (15%), and the Bohm-de Broglie pilot wave theory (7%). Meanwhile, 16% of respondents submitted written answers that either rejected all options, claimed we don't need any interpretations, or offered their personal takes on the best interpretation of quantum mechanics. 

So, much like many other endeavors in quantum mechanics, we'll just have to see what sticks (or more likely, what doesn't).

Physicists who discussed the results with Nature had mixed feelings about whether the lack of consensus is concerning. Elise Crull at the City University of New York, for instance, told Nature that the ambiguity suggests “people are taking the question of interpretations seriously.”

Experts at the cross-section of philosophy and physics were more critical. Tim Maudlin, a philosopher of physics at New York University, told Gizmodo that the survey's categorization of certain concepts is misleading and conducive to contradictory answers—a discrepancy that the respondents don't seem to have realized, he said. “I think the main takeaway from this is that physicists do not think clearly—and have not formed strongly held views—about foundational issues in quantum theory,” commented Maudlin, my professor in graduate school.

In an email to Gizmodo, Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins who responded to the survey, expressed similar concerns. Several factors may be behind this lack of consensus, he said, but there's a prevalent view that it “doesn't matter as long as we can calculate experimental predictions,” which he said is “obviously wrong.”

“It would be reasonable if we thought we otherwise knew the final theory of physics and had no outstanding puzzles,” added Carroll, who was part of an expert group consulted for the survey. “But nobody thinks that.”

“It's just embarrassing that we don't have a story to tell people about what reality is,” admitted Carlton Caves, a theoretical physicist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque who participated in the survey, in Nature's report. 

However, the survey's results do seem to hint at a general belief in the importance of a solid theoretical groundwork, with almost half of the participants agreeing that physics departments don't give sufficient attention to quantum foundations. On the other hand, 58% of participants answered that experimental results will help inform which theory ends up being “the one.”

For better or worse, the survey represents the lively, fast-developing field of quantum science—which, if you've been following our coverage, can get really, really weird. A lack of explanation or consensus isn't necessarily bad science—it's just future science. After all, quantum mechanics, for all its complexity, remains one of the most experimentally verified theories in the history of science.

It's fascinating to see how these experts can disagree so wildly about quantum mechanics, yet still offer solid evidence to support their views. Sometimes, there's no right or bad answer—just different ones.

For you fellow quantum enthusiasts, I highly recommend that you check out the full report for the entire account of how and where physicists were split. You can also find the original survey, the methodology, and an anonymized version of all the answers at the end of the report. 

And if you do take the survey, or at least part of it, feel free to share your answers. Oh, and let me know whether you believe Heisenberg should have burned Umdeutung after all.

Up to 18TB of extra DDR5 per server.

RAM capacity tends to be a bottleneck for numerous AI applications, but adding memory to host systems is sometimes not possible or complicated, so Enfabrica, a startup supported by Nvidia, has invented its Emfasys system that can add terabytes of DDR5 memory to any server using an Ethernet connection. The memory pool over the Ethernet system is designed for large-scale inference workloads and is currently tested with select clients.

Enfabrica's Emfasys system is a rack-compatible system based on the company's ACF-S SuperNIC with a 3.2 Tb/s (400 GB/s) throughput. It connects up to 18 TB of DDR5 memory with CXL on top. The memory pool can be accessed by 4-way and 8-way GPU servers through standard 400G or 800G Ethernet ports using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Ethernet, so adding an Emfasys system to almost any AI server is seamless.



Data movement between GPU servers and the Emfasys memory pool is done using RDMA, which allows zero-copy, low-latency memory (measured in microseconds) access without CPU intervention using the CXL.mem protocol. Of course, to access the Emfasys memory pool, servers require memory-tiering software (that masks transfer delays among other things), provided or enabled by Enfabrica. This software runs on existing hardware and OS environments and builds upon widely adopted RDMA interfaces, so deployment of the pool is fairly easy and does not require any major architectural changes.



Enfabrica's Emfasys is meant to address growing memory requirements of modern AI use cases that use increasingly long prompts, large context windows, or multiple agents. These workloads place significant pressure on GPU-attached HBM, which is both limited and expensive. By using an external memory pool, data center operators can flexibly expand the memory of an individual AI server, which makes sense for the aforementioned scenarios.

By using the Emfasys memory pool, owners of AI servers improve efficiency as compute resources are better utilized, expensive GPU memory is not wasted, and overall infrastructure costs can be reduced. According to Enfabrica, this setup can lower the cost per AI-generated token by as much as 50% in high-turn and long-context scenarios. Token generation tasks can also be distributed across servers more evenly, which will eliminate bottlenecks.

"AI inference has a memory bandwidth-scaling problem and a memory margin-stacking problem," said Rochan Sankar, CEO of Enfabrica. "As inference gets more agentic versus conversational, more retentive versus forgetful, the current ways of scaling memory access won't hold. We built Emfasys to create an elastic, rack-scale AI memory fabric and solve these challenges in a way that has not been done before. Customers are excited to partner with us to build a far more scalable memory movement architecture for their GenAI workloads and drive even better token economics."

The Emfasys AI memory fabric system and the 3.2 Tb/s ACF SuperNIC chip are currently being evaluated and tested by select customers. It is unclear when general availability is planned, if at all.

In 2023, Mitchell Miller, a sleep medicine doctor based in Clearwater, Florida, received a visit from an unusual patient.

While Miller is accustomed to seeing people with sleep apnea—a persistent condition in which people stop breathing dozens or even hundreds of times during the night, causing disturbed sleep and daytime exhaustion—it is most common in men, particularly those who are overweight or obese and in their forties and fifties.

This patient was a 33-year-old woman of slight build who was also suffering from the telltale signs of daytime fatigue. Unlike Miller's usual patients, she had Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), the medical term for a group of genetic disorders that affect the strength and elasticity of various muscles, joints, and tissues, often bestowing individuals with exceptional flexibility.

EDS is estimated to affect 1.5 million people worldwide, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. One of the lesser-known health conditions associated with the disorder is sleep apnea: Patients with EDS face a sixfold increased risk compared to the general population.

“We rely on muscle tone and elasticity to maintain our airway while asleep,” says Miller. “EDS causes increased laxity or looseness in various tissues, including the throat or the tongue, which makes them more prone to blocking the airway during sleep.”

Tests revealed that Miller's patient was experiencing up to 24 apnea events per hour. While five or fewer events per hour is considered normal, patients with moderate to severe apnea can experience 15 to 30 or more disruptions. But knowing the underlying cause of her trouble gave Miller an idea: by implanting a device in the patient's chest, he could send mild electrical pulses to a nerve controlling tongue movement—pushing it forward and keeping the airway open during sleep.

The results of this experimental therapy, known as hyperglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS), were so remarkable that Miller felt compelled to publish the case study. One of the advantages of HGNS is that once implanted, a patient can turn the device on themselves before going to sleep using a remote control, then switch it off in the morning. Miller's patient “had a complete resolution of her sleep apnea,” he says. Two years on, she remains symptom-free.

In recent years, the need for better approaches to treating sleep apnea has become increasingly apparent. Studies have linked uncontrolled apnea in midlife to a range of chronic diseases including stroke, sudden heart failure and hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and even dementia. While the gold standard therapy is a ventilator-like device known as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine—which pumps air into the throat to keep the airway open—research suggests only 30 percent of people are able to keep using CPAP long term due to factors including claustrophobia from needing to wear a mask in bed or difficulty sleeping due to the machine's persistent hum. Miller says that his patient initially tried CPAP therapy but could not tolerate it.

“There's definitely a need for less cumbersome treatments,” says Thomas Gaisl, a pulmonologist at University Hospital Zurich studying sleep apnea. “Most people would be more willing to take a pill than use CPAP on a daily basis.”

But the search for such a pill—or indeed any treatment as effective as CPAP—has proved challenging. Dozens of drugs have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials, and while HGNS was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014, Miller says that its rollout has been limited, as many doctors are uncertain about the risk-to-benefit trade-off. “The device is quite costly, and the implantation requires a surgical procedure,” he explains, which comes with added risk to the patient. “As with any new technology, there is often a lag in acceptance from both the medical community and insurers.”

It's unlikely that a single therapy will be found as an alternative to CPAP, Gaisl argues, because sleep apnea isn't one single disease—rather, a diverse cluster of conditions. Obesity is known to be one of the major risk factors—and the weight-loss drug tirzepatide has recently been licensed as a sleep apnea therapy—because excess fat around the neck and upper body can obstruct the airway and cause pauses in breathing. But there are many other causes, some of which are only recently coming to light. Researchers are now beginning to understand the impact of ethnicity on sleep apnea, for example, with patients in Asia at heightened risk.

Sleep apnea is resultant of “a mosaic of different things, not just obesity,” says Gaisl. “We're increasingly seeing that different subgroups benefit most from more personalized approaches.”

This recognition has led researchers to focus more on the EDS population. Gaisl estimates that simply having EDS is equivalent to increasing your BMI by 11 points in terms of the likelihood of developing sleep apnea. That's because the genes linked to EDS affect the structure of so-called “matrix proteins” like collagen and elastin, which provide the framework for the body's connective tissues—everything from skin to tendons, muscles, and ligaments.

“Collagen is an integral part of almost all tissues, including those which form the airway,” says Karim Ghobrial-Sedky, an adjunct professor at Drexel University and a sleep specialist who has treated EDS patients with sleep apnea. “In EDS, it's this abnormality in collagen which makes the airway more prone to collapsing when the person is taking a breath.”

Because of this, researchers believe that EDS sleep apnea patients are especially suited to treatments targeting muscles in the tongue and throat—like Miller's HGNS, or a newer drug combination under development by a company called Apnimed. Based on the discovery that two compounds, atomoxetine and aroxybutynin, could work in synergy to improve upper airway muscle tone and reduce airway muscle relaxation during sleep, Apnimed has been shown in a clinical trial to reduce instances of sleep apnea by 56 percent. “People with hypermobility are a prime target cohort for these kinds of therapies,” says Gaisl.

While EDS was long considered rare, recent studies suggest genetic hypermobility may affect as many as 1 in 500 people, with women disproportionately affected. Gaisl believes the underlying biology behind these conditions also offers clues for explaining other subtypes of sleep apnea. In his view, the genetics of EDS actively mirrors the damage which other people are inadvertently inflicting on their matrix proteins through behaviors and environmental stresses like smoking, chronic inflammation, excessive dietary sugar and the aging process itself, heightening their risk of sleep apnea through midlife.

“EDS is a kind of natural experiment which is giving us insights into some of the key biological mechanisms behind sleep apnea that are masked in the general population,” says Gaisl.

Such individuals could benefit more from targeted therapies like HGNS or Apnimed's drug combination, compared with patients whose apnea is primarily driven by weight gain or underlying breathing abnormalities. Newer diagnostics are applying AI algorithms to patients' sleep data, pinpointing key patterns that suggest a specific type of airway collapse. In the future, these tools could help clinicians to identify such people both faster and more accurately, as well as individuals with undiagnosed hypermobility. These insights could then be used to tailor their treatment.

As researchers learn more about the role of matrix proteins in EDS-related sleep apnea, it could even pave the way for entirely new treatments in future.

Matrix proteins “really point to the importance of collagen in maintaining the airway during sleep,” says Gaisl. “This opens up a new avenue for therapeutics which perhaps target how the connective tissues are impacted over time, causing sleep apnea—treatments which could ultimately benefit a much broader range of patients.”

This is the worst dark pattern on subscription I have seen of any service I have ever paid for!Anthropic had a fairly positive image in my head until they cut off my access and are not giving me a way to cancel my plan.Edit: after mucking with the Stripe credit card payment options I found a cancel plan button underneath the list of all invoices. So there is an option, I just had a harder time finding it then I have had with other services. Successfully cancelled!

Gemini Advanced offered 2.5 Pro with nearly unlimited rate limits, then nerfed it to 100/day.OpenAI silently nerfed the maximum context window of reasoning models in their Pro plan.Accompanying the nerf is usually a psy op, like nerfing to 50/day then increasing it to 100/day so the anchoring effect reduces the grievance.It's a smart ploy because as much as we like to say there's no moat, the user does face provider switching costs (time and effort), which serves as a mini-moat for status quo provider.So providers have an incentive to rope people in with a loss leader, and then rug pull once they gained market share. Maybe 40% of the top 5% of Claude users are now too accustomed to their Claude-based workflows, and inertia will keep them as customers, but now they're using the more expensive API instead. Anthropic won.Modern bait and switch, although done intelligently so no laws are broken.

To the degree there is a moat, I do not think it will be effective at keeping people in. I had already been somewhat disillusioned with the AI hype, but now I am also disillusioned with the company who I thought was the best actor in the space. I am happy that there is unlikely to be a dominant single winner like there was for web search or for operating systems. That is, unless there's a significant technological jump, rather than the same gradual improvement that all the AI companies are making.

When a provider gets memory working well, I expect them to use this to be a huge moat - ie. they won't let you migrate the memories, because rather than being human readable words they'll be unintelligible vectors.I imagine they'll do the same via API so that the network has a memory of all previous requests for the same user.

I'm not sure what harm you think you're suffering from, and what a proper remedy might be, if you think it's illegal. I don't know if I would go that far, as there are all kinds of words most terms of service use to somehow make it so that you have already acknowledged and agreed to whatever they decide to do.

The basic nature of my job is to maintain the tallest tower of complexity I can without it falling over, so I need to take complexity and find ways to confine it to places where I have some way of knowing that it can't hurt me. LLMs just don't do that. A leaky abstraction is just a layer of indirection, while a true abstraction (like a properly implemented high-level language) is among the most valuable things in CS. Programming is theory-building!

But... what else? These things are rare. It's not like there's a new thing that comes along every few years and we all have to jump on or be left behind, and LLMs are the latest. There's definitely a new thing that comes along every few years and people say we have to jump on or be left behind, but it almost never bears out. Many of those ended up being useful, but not essential.I see no indication that LLMs or associated tooling are going to be like compilers and version control where you pretty much can't find anyone making a living in the field without them. I can see them being like IDEs or debuggers or linters where they can be handy but plenty of people do fine without them.

I believe that at some point, AI will get good enough that most companies will eventually stop hiring someone that doesn't utilize AI. Because most companies are just making crud (pun intended).
It'll be like specialized programming languages. Some will exist, and they may get paid a lot more, but most people won't fall into that category.
As much as we like to puff ourselves up, our profession isn't really that hard. There are a relative handful of people doing some really cool, novel things. Some larger number doing some cool things that aren't really novel, just done very nicely. And the majority of programmers are the rest of us. We are not special.What I don't know is the timing. I don't expect it to be within 5 years (though I think it will _start_ in that time), but I do expect it within my career.

Just as the developer who refused to adopt version control, IDEs, or Stack Overflow eventually became unemployable, those who reject tools that fundamentally expand their problem-solving capacity will find themselves unable to compete with those who can architect solutions across larger possibility spaces on smaller teams.Will it be used for absolutely every problem? No - There are clearly places where humans are needed.But rejecting the enormous impact this will have on the workforce is trading hype goggles for a bucket of sand.

This passage forces me to concluse that this comment is sarcasm. Neither IDEs nor the use of Stack Overflow is anywhere near a requirement for being a professional programmer. Surely you realize there are people out there who are happily employed while still using stock Vim or Emacs? Surely you realize there are people out there who solve problems simply by reading the docs and thinking deeply rather than asking SO?The usage of LLM assistance will not become a requirement for employment, at least not for talented programmers. A company gating on the use of LLMs would be preposterously self-defeating.

AI presently has a far lower footprint on the globe than the meat industry -- The US Beef industry alone far outpaces the impact of AI.As far as "work pillaging" - There is cognitive dissonance in supporting the freedom of information/cultural progress and simultaneously desiring to restrict a transformative use (as it has been deemed by multiple US judges) of that information.We don't see eye to eye, and I think that's ok. We can re-evaluate our predictions in a year!

Beef has the benefit of seeing an end, though. Populations are stabilizing, and people are only ever going to eat so much. As methane has a 12 year life, in a stable environment the methane emissions today simply replace the emissions from 12 years ago. The carbon lifecycle of animals is neutral, so that is immaterial. It is also easy to fix if we really have to go to extremes: Cull all the cattle and in 12 years it is all gone!Whereas AI, even once stabilized, theoretically has no end to its emissions. Emissions that are essentially permanent, so even if you shut down all AI when you have to take extreme measures, the effects will remain "forever". There is always hope that we'll use technology to avoid that fate, but you know how that usually goes...

I don't know how else one gets information and forms an opinion on the technology except for media consumption or hands-on experience. Note that I count "social media" as media.My proposition is that without hands-on experience, your information is limited to media narratives, and it seems like the "AI is net bad" narrative seems to be the source of perspectives.Skepticism is warranted, and there are a million ways this technology could be built for terrible ends.But, I'm of the opinion that:
A) The technology is not hype, and is getting better
B) That it can, and will, be built -- Time horizon debatable.
C) That for it to result in good outcomes for humanity, it requires good people to help shape it in its formative years.If anything, more people like you need to be engaging it to have grounded perspectives on what it could become.

Okay, I think I got your intent better, thanks for clarifying.You can add discussion with other people outside software media, or opinion pieces outside media (I would not include personal blogs in "media" for instance, but would not be bothered if someone did), including people who tried and people who didn't.

It would be also frightening: the risk that, as a good person, you help shape a monster.The only way out I can see is inventing the thing that will make LLMs irrelevant, but also don't have their fatal flaws. That's quite the undertaking though.We'd not be competing on an equal footing: LLM providers have been doing things I would never have dared even considering: ingesting considerable amount of source materials completely disregarding their licenses, hammering everyone servers, spending a crazy amount of energy, sourcing a crazy amount of (very closed) hardware, burning an insane amount of money even on paid plans.

There's also a clear difference between users of this site that come here for all types of content, and users who have "AI" in their usernames.I think that the latter type might just have a bit of a bias in this matter?

I'm not sure, I frequently use LLMs for well-scoped math-heavy functions (mostly for game development) where I don't neccessarly understand what's going on inside the function, but I know what output I expect given some inputs, so it's easy for me to kind of blackbox test it with unit tests and iterate on the "magic" inside with an LLM.I guess if I really stopped and focused on math for a year or two I'd be able to code that myself too, but every time I tried to get deeper into math it's either way too complex for me to feel like it's time well spent, and it's also boring. So why bother?

The use cases of these GPT tools are extremely limited. They demo well and are quite useful for highly documented workflows (E.G. they are very good at creating basic HTML/JS layouts and functionality).However, even the most advanced GPT tools fall flat on their face when you start working with any sort of bleeding edge, or even just less-ubiquitous technology.

The Godot engine is an open-source project that has matured significantly since GPT tools hit the market.The GPTs don't know what the new Godot features are, and there is a training gap that I'm not sure Open AI and their competitors will ever be able to overcome.Do you work on web applications?

Godot with AI was definitely a worse experience than usual for me. I did not use the Godot editor. It seems like the development flow for Godot however is based around it. Scenes were generated through a Python script, which was of course written by Claude Code. Personally, I reviewed no line of code during the process.My findings afterwards are;1) Code quality was not good. Personally I have a year of experience working with Unity and online the code examples tend to be of incredibly poor quality. My guess is if AI is trained on the online corpus of game development forums, the output should be absolutely terrible. For the field of game development especially AI is tainted with this poor quality. It did indeed not follow modern practices, even after having hooked up a context MCP which provides code examples.2) It was able to refactor the codebase to modern practices upon instructing it to; I told it to figure out what modern practices were and to apply them; it started making modifications like adding type hints and such. Commonly you would use predefined rules for this with an LLM tool, I did not use any for my experiment. That would be a one-time task after which the AI will prefer your way of working. An example for Godot can be found here: https://github.com/sanjeed5/awesome-cursor-rules-mdc/blob/ma...3) It was very difficult to debug for Claude Code. The platform seems to require working with a dedicated editor, and the flow for debugging is either through that editor or by launching the game and interacting with it.

With Claude I can even write IC10 code. (with a bit of help and understanding of how Claude works)IC10 is a fictional, MIPS-like CPU in the game Stationeers. So that's pretty promising for most other things.

I just use "AI" instead of Google/SO when I need to find something out.So far it mostly answers correctly, until the truthful answer comes close to "you can't do that". Then it goes off the rails and makes up shit. As a bonus, it seems to confuse related but less popular topics and mixes them up. Specific example, it mixes couchdb and couchbase when I ask about features.The worst part is 'correctly' means 'it will work but it will be tutorial level crap'. Sometimes that's okay, sometimes it isn't.So it's not that it doesn't work for my flow, it's that I can't trust it without verifying everything so what flow?Edit: there's a codebase that i would love to try an "AI" on... if i wouldn't have to send my customer's code to $random_server with $random_security with $untrustable_promises_of_privacy. Considering how these "AI"s have been trained, I'm sure any promise that my code stays private is worth less than used toilet paper.Gut feeling is the "AI" would be useless because it's a not-invented-here codebase with no discussion on StackOverflow.

I see people starting to unlearn working by themselves rapidly and becoming dependant on GPT, making themselves quite useless in the process. They no longer understand what they're working with and need the help from the tool to work. They're also entirely helpless when whatever 'AI' tool they use can't fix their problem.This makes them both more replaceable and less marketable than before.It will have and already has a huge impact. But it's kinda like the offshoring hype from a decade ago.
Everyone moved their dev departments to a cheaper country, only to later realize that maybe cheap does not always mean better or even good. And it comes with a short term gain and a long term loss.

Nothing in our world is truly unlimited. Digital services and assets have different costs than their physical counterparts, but that just means different limits, not a lack of them. Electrical supply, compute capacity, and storage are all physical things with real world limits to how much they can do.These realities eventually manifest when someone tries to build an "unlimited" service on top of limited components, similar to how you can't build a service with 99.999% reliability when it has a critical piece that can only get to 99.9%.

Repairs have always come with deductibles.This is standard in virtually every insurance program. There are a lot of studies showing that even the tiniest amount of cost sharing completely changes how people use a service.When something is unlimited and free, it enticed people to abuse it in absurd ways. With hardware, you would get people intentionally damaging their gear to get new versions for free because they know it costs them nothing.

The main HN thread yesterday was full of comments complaining about losing unlimited access.It's so weird to watch people get angry about thinking they're losing something they never had. Even Anthropic said less than 5% of accounts would even notice the new limits, yet I've seen countless comments raging that “everyone must suffer” due to the actions of a few abusing the system.

Some facts for sanity:1- The poster of this blog article is Kilocode who makes a (worse) competitor to Claude Code. They are definitely capitalizing on this drama as much as they can. I've been getting hit by Reddit ads all day from Kilocode, all blasting Anthropic, with the false claim that their plan was "unlimited".2- No one has any idea yet what the new limits will be, or how much usage it actually takes to be in the top 5% to be affected. The limits go into effect in a few days. We'll see then if all the drama was warranted.

Can you really ever compete when you are renting someone else's GPUs?Can you really ever compete when you are going up against custom silicon built and deployed at scale to run inference at scale (i.e. TPUs built to run Gemini and deployed by the tens-of-thousands in data centers around the globe)?Meta and Google have deep pockets and massive existing world-class infrastructure (at least for Google, Meta probably runs their php Facebook thing on a few VPS dotted around in some random colos /s ) .

When companies sell unlimited plans, they're making a bet that the average usage across all of those plans will be low enough to turn a profit.These people “abusing” the plan are well within their right to use the API as much as they want. It just didn't fall into the parameters Anthropic had expected.LLM subscriptions need to go away, why can't we just pay as we go? It's the fairest way for everyone.

Because Claude Code is absolutely impossible to use without a subscription? I'm fine with being limited, but I'm not with having to pay more than $200/monthAnybody that feels they're not getting enough out of their subscription is welcome to use API instead.

When some users burn massive amounts of compute just to climb leaderboards or farm karma, it's not hard to imagine why providers might respond with tighter limits—not because it's ideal, but because that kind of behavior makes platforms harder to sustain and less accessible for everyone else. Because on the other hand a lot of genuine customers are canceling because they get API overload message after paying $200.I still think caps are frustrating and often too blunt, but posts like that make it easier to see where the pressure might be coming from.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lqrbnc/you_deser...

Anthropic never sold Max plans as unlimited.  There are two tiers, explicitly labeled "5x" and "20x", both referring to the increased usage over what you get with Pro.

Claude Max, to my knowledge, was never marketed as "unlimited". Claude Max gives you WAY more tokens then $100/$200 would buy. When you get rate limited, you have the option to just use the API. Overall, you will have gotten more value than just using the API alone.And you always had, and continue to have, the option of just using the API directly. Go nuts.The author sounds like a petulant child. It's embarrassing, honestly.

Differentiation through honesty: In a market full of fluff, directness stands out. Customers might respect a brand more for telling the truth plainly, even if the truth isn't ideal.The risk: It could scare off some customers who don't read the fine print anyway. But that may not be a loss—it might actually filter in the right kind of customer, the one who wants to know what they're really getting.

I find out about changes on Twitter/HN before I hear about them from Anthropic.I love the Claude Code product, but Anthropic the company is definitely nudging me to go back to OpenAI.This is also why competition is great though - if one company had a monopoly the pricing and UX would be 20x worse.

you can see here in this Reddit thread from April, when Claude Max was launched, that it was explicitly explained as being limited: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jvbpek/breaking_...Max is described as "5-20x more than Pro", clearly indicating both are limited.here's their launch blog post: https://www.anthropic.com/news/max-plan> The new Max plan delivers exactly that. With up to 20x higher usage limits, you can maintain momentum on your most demanding projects with little disruption.obviously everyone wants everything for free, or cheap, and no one wants prices to change in a way that might not benefit them, but the endless whinging from people about how unfair it is that anthropic is limiting access to their products sold as coming with limited access is really extremely tedious even by HN standards.and as pointed out dozens of times in these threads, if your actual worry is running out of usage in a week or month, Anthropic has you covered - you can just pay per token by giving Claude Code an API key.  doing that 24/7 will cost ~100x what Max does though, I wonder if that's a useful bit of info about the situation or not?

New research published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) finds that prolonged and/or repeated exposure to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) anesthetic agents (sevoflurane, propofol) for infants in the first two months of life resulted in an accelerated maturation of brain electrical activity patterns evoked by visual stimuli when recorded at 2-5 months of age, compared to infants who did not have early general anesthesia exposure. These findings may suggest the use of non-GABA-active anesthetics for the newborn age-range. To address such concerns, a large multicenter clinical trial (called TREX) is currently in progress using a combination of anesthetic agents in order to minimize exposure to GABA-active anesthetics. 

This paper is the fourth in a series emerging from a prospective longitudinal study known as the General Anesthesia and Brain Activity (GABA) Study, led by researchers at Boston Children's Hospital and Northeastern University. This newest paper is the primary translational publication of the GABA Study which is a first direct test in humans of a finding first made in mice that GABA triggers critical trajectories of brain development (Hensch et al, Science 1998; Hensch and Fagiolini, Nature 2000). The PNAS paper represents a proof-of-principle translation into human neurodevelopment from a well-established mechanism that governs neuroplasticity and development in animal models. This translational effort opens up new and important insights into individual variability in developmental timing toward serving a range of clinical populations.

 These findings build on previous work published in British Journal of Anesthesia-Open that found infants who received early and prolonged anesthesia exposure showed no statistically significant differences in a wide range of basic cognitive, language, motor, and behavioral domains when assessed at 10 months and 2–3 years old.

The accelerated visual cortical development at 2-3 and 4-5 months reported in the PNAS paper, combined with the reassuring neurodevelopmental findings at 10 months and 2-3 years in the BJA Open paper highlight the resilience of the highly plastic human infant nervous system. Further research is needed to explore the long-term impacts of prolonged and/or repeated early exposure by school age.

In a small trial, Mass General Brigham researchers found a drug designed to treat Celiac disease supported a more rapid return to normal activities for patients following COVID.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that can occur after a COVID-19 infection, presenting as high fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and life-threatening cardiac injury. A small, randomized clinical trial led by Mass General Brigham investigators found the oral drug larazotide-an experimental drug originally designed to treat Celiac disease-was both safe and effective in treating children with MIS-C. Their results are published in Science Translational Medicine.

While our study is small, its results are powerful and have implications not only for MIS-C, but potentially for long COVID. Our findings suggest that larazotide is safe and quickly resolves symptoms in children with MIS-C. We are now running a clinical trial to test whether larazotide may also be a useful therapy to treat patients with long COVID."

Lael Yonker, MD, lead author, co-director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center, Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutic Development Center, and Pulmonary Genetics Clinic at Mass General Brigham for Children

Current MIS-C treatments are limited. Some patients receive general anti-inflammatory drugs, but many experience a rebound of symptoms after completing a course. Such drugs are not designed to target the sticky SARS-CoV-2 viral particles that may persist in the gut. Enter larazotide, an orally administered drug that does target the gut. Larazotide strengthens intestinal barriers to limit the number of materials-like SARS-CoV-2 viral particles-that exit the intestines and enter circulation.

To test larazotide's efficacy and safety as an MIS-C treatment, researchers conducted a double-blind clinical trial with 12 children experiencing early-stage MIS-C. The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health. Each patient randomly received either a placebo or larazotide four times daily for 21 days, then was tracked over six months of recovery. Children who received larazotide showed faster resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, faster clearance of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, and more rapid return to normal activities. The findings demonstrate larazotide may be a safe and promising treatment option for children with MIS-C.

To enable early diagnosis of acute illnesses and effective management of chronic conditions, point-of-care testing (POCT) technology—diagnostics conducted near the patient—is drawing global attention. The key to POCT lies in enzymes that recognize and react precisely with specific substances. However, traditional natural enzymes are expensive and unstable, and nanozymes (enzyme-mimicking catalysts) have suffered from low reaction selectivity. Now, a Korean research team has developed a high-sensitivity sensor platform that achieves 38 times higher selectivity than existing nanozymes and allows disease diagnostics visible to the naked eye within just 3 minutes.

On the 28th, KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that Professor Jinwoo Lee's research team from the Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, in collaboration with teams led by Professor Jeong Woo Han at Seoul National University and Professor Moon Il Kim at Gachon University, has developed a new single-atom catalyst that selectively performs only peroxidase-like reactions while maintaining high reaction efficiency.

Using bodily fluids such as blood, urine, or saliva, this diagnostic platform enables test results to be read within minutes even outside hospital settings—greatly improving medical accessibility and ensuring timely treatment. The key lies in the visual detection of biomarkers (disease indicators) through color changes triggered by enzyme reactions. However, natural enzymes are expensive and easily degraded in diagnostic environments, limiting their storage and distribution.

To address this, inorganic nanozyme materials have been developed as substitutes. Yet, they typically lack selectivity—when hydrogen peroxide is used as a substrate, the same catalyst triggers both peroxidase-like reactions (which cause color change) and catalase-like reactions (which remove the substrate), reducing diagnostic signal accuracy.

To control catalyst selectivity at the atomic level, the researchers used an innovative structural design: attaching chlorine (Cl) ligands in a three-dimensional configuration to the central ruthenium (Ru) atom to fine-tune its chemical properties. This enabled them to isolate only the desired diagnostic signal.

Experimental results showed that the new catalyst achieved over 38-fold improvement in selectivity compared to existing nanozymes, with significantly increased sensitivity and speed in detecting hydrogen peroxide. Even in near-physiological conditions (pH 6.0), the catalyst maintained its performance, proving its applicability in real-world diagnostics.

By incorporating the catalyst and oxidase into a paper-based sensor, the team created a system that could simultaneously detect four key biomarkers related to health: glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and choline—all with a simple color change.

This platform is broadly applicable across various disease diagnostics and can deliver results within 3 minutes without complex instruments or pH adjustments. The findings show that diagnostic performance can be dramatically improved without changing the platform itself, but rather by engineering the catalyst structure.

Professor Jinwoo Lee of KAIST commented, "This study is significant in that it simultaneously achieves enzyme-level selectivity and reactivity by structurally designing single-atom catalysts." He added that "the structure-function-based catalyst design strategy can be extended to the development of various metal-based catalysts and other reaction domains where selectivity is critical."

Seonhye Park and Daeeun Choi, both Ph.D. candidates at KAIST, are co-first authors. The research was published on July 6, 2025, in the prestigious journal Advanced Materials.

A new technology that harnesses AI to analyze mammograms and improve the accuracy of predicting a woman's personalized five-year risk of developing breast cancer has received Breakthrough Device designation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Developed by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, the software has been licensed to Prognosia Inc., a WashU startup company.

The system analyzes mammograms to produce a risk score estimating the likelihood that a woman will develop breast cancer over the next five years. The technology is compatible with both types of mammogram imaging available: the four 2D views of the breast produced by full-field digital mammography and the synthetic 3D view of the breast produced by digital breast tomosynthesis. Importantly, the system produces an absolute five-year risk that makes it possible to compare a woman's risk to an average risk based on national breast cancer incidence rates. This provides a meaningful estimate that is aligned with the U.S. national risk reduction guidelines, so that clinicians will know what steps to take next if a woman's risk is elevated.

The FDA Breakthrough Device designation provides an expedited review process for full market approval in an effort to give patients and clinicians accelerated access to new medical devices. Products that receive the designation have already undergone rigorous testing and shown excellent promise in their potential to improve treatment or the diagnosis of debilitating or life-threatening conditions.

The software package, called Prognosia Breast, was developed by Graham A. Colditz, MD, DrPH, the Niess-Gain Professor of Surgery at WashU Medicine and associate director of prevention and control at Siteman Cancer Center, based at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and WashU Medicine; and Shu (Joy) Jiang, PhD, an associate professor of surgery in the Division of Public Health Sciences in the Department of Surgery at WashU Medicine. Colditz and Jiang co-founded Prognosia in 2024 in collaboration with WashU's Office of Technology Management (OTM) and BioGenerator Ventures, the latter of which provided both financial support and business strategy expertise from Entrepreneur-in-Residence David Smoller, PhD.

The software is a pre-trained machine learning system that analyzes mammogram images and provides an estimate of how likely a patient is to develop breast cancer over the next five years, based solely on images and a woman's age. According to the developers, Prognosia Breast estimates a person's five-year risk of developing breast cancer 2.2 times more accurately than the standard method, which is based on questionnaires that consider factors such as age, race and family history. The system was trained on past mammograms from tens of thousands of individuals who underwent breast cancer screening through Siteman Cancer Center. Some of them went on to develop cancer, teaching the system what to look for in the earliest stages of tumor development. Such early signs of disease can't be perceived even by a well-trained human eye.

We're excited about the potential of this technology to improve risk prediction and prevention of breast cancer broadly, no matter where a woman is getting screened. The long-term goal is to make this technology available to any woman having a screening mammogram anywhere in the world. No matter the type of imaging they receive, our data show the software's potential to identify women at increased risk of developing breast cancer over the next five years, providing them with opportunities to take targeted steps to reduce that risk."

Graham A. Colditz, MD, DrPH, the Niess-Gain Professor of Surgery at WashU Medicine

The new device could have a large impact on risk prediction because the infrastructure is already in place to begin immediately using the software anywhere mammography is provided. Furthermore, many women already receive regular mammograms. According to 2023 survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 75% of women ages 50 to 74 reported having received a mammogram in the past two years.

Even with widespread screening, about 34% of breast cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed at later stages of the disease. According to the investigators, being able to assess risk up to five years in advance of the onset of cancer is likely to improve early detection, reducing the number of late-stage cancers diagnosed. Early detection has been shown to make treatment more effective and reduce deaths from breast cancer.

"Receiving a Breakthrough Device designation is a powerful validation of the extraordinary dedication and vision of this research team to improve breast cancer diagnosis and care," said Doug E. Frantz, PhD, vice chancellor for innovation and commercialization at WashU. "It takes years of concerted effort to produce software that could quickly be integrated into the workflow of any mammography center, significantly enhancing the clinical value of routine mammograms no matter where they are provided. This is a prime example of the vital role of entrepreneurship and commercialization at WashU in transforming cutting-edge research into real-world technologies that improve patient care."

The device produces a five-year risk score that is intended to complement, not replace, the analysis provided by radiologists, who will continue to review the mammograms following standard protocols. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a five-year risk score of 3% or higher is considered elevated. According to guidelines from these organizations, women with elevated scores should be referred to specialists who can further advise them on their options for additional screening and prevention strategies.

About one in eight women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Those found to be at elevated risk of this cancer have the option to receive more frequent screening - which may include other types of imaging, such as MRI - and in some cases may choose to take a type of chemotherapy called tamoxifen or endocrine therapy as preventive treatments. With such options available, identifying women at high risk is important so they have access to specialists who can help guide them in making these important choices.

The developers are planning a clinical trial at Siteman Cancer Center that will apply the risk score from Prognosia Breast in combination with the standard mammography screening protocols. Standard screening protocols include the review of mammograms and measures of breast density already provided to all patients. Individuals found to be at elevated risk will be referred to Siteman's breast health specialists, who focus on helping individuals navigate the options they have for managing high breast cancer risk.

"Despite the sophistication of today's breast imaging and its broad use for identifying existing tumors, today's risk prediction for breast cancer is still questionnaire-based and not very good at estimating future risk," Jiang said. "Our work has focused on filling that need for better methods. Moving to image-based risk prediction - which our studies have shown is much more accurate - has the potential to be revolutionary for patient care."

The current FDA designation applies to the software's analysis of mammogram images taken at a single time point. In the future, the researchers plan to update Prognosia Breast to analyze several years of mammograms from the same individual, which may further improve the accuracy of the prediction.

A current study by the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium is looking at the question of which people with Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of developing a second colorectal cancer. Researchers from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn and the University of Leipzig have now published their findings in the journal "Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology".

Lynch syndrome (LS), formerly referred to as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC), is the most common hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. It is estimated that around 300,000 people are affected in Germany alone. LS significantly increases the risk of colon cancer and other types of cancer and is responsible for up to around five percent of all colon cancers. It is caused by inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, which normally correct errors during cell division. When these genes are defective, errors accumulate in the genome, increasing the likelihood of further tumors, including metachronous colorectal cancers, even after successful initial treatment.

Researchers from Bonn and Leipzig therefore investigated risk factors for the occurrence of a second primary colorectal cancer on behalf of the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium. "Our aim is to improve the personalized care of people with Lynch syndrome," says co-senior author Prof. Dr. Jacob Nattermann, Head of the Hepatogastroenterology Section at the UKB's Medical Clinic I (Director: Prof. Christian Strassburg) and member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) "Life & Health" at the University of Bonn.

The study draws on data from the central registry of the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium and included 852 individuals with Lynch syndrome who had been diagnosed with a first colorectal cancer. Researchers examined whether variables such as age, sex, tumor location, and genetic subtype influenced the likelihood of developing a second primary colorectal tumor.. "Around one in five of the Lynch syndrome carriers studied developed a second colon cancer over the course of an average of 7.9 years," says lead author Dr. Robert Hüneburg, spokesperson for the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium and senior physician at the Medical Clinic I of the University Hospital Bonn, which is part of the Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Bonn. " This study helps refine individualized risk stratification. By systematically evaluating genetic and clinical data, we can better tailor surveillance and counseling for affected individuals."

The study found that the risk of developing a second colorectal cancer depends on which gene is altered in people with Lynch syndrome.People with changes in the MLH1 or MSH2 genes had a higher risk than those with changes in MSH6 or PMS2. This so-called genotype stratification - i.e. risk assessment according to genetic findings - is an important approach for developing individualized prevention strategies.

The analysis is based on one of the largest groups of people with Lynch syndrome examined for this question. The long-term documentation in our registry also makes it possible to map less obvious risk constellations."

Priv.-Doz. Dr. Christoph Engel, co-senior author of the study and head of the Familial Tumor Diseases working group at the Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology at Leipzig University

The results of the study underline the benefits of structured registry data for recording the clinical course of hereditary tumor syndromes. They form a basis for the further development of risk-adapted aftercare concepts.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a highly complex system that encompasses cellular components (such as cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells) and non-cellular components (such as blood vessels and signaling molecules). These diverse components engage in complex interactions with tumor cells and undergo dynamic changes during tumor progression. Specifically, intratumoral microbial metabolites play an important role on the TME. The metabolic products of these microorganisms encompass a range of bioactive molecules, including lactate, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, and inosine. These metabolites, when released into the TME, can influence immune cell function through the modulation of cytokine secretion.

Considering the significant role of intratumoral microbial metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, these bioactive compounds may substantially impact cancer immunotherapy outcomes. Although extensive research has focused on gut microbiota-derived metabolites in tumor progression and cancer treatment, it is crucial to distinguish between metabolites from intratumoral microbes and those produced by gut microbiota. In this context, this review provides a systematic analysis of the role of intratumoral microbes in the tumor microenvironment and cancer immunotherapy, specifically examining how intratumoral microbes modulate the tumor microenvironment through: 1) glucose metabolites, 2) amino acids and their metabolites, 3) lipid metabolites, and 4) other metabolites, ultimately affecting the clinical benefits of immunotherapy. Furthermore, this review presents a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms by which intratumoral microbial metabolites function in the tumor microenvironment and investigates the potential connections between these metabolites and immunotherapy efficacy, with the objective of establishing theoretical foundations and research directions for novel cancer treatment strategies, while fostering interdisciplinary integration among microbiology, oncology, and immunology.

A team of Canadian scientists has discovered a surprising new way to improve blood sugar levels and reduce liver damage: by trapping a little-known fuel made by gut bacteria before they wreak havoc on the body.

The findings, published in Cell Metabolism on July 29, 2025, could open the door to new therapies to treat metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.

Researchers at McMaster University, Université Laval and the University of Ottawa showed that a molecule produced by microbes in the gut can sneak into the bloodstream and fuel the liver to make more glucose and fat than necessary. But when researchers developed a way to trap this molecule in the gut before it enters the body, they saw dramatic improvements in blood sugar control and fatty liver disease in mice with obesity.

This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway. We've known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose - a process called the Cori cycle. What we've discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation."

Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor, Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster

In 1947, married scientists Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work showing how muscles in the body generate lactate that fuels the liver to produce blood glucose, which then cycles back to fuel the muscle. The work laid the foundation to explain how muscles use a form of lactate (L-lactate), and the liver uses blood glucose, to communicate and exchange fuel with each other.

The Canadian team found that obese mice - and even people with obesity - have higher levels of a lesser-known molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the more familiar L-lactate made by muscles, most of the D-lactate comes from gut microbes and was shown to raise blood sugar and liver fat more aggressively.

To stop this, the researchers created a "gut substrate trap" - a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less insulin resistance, and reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis - all without changing their diet or body weight.

"This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we're intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm," says Schertzer, a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation.

The research, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), highlights the growing importance of the microbiome in chronic diseases.

The amount of each of the more than a thousand different glycoproteins in your blood varies widely with the 10 most abundant glycoproteins accounting for 90 percent of the total mass. Finding a protein that isn't in this top 10 is a bit like looking for Waldo if only one rendition of the character remained in a collection of every "Where's Waldo" comic ever produced.

This range of disparity in protein concentration is termed dynamic range, and it makes it more difficult for scientists to identify less-abundant proteins and their matching receptors.

Scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys and colleagues at Scripps Research Institute published findings July 7, 2025, in Nature Communications demonstrating a strategy for identifying less-abundant proteins that bind with a specific type of receptor termed an endocytic lectin, and namely the mannose receptor Mrc1 (also known as CD206 and MMR). This approach enabled the research team to uncover hundreds of binding partners that together predicted Mrc1's roles in our health.

To boost the signal and overcome the noise of so many proteins appearing at different levels, the investigators employed the prototypical mannose-binding lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) to first enrich for those blood proteins bearing multiple linkages of mannose.

"ConA and Mrc1 both have the same mannose linkage binding properties, however Mrc1 is not available as a similarly active recombinant protein," said Mayank Saraswat, PhD, a senior staff scientist at Sanford Burnham Prebys and co-lead author of the study.

"We isolated proteins that bind ConA from the plasma of normal mice and from mice lacking Mrc1," said Saraswat. "Comparisons revealed an increased sensitivity and selectivity allowing identification of the receptor's ligands as they accumulate in the blood in the absence of Mrc1."

Mrc1 keeps the concentration of various critical blood plasma proteins in a healthy range. It does this by binding to proteins that have been post-translationally modified with mannose, sometimes termed mannosylated proteins. Binding of mannosylated proteins to Mrc1 initiates an endocytic clearance mechanism that limits Mrc1 ligand half-lives and abundance in circulation.

After comparing proteins in the bloodstreams of normal mice and mice lacking Mrc1, the team found the accumulation of 244 mannosylated blood plasma proteins to double or more of the amounts found in normal mice due to Mrc1 no longer keeping the levels in check.

The scientists then took a closer look at the newly identified ligands. They used bioinformatics to review and depict these hundreds of proteins by their functions.

We noticed that a lot of the proteins had very important roles to play. Renin and angiotensin converting enzyme, for example, are major regulators of blood pressure."

Jamey Marth, PhD, professor at Sanford Burnham Prebys and senior and corresponding author of the manuscript

The researchers dug deeper on eight of these proteins known to affect blood pressure, inflammation, organ function and sepsis.

"We observed the disruption of normal physiology and function that was entirely predictable from the identities of the mannosylated proteins accumulating, with the added effect of disease tracking with chronological age," said Marth. 

In the case of sepsis, mice lacking Mrc1 perished more quickly from the condition.

"When we looked at samples of blood from human sepsis patients, we found that there was a difference in the proteins that were accumulating when compared to the Mrc1-deficient mice," said Saraswat. "However, when we compared the pathways controlled by these proteins, half of those activated in human sepsis were also activated by Mrc-1 dysfunction." 

"To understand the part that glycosidic linkages are playing in health and disease by modifying the abundance and activity of blood glycoproteins, we need to decipher this new language spanning protein glycosylation, detect abnormalities and determine how this system translates in the body to affect different physiological functions," said Saraswat.

The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in how our bodies fight infection, heal, and regulate inflammation. At the heart of this pathway is the NEMO protein, encoded by the IKBKG gene. When this gene malfunctions, it can lead to a diverse spectrum of diseases—from pigment changes and dental anomalies to severe immunodeficiency (ID) and inflammation. The challenge for clinicians is that these mutations often present in vastly different ways across patients, sometimes with subtle or overlapping symptoms. Due to these complexities, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive clinical map of IKBKG mutations to improve early diagnosis and personalized care.

On January 12, 2025, researchers from Chongqing Medical University published a comprehensive review (DOI: 10.1016/j.gendis.2025.101531) in Genes & Diseases, offering one of the most detailed clinical landscapes of IKBKG mutations to date. Analyzing 144 studies and 564 cases, the team systematically classified how specific genetic mutations correspond to a variety of rare disorders—including incontinentia pigmenti (IP), anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), ID, and the recently identified NDAS. By drawing connections between genetic variations and disease severity, the study equips clinicians with a clearer diagnostic framework for recognizing these complex conditions rooted in NF-κB dysfunction.

The research revealed a striking range of disease presentations driven by IKBKG mutations. Most cases were diagnosed as IP (78%), followed by EDA-ID (15.8%), ID (5.0%), and NDAS (1.2%). Female patients predominantly had IP, while the other syndromes mainly affected males. Common symptoms ranged from skin pigmentation abnormalities and dental defects to recurrent, severe infections and systemic inflammation.

The study found that the zinc finger (ZF) domain of IKBKG was especially prone to disease-causing mutations, many of which led to the most severe outcomes. Variants such as E390RfsX5, H413R, and X420W were associated with multi-organ involvement and high phenotype scores. Notably, some mutations—like E390RfsX5—appeared across multiple disease categories, complicating diagnosis and treatment decisions. Beyond symptom mapping, the study identified patterns in infection susceptibility. Mycobacteria and Streptococcus were frequent culprits, and immunoglobulin abnormalities—especially IgG and IgM deficiencies—were common among EDA-ID and ID patients. The detailed genotype-phenotype correlations developed in this review offer a roadmap for clinicians navigating ambiguous or overlapping presentations.

This research sheds light on a notoriously elusive group of disorders. What makes IKBKG-related conditions so challenging is their variability—two patients with the same mutation can present entirely different symptoms. Our findings offer a much-needed clinical guide to help physicians recognize these cases earlier, improve outcomes, and reduce diagnostic delays, especially in children."

Dr. Yuan Ding, senior author of the study

The study offers a practical foundation for precision diagnostics in rare ID and inflammatory diseases. By linking specific IKBKG mutations to clinical outcomes, healthcare providers can better anticipate disease progression and tailor treatments—whether through immunoglobulin therapy, stem-cell transplantation, or emerging gene-editing technologies. The review also underscores the urgency of recognizing underdiagnosed cases, especially in infants and young children with unusual infections or skin and dental anomalies. As gene therapy research accelerates, this comprehensive mutation map may serve as a reference point for designing mutation-specific interventions, bringing hope to patients and families affected by these complex syndromes.

A new international study confirmed a significant post-pandemic rise in disorders of gut-brain interaction, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia, according to the paper published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. 

Building on prior research, investigators used Rome Foundation diagnostic tools to analyze nationally representative samples from both 2017 and 2023 - offering the first direct, population-level comparison of disorders of gut-brain interaction prevalence before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is the first population-level study to directly compare rates of disorders affecting gut-brain interaction before and after the pandemic, using a consistent methodology. It adds weight to growing calls for updated care models and more research into the gut-brain axis in the post-COVID era.

Deborah Abrams Kaplan

 July 30, 2025  

A few years ago, a patient in her 30s saw Nicholas Dragolea, MBBS, a general practitioner when her Apple Watch showed an irregular heart rhythm. She had no family history of heart disease or any related symptoms, such as breathlessness, palpitations, lightheadedness, heart racing, or chest pain, Dragolea said. He ordered a Holter monitor and confirmed that the patient had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He started her on weight control treatment and anticoagulants. “It's important because if you don't diagnose and treat it [PAF] early, it increases the risk of stroke, and the patient can become more symptomatic later on,” he told Medscape Medical News.

As patients buy and use more wearable devices, doctors are increasingly being presented with data from their patients asking for medical opinions. It's an extension of Dr Google, when patients come to their physicians after having read about a medical condition online. How doctors react (or not) to their patient's wearable data and their legal liability in doing so has implications for both doctor and patient.

About Medscape Data

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, a Physicians and Malpractice Report 2024 found that

A December 2024 survey from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, found that about two thirds of Americans regularly use wearable devices to monitor their heart, including smartwatches, portable blood pressure machines, fitness apps, and wearable movement/fitness trackers. The study found that only one quarter of these users, however, currently share their data with their physician.

For physicians without protocols for handling the data, this may be a relief. A 2024 ZS Future of Health Report showed that 71% of US physicians surveyed were overwhelmed by the amount of data available to them, a potential barrier to adopting connected health systems. The same percentage said they don't know what to do with the onslaught of that data.

When a patient shares concerning wearables data, the physician should prioritize the history and examination, said Dragolea, also following any national guidelines. Sharing guidelines can help calm a patient's nerves as well, if the doctor does conduct follow-up testing.

Dragolea would ask patients about their family history, symptoms, how they felt when the wearables data were recorded, what the patient's concern is, and any expectations they have in handling it. “Nowadays, they will likely have done research about what it means,” he said. He doesn't recommend overinvestigating an issue that's less concerning. But if doing nothing will make the patient anxious, that's not good either — because they'll likely just make an appointment with another doctor.

It's also important to assess the data source. Someone with a wearable that showed low oxygen readings may just need education that the devices can give erroneous readings if moved the wrong way or if the patient was sweaty when the reading occurred.

Dragolea sometimes explains to patients that the devices are mostly for wellness and are not approved medical devices. “The data is not always accurate, and it is not always data we can act on to instruct us in any particular problem or diagnosis,” Dragolea said.

Some devices have FDA medical clearance, and others do not. Dragolea takes heart data from an Apple Watch more seriously than devices without this regulatory approval, he said.

If a doctor has not heard of the patient's device, they can quickly search online to see if it has FDA clearance or if there are clinical studies citing methodology backing up the outcomes, said Bethany Corbin, a healthcare innovation attorney in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It can take 1 or 2 minutes to type in the device name plus ‘clinical trial' to see if it's vetted from a clinical perspective,” she said. If it's not, that doesn't mean it's inaccurate, but doctors should take the readings with a different grain of salt, she added.

William Haas, MD, who specializes in wellness and integrative medicine, uses wearable data more frequently than many practices. “From the lens of the average practitioner, a lot has to do with the alerts alongside the symptoms,” he said. “Then I decide if I need to pursue proper medical testing to evaluate it further.”

When talking to patients about wearables, Haas tells them, “They're not diagnostics, but they're excellent early warning signs.” If a device shows low oxygen saturation at night, it could be sleep apnea. He then asks the patient if their partner says they snore or if the partner notices the patient having periods during sleep when they're not breathing. He asks if they wake up tired in the morning. For cardiac issues, “we try to match up data like an elevated heart rate, lightheadedness, and dizziness — targeted symptoms to match up to data points.”

Haas gives less credence to devices' proprietary health indices. “They may come up with a recovery index based on heart rate variability, but I'd be more apt to look at actual heart rate variation,” he said.

In addition to smartwatches and rings, there are wearables like glucose and blood pressure monitors. And there's overlap with patient-submitted data, which can also be instructive. Corbin shared the story of a woman who brought her phone-based period tracking app data to her provider. The data showed cycle irregularity including breakthrough bleeding. The provider performed a physical exam and said the patient was fine, suggesting stress as a cause. The woman went to a different provider who followed the patient for a few months, ordering a Pap smear, which was positive for cervical cancer.

A lot of doctors are hesitant to recommend wearable technologies, as they haven't vetted them and don't know what's most accurate, said Corbin. “Patients and consumers know more about devices than doctors do,” she added. There can be practice liability if it's not set up to collect and track wearables data in the electronic health record, if they're not consistently monitoring incoming data, and there's no feedback loop. “I don't see doctors embracing digital health tools,” she said. “There's more liability in not monitoring versus not using them.”

Haas does incorporate wearables in his practice, which focuses on wellness. “In my practice I almost never make a recommendation to my patients that I don't use myself,” he said, as he wants to know how the device works and what potentially can be tracked.

He also uses a platform [Headsuphealth] to aggregate smart data, lab testing, and self-reported questionnaires. It shares trends over time for individual patients and groups of patients. “It gives me more context on how to interpret some smart device data to match up to lab testing and to look for correlations.”

Haas noted that “you're not legally required to act on every bit of data,” but there are legal risks if a doctor ignores a patient's symptoms alongside wearable alerts without proper documentation.

It's an issue worth following, as more patients will report wearables data to doctors in the future, said Dragolea. “I believe the numbers will increase as more people get wearables, rings, watches, and earrings as well.” This will require a lot more conversations with patients about the data quality and maybe more help from regulators on what to do in these cases, he said.

A group of researchers led by The University of Osaka have identified a novel genetic mutation in Streptococcus pyogenes, a common bacterium which causes strep throat, significantly associated with severe invasive infections.

A single mutation in the bacterial ferric ion transporter weakens bacterial growth in human blood. This mutation, unique to Japanese isolates, indicates a novel pathogenic mechanism. This world-first discovery offers a potential new target for treatments and preventive measures.

S. pyogenes causes severe invasive infections with a high mortality rate. Cases of invasive strep in Japan surged in 2024, highlighting the urgent need for new treatments and a deeper understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.

A new study looked at the genes of hundreds of S. pyogenes samples from Japan and other countries to pinpoint the genetic differences that make some strains more dangerous. The research group conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of 666 S. pyogenes strains—311 from Japan and 355 from other countries—using cutting-edge pangenome-wide association studies.

The researchers found a number of genetic changes linked to the bacteria's ability to cause severe infections, including a brand new mutation never seen before. This mutation affects a gene involved in how the bacterium gets iron, a nutrient it needs to survive.

Interestingly, they also found that many genes previously thought to cause serious illness were actually common in the less harmful strains. This suggests that some strains may become more dangerous not just by gaining harmful genes, but also by losing genes that hold them back.

This research significantly advances our understanding of severe invasive strep, especially within the Japanese population.

This large-scale analysis, involving painstaking supercomputer analysis and experimental validation, offers a promising avenue for new therapies targeting a mutated iron transporter."

The study's pangenome-wide approach also demonstrates the potential of large-scale genomic analyses for unraveling complex disease mechanisms, offering a powerful tool for future research in other infectious diseases.

In this story:

Chelsea requested US President Donald Trump to be part of the 2025 Club World Cup celebrations, his son Eric has claimed.

Following a 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13 at MetLife Stadium, Chelsea were crowned Champions of the World and were recognised as the first ever side to win the Club World Cup, a newly-formatted competition.

After the full-time whistle blew in the United States, Chelsea made their way to collect their medals, passing co-owner Todd Boehly, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Trump, before waiting on the stage for club captain Reece James for the trophy lift.

As James entered last to collect his medal, he was handed the trophy by Trump on Infantino. Usually, the team would be left to lift the trophy to soak in the moment of their triumph. However, this was not the case at the Club World Cup final.

Despite Infantino stepping to one side, Trump remained on stage, to the confusion of Chelsea's players, who tried ushering the President off the stage but to no success. It caused confusion and resulted in Trump being at the centre of the Blues' trophy lift celebrations.

A few weeks on from the final, Trump's son Eric has spoken on the matter of his father being part of the celebrations, and insists Chelsea 'invited him to the stage because they said it would be the greatest honour of their life'.

“Well, listen, he's the Commander in Chief of the United States of America," Eric told BBC Sport. 

"In terms of FIFA, the winning team invited him to the stage because they said it would be the greatest honour of their life if the President of the United States could present the Club World Cup trophy to the team.

“And by the way, I was there, I was watching it, the place went crazy, and there's no one that's done more for sport than him, and I think in time that will be rewarded.”

Eric's claims haven't appeared to be backed up by any of the Chelsea squad, all of whom appeared incredibly confused by the situation. 

Reece James stated Donald Trump wanted to remain on stage, admitting: "They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay.

"He just congratulated me and the team for lifting the trophy and told us to enjoy the moment."

Meanwhile, Cole Palmer, who won the Man of the Match award in the final, said: "I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy. I was a bit confused, yes."

U.S. men's national team captain Christian Pulisic opened up about his time at Chelsea and just how much more “at home” he feels with AC Milan.

Pulisic is coming off a career-best season playing for the Rossoneri. The 26-year-old recorded 17 goals and 10 assists across all competitions, helping AC Milan win their first Italian Super Cup in nearly a decade. 

The American's success in Milan is a far cry from his shortcomings at Chelsea just two years prior. Pulisic only found the back of the net 26 times in 145 appearances for the Blues and struggled to play regular minutes in his four-year stint at Stamford Bridge.

As Pulisic gears up for the 2025–26 season, the winger revealed why he believes his game reached new heights as soon as he left Chelsea for AC Milan. 

“Here at Milan, I've been given freedom from the start, and I feel the trust in me from everyone: from my teammates to the coach, from the directors to the fans,” Pulisic said to La Gazzetta dello Sport.

Pulisic went from fighting for a place in Chelsea's XI to becoming a permanent fixture in AC Milan's lineup. The USMNT star made 51 appearances in his debut campaign with the Rossoneri and 50 more last season. In the biggest games across all competitions, Pulisic was a focal point of the Italian giants' attack, earning starts on the wing or as the team's No. 10.

“By acquiring me, the club has given me a great opportunity, and I have a duty to improve every year, to work hard to always take a step forward in terms of performance.”

The conversation turned to whether Pulisic feels ”more at home” at AC Milan, a fact that the 26-year-old agreed with.

“That's true, although it's easier to say after having scored so many goals in the last two seasons,” Pulisic said. “I'm having a lot of fun at Milan and I want to continue on this path, pushing as hard as I can.” 

Pulisic and the Rossoneri will look to bounce back in Serie A next season after only managing a disappointing eighth place finish. AC Milan will miss out on European soccer, but with new manager Massimiliano Allegri at the helm and the arrival of Luka Modrić, Pulisic is optimistic about the team's future.

“Our goal is to qualify [for the Champions League] next year. The Champions League is the most exciting European competition, and Milan deserves to play in it,” Pulisic said.

“We'll try to win as many games as possible and finish as high as we can [in Serie A].”

The U.S. Soccer Federation is made up of 27 National Teams, nine of which are Extended National Teams, including Deaf, Cerebral Palsy, Power Chair, Beach and Futsal teams. So, while the crest denotes the highest pedigree in men's and women's soccer in the country, it also represents the opportunity for anyone to play the game in alternative ways.

It's important to Stuart Sharp, head of Extended National Teams at U.S. Soccer, to use “extension” when talking about the nine teams that fall under his purview. When Sharp started at U.S. Soccer as the Cerebral Palsy Men's National Team head coach in 2014, the team was listed as “other.” He and Jim Moorehouse, senior director of ENTs, transformedthe department to provide opportunity, grow soccer culture in the United States and lead the world in alternative forms of the game, reflecting the U.S. Way.

“We're all different shapes, we're different sizes, we have different skill sets,” Sharp said on the U.S. Soccer Podcast. “So, we have an opportunity in our department to create relevant role models well beyond the grass, the court or the sand for people to see [that] there's a National Team player that I aspire to be.”

The nine teams are often in action in matches across the world. Recently, the co-ed Power Chair National Team competed in a historic first-ever international friendly in England. The Men's Deaf National Team will play in a double header with the USWNT in October on the way to the Deaflympics in Tokyo from Nov. 14-25.

“It's about high-level performance,” Sharp said. “These athletes want to be treated like National Team players and certainly that's our approach with our staffing and resources.”

The resources are in place, but at times, the awareness isn't there. The opportunities on U.S. Soccer's Extended National Teams are ripe for the taking, but recruiting can look different on the extended side of the game. Sharp isn't above “sliding into DMs” of potential U.S. Soccer players.

“[It's] crazy and apologetically, I will say yes,” Sharp said. “That's what we have to do. Podcasts like this, any news articles we put out there are a way of recruiting new talent across our Extended National Teams.”

Sharp recently came across National Team talent by searching the web, and sending a player a direct message on social media.Initially, they received a “no” from the atheletebut thatwasn't a dead end for Sharp and his recruiting team. They reached out to a reporter who wrote a story on the athlete, got in touch with his family and recruited the future U.S. Soccer player.

There are few lengths Sharp won't explore to offer someone who never thought they had an opportunity to play at the highest level of soccer.

“Many of our players had a major moment in their life or they were born with a disability or impacted in another way later in life [have] an opportunity to represent this nation on another level,” Sharp said. “... We're working with National Team athletes because that's what they bring to the table. They've all got interesting pasts, but it's about what they're doing currently and in the future.”

Manchester United have been urged to continue their pursuit of Emiliano Martinez this summer as he can provide the "balance" that Andre Onana cannot.

In many ways, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup served as a crucial testing ground—not just for its revamped format, its place on the international calendar, and the complex logistics involved, but also for innovative features introduced by FIFA. Among these, one stood out as a clear fan favorite: the Ref Cam, and it's now set to expand into domestic leagues worldwide.

The Ref Cam is a small camera mounted on the referee's headset, offering fans a real-time—or replayed—view of what match officials see on the field. This first-person perspective proved to be an instant hit. 

FIFA's clips showcasing the referee's point of view quickly went viral across social media, earning praise for enhancing transparency and bringing supporters even closer to the action.

Following the Club World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) officially approved the use of body cameras for referees, specifically for television broadcasts. FIFA considers the pilot program a resounding success and has now opened the door for any league to adopt the technology in their own competitions.

However, it comes with a catch: leagues will have to foot the bill themselves. FIFA will not subsidize the cost of implementing the system, meaning that any domestic competition hoping to introduce Ref Cams must be prepared to make a significant financial investment.

Despite the expense, the widespread appeal and added entertainment value make the Ref Cam a tempting upgrade—especially for leagues like the Premier League or Major League Soccer, which consistently look for ways to improve the fan experience both in-stadium and through broadcast.

It's likely just a matter of time before more competitions jump on board. The feature not only adds a new layer of drama and immersion but could also help educate fans about refereeing decisions, fostering a deeper understanding of the game's challenges from an official's perspective.

In an era where engagement, content, and innovation drive growth, the Ref Cam has emerged as a powerful storytelling tool. Whether it's a controversial foul, a perfectly timed tackle, or the intense emotion of officiating at the highest level, fans are now getting a front-row seat to moments they were never able to experience before.

As football continues to evolve, this small camera might just become a game-changer in how we watch and understand the beautiful game.

Former Inter defender Marco Materazzi has thanked Enzo Maresca and Chelsea for "avenging" Inter's defeat in the Champions League final against PSG and says former Everton manager Walter Smith treated him like his own son.

The World Cup winner with Italy spoke about his experience in the Premier League in an interview with Lega Serie A.

Materazzi left Perugia in 1998 to join Everton, where he played for one season before returning to the Curi Stadium.

Materazzi: Time at Everton was "beautiful and difficult"

"It was very beautiful and difficult. I went there with my wife and my son who was eight months old," the former defender recounts.

“We were alone, and I can't deny that I would have stayed at Perugia because we had won Serie B. I went back to Perugia and we were relegated, so I decided to bring the club back to Serie A. We managed to get promoted, and then they sold me to Everton. I told them I wanted to stay as captain. I was earning very little compared to the other players, so I asked for a deal to stay, but they told me I had to leave, so I packed my bags and went to Liverpool. My wife convinced me, she said: ‘This will change our lives for the better', and it did. I knew that going to England would mean I would no longer be in the national team's spotlight, and that's the real reason why I returned to Italy.”

"I remember everything from that time in England, the manager – who unfortunately is no longer alive – Walter Smith. He loved Italy and always brought his teams for pre-season training in Italy, so that helped a lot. The fact that he loved the Italians also helped, because he treated me like his son, and when you're abroad, having someone who supports you and believes in you not only as a player but also as a person, helps you a lot to adapt."

A very physical defender, Materazzi's characteristics suited the Premier League style well in those years.

"Everyone said I had the right qualities to play in the Premier League," he admits.

"Especially in those years, the Premier League wasn't at the top of the sport. At that time, the only teams that played in a 'Latin' way were West Ham, who played very beautifully, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's Arsenal.

"As for the others, when you played against Wimbledon, for example, the dressing rooms were small, but their strikers were so big they made me look small. English football has evolved now and has adapted to the philosophies of coaches like Maresca, Guardiola. Maresca even became world champion, and I have to thank him for avenging Inter's defeat in the Champions League final."

Maresca's Chelsea became the first-ever Club World Cup winner earlier this month after defeating PSG in the final held in New York.

The Ligue 1 giants had beaten Inter 5-0 in the Champions League final in May.

Materazzi returned to Perugia in 1999 and then signed for Inter in 2001. He spent ten years at San Siro, winning several trophies, including five Serie A titles, four Coppa Italias and a Champions League.

Materazzi retired from football in 2017 after a three-year spell at Chennaiyin. /GazetaExpress/

Former Inter defender Marco Materazzi thanks Enzo Maresca and Chelsea for ‘avenging' Inter's defeat in the Champions League Final against PSG and admits ex-Everton coach Walter Smith treated him like a son.

Italy World Cup winner Materazzi spoke about his time in the Premier League in an interview with Lega Serie A.

Materazzi left Perugia in 1998 to join Everton, where he played for one season before returning to the Stadio Curi.

“It was very beautiful and difficult. I went there with my wife and my son, who was eight months old,” admitted the ex-defender.

“We were alone, and I can't deny that I would have stayed in Perugia because we had won the [Serie B] league. I returned to Perugia, and we were relegated, so I decided to bring the club back to Serie A. We managed to get promoted, and then they sold me to Everton. I told them I wanted to stay as the captain. I was earning very little compared to other players, so I asked to find an agreement to stay, but they said I had to leave, so I packed my bags and went to Liverpool.

“My wife convinced me, she said: ‘It's going to change our life for the better', and it's what happened. I knew that going to England meant I would not be considered for the national team, and that's the real reason why I returned to Italy.

“I remember everything about my time in England, the coach, who unfortunately is no longer here, Walter Smith. He loved Italy and always brought his teams to Italy for pre-season camp, so that was very helpful. The fact that he loved Italians was helpful because he treated me like a son, and when you go abroad, having someone who supports you and believes in you, not just as a player, but also as a man, helps a lot with settling in.”

A very physical centre-back, Materazzi's characteristics suited the Premier League's style in those years.

“Everyone said I had the right skill set to play in the Premier League,” he admitted.

“Particularly in those years, it wasn't the forefront of the sport. In those years, the only teams that played the ‘Latin way' were West Ham, who played very well, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's Arsenal.

Awful Announcing

The Athletic is making big moves to bolster its soccer coverage ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

This week, the New York Times-owned outlet announced the hires of former U.S. Men's National Team forward Charlie Davies and ex-Yahoo Sports standout Henry Bushnell. Their arrivals follow the departure of longtime staff writer Pablo Maurer earlier this year.

Davies joins as a regular contributor, making his debut in written journalism with The Athletic. In his first foray into the medium, the expectation is that Davies will regularly produce opinion columns, appear regularly on podcasts, and produce insightful explainer videos.

While Davies is new to written journalism, Awful Announcing has learned that the plan is for The Athletic's editorial team to work closely with him to ensure his unique voice and personality translate flawlessly to the page.

Davies earned 17 caps for the USMNT between 2007-09 and played a pivotal role in helping the team qualify for the 2010 World Cup before a serious car accident effectively ended his international career. Last playing professional soccer in 2017, Davies has since become an analyst for CBS Sports, as well as a color analyst for the New England Revolution on NBC Sports Boston.

Bushnell, meanwhile, arrives from Yahoo Sports, where he built a reputation as one of the most respected U.S. soccer journalists. At The Athletic, he's expected to keep that same edge as part of the outlet's push to grow its soccer vertical in the lead-up to 2026.

So, after 8 years(!) at Yahoo Sports, some news…

I'm joining the superteam @TheAthletic.

While these additions point to why The Athletic chose not to renew Maurer's contract, the outlet believes this refreshed lineup will better position it to deliver top-tier coverage heading into next year's World Cup.

Since the beginning of 2023, Sam has been a staff writer for Awful Announcing and The Comeback. A 2021 graduate of Temple University, Sam is a Charlotte native, who currently calls Greenville, South Carolina his home. He also has a love/hate relationship with the New York Mets and Jets.

Charles Davis will replace Tiki Barber in his last year on NFL coverage, while JJ Watt takes the No. 2 analyst role.

"We'll be getting some tweets about that, I'm sure."

Barber worked alongside Andrew Catalon and Jason McCourty in a three-man booth last season.

TNT Sports averaged 2.1 million viewers per NASCAR Cup Series race across TNT and truTV this summer.

Football's lawmakers have extended the use of referee body cameras for broadcast purposes to worldwide domestic and international competitions.

The International Football Association Board (IFAB) said its board of directors had approved the extension of the trial of the technology following “successful tests” at the 2025 Club World Cup.

Other competitions wishing to participate in the trial and implement referee body cameras must seek permission from IFAB and FIFA to do so. This is a similar process to the introduction of previous new officiating measures, such as in-stadium VAR announcements.

The implementation of the technology in the Premier League for the 2025-26 season is under consideration.

Jarred Gillett became the first Premier League referee to wear a body camera during the fixture between Crystal Palace and Manchester United in May 2024. The footage was not made available for immediate broadcast and was described as a “one off” for a programme promoting match officials.

The technology was also trialled during a Bundesliga game between Eintracht Frankfurt and Wolfsburg in February 2024. German Football Leagues (DFL) co-CEO Steffen Merkel said on Wednesday: “Subject to approval by IFAB and FIFA, we would expect it to be used in 40 to 50 (Bundesliga) games in the coming season.

“I think that right at the start this will be less a topic for the live area, rather for the highlight area and social media, because we have had good experiences with reach and audience enthusiasm.”

The technology trial was initially limited to FIFA competitions following approval at an IFAB meeting in March. It was introduced for the Club World Cup in the United States this summer for as part of live match transmission, providing a new replay angle from the referee's perspective.

Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the FIFA referees committee, said in April the use of body cameras would offer broadcast viewers a “new experience”. The former FIFA referee said following the tournament their use “went beyond our expectations”.

The initial trial was to “identify possible future use and develop quality and safety standards”. “Now, other competitions have the option to test such systems and provide valuable information and feedback,” an IFAB statement read.

Referee body cameras were first trialled in English grassroots football in 2023 with the aim of improving behaviour and respect from players and supporters towards match officials.

“We had the possibility to see what the referee sees on the field of play,” Collina told FIFA's official website in July. “And this was not only for entertainment purposes, but also for coaching the referees (and) to explain why something was not seen on the field of play.”

Ruben Amorim is on the lookout for a new starting centre-forward, but the Red Devils have opened talks with the wrong target

Well, here we are again. Another summer where Manchester United need to add a striker to their ranks. Not for the first time, the Red Devils have dawdled and dallied going about such business.

The 2024-25 season will forever be an unforgettable one for those of a United persuasion for all the wrong reasons. They finished a club-record low of 15th in the Premier League, lost the Europa League final to a Tottenham team that somehow finished beneath them domestically, and found scoring goals the most difficult of tasks.

Ruben Amorim, appointed as successor to Erik ten Hag last November, has yet to properly stamp his imprint on this team. If anything, he's taken them backwards when that seemed an impossible feat. The positives to work with are he has a vision for how he wants United to play - albeit there are major flaws to iron out in the rough and tumble of English football - and they have become a pain for the big boys to play against, retaining a defensive resolution when facing teams of far superior quality.

How much United can achieve in 2025-26, though, will likely depend on their scoring threat. If they throw the same wayward punches as last season, they will find themselves strewn across the canvas again and again. They have already sought to improve in the final third with the additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but they still need a No.9 to bring it all together.

In recent days, reports claimed the United top brass had narrowed that search down to two quite different options: Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. And while it broke on Wednesday that they have opened talks with the latter, it is Watkins that they should be looking to get over the line.

Emma Hayes reflects on her first year in charge of the USWNT. (2:27)

The transition of the U.S. women's national team since Emma Hayes took over as coach has marked a staggering, unprecedented level of experimentation for the world's most successful women's soccer team.

Twenty-four players have made their international debuts in the first 24 games with Hayes in charge over the past year, even with U.S. winning a gold medal at last summer's Olympics.

Now, Hayes has said she has seen enough to narrow down her core of players and focus on developing the group she hopes will win the Americans a fifth World Cup in Brazil in 2027.

So after all that experimentation, which new players are most likely to be on the roster for the Women's World Cup two years from now? We've ranked the debutants by who appears to fit into Hayes' 2027 plans. It's about talent, yes, but also the team's positional needs, meaning some players rank higher or lower based on necessity.

Gaetino's lone U.S. appearance to date was her debut last year in a 3-0 win over Argentina. At 22, she still has plenty of time to develop, but she has not consistently been with the U23s of late, either, as Hayes has tested out other emerging center backs.

Hayes has experimented the most at fullback, and Malonson is among the options being explored. Malonson's only cap to date, however, came last year against Argentina. Other fullbacks have been featured more heavily recently.

The player who never missed a game in the NWSL suffered a major injury last year just after her U.S. team debut, which was heartbreaking timing especially considering Hayes is on the hunt for depth at the position. Chicago's struggles this year have made it difficult for Staab to stand out upon her return.

There are few bigger advocates for the Legend of LaBonta than this writer, but she has tough competition in midfield. There's a youth movement afoot as Hayes builds for the next decade. That said, LaBonta remains an all-NWSL talent in midfield, and Hayes has shown that club form matters. The biggest question, assuming LaBonta's form holds, is how she fits in the crowded midfield puzzle.

Meza was impressive in her debut against Ireland last month, an opportunity she earned through her steady play in midfield for Seattle. She has potential as a deeper-lying midfielder, but there are better-known entities ahead of her on the depth chart.

Rodriguez is an attacking force at fullback in the NWSL. She ranks 14th in the league in chances created, per ESPN Research. She has exactly the type of attacking profile Hayes has trialed at fullback. Right now, though, Hayes has only the sample size of the most recent U.S. camp for Rodriguez.

Like Rodriguez, Abello is an attack-minded fullback with limited international reps thus far, but she gets the edge for versatility. She can play centrally in a three-back capacity -- which Hayes noted recently -- and she also handles a more advanced winger role for Orlando at times. She has great upside and should continue to get opportunities.

McGlynn debuted last fall as the race to replace Alyssa Naeher entered full swing. Every goalkeeper on this list has a strong shot at making the 2027 World Cup because the most recent No. 1 (Naeher), No. 2 (Casey Murphy) and No. 3 (Jane Campbell) are out of the picture or out of favor. McGlynn has the most ground to make up among the three goalkeepers on this list.

Sams has been a consistent force for Orlando and continues to get the call for the Americans, but she started in only two of the U.S. team's 10 games thus far this year (with one appearance off the bench). Only Hayes can truly say why, but Sams appears to be at least fourth on the center-back depth chart. Her club form for Orlando remains strong and she is great in one-on-one situations.

Reale was exceptional in the U.S. team's most recent game against Canada. She has been steady for Gotham throughout her rookie season and looks ready for the international stage. Those left-footed crosses she can serve up from the wing? Hayes will take them all day. At 21, this defender looks like the Reale Deal (we'll be here all day, thanks).

The long-term future of Bugg as a starting U.S. center back seems inevitable; it's a question more of when, not if. Hayes said recently that Bugg will still play at the U-20 World Cup and likely train with the U23s at times to prepare her for either 2027 or the 2028 Olympics and beyond. How quickly that development progresses and, maybe, whether FIFA expands the World Cup rosters to 26 players, could determine her immediate future. But Bugg is already thriving in the NWSL and drawing comparisons to Naomi Girma for her composed defending.

Hershfelt has not played for the U.S. in 2025 due to injury, but don't forget she was part of last year's Olympic run. Her likelihood of being on the 2027 World Cup roster will rise and fall based on her health; the most important thing now is getting back on the field. There isn't a tougher midfielder in the pool (a Julie Ertz comparison might be appropriate), and she has a passing vision going forward to complement that.

Hayes is high on Sears, whose athleticism is off the charts. Sears continues to refine her technical game and decision-making, the latter being a development Hayes praised during the most recent window. Sears is tied for fifth in the NWSL with six goals this season, second among Americans and the most of any player with senior U.S. caps.

McKeown is one of the most interesting developments in the player pool after a well-documented conversion from forward in recent years. She has appeared in eight of 10 U.S. games this year since making her debut. Her background means she profiles as a more aggressive, ball-playing center back -- someone who could complement the steady, all-world Girma against the right opponent. X factors at this position include the future health of Tierna Davidson, but McKeown has shown marked progress internationally even in a few months.

A brief injury in the spring kept Ryan out of U.S. camp, but don't forget that she has been dynamic and effective from multiple positions in her brief stints with the team. Ryan can play anywhere across the front four. The most important thing for her in the near term is making sure she keeps producing at the club level for a Houston team that still hasn't found its footing.

Thompson's moments at the international level have been limited thus far, but talk to anyone behind the scenes and they speak about the teenager as one of the next top American players. Her older sister, Alyssa, has already had her breakout moments for club and country; Gisele's are on the horizon. Her future with the U.S. looks like a question of where, rather than if, she fits on the field.

Has anyone taken hold of their opportunity as well as Cooper? She has the relentless drive that gets stuff done (and the bite to her game Hayes loves). Cooper can take on defenders on the wing and get to the end line, and she can score from central areas. There is stiff competition for the winger roles -- don't forget that the starting Olympic forward trio of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson are likely due back at some point -- but Hayes has clearly been impressed by Cooper.

As Hayes said, the data doesn't lie: Dickey is arguably the best American goalkeeper in the NWSL this year. She ranks second behind Aubrey Kingsbury (who was the No. 3 goalkeeper at the 2023 World Cup) in post-shot expected goals minus goals against, a measure effectiveness at stopping shots. Dickey's recent debut for the U.S. affirmed that she will be part of the rotation going forward.

Bethune is a creative talent with the bravery to attempt risky passes and the technical ability to execute them. She tied the NWSL record for assists last year as a rookie while debuting ahead of the team's Olympic run. Rose Lavelle is still the standard setter as the Americans' No. 10, as she reminded the world in a recent dazzling performance against Canada, but Bethune, who is six years younger, has a similar skill set that can't be ignored. Bethune just needs refining and more time on the field after a long injury layoff.

Patterson might have had the best run of spring games of any new USWNT player, punctuated by a strong showing against Canada earlier this month. She's an exceptional two-way fullback with the right mix of athleticism and vision. Her ascent is perfectly timed with Hayes' search for solutions at the position. Patterson's goal against Ireland last month was a tangible reward. Come 2027, she might line up as the fullback opposite Emily Fox.

Longtime U.S. fans know how rare it is to find a total package of a defensive midfielder. Hutton is that player. At 19, she is already poised under pressure in the center of the park, gliding forward to make progressive passes and pushing opponents off the ball defensively. Her game is imperfect, like that of any 19-year-old, but it's also well beyond her years. She is Sam Coffey's primary competition -- and seven years younger.

There's something about Sentnor when she gets on the ball. She appears to move faster with the ball at her feet in the open field than when she sprints without it, leading U.S. great Tobin Heath to compare her to Lionel Messi. Sentnor can also produce a powerful, sometimes audacious shot even with a short run-up, reminiscent of Christen Press' abilities. Sentnor can play as the No. 9, No. 10 or on the wing.

No player has risen the ranks more in the past few months than Tullis-Joyce, who appears to be the favorite for the starting goalkeeper job after a sensational debut against Brazil in April. She enjoyed a strong club season in England and backed it up with solid performances in her first U.S. caps, emerging with confidence when the Americans lacked answers in net. It's her starting role to lose, and by way of the need for a new trio of goalkeepers, only injury or an unfathomable dip in form would keep her away from the 2027 World Cup team.

Short-term, long-term, all of the above: Yohannes is a star in the making. Her recent transfer to OL Lyonnes from Ajax marks the next step in her development to train alongside top world players daily. Yohannes is remarkably composed as a deep-lying playmaker, and her final ball to break defensive lines shows the kind of skill set the U.S. wishes it had in recent years. Hayes has worked hard to control the hype around Yohannes, but the reality is that any midfield starting combination in 2027 will come together around her.

Marc-Andre ter Stegen's hopes of finally becoming Germany's undisputed No. 1 at a major tournament could be slipping away. 

This is because, according to reports from Germany, as relayed by Mundo Deportivo, the door may be reopening for veteran goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to make a surprise return to international football, just in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

At 33, Ter Stegen was expected to lead Germany at the next World Cup, especially after Neuer announced his retirement from international duty following Euro 2024. 

For the Barcelona keeper, this was meant to be the crowning moment of his national team career, having waited patiently in Neuer's shadow for over a decade. But things have taken an unexpected turn.

The Barcelona captain recently underwent his second back surgery, ruling him out for around four months. 

Though Barcelona have not confirmed a specific return date, the injury has already cast serious doubt over his readiness for the upcoming international fixtures. 

Meanwhile, in Germany, whispers are growing louder that Neuer could be considering a comeback, saying he has “next year's World Cup in mind.” 

The 39-year-old is still Bayern Munich's first-choice keeper and looked sharp throughout Euro 2024, which was supposed to be his international farewell.

Interestingly, Julian Nagelsmann has backed Ter Stegen in recent months, labelling him “my number one.” 

That endorsement now feels more uncertain, with Ter Stegen's physical condition and form under close scrutiny.

Once Ter Stegen returns, he will only two have friendlies – one in March and another just before the World Cup – to prove he is fit and sharp enough to reclaim his spot. That is a razor-thin margin in the ultra-competitive environment of the national team.

However, if Neuer stays in top shape and is willing to answer the call, Nagelsmann could face a difficult decision.

Arda Güler emerged as a standout performer for Real Madrid during their recent FIFA Club World Cup campaign, despite the team's disappointing 4-0 semifinal defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. Güler, alongside fellow breakthrough star Gonzalo Garcia, was a constant threat in the final third, leaving a significant impression on observers.

His strong showing at the tournament has seemingly earned him favor with new Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso as the club looks towards the upcoming season. According to MARCA, Alonso was particularly impressed not only by Güler's technical quality but also by his tactical maturity and adaptability.

During the tournament, Güler was deployed in a deeper midfield role, operating in a system with three central defenders behind him. This position was unfamiliar to the young Turk, yet he thrived, showcasing his technique and vision while also demonstrating a willingness to contribute defensively. The tactical shift aimed to leverage his creative abilities while demanding more defensive responsibility.

This positive development marks a significant turn for Güler, who endured a frustrating start to his Real Madrid career due to injuries and limited playing time. He now appears to have found a coach who believes in his potential. While Xabi Alonso has a considerable task ahead in implementing his playing style at the Santiago Bernabéu, all indications suggest that Güler will play a pivotal role in his plans.

This newfound prominence for Güler is a promising sign for Real Madrid, especially amidst recent reports linking star forward Rodrygo with a potential departure from the club this summer.

Aston Villa icon Gabriel Agbonlahor has threatened to "move countries" if Manchester United sign Ollie Watkins. The Villans are reportedly eyeing a move for Dominic Calvert-Lewin in case Watkins leaves the club. The 28-year-old striker is currently a free agent after leaving Everton at the end of the 2024-25 campaign.

The "pay them!" chants at the WNBA All-Star Game echoed the "equal pay!" chants at the U.S. women's soccer team's 2019 World Cup triumph. Can fans have as much impact now as they did back then?

When the crowd at the WNBA All-Star Game aimed a chorus of “Pay them!” chants at commissioner Cathy Engelbert, they not only woke up the public to the players' demands. They also woke up some echoes.

People who have been involved in women's sports for a while couldn't help remembering 2019, when the U.S. women's soccer team's World Cup title was greeted by chants of “Equal pay!” in stadiums from the  United States to France, where the tournament was held. And while WNBA players have their own goals at the bargaining table, the connection wasn't just made by outsiders.

Spend enough time watching basketball and soccer, and you'll see a fair number of players from both sports at each other's games, especially in cities with WNBA and NWSL teams. It's been the case in New York and Washington for a while, and now it's just as likely in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

They don't just pass by each other, either. Megan Rapinoe is a courtside regular at New York Liberty games with her equally famous fiancée, Sue Bird, who was a Seattle Storm teammate of Breanna Stewart for years before retiring. 

Rapinoe also spent many of her playing years in Seattle with the NWSL's Reign, so it was it was only natural that she also befriended Stewart. And given Rapinoe's history of advocacy, it's only natural now that Stewart can seek her advice.

“That will probably be my next conversation after the next meeting at the end of July,” Stewart said, adding that WNBA players noticed the historic gains made by NWSL players in their CBA deal last year. 

“The way the NWSL last year completely changed and shifted their CBA, it changed the landscape of the sport,” Stewart said. “And that's what we're trying to do is change the landscape of the WNBA, of women's basketball. So then thereafter, it creates a standard for all the other leagues.”

Does the public's involvement actually matter? Players in both sports say yes. 

Stewart said the “Pay them!” chants were “probably the biggest success of the [All-Star] weekend because it just shows how much they care about what we're doing.”

Kahleah Copper, the pride of North Philadelphia, said, “It means a lot to have the public support because it's just giving us another platform to really push for what we want.”

And Liberty guard Natasha Cloud added her approval with her usual Delco-bred charisma.

“It's a special thing,” she said. “Our fans know they love this league, they invest in this league [and] in themselves, whether it's their money, their time, their energy, whatever it is. So to want to see the players that make their experience that much better at these games, at these venues, at these arenas — they know that this is a collaborative effort. So it's really empowering for the players, for us to witness that.”

Though the circumstances aren't entirely the same this time around — the WNBA players aren't filing lawsuits like the U.S. soccer players did — those “Equal pay!” chants back then made a worldwide impact. 

Former U.S. star midfielder Sam Mewis spent years on her union's bargaining committee. Now a member of the media herself as a podcaster with the Men in Blazers network, she still vividly recalls her feelings from that magic summer.

“That moment was a big realization for all of us that this meant something to a lot of people, and that the fans were supporting us,” she said. “I remember our lawyers and PR team insisting that the public pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to come to terms with us was a huge factor in our negotiations. Having the fans on your side in a negotiation like the one the WNBPA is facing — that makes a big difference.”

U.S. Soccer also didn't help itself. Its president at the time, Carlos Cordeiro, famously botched pronouncing Rapinoe's name during the team's World Cup victory celebration at New York's City Hall. 

But that was a small misstep compared to the one he made six months later: a lack of oversight of sexist language in a legal filing by U.S. Soccer's lawyers in the equal pay suit. The furor that ensued forced his resignation, amid criticism not just from the women's game but also U.S. men's team coach Gregg Berhalter and MLS commissioner Don Garber.

For as much criticism as Engelbert has taken from fans and players, it seems hard to believe she'll suffer a fate that severe. Though the former Deloitte consultant has been accused of lacking a common touch — just as Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs banker, was — she spent a lot of time talking with players at the All-Star Game, and got credit from them for it.

Engelbert also knows where the WNBA needs to get, even if that doesn't make it any easier to convince  the people who sign her paycheck: WNBA team owners, and NBA team owners who also invest in the league without owning teams. 

The players want a big increase in their share of league revenues, and they see three factors. NBA players get around 50% of that league's basketball-related revenues, while WNBA players get only around 9.3% of theirs. But while the WNBA obviously hasn't made as much money over the years, the league now has a $2.2 billion media rights deal starting next season, plus three expansion teams paying $250 million entry fees.

“All these teams are being added, we don't see a dime of it,” Cloud said. “How much does it cost to buy into our league? Nine figures now. ... So why don't we see any of it? This business is going to be a billion-dollar business within, like, 10 years, and they know that.”

Copper knows how many critics there are out there. She wondered aloud how many of them were alive when the NBA was the same age the WNBA is now, in its 29th season. (That was 1977, for the record.)

“I think there [are] a lot of people on social media who don't know,” she said. “They say, ‘Oh, y'all don't deserve this money,' or whatever the case may be — but they don't know that in Year [29] for the NBA, they weren't getting paid as much as they're getting paid [now]. So I just want people to educate themselves on what we're really trying to accomplish before they comment.”

There's one more history lesson here, and it's meant to go straight to the top.

For as much as Cordeiro wanted to get a deal done, his missteps cost him the prize. It ultimately was won by his successor, Cindy Cone. After she rose from the vice presidency, she finished the job with experience as an administrator and World Cup-winning player.

If Engelbert wants to land on the right page in the history books, the pathway there is clear. Get the players the money they've earned, and she'll have earned the right to be praised for it.

Joel Latibeaudiere, now at Coventry, and Manchester City's Phil Foden were Curtis Anderson's team-mates in 2017

It's not every day that a World Cup winner walks into a coffee shop in central Manchester.

Yet there is no crowd, no signing autographs or selfies with fans. Things have turned out differently for Curtis Anderson. 

Anderson, a former Manchester City goalkeeper who helped England win the Under-17s Fifa World Cup in 2017, is able to sip his flat white in relative peace as he explains why he gave up his dream and became a financial adviser instead.

Of the 21 players who triumphed in India eight years ago, Anderson is the only one who is no longer playing football at any level.

Unlike most in his current field, Anderson is using his experiences in the game to help young professional footballers whose shoes he once stood in.

Anderson works for an independent financial adviser, where he heads the sports department.

Half of his time is spent exclusively with athletes - mainly footballers - helping them make informed financial decisions to maximise their earnings from a short career.

"You can literally change people's lives by taking money stresses away," Anderson tells BBC Sport.

"People don't understand simple things around finance so making things clearer for people and helping them keeps me motivated.

"I want to help as many people as possible. I'm so passionate about helping young football players."

Not too long ago, the 24-year-old was in the same position as those he now helps. So how did he end up here?

On 28 October 2017, Anderson became a world champion.

Five months on from spending England's European Under-17 Championship campaign on the bench, Anderson didn't miss a minute as Steve Cooper's side reached the final of the U17 World Cup in India.

England had a squad including future Premier League regulars Phil Foden - who was named player of the tournament - Morgan Gibbs-White, Conor Gallagher, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Marc Guehi, and produced a remarkable comeback to beat Spain 5-2 after trailing 2-0.

"We were so relaxed and confident, nobody panicked," Anderson recalls.

"We pulled a goal back then went into half-time thinking 'we've got this'. There was no one getting stressed or going crazy in the dressing room."

Anderson was on top of the world but, by his own admission, he became impatient.

Anderson sought a move away in search of more minutes, but was still at City when the transfer window closed after a loan move to a Championship club fell through.

With few options on the table, Anderson decided to join American side Charlotte Independence of the United Soccer League on a permanent basis in March 2019. 

It was a decision he came to regret - three months later, the manager who signed Anderson was sacked, and he found himself out of favour.

"I look back and think, at 18, what was I in a rush for?" says Anderson.

"I was in such a desperate rush to do everything. I came off the back of the World Cup and expected everything now. I was looking at other young players, what they were doing, and not really valuing the path that I was on.

"Playing for City and England, my trajectory would have been straight up."

After a year on the books at Wycombe Wanderers, Anderson dropped down into non-league before retiring in 2023.

"The spark of football just wasn't really there," he says.

"I didn't have the same drive and love for it that I had five years earlier, I was happy to do my day job. The decision to fully stop playing came quite easily."

Anderson left Manchester City in 2019 to play in the United States

Like most footballers, Anderson started young.

His first taste of football came in his home town of Barrow-in-Furness, where he played both outfield and in goal for the under-six team coached by his dad.

Before long he was scouted by Blackpool, where he played until the two Manchester giants came calling.

Manchester United and City both wanted the 11-year-old, but he and his family were swayed by the latter's plans for the state-of-the-art City Football Academy.

Moving from a small town in Cumbria to a new city and an elite club was a daunting experience, but one Anderson feels helped him develop as a person and switch careers years later.

"Being in a high performance environment every single day, where you try to achieve the highest level, working as hard as you can and being called out if you're not at the level - not many kids are exposed to that," he says.

"It shapes you as a person. When I look back at my football career, people ask me if I regret it but absolutely not. 

"Football gave me absolutely everything, in terms of exposure and the opportunity to mature really young."

When the coronavirus lockdown left Anderson unable to find a new club, he started wondering how the money he had earned at City had dwindled away.

"I remember being 17 and not knowing what to do with the money, it was a daunting thing," he says.

Anderson passed accountancy and finance exams after contacting the Professional Footballers' Association for guidance.

He decided that path wasn't for him, which led to him shadowing a financial adviser near his parents' house. 

He's worked in financial planning and advice ever since, turning down several offers to return to the Football League as his heart wasn't in it.

His new pursuit provided a level of control and security - as well as purpose - that playing lower-league football could not.

"At Wycombe, I'd get questions from older players," he says. "I realised there is a lack of education and support about finance in football. 

"There's not enough education, guidance and support for young people with high earnings.

"If you're a lower-league player, your immediate priority should be to plan for life after football. If you've got that sorted, you can set yourself and your family up for years.

"I look at what I know now and feel like I need to help as many people in football as I can."

But when he sees his former England team-mates succeeding at the top of the game, does he have any regrets?

"I'm proud to see them doing so well, I don't sit there and think I wish I was doing that, or what could have been," he says.

"I've got no regrets and I'm not envious. I just stopped enjoying it. If you offered to put me in their situations now, playing week-in week-out in the Premier League, I wouldn't trade that for what I'm doing now.

"When I look at my football career, it gave me the opportunity to do what I do now. There aren't many financial advisers under 25 - or not many good ones anyway!"

Two weeks after completing her Wimbledon breakthrough, Iga Swiatek dropped just four games in her return to action, extending her run of form in a second-round win over Guo Hanyu.

After Iga Swiatek swept to the Wimbledon title, she admitted the breakthrough was so far-fetched she never even dreamed of it happening.

“Because it seemed so far away,” Swiatek said afterward. “I feel like I am already an experienced player, having won Slams before, but I never expected to win this one.”

Now that she's checked that elusive box, this question looms: Is there anything she can't do?

The most recent confirmation that Swiatek is again in the midst of a dangerous groove came Wednesday afternoon in Montreal when she defeated qualifier Guo Hanyu 6-3, 6-1 in a second-round match at the Omnium Banque Nationale.

Let the record show that when she won the opening four games, Swiatek ran her staggering total of consecutive games to 24. How is that possible? She won the last two games of the first set in the Wimbledon semifinal against Belinda Bencic before closing out the second set 6-0. And then threw down a perfect 6-0, 6-0 against Amanda Anisimova in the final.

So, to review, when Guo broke her serve in the fifth game, Swiatek lost her first game in 20 days -- which, of course, included a seaside vacation. Next for the No. 2 seed is the winner of the later match between No. 27 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Eva Lys on Friday.

Guo, a 27-year-old from China, is a formidable doubles player, with two titles this year (Bad Homburg and Adelaide) with partner Alexandra Panova. Guo began the year at No. 538 in the rankings but managed to win two qualifying matches in Montreal.

Her 6-3, 6-3 first-round win over Yulia Putintseva was Guo's first-career main-draw win at the WTA level. She was, predictably, no match for Swiatek.

Swiatek broke Guo's serve six of eight times, improving the Hologic WTA Tour's highest percentage of winning return games to 47 -- 102 of 221. Swiatek's career record against players ranked outside the Top 200 is now 21-1.

Aryna Sabalenka has been the No. 1-ranked player for 41 consecutive weeks and counting. But the Wimbledon result suggested that Swiatek -- after a difficult year when she changed coaches and served a brief suspension -- is ready to challenge her again. Swiatek was No. 1 for 125 weeks, already the seventh highest total since the rankings were instituted 50 years ago.

At Wimbledon, Swiatek made a conscious effort to be more aggressive, pumping up her serve, taking more risks and flattening out her groundstrokes. Will that trend continue on hard courts?

Swiatek's best effort in Canada came two years ago in the semifinals in Montreal. She lost there to eventual champion Jessica Pegula. The Canadian Open and Cincinnati are the only two WTA 1000s in which Swiatek has failed to reach the final.

Based on recent returns, that might be about to change.

 

Two weeks after completing her Wimbledon breakthrough, Iga Swiatek dropped just four games in her return to action, extending her run of form in a second-round win over Guo Hanyu.

Iga Swiatek has just won her first match since Wimbledon and she did it in routine fashion after ousting Guo Hanyu 6-3 6-1 in just over an hour of play.

After winning her maiden Wimbledon title, the Polish tennis superstar made a lightning start to her Montreal opener, breaking the 259th-ranked qualifier twice in a row to open a 4-0 lead. While the Chinese managed to get one break back in the fifth game, it didn't disrupt the six-time Grand Slam champion, who held on to her second break to seal the opener.

Up by a set, Swiatek also started the second set with an early break, but dropped her serve for the first time in the following game. But once again, she remained unfazed - won the next five games - to complete her win in straight sets.

In her pre-tournament Montreal presser, Swiatek admitted that it wasn't easy to get back to work after achieving her dream. But, she still remained true to herself and did her best to be as ready as possible for the summer on hard courts.

"Reaching the top is a challenge. It requires mental strength and a lot of consistency. You always have to be ready for every tournament, both physically and mentally. Becoming the player everyone wants to defeat is one of the most difficult things. It's been a very busy couple of weeks, but I'm very happy. Winning Wimbledon was a dream come true. I went back to work with my team to get used to the new conditions and the new surface. I'm glad I arrived a little early to train and prepare. I'm really looking forward to playing the tournament," Swiatek said after arriving in Montreal.

Ben Shelton produced another dominant serving display on Wednesday in his opening match at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, where he brushed aside Adrian Mannarino 6-2, 6-3 to reach the third round in Toronto.

The fourth-seeded American won 90 per cent (28/31) of his first-serve points and saved both break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to capture his first win against the Frenchman in the pair's third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

"I have played good matches against him but come up short," said Shelton, who previously lost to Mannarino at the Australian Open (2024) and in Miami (2023). "He makes things really difficult and returns really well. So the way that I served today, to take the racquet out of his hands, I knew I had to be accurate.

"Usually with him a big serve doesn't always work, because his hands are so good and he stands up on the baseline. I have to hit spots and I hit spots really, really well today. I am really happy with the way I served."

With his 65-minute victory, Shelton recorded his 25th win at an ATP Masters 1000 event. The 22-year-old, competing at a career-high No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has now won eight of his past 10 matches.
"It got a little dicey in that last game but I am happy with the way I stay composed at the end and served it out down break point at the end," Shelton added.
A semi-finalist in Washington last week, Shelton will next meet 25th seed Brandon Nakashima or Ethan Quinn. Shelton is seeking his first Masters 1000 title this fortnight in Toronto and is currently ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, aiming to make his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals this year.

Earlier, Andrey Rublev moved past Hugo Gaston 6-2, 6-3 to record his 250th victory on hard courts. The 27-year-old, who earned his first tour-level hard-court win in Delray Beach in 2015, finished with a 19-17 winners-to-unforced errors count against Gaston to reach the third round.
"He has amazing touch, amazing legs," Rublev said on Gaston. "It is natural against those kinds of players to have your rhythm broken. So it is important to step in and take time away from them, because all of that is natural for them."
The sixth seed Rublev advanced to the title match at the ATP Masters 1000 event last year, falling to champion Alexei Popyrin. Chasing his second trophy of the season, the Doha titlist will next meet 28th seed Lorenzo Sonego or China's Buyunchaokete.

Third-round action gets underway on day five at ATP Toronto on what promises to be an entertaining day of tennis in Ontario. As ever, we here at LWOT will be offering our predictions for every match on the slate, including Daniil Medvedev vs Alexei Popyrin. But who will book their place in the last 16?

Head-to-head: Tien 1-0 Opelka

Learner Tien got a big win in the second round against Denis Shapovalov as his impressive Canadian Open debut continues. He was rock solid thorugh and forced Shapovalov to go for broke, resulting in the Canadian making a few too many errors in a tight two-set challenge. Reilly Opelka will be a completely different challenge, with the older of the two American's out for revenge after losing to Tien in Rome. Opelka will have a better chance against Tien on the fast, bouncy courts in Canada but Tien is also more at home on a North Americann hard court and he will also like his chances every time he gets into rallies.

Prediction: Tien in 3

Head-to-head: Etcheverry 2-1 Cerundolo

Francisco Cerundolo won a close second-round encounter against Jaume Munar – doubtless a particularly welcome victory after a string of defeats in close matches recently. Both players made a lot of errors in this match, but Cerundolo was clinical in saving several break points in the third set. Tomas Martin Etcheverry, meanwhile, played a fabulous match to knock out Tallon Griekspoor in the second round. Etcheverry served brilliantly and made very few errors in one of his best hard-court performances this season. If he can sustain this level, he will cause a lot of problems for Cerundolo.

Prediction: Etcheverry in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

Lorenzo Musetti is a top-three seed for the first time in a Masters tournament, and he is off to a good start. He defeated James Duckworth in straight sets and won 90% of his first serve points. However, he will need to improve his first serve percentage against Alex Michelsen, who is a solid returner and will look to pounce on Musetti's second serves. Still, Musetti should have the edge in longer rallies, and his creativity could frustrate the American player. Expect a close match but for the higher-ranked man to come out on top.

Prediction: Musetti in 3

Head-to-head: Zverev 1-0 Arnaldi

Top seed Alexander Zverev battled past the in-form Adam Walton in the second round. He lost just three points behind his first serve but made more errors than usual and will look to rectify that against Matteo Arnaldi, who pushed Zverev in their only previous meeting. Arnaldi is a great mover and can hit winners from anywhere when needed. Expect another close encounter between these two, but give the German the edge.

Prediction: Zverev in 3

A clash between two former champions is the headline act on on what promises to be an entertaining day five at ATP Toronto with eight matches on the slate. As ever, we here at LWOT will be offering our predictions for every match on the slate, including Alexander Zverev vs Matteo Arnaldi. But who will book their spot in the last 16?

Head-to-head: first meeting

Emilio Nava has three quarterfinals to his name since the start of June with his recent uptick pushing him closer to a top 100 breakthrough. A win over Karen Khachanov will put him on the brink. But that is easier said than done. The Russian was at his free-flowing best to begin the tournament, dismissing Juan Pablo Ficovich in straight sets, dropping just six games. Expect Khachanov to be the better player in the big moments.

Prediction: Khachanov in 2

Head-to-head: Ruud 1-1 Borges

This will be a French Open rematch, almost two months on from Nuno Borges stunning 2-6 6-4 6-1 6-0 over Casper Ruud in the second round at Roland Garros. But it's tough to read too much into that. The Norwegian had been struggling with an injury for much of the clay-court swing and was clearly unfit to play when they met in Paris. He then didn't feature on grass because of a knee injury. A healthy Ruud should be a class above Borges, and this will be a good opportunity to avenge that defeat at ATP Toronto.

Prediction: Ruud in 2

Head-to-head: Rune 1-0 Muller

Holger Rune secured a massive win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, his first in over a month. That might just be a turning point for the 22-year-old who demonstrated his hard-court credential by reaching the fina in Indian Wells during the Sunshine Double (though he was well-beaten there by Jack Draper). With some of the big guns missing in Toronto, Rune will surely believe he can get his hand on another Masters title should he make it to the deep end of the draw. This is unlikely to be an entirely straightforward day for the Dane with Alexandre Muller not to be underestimated, but the match up still favours him.

Prediction: Rune in 3

Head-to-head: Medvedev 4-1 Popyrin

Alexei Popyrin became one of the most unexpected Masters champions in this tournament last season. But the Australian has been candid about his struggles this season. His game was all over the place during the grass-court swing. Although he picked up a confidence-boosting straight sets win in his opening match of his title defense, Popyrin has not been playing with a lot of ryhthm, both tactically and mentally. Daniil Medvedev will bring a much higher floor despite his own inconsistencies and looking physically drained in some of his matches. With Popyrin short of his best, Medvedev is likely to seize that advantage.

Prediction: Medvedev in 3

Jessica Pegula offered honest, thoughtful reflections during a recent mental health panel in Montreal, where the WTA Foundation also announced a $10,000 donation to the Canadian Centre for Mental Health and Sport.

Mental health was at the forefront earlier this week at the National Bank Open in Canada. A number of tennis stars took part in enlightening and powerful mental health panels in Montreal, where the WTA event is being held, and Toronto, where the men are playing.

This was the second consecutive year that Tennis Canada staged the event in partnership with the WTA, and the first time that a mental health panel was held at an ATP Masters 1000 event.

At IGA Stadium in Montreal, World No. 4 and reigning Canada champion Jessica Pegula participated in a conversation with Blair Henley, Tournament Director Valérie Tétreault, coach Mark Gellard and WTA Tour Director of Safeguarding Lindsay Brandon.

Among others topics, the conversation focused on how players can maintain a healthy presence online in the age of social media while still being able to compete at their highest level. They also discussed the Threat Matrix, a proactive monitoring service that aims to protect athletes from online abuse and threats. The Threat Matrix was launched in 2023 by the International Tennis Federation, the WTA, the All England Lawn Tennis Club and the United States Tennis Association.

“A lot of people don't realize how many bad messages we get," Pegula explained, "and the irony is that it doesn't matter if we win or lose. You have to have thick skin as an athlete, but it's definitely becoming necessary to change our habits online, to use measures to filter out the negativity, and even to turn off comments during tournament weeks.”

In Toronto, the panel featured Tennis Canada's Director of Wellness Marie-Josée Bellemare, coach Craig Boynton, Sportsnet's Caroline Cameron, World No. 13 Casper Ruud and World No. 11 Andrey Rublev. The group discussed ways to normalize open and honest conversations about mental well-being, how negative perceptions can deter individuals from seeking help, and the importance of building a culture of support within teams and organizations.

"Certain things you can keep to yourself, but I had a good experience talking with a psychologist,” Ruud said. “You go to the gym with a trainer to work on your fitness, but talking to a psychologist is like working on your mental aspect in the same way -- you work out your brain a little bit, get your thoughts sorted and find new ways to motivate yourself. I just found it really helpful. I didn't [necessarily] want to be a voice [on mental health] but it felt like a natural thing to talk about.

"I wanted to advise people that, if you're struggling or if you have issues, or you're uncertain if you should talk to someone or not, it's definitely a good thing to try. It helped for me.”

The panels on Monday were part of Tennis Canada's Mental Health Strategy, which launched in February 2024. The strategy -- in partnership with the University of Ottawa, Own the Podium, the Canadian Centre for Mental Health and Sport (CCMHS) and Game Plan -- strives to improve the health and wellness of Tennis Canada's athletes, coaches, parents and staff members. And the Mental Timeout initiative, a key part of the strategy's Promote pillar, aims to bring awareness to the importance of mental health and wellness.

“These stories are so important because they're motivating, inspirational and they're breaking down barriers,” Tennis Canada Chief Executive Officer Gavin Ziv said. "So, we are very appreciative, and we take this topic very seriously at Tennis Canada. Marie-Josee [Bellemare] and her team are doing incredible work, not just with the kids in our program, but with our coaches and parents. This is part of what it takes to be successful.

"We are happy with where we are, but we know we have a lot more work to do. So, please, keep on listening."

During the panels in Montreal and Toronto, the WTA Foundation and ATP Serves announced that they will each make $10,000 donations to the CCMHS.

Ben Shelton and Alex de Minaur have both enjoyed successful 2025 campaigns on the ATP Tour.

Shelton reached the Australian Open semi-final in January and the Wimbledon quarter-final in July, while de Minaur recently captured his 10th tour title at the Washington Open.

Both players are set to compete at this week's Canadian Open in Toronto. Shelton faces Adrian Mannarino in his first match while de Minaur will compete against Francisco Comesana.

De Minaur and Shelton are both young and still have time to capture their first Grand Slam titles. However, two superstars have emerged in the form of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, meaning lower-ranked players will likely have to defeat both players to win a Grand Slam.

These two top-10 ranked players also hold an unwanted record which spans the 2025 season. This is a record that must change if they hope to win the US Open in August.

Neither Ben Shelton nor Alex de Minaur has beaten a top-10 ATP player in 2025.

Both players have had five chances, and they have both lost all five of their respective encounters. This record, which is the worst of any player on tour, does not bode well for the US Open.

Shelton first lost to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open quarter-finals. He then lost to Alexander Zverev at the BMW Open and later to Carlos Alcaraz at the French Open.

The American was defeated by Zverev again at the BOSS Open, before losing to Jannik Sinner once more in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon.

Alex de Minaur has also struggled against top-10 opponents, despite recently winning the Washington Open.

The ‘demon' also lost to Jannik Sinner at the Australian Open. He later lost to Carlos Alcaraz at the Rotterdam Open, before losing to Lorenzo Musetti at the Madrid Open.

His woes continued at the Barcelona Open, where he lost to Alcaraz again, before being defeated by Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon quarter-finals.

These two top-10 ranked players simply must improve their record against top-10 players if they are to have any chance of winning the US Open.

Very rarely does a draw open up to benefit lower-ranked players, especially when the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are fit and healthy.

The last time this happened at a Grand Slam was in 2014, when 14th seed Marin Cilic defeated 10th seed Kei Nishikori to win the US Open title. This match saw the lowest set of seeds contest a US Open final since 2002.

Ben Shelton and Alex de Minaur have had contrasting success in terms of tournament victories on the ATP Tour. De Minaur is the proud owner of 10, while Shelton has only won two titles; less than the three Luciano Darderi has won.

However, Shelton is the obvious choice in this matter. While de Minaur has demonstrated more consistency over the course of a season, Shelton has regularly performed well on the biggest stages.

De Minaur has never reached the semi-final stage of a Grand Slam, despite numerous quarter-final appearances.

Meanwhile, Shelton reached the semi-final stage at both the 2024 US Open and the 2025 Australian Open.

Furthermore, Shelton possesses bigger weapons. While de Minaur may be the most agile player we have seen on a tennis court, he does not have a single shot which represents a significant threat against the likes of Jannik Sinner.

Shelton, on the other hand, has a booming forehand and monstrous serve; both of which can be used to trouble higher-ranked opponents at the US Open.

Shelton, on the other hand, has a booming forehand and monstrous serve; both of which can be used to trouble higher-ranked opponents at the US Open.

Jessica Pegula offered honest, thoughtful reflections during a recent mental health panel in Montreal, where the WTA Foundation also announced a $10,000 donation to the Canadian Centre for Mental Health and Sport.

Mental health was at the forefront earlier this week at the National Bank Open in Canada. A number of tennis stars took part in enlightening and powerful mental health panels in Montreal, where the WTA event is being held, and Toronto, where the men are playing.

This was the second consecutive year that Tennis Canada staged the event in partnership with the WTA, and the first time that a mental health panel was held at an ATP Masters 1000 event.

At IGA Stadium in Montreal, World No. 4 and reigning Canada champion Jessica Pegula participated in a conversation with Blair Henley, Tournament Director Valérie Tétreault, coach Mark Gellard and WTA Tour Director of Safeguarding Lindsay Brandon.

Among others topics, the conversation focused on how players can maintain a healthy presence online in the age of social media while still being able to compete at their highest level. They also discussed the Threat Matrix, a proactive monitoring service that aims to protect athletes from online abuse and threats. The Threat Matrix was launched in 2023 by the International Tennis Federation, the WTA, the All England Lawn Tennis Club and the United States Tennis Association.

“A lot of people don't realize how many bad messages we get," Pegula explained, "and the irony is that it doesn't matter if we win or lose. You have to have thick skin as an athlete, but it's definitely becoming necessary to change our habits online, to use measures to filter out the negativity, and even to turn off comments during tournament weeks.”

In Toronto, the panel featured Tennis Canada's Director of Wellness Marie-Josée Bellemare, coach Craig Boynton, Sportsnet's Caroline Cameron, World No. 13 Casper Ruud and World No. 11 Andrey Rublev. The group discussed ways to normalize open and honest conversations about mental well-being, how negative perceptions can deter individuals from seeking help, and the importance of building a culture of support within teams and organizations.

"Certain things you can keep to yourself, but I had a good experience talking with a psychologist,” Ruud said. “You go to the gym with a trainer to work on your fitness, but talking to a psychologist is like working on your mental aspect in the same way -- you work out your brain a little bit, get your thoughts sorted and find new ways to motivate yourself. I just found it really helpful. I didn't [necessarily] want to be a voice [on mental health] but it felt like a natural thing to talk about.

"I wanted to advise people that, if you're struggling or if you have issues, or you're uncertain if you should talk to someone or not, it's definitely a good thing to try. It helped for me.”

The panels on Monday were part of Tennis Canada's Mental Health Strategy, which launched in February 2024. The strategy -- in partnership with the University of Ottawa, Own the Podium, the Canadian Centre for Mental Health and Sport (CCMHS) and Game Plan -- strives to improve the health and wellness of Tennis Canada's athletes, coaches, parents and staff members. And the Mental Timeout initiative, a key part of the strategy's Promote pillar, aims to bring awareness to the importance of mental health and wellness.

“These stories are so important because they're motivating, inspirational and they're breaking down barriers,” Tennis Canada Chief Executive Officer Gavin Ziv said. "So, we are very appreciative, and we take this topic very seriously at Tennis Canada. Marie-Josee [Bellemare] and her team are doing incredible work, not just with the kids in our program, but with our coaches and parents. This is part of what it takes to be successful.

"We are happy with where we are, but we know we have a lot more work to do. So, please, keep on listening."

During the panels in Montreal and Toronto, the WTA Foundation and ATP Serves announced that they will each make $10,000 donations to the CCMHS.

Pam Shriver is very passionate about women's tennis and is a former US Open singles finalist.

Shriver, who was Donna Vekic's coach until recently, is also a former doubles world number one and won a combined 22 Grand Slam titles in her career.

There is often a debate about the differences between men's and women's tennis, and what can be done for both tours to be treated equally.

Now, Shriver has revealed her wish for the WTA Tour that she believes would make it ‘so much better'.

There have been six different winners in the past six years in the women's singles event at the US Open.

Aryna Sabalenka is currently the reigning US Open champion, with the likes of Emma Raducanu, Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu also winning the prestigious title in recent years.

When speaking to Talking Tennis about Raducanu, Shriver went on to explain how much she thought women's tennis would benefit from the likes of the 2021 US Open champion, Osaka and Andreescu all returning to their previous heights.

“And now she is here at 22 years old, kind of step by step getting better in her game figuring out how to, talking about someone who needs to figure out how to stay healthy it's Raducanu,” said Shriver. 

“I know a lot of people question all the turnover in her coaching team, but as you know she's healthy and clear in her head how she wants to construct points, you know she can lean on a lot of different voices and seems to be able to do pretty well. 

“And let's hope…I mean women's tennis would be so much better if Andreescu, if Raducanu, if Osaka and those are all past US Open winners, Osaka obviously a couple of Australian's as well. 

“But, we need these past major winners that should still be in their prime to be able to be a part of the conversation and then can you imagine what we would have on the women's side, so that's my hope for women's tennis is that does happen.”

Raducanu has made recent improvements to her game that were on show at the Washington Open where she reached the semifinals.

During that run, Raducanu actually beat Osaka, who appears to be struggling to return to the player that was once world number one.

Osaka has recently split from coach Patrick Mouratoglou and is now working on a trial basis with Iga Swiatek's former coach Tomasz Wiktorowski.

The former US Open champion that Shriver mentioned who appears furthest from her best out of the three is Bianca Andreescu.

Andreescu won her first match at the Canadian Open, but was left in tears after injuring her ankle in the last game of the match.

This has been a familiar feeling for the Canadian, who has dealt with many different injury struggles and is currently ranked down at world number 187.

Raducanu won the US Open as a qualifier in 2021, stunning the sporting world by making history at just 18 years old.

The Briton has dealt with many injury struggles of her own since then and underwent surgeries to both of her wrists and left ankle in 2023.

Raducanu has been unable to surpass the fourth round of a major tournament since then, with Shriver now giving her verdict on if she can add to her major tally.

“Well listen, if you can come out of qualifying and win ten straight matches in straight sets, I'm not going to say she can't do it again,” said Shriver. “Obviously in the last say three and a half years, four years she's kind of fallen back into kind of like a solid player with some good results during the year. 

“But if you just took her resume, take that US Open out, that one tournament out, you would probably say no she's not going to win one. She might have some quarterfinals, semifinals, but when you know that somebody's had the mindset to do it once you always think sure, they can do it again.”

Ironically since Raducanu won the US Open in 2021, it has actually been the only Grand Slam tournament where she has failed to win a single match.

In 2025, Raducanu has only lost to Aryna Sabalenka and Swiatek at Grand Slam tournaments.

Becoming seeded for the US Open has to be a big goal for Raducanu, and she will look to continue her rise up the rankings when she plays Peyton Stearns at the Canadian Open.

Former world No 14 Jerzy Janowicz has offered a harsh assessment of Iga Swiatek's Wimbledon title run as he claimed his fellow Pole “didn't have a single test.”

An imperious Swiatek dropped just a single set en route to claiming her maiden Wimbledon crown and sixth Grand Slam title overall.

It was Swiatek's first career grass-court title and followed her runner-up result at the WTA 500 event in Bad Homburg the week before Wimbledon.

The highest-ranked player Swiatek faced at Wimbledon was Amanda Anisimova, who was the world No 12 at the time.

The 24-year-old destroyed Anisimova in less than an hour to claim the first-ever 6-0, 6-0 victory in a Wimbledon final.

In an interview with Polish outlet Super Express, Janowicz — who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2013 — questioned Swiatek's grass-court credentials despite her Wimbledon victory.

“I wouldn't say Iga plays well on grass, because she didn't really have a single major test at Wimbledon,” said Janowicz.

“She played against girls who were much weaker at tennis, she didn't really play against any girls who could give her trouble on grass.

Iga Swiatek says losing the No.1 title was ‘freeing' despite ‘not fair' admission

Iga Swiatek opens up on failed doping test, branding it a ‘terrible' and ‘confusing' experience

“These were girls who were really learning grass or who played poorly on grass. The ladder simply opened up for Iga, and Iga took advantage of it brilliantly.

“She didn't have a single test at Wimbledon this year, so it's hard to give a blanket assessment. No one could have given her such pure tennis conditions — not just the grass, but pure tennis conditions — to test Iga. One thing we know for sure is that Iga passed the open bracket test perfectly.”

The former Polish star went on to argued that Swiatek's Wimbledon win will not fix the “problems” he believes she is battling.

“It's hard for me to predict things from my own eyes, because I don't follow every single match,” Janowicz added.

“I'd say that even this victory won't solve Iga's typical problems, because Iga usually has problems — let's even call them mental — when there's resistance from the other side.

“If her opponent offers no resistance and everything goes according to plan, as Iga hopes, then her facial expression or demeanour don't indicate any problems.

“Problems arise when plan A doesn't quite work out as she'd like, because there's resistance from the other side, and that's when these problems arise. Will this continue? We'll see at the next tournament.”

Janowicz has competed in Padel since playing his last tennis match in 2022. The 34-year-old was plagued by injuries in the latter years of his career having made his breakthrough by reaching the 2012 Paris Masters final.

                After 75 weeks at the top, Iga Swiatek lost her No.1 spot to Aryna Sabalenka following a surprise US Open defeat.            


                “When everything came out [publicly], I was basically crying for two weeks, couldn't practice."            


                Iga Swiatek has lauded Carlos Alcaraz's approach to the sport.            


                Jessica Pegula has a lot of points to defend in Canada, but Iga Swiatek will start with a clean slate while Emma Raducanu's points situation is slightly complicated.

Iga Swiatek has told Wimbledon chiefs they “did it wrong” after revealing during this summer's Grand Slam event that she likes to eat a strawberry and pasta dish. The Pole stormed to the title at the All England Club for the first time in her career after thrashing Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in the final.

Swiatek has traditionally struggled on grass and hadn't progressed beyond the Wimbledon quarter-finals ahead of this year's edition of the tournament. But she produced a fine run of form to ease to the title after a string of her rivals were knocked out early on. And following her third-round victory over Danielle Collins, she told the Wimbledon crowd about her favourite meal during an on-court interview with Annabel Croft.

“I have my favourite actually, I ate it as a kid, it's pasta with strawberries,” Swiatek explained. “Pasta, strawberries, a little bit of yoghurt. It's just great.”

Many tennis fans had never heard of the dish, which is known as Makaron z truskawkami in Poland, and her comments went viral as a host of people gave their verdict on the meal.

And Swiatek was asked about the dish during an appearance on the Served with Andy Roddick podcast.





Roddick began: “I was sitting in the Royal Box at Wimbledon and I had the pleasure of watching you play that day. It was the match against Danielle.

“I left that match and I said, ‘I know grass hasn't been her favourite surface throughout her career so far, [but] I go, ‘She's in this thing to win it.'

“In that interview - and I know you've talked about this a couple of times - I just need some more information about this pasta and strawberries thing. So congrats on winning Wimbledon and also making this food choice mainstream.”

And Swiatek replied: “It got kind of crazy, I don't know how that happened. I wasn't expecting that kind of reaction.”

She then added: “If anyone watched that Wimbledon video, when they tried it, that's not the proper way to make it, sorry Wimbledon.

“Basically you've got to smash the strawberries so they're all kind of juicy. And then they mix perfectly with the pasta and the yoghurt or the cream. You should smash them as hard as possible, that's the thing. So everything is mixed.

“You don't smash the pasta, come on, that would be too much. You smash the strawberries. That's the way they're going to connect all the sensations, all the juicy strawberry jam.”

Tennis fans will tell you that the Stefanos Tsitsipas experience is not for the faint of heart.

At times, the well-coiffed Greek can look unplayable, but far too often he looks like he's lost the plot. Tsitsipas, once ranked No. 3 in the world, is now at No. 30, and has not won three matches in a row since March, when he followed up a title in Dubai with back-to-back victories in Indian Wells.

At the time of that streak, Tsitsipas was ranked No. 8 and looked like he was on the cusp of a resurgent season.

Instead, the 26-year-old won nine of his next 17 matches and is now in danger of losing his seeded status for the US Open.

Tsitsipas' off-court dramatics always follow him around, and things are quite noisy right now.

Not only is Tsitsipas' high-profile romance with WTA star Paula Badosa over, he also abruptly split with his coach, Goran Ivanisevic, before the North American hard-court swing.

Perhaps this is the kind of jolt Tsitsipas needs to close out the year strong, but it's hard not to get worried when there's seemingly always something going on in his camp.

Tsitsipas remains one of the most talented players on the ATP Tour and can play an opponent like Christopher O'Connell off the court, but at the same time the Aussie is the exact type of foe that can be a thorn in the side of a hot-headed favorite.

O'Connell won't cede an inch, knowing he just needs to hang around in the match as long as possible in order to give Tsitsipas the runway to unravel.

O'Connell had a very disappointing campaign on the grass, but he's never seemed comfortable on the surface and should be buoyant after a dominant win over Chun Hsin Tseng in Round 1 in Canada.

Tsitsipas could make quick work of O'Connell, but it's more likely that this match has plenty of twists and turns.

Tennis is a gruelling sport that can really take its toll on players both physically and mentally.

Ons Jabeur has recently announced she is taking a break from the sport, as she bids ‘to rediscover the joy of simply living'.

Even multiple-time Grand Slam champions have struggled this year, with Carlos Alcaraz also considering taking a break earlier this year.

Now an ATP player who once claimed he had what it takes to become world number one has announced that he will be taking a break of his own after dropping down the rankings.

Maxime Cressy is an American player who has a career-high ranking of world number 31.

He achieved this ranking in 2022, the same year that he won his maiden ATP title at the Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Rhode Island.

However, Cressy has not enjoyed so much success since then, and has not won a match on the main ATP Tour since July 2024.

The 28-year-old has only won two of his last 10 matches on the lower-level ATP Challenger Tour, with his most recent loss coming via retirement at the tournament in Tyler, Texas.

This drop-off in form has seen Cressy plummet down the rankings to world number 681, which is his lowest ranking in seven years.

In a new post on social media, Cressy announced that he will now be taking an indefinite break from the sport to recover from a long-term back problem that he has been managing since 2023.

“Hi everyone!” Cressy began in his Instagram post. “I just wanted to be honest and transparent: I've decided to step away from the tour for the time being to focus on recovering from an ongoing lower back injury.

“Since 2023, I have had severe lower back pain but I played through it again and again. Today, it has reached a point where I can no longer compete an entire match competitively. I have dedicated my entire life to becoming the best tennis player I can be, I wished it was to be the best but I know that I have given my absolute best effort and I have the peace of mind with that knowingness.

“I'm grateful for the support and love I've received throughout my career, and for those who've stood beside me both on and off the court.”

A post shared by Maxime Cressy (@maximecressy)

This is a dramatic fall for Cressy, who once had huge hopes for his career after winning his first ATP title in Newport.

When speaking to the ATPTour.com after that victory, Cressy revealed his goals to reach the summit of the rankings.

“Regardless of the ups and downs, my ranking has just skyrocketed really fast in the past two years,” Cressy said at the time. “Considering all the failures that I've had, it's been kind of crazy, because I definitely feel like I've fallen down a lot.

“But I rose back up quickly, I never gave up and I stayed resilient. Being just outside the top 30 that quickly is a huge indication that I have what it takes to be world number one.  I don't think that belief is ever going to change.”

Cressy has only declined in the rankings since then, and it is now unclear if he will ever play professional tennis again.

Danish tennis star Holger Rune found himself on the wrong end of a slightly embarrassing but nonetheless harmful and funny story, as Russian WTA player Veronika Kudermetova revealed that the ATP talent tried sliding into her DMs on Instagram, only to be turned away by the fact that Kudermetova is happily married.

Speaking on former Russian player Elena Vesnina's podcast, 2025 Wimbledon women's doubles champion Kudermetova revealed that the Danish top 10 player is one player who approached her, but she had to let him down with grace, on the counts of having a partner and also being six years older than the men's star.

“Rune recently texted me. I told him, ‘Boy, I'm probably too old for you. If you looked at my Instagram, you'd see I have a husband,'” revealed Kudermetova, who is currently ranked 42nd on the WTA tour, but has formerly been in the top 10. She is currently ranked fifth on the WTA tour in doubles after lifting the Wimbledon title alongside Elise Mertens, the first major title of her career.

“He replied, ‘Oh, sorry.' After that, he stopped saying hi to me,” revealed the Russian, who is currently participating in the National Bank Open in Montreal and is set to play Coco Gauff in the third round of that event. Rune, meanwhile, came through a tricky second round contest against big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi-Perricard in the men's tournament taking place in Toronto.

Kudermetova is married to her long-time coach Sergei Demekhine, who has been part of her coaching staff since she was a teenager coming through the ranks in Russia. While she has had a solid singles career, she has had more success on the doubles court, including a statement win at Wimbledon this year.

Rune, meanwhile, is looking for more consistency to try and make that big step up from being a contender to being a serious champion on the men's tour. After a breakthrough in 2022-23, Rune dropped out of the top 10, but marked his return earlier in 2025. The Dane will be eyeing up a deep run at the US Open, for which the Canadian Masters tournament is the first of a series of warm-up events.

Coco Gauff overcomes 23 double faults to return to winning ways after disappointing Wimbledon exit, while Alexander Zverev and Lorenzo Musetti advance; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Wednesday 30 July 2025 06:59, UK

Coco Gauff made a winning return to competition on Tuesday night as she recorded her first victory since being crowned the French Open champion.

Gauff had to overcome 23 double-faults to win for the first time since the Roland Garros final, outlasting fellow American Danielle Collins 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2) in the second round of the National Bank Open.

Gauff hadn't played since losing in the first round at Wimbledon and appeared to have made a change to her serving grip during her time away. She struggled with it during the match, hitting some serves that were well long and others that were soft and easily pounced on by the powerful Collins.

"It was a frustrating match for me," Gauff said. "I felt like I was practising well and then I don't think I transferred it today, but hopefully I got my bad match of the tournament out of the way and I can come back stronger in the next round."

A balky serve ended her U.S. Open title defence last year, when she committed 19 double-faults in a fourth-round loss to Emma Navarro. The serve was even more erratic Tuesday, though Gauff did hit a good one to end the match with an ace.

She is the top seed in Montreal due to the withdrawal of top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, the player Gauff beat to win the French Open in June.

Gauff will face Veronika Kudermetova in the third round and said she had plenty left after the match that lasted two hours, 55 minutes, adding she could possibly cut that in half if she cleaned up her serve.

"I felt that I was playing well except that part of my game," Gauff said. "But I felt like off the ground I was playing pretty well."

Leylah Fernandez, meanwhile, criticised the schedule at the National Bank Open after the Canadian lost in the first round of her home tournament, two days after winning the title in Washington.

Fernandez was routed 6-4, 6-1 by Australian Maya Joint in just one hour, 15 minutes. The No 24-ranked player won her fourth career WTA title Sunday in Washington and was hoping for additional rest before returning to the court in Montreal.

Fernandez said she received "a lot of promises" that she would play during Tuesday's night session, giving her more time to recover between the two tournaments, but learned Sunday while traveling that wouldn't be the case.

"I did not receive that," she said. "That hurt me because I was very looking forward to be playing at night, but I guess it's a little bit political issues at that point."

Top-seeded Alexander Zverev beat Adam Walton 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 in his first match since Wimbledon, where he suffered a shock first-round exit to Arthur Rinderknech.

"I'm trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way," Zverev said.

The German is ranked third but seeded No 1 in this tournament that he won in 2017 after the withdrawals of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Zverev won a 52-shot rally in the tiebreaker to earn a set point.

"It was a very important moment and a very important point for me," Zverev said. "I was lucky to get through in the first set and then finish it off in two."

Third-seeded Lorenzo Musetti beat Australian qualifier James Duckworth 7-5, 6-1, while No 5 Holger Rune was a 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 winner over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard on a hot, sunny afternoon.

All seeded players had a first-round bye in the Masters 1000 tournament that also saw Jack Draper and Novak Djokovic withdraw.

Number eight seed Casper Ruud, No 10 Daniil Medvedev, No 11 Karen Khachanov, No 14 Francisco Cerundolo and No 18 Alexei Popyrin, the defending champion, were among the other winners. Reilly Opelka upset 16th-seeded Tomas Machac in three sets.

Coco Gauff overcomes 23 double faults to return to winning ways after disappointing Wimbledon exit, while Alexander Zverev and Lorenzo Musetti advance; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Wednesday 30 July 2025 06:59, UK

Coco Gauff made a winning return to competition on Tuesday night as she recorded her first victory since being crowned the French Open champion.

Gauff had to overcome 23 double-faults to win for the first time since the Roland Garros final, outlasting fellow American Danielle Collins 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2) in the second round of the National Bank Open.

Gauff hadn't played since losing in the first round at Wimbledon and appeared to have made a change to her serving grip during her time away. She struggled with it during the match, hitting some serves that were well long and others that were soft and easily pounced on by the powerful Collins.

"It was a frustrating match for me," Gauff said. "I felt like I was practising well and then I don't think I transferred it today, but hopefully I got my bad match of the tournament out of the way and I can come back stronger in the next round."

A balky serve ended her U.S. Open title defence last year, when she committed 19 double-faults in a fourth-round loss to Emma Navarro. The serve was even more erratic Tuesday, though Gauff did hit a good one to end the match with an ace.

She is the top seed in Montreal due to the withdrawal of top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, the player Gauff beat to win the French Open in June.

Gauff will face Veronika Kudermetova in the third round and said she had plenty left after the match that lasted two hours, 55 minutes, adding she could possibly cut that in half if she cleaned up her serve.

"I felt that I was playing well except that part of my game," Gauff said. "But I felt like off the ground I was playing pretty well."

Leylah Fernandez, meanwhile, criticised the schedule at the National Bank Open after the Canadian lost in the first round of her home tournament, two days after winning the title in Washington.

Fernandez was routed 6-4, 6-1 by Australian Maya Joint in just one hour, 15 minutes. The No 24-ranked player won her fourth career WTA title Sunday in Washington and was hoping for additional rest before returning to the court in Montreal.

Fernandez said she received "a lot of promises" that she would play during Tuesday's night session, giving her more time to recover between the two tournaments, but learned Sunday while traveling that wouldn't be the case.

"I did not receive that," she said. "That hurt me because I was very looking forward to be playing at night, but I guess it's a little bit political issues at that point."

Top-seeded Alexander Zverev beat Adam Walton 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 in his first match since Wimbledon, where he suffered a shock first-round exit to Arthur Rinderknech.

"I'm trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way," Zverev said.

The German is ranked third but seeded No 1 in this tournament that he won in 2017 after the withdrawals of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Zverev won a 52-shot rally in the tiebreaker to earn a set point.

"It was a very important moment and a very important point for me," Zverev said. "I was lucky to get through in the first set and then finish it off in two."

Third-seeded Lorenzo Musetti beat Australian qualifier James Duckworth 7-5, 6-1, while No 5 Holger Rune was a 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 winner over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard on a hot, sunny afternoon.

All seeded players had a first-round bye in the Masters 1000 tournament that also saw Jack Draper and Novak Djokovic withdraw.

Number eight seed Casper Ruud, No 10 Daniil Medvedev, No 11 Karen Khachanov, No 14 Francisco Cerundolo and No 18 Alexei Popyrin, the defending champion, were among the other winners. Reilly Opelka upset 16th-seeded Tomas Machac in three sets.

TORONTO (AP) — Top-seeded Alexander Zverev beat Adam Walton 7-6 (6), 6-4 at the National Bank Open on Tuesday night in his first match since Wimbledon.

Zverev is trying to get back on track after reaching the Australian Open final in a strong start to the season. He was upset by Arthur Rinderknech in the first round at Wimbledon, saying afterward he was struggling mentally.

"!'m trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way,” Zverev said.

The German is ranked third but seeded No. 1 in this tournament that he won in 2017 after the withdrawals of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Zverev won a 52-shot rally in the tiebreaker to earn a set point.

“It was a very important moment and a very important point for me,” Zverev said. “I was lucky to get through in the first set and then finish it off in two.”

Holger Rune may not be renowned for booming serves or towering aces, but he hit 6'8” powerhouse Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard with a taste of his own medicine on Tuesday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers.

After withdrawing from his opener in Washington last week due to back pain, Rune returned to claim a 7-6(7), 6-3 victory in Toronto, his first hard-court win since reaching the Indian Wells final in March. The fifth-seeded Dane fired 12 aces to Mpetshi Perricard's seven and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats, during their 76-minute clash.

“I haven't served like this in a while,” said Rune, who dropped just three of 21 second-serve points. “I've been working on some small adjustments on my serve and it seems to be feeling good. It felt really good and I trusted it all the way.

“When he's hitting those big serves, there's not much to do, so it's just about focusing on your own serve. I think I did that well. I'm just very happy with the match in general.”

Despite withdrawing on the day of his D.C. opener, Rune spent three days in Washington working with Andre Agassi. Their time together may have been short, but the former World No. 4 Rune looks sharp upon return to action for the first time since his first-round loss at Wimbledon last month.

Mpetshi Perricard dropped 17 aces on Rune en route to the Basel title last year, but the 22-year-old Dane used the quick conditions at the Canadian ATP Masters 1000 event to earn revenge and level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1.

With a 23-14 tour-level record in 2025, highlighted by winning the Barcelona title in April, Rune is 15th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He will next face Alexandre Muller in Toronto.

Lorenzo Musetti, who is sixth in the Live Race and aiming to debut at the Nitto ATP Finals, also came through his opening Toronto test in straight sets on Tuesday, beating James Duckworth 7-5, 6-1. With his win, the 23-year-old Italian snapped a three-match losing streak after first-round exits in Wimbledon and Washington.

The 23-year-old Italian owns a Tour-leading 17 wins at ATP Masters 1000 level this year, but 13 have come on clay. If he is to strengthen his chances of competing in Turin, he must carry the form he gathered during the European clay-court swing — where he reached the semi-finals at all three Masters events and Roland Garros — into the North American hard-court season.

Musetti will next play Alex Michelsen, who edged Tomas Barrios Vera 7-6(7), 6-3 in a tense second-round clash. The 26th-seeded American saved three set points in the opening set before racing through the second to earn his first win in Toronto.



In other early action, defending champion Alexei Popyrin began his campaign with a 7-6(7), 6-3 win against Canadian wild card Nicolas Arseneault. The 25-year-old Popyrin, who last year ousted five consecutive Top 20 players to win his biggest career title, will next play 10th seed Daniil Medvedev. Popyrin's second-round victory marked his third hard-court win of the season.

Medvedev overcame lucky loser Dalibor Svrcina 7-6(3), 6-4, but the 2021 champion is looking for more out of his game.

“I was far from my best tennis, but it happens,” said a relieved Medvedev post match. “In Washington, I felt like I played a good match against Corentin [Moutet] and I lost. Wimbledon, kind of the same. It's better to play worse and win, so I'm happy I won the match.”

Emilio Nava downed French lucky loser Terence Atmane 6-2, 7-5 to record consecutive tour-level wins for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in Los Cabos two weeks ago. The 23-year-old American will next face 11th seed Karen Khachanov, who eased past Argentine qualifier Juan Pablo Ficovich 6-4, 6-2.

Finding a rhythm on serve proved a challenge for both competitors. The two each went nine for 16 on their break point chances and in addition to Gauff's problems at the line, Collins herself double-faulted 13 times.The former Australian Open finalist nearly pulled off her second win over a world No. 2 this season. Having twice erased a break deficit in the decider, Collins served for the match at 6-5 but couldn't string together the right sequence of points in losing the two-deuce game.Gauff soon ran away with the final five points of the first-time meeting, ironically finishing with an ace out wide to prevail after two hours and 56 minutes.This is the 21-year-old's first tournament since going 0-2 on grass that ended with an opening defeat at Wimbledon to Dayana Yastremska. Veronika Kudermetova, who knocked off 29th seed Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2, awaits Gauff in the third round.

Iga Swiatek made some important changes to her game to win the Wimbledon title.

Before 2025, the Pole had never progressed beyond the quarterfinals at the All-England Club.

She also entered the tournament without any title wins for the past year, but perhaps that sense of nothing to lose is what Iga Swiatek needed heading into her most difficult Grand Slam.

Many of her biggest rivals fell early during Wimbledon, but Swiatek eased through the field, and won her last three sets of the tournament without losing a game to win her first grass court title.

Swiatek possesses heavy and consistent groundstrokes, and she has arguably the best movement in the game.

But one area that she was keen to improve is her serve in a bid to make it more penetrative and win more free points as a result.

Swiatek has worked on her serve with coach Wim Fisette, but she was surprised with how she served at Wimbledon.

During Swiatek's third round win over Danielle Collins at SW19, her average first serve speed was 180km/h, which was faster than Aryna Sabalenka, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys at the same stage of the tournament.

During a guest appearance on Andy Roddick's ‘Served' podcast, Swiatek opened up on how her improved serve has made her feel.

“Honestly when I looked at the stats after the tournament I told my condition coach was the speed check broken because I never served that fast!,” she said.

“I was serving faster than all the big servers that we have on the WTA Tour. I was surprised, I don't know if I am going to be able to do that next tournament.

“I will try because I loved it and I got so many free points and the girls couldn't really return these serves as well as before, so it was super convenient.

“I think that was the one of the keys and I got to say for the first year I wasn't trying to copy my clay court game, with still trying to spin the ball on the forehand and move similarly.

“I just knew that I needed to use my intuition a bit more, I think I played more flat from the beginning of the grass court season and more aggressive from the first shot.”

While it is still a work in progress, Swiatek has been working hard on her serve for the entire year.

While she saw the fruits of her labour to its fullest extent at Wimbledon, Swiatek said she first felt the improvements in her serve at January's Australian Open, where she reached the semifinals.

“Basically I think I needed someone to force me to do that to give me a little bit of confidence to be able to serve all directions with good speed and precision,” she said.

“I felt that already in Australia that this is going better. I had some tournaments where I didn't feel it that well, but I guess in every process you are going to have ups and downs until you get to the point where it comes more naturally.

“At Wimbledon I think also with the balls that are sticking to the strings, the contact point is a bit longer, because they are heavier a bit. I felt like I could serve really well and I was really going for it.”

Venus Williams will continue her professional tennis comeback at the US Open. The seven-time singles grand slam champion received a wild-card entry for the mixed doubles event alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka, the U.S. Tennis Association association announced Tuesday.

Williams, 45, returned to the WTA Tour last week at the D.C. Open after more than a year away, defeating Peyton Stearns 6-3, 6-4 in the round of 32 to become the oldest woman to win a WTA Tour-level match since Martina Navratilova in 2004. Williams lost to Magdalena Frech 6-2, 6-2 in the round of 16. She also won a doubles match alongside Hailey Baptiste at the event.

Opelka, 27, stands 6-foot-11 and has a massive serve. He reached as high as No. 17 in the world rankings in 2022 but has had significant injury issues recently.

The USTA made significant changes to the mixed doubles event, raising the prize money and altering the schedule so it doesn't conflict with the singles event, in order to draw bigger names, according to the Associated Press. The event takes place over two days -- Aug. 19 and 20 -- the week before the singles portion of the tournament begins.

The effort seems to have worked. Also in the mixed doubles field are men's world No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, who have combined to win all three singles slam titles this year. American men's standouts Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton are also in the field. The highest-ranked woman participating in mixed doubles is No. 3 Iga Swiatek.

Williams still could request -- and potentially receive -- a wild-card entry for the singles event.

The Cooldown Room: Belgium's red flag wholesome moments and commentary confessions!

Iconic Max Verstappen onboards

Yuki Tsunoda gives his take on his Belgian Grand Prix experience from Spa-Francorchamps.

Yuki Tsunoda was unable to capitalise on his best Qualifying result of the season for Red Bull as his Belgian Grand Prix unraveled following a "miscommunication" and strategy error.

The Red Bull man qualified seventh and was running in that position at the start of the race – an event that marked his 100th Grand Prix start – but he wound up finishing a frustrating P13 on a day where points seemed possible for the Japanese racer, who remains without a score since Imola back in May.

Tsunoda's race suffered a significant blow in the first pit stop period as, with the track drying, a small handful of drivers gambled and came in to swap to slick tyres. That proved to be the right call, prompting the majority to pit on the next lap.

However, Tsunoda – and a small handful of others – stayed out one further lap, which given the length of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, proved to be very costly. When the Red Bull racer pitted, he tumbled from P7 to 12th and found himself in a DRS train behind Pierre Gasly's Alpine.

“There was a miscommunication I guess between myself and the team,” Tsunoda explained after the race. “I requested to switch to the dry tyre, they called me way too late, I unfortunately had just passed the pit entry when they called me.

“One lap in these kinds of conditions is very decisive; I lost five positions and was stuck behind a bit all the race. That's it, that was my race.”

Tsunoda fought hard to make it back to P11 and had DRS at times in his quest to overtake Gasly, but running in the dirty air for so long also cost him tyre wear, and he was picked off late on by both Ollie Bearman in the Haas and a much fresher-shod Nico Hulkenberg.

“I tried my best to overtake but unfortunately my straight-line speed was nowhere,” he added. "I requested to – well I tried my best to – overtake but my tyre was gone so it was frustrating.

“Overall, a frustrating race and disappointing not to be in the points. There are definitely a couple of things that we can take away from the race and we will re-focus for Budapest next weekend.”

Tsunoda remains under pressure to put together some strong results – since joining Red Bull, he has one ninth and two P10 finishes in the 11 Grands Prix he has contested with the team, plus a few points from finishing P6 in the Sprint in Miami.

Belgium initially looked like it might be a turning point for Tsunoda, who on Saturday finally received the same package of upgrades that Max Verstappen has been running. But sadly, his best Qualifying of the year and first Q3 showing since Miami did not result in any score.

Tsunoda remains 17th in the Drivers' Championship standings with 10 points in total, with the upcoming Hungarian Grand Prix the final race weekend before the summer break.

Iconic Max Verstappen onboards

Find out who impressed our judges with their performances at the Belgian Grand Prix.

On a weekend where Spa-Francorchamps was engulfed in both bright sunshine and heavy rain, Oscar Piastri came out on top and extended his points lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris. But how did our Power Rankings list for the weekend shake out? Check out the latest scores and overall leaderboard below...

Having missed out on victory in the Sprint from pole, Piastri stamped his authority on Sunday's Grand Prix and instantly went on the attack, taking the lead on the first lap of racing from team mate Norris. Having extended his lead to 9.1s through the sole pit stop sequence for dry tyres, the Australian rattled off consistent lap times on the medium Pirelli rubber for his sixth win of the season and extended his championship lead to 16 points. Our judges were suitably impressed.

A scintillating final Qualifying lap vaulted Albon's Williams up to fifth for the Grand Prix, making up for a tricky Sprint where he finished outside the top 10, having been hampered by a power unit issue. Having lost a position to Russell's Mercedes in the early wet running, Albon settled into a rhythm and was able to keep Hamilton's faster Ferrari behind thanks to a superior straightline advantage which yielded sixth at the chequered flag.

Leclerc was best of the rest on Sunday after qualifying third behind the McLaren duo and maintained the net-position through the pit stop sequence having superbly kept Verstappen behind when his Ferrari's intermediate tyres were shot. He never stretched his advantage over the Dutchman to more than a handful of seconds, but showed Ferrari's new suspension package was a step forward for the Scuderia.

Verstappen gambled on a low-downforce set-up for Saturday's Sprint, which yielded P2 on the grid, before snatching the lead from poleman Piastri on the run to Les Combes before hanging on against the faster McLarens. Only able to grab fourth for the Grand Prix with more downforce applied and despite his best efforts, the four-time and reigning World Champion was unable to find his way around Leclerc's Ferrari.

Made it through to Q2 despite the Alpine's poor straightline speed performance and, after starting P13, grimly led a DRS train for much of the 44-lap race on the fringes of the top 10. Having held Tsunoda's Red Bull and the Haas of Bearman at bay throughout, the Frenchman was rewarded with a point having been promoted to 10th when Hulkenberg's Kick Sauber ahead stopped for a second time.

Secured his third points finish from the last six races after largely going under the radar in Belgium, finishing 10th in the Sprint and qualifying ninth for the Grand Prix, both times behind Racing Bulls team mate Hadjar. But while the Frenchman was forced to make a second pit stop for tyres that relegated him to the back of the field in the race, Lawson quietly went about his business to finish P8.

Was left to follow Verstappen and Piastri home in the Sprint but made amends with a Grand Prix pole position. Despite being helped by a rolling start and clear vision once action got underway on Sunday, the McLaren man was unable to prevent Piastri from overtaking along the Kemmel Straight. Pitting a lap later and for the hard tyre meant Norris had a mountain to climb, with several small mistakes ultimately consigning him to second.

The Brazilian's impressive run of form continued in Belgium as he secured his second points finish from three races after finishing P9. Made it through to Q3, out-qualifying Kick Sauber team mate Hulkenberg again, and showed more pace than the German as he was allowed to move ahead after falling behind in the early laps. Thereafter, he kept out of trouble and followed Lawson home but well clear of Gasly.

A spin and then losing his best lap time to track limits in both the Sprint and Grand Prix Qualifying sessions respectively meant Hamilton exited Q1 twice. But after a pit lane start, the Ferrari driver transformed his weekend's fortunes with an impressive climb through the field, becoming the first driver to jump to slicks. His reward was P7 after being unable to find a way round Albon's Williams.

For the fourth Grand Prix in succession, Bearman finished 11th and just outside the points in Belgium. But there was some joy for the Haas driver, as seventh in the Sprint meant he claimed his first points since Bahrain back in April as he utilised a low-drag set-up to reach Q3.

Russell, Ocon and Hadjar all nearly made it inside this week's top 10. Russell took a lonely fifth on Sunday, while both Ocon and Hadjar impressed during the Sprint. The Haas man finished fifth but pitted later than most on Sunday and finished down the order, while Hadjar bagged P8 in the Sprint but a second pit stop, and a car issue, left him last in the Grand Prix.

The world lost one of the most influential entertainers on July 22 when Ozzy Osbourne passed away on July 22. Now, over a week later, the rock icon has been laid to rest. Naturally, many of his family, close friends, and colleagues attended the funeral. His son, Jack Osbourne, paid tribute to his father with a well-thought-out outfit for the sad occasion. 

Notably, Ozzy Osbourne's funeral procession was held on July 30 in Birmingham, his hometown. Ozzy was 76 when he passed away. 

July 30 was a profoundly emotional day for the Osbourne family as they were joined by many to bid farewell to Ozzy. Regarding Jack Osbourne, he wore a traditional black suit with a tie and a shirt in the same color. Jack also wore a pair of black shades to the funeral. 

Regarding honoring his father with his attire, Jack wore a few pieces of subtle jewelry. According to Page Six, he included a solver cross embellishment on his black Chrome Hearts tie. This is a nod to the fact that Ozzy Osbourne often donned jewelry, which typically included crosses. 

Of course, Jack Osbourne wasn't the only member of the family to use jewelry to tribute Ozzy. Sharon Osbourne wore one of his gold rings as a necklace to the funeral. Kelly wore a pair of sunglasses that resembled the ones her father wore, while Aimee donned a bat brooch. 

Ozzy Osbourne was honored in his hometown with a funeral procession. According to CBS News, it stretched from Broad Street all the way to a canal bridge that's named after Black Sabbath. This was a way for not only loved ones to honor his life, but also for fans to say goodbye to the rock legend. 

The bridge features life-size renderings of the Black Sabbath members, which, in addition to Ozzy Osbourne, include Terry “Geezer” Butler, Tony Iommi, and Bill Ward. Notably, the bridge was unveiled in 2019. There is currently a memorial at the bridge for Ozzy, and Sharon Osbourne added flowers to it during the procession. 

Lord Mayor of Birmingham Zafar Iqbal also attended the procession and released a statement. It reads, “Ozzy was more than a music legend — he was a son of Birmingham.” Ozzy will be missed by his family, friends, and countless fans from all over the world.

			By Dominic Patten, Ted Johnson 


	The runner-up in the 2024 U.S. presidential election won't be running for California‘s top job next year, but Kamala Harris isn't ruling out a 2028 White House bid yet.


	After months of speculation and impressive polling, the former Vice President has made it official: She's not going to be on the ballot to lead the Golden State. “After deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for Governor in this election,” Harris said Wednesday.


	The news certainly comes as a surprise to those outside Harris' inner circle, though sources say Gov. Gavin Newsom was in the loop about what was going on.

	











	Earlier this year, around the time of the Oscars, Harris told friends and deep-pocketed donors that she would make a final decision on running for governor by the end of the summer. A little ahead of schedule, today's announcement may send some shockwaves through the West Coast body politic as all indications were that the former Veep was staffed up and ready to roll up to Sacramento. To that, the likes of Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, ex-Rep. Katie Porter, and current CA Attorney General Rob Bonta have all publicly stated that their own plans would be contingent on what Harris decided.




			Watch on Deadline		







	However, even though the crowded field to replace the termed-out Newsom won't include California's ex-senator and state Attorney General, the electorate and Donald Trump may not have seen the last of the 2024 Democratic nominee.


	For one thing, as we await Trump's inevitable condescending social-media response to his rival's decision, Harris certainly intends to be in the trenches for the 2026 midterms, even if she's not running.

	











	“For now, my leadership — and public service — will not be in elected office,” the ex-VP said in a statement today (read it in full below.) “I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.”


	For another thing, the use of the term “for now” gives career politician Harris that wiggle room all POTUS contenders like to have if events and donation swing in their favor. With Trump constitutionally unable to run again, at least in theory, current VP JD Vance looks to be the top GOP contender – a match-up over which Harris and many other Democrats can barely contain themselves.


	Had she entered the governors race, Harris likely would have been the frontrunner, based on recent polling and her position on the national stage. A University of California, Irvine poll earlier this month showed that Harris would be the top choice of Californians, garnering 41% support, while an unnamed Republican got 29%. A large number of voters were undecided.But even with her advantages, a gubernatorial race carried some risks, particularly if next year's midterms reflect another cycle of voter discontent. It's rather rare for a former vice president, much less one who has been at the top of a national party ticket, to seek another office other than the presidency.


	Richard Nixon's career was written off for dead after he ran for California governor in 1962 and lost, after serving as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president. Walter Mondale sought to return to the Senate in 2002 after serving as Jimmy Carter's vice president and lost that bid. Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson's vice president, was successful in returning to the Senate in 1970. So far, the Democratic field for governor is heavy in party stalwarts, like Kounalakis and Porter – albeit they are not as well known as Harris. It also includes former assembly speaker Toni Atkins, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.Additionally, said to be mulling a run for governor is developer and former Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rick Caruso. On Instagram earlier this week, the onetime Republican and Democrat posted a photo of himself with Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor and Assembly powerhouse, who once dated Harris. In the photo, Brown is holding up a photo of the Capitol in Sacramento. Caruso wrote on the post, “Who would've thought…”


	Here's Harris' full statement today:

Over the past six months, I have spent time reflecting on this moment in our nation's history, and the best way for me to continue fighting for the American people and advancing the values and ideals I hold dear.I am a devout public servant, and from the earliest days of my career, I have believed that the best way I could make a difference in people's lives and fight for a better future was to improve the system from within. And it has been a profound honor to do that work and serve the people of California and our nation—as a prosecutor, Attorney General, United States Senator, and Vice President.In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their Governor. I love this state, its people, and its promise. It is my home. But after deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for Governor in this election. I have extraordinary admiration and respect for those who dedicate their lives to public service—service to their communities and to our nation. At the same time, we must recognize that our politics, our government, and our institutions have too often failed the American people, culminating in this moment of crisis. As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking—committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook. For now, my leadership—and public service—will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans. In the United States of America, power must lie with the people. And We, the People must use our power to fight for freedom, opportunity, fairness, and the dignity of all. I will remain in that fight.

2028 will be peaceful.
Ghislaine Maxwell will be living free in Vermont. Diddy will be living free in Bali.
Trump will be enjoying his McDonalds & cokes with a new $5 billion in the bank, earned while being a most self-serving President. (all the while convincing his maga morons he's looking out for them…hahahahahahhaahhhahahah).

I'm a liberal but it would be disastrous if she runs again in 2028 after the country gave her a resounding “NO!”.

Good idea Kamala you can probably rule out 2028 also!

Thank goodness.
How about a gov that makes CA better, not worse.

I'm going to celebrate!

Ozzy Osbourne was laid to rest on Wednesday during a funeral in his native Birmingham, England, giving fans one last chance to bid farewell to the heavy-metal pioneer. Osbourne died last week at the age of 76, sparking tributes from throughout the music world: Green Day played a snippet of Black Sabbath's “Iron Man” onstage to thank Osbourne, Alice Cooper and his band sang Sabbath's “Paranoid,” and artists from Pearl Jam to Metallica posted remembrances.


Carrie Underwood was also a fan of Osbourne, and of heavy metal music in general. The powerhouse country vocalist has talked often about her love of hard rock, performed with Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose numerous times, and covered songs by fellow umlaut bands Mötley Crüe and Motörhead in concert. She's also been known to slay “Mama, I'm Comin' Home,” Osbourne's 1991 power ballad. In 2023, Underwood appeared on The Howard Stern Show on SiriusXM and delivered yet another version of the No More Tears standout. Backed by her full band, the Nashville star underscored the connection, both sonically and lyrically, between mainstream country and old-school metal.

	It's a connection that continues to this day. Earlier this summer, Dolly Parton joined Mötley Crüe on a new version of their own power ballad “Home Sweet Home,” which debuted at Number One on Mediabase's Classic Rock chart. (She also delivered a video message to Osbourne during the July 5th farewell concert by Black Sabbath.)

	Elsewhere, outlaw country singer Alex Williams released Space Brain, a collection of hair metal songs reinvented as stone-cold country music. Among the tracks? Osbourne's “Flying High Again,” rendered on Space Brain as a duet with Cody Jinks, another former metalhead.

The idea of Andrew Rannells and Josh Gad being trapped in a world of two-hander sitcoms makes a lot of sense. But there's no reason to use Stay Tuned's cult status as a way to get them there. Stay Tuned is about a man having to learn how to be a man to his wife in reality instead of losing himself in television, played by two actors who were famous for starring on 1970s shows. Gad and Rannells are stage darlings who no one who even knows what Stay Tuned is want in a television show.

If they don't feature “Start Me Up” by Salt N Peppa, I will riot!

They really are just rebooting everything, aren't they? Even stuff like this movie that has long been forgotten and was a flop in its original release.

this is actually a wonderful idea – and should be super fun

You may have seen “Psycho Beach Party,” director Robert Lee King and writer Charles Busch's wickedly funny send-up of classic Hollywood, while surfing on late-night cable channels in the early aughts. Based on Busch's own play from 1987, which was itself inspired by Frederick Kohner's late-'50s Gidget character and her initiation into surf culture, “Psycho Beach Party” is exactly as the title sounds: part slasher, part beach movie, and all pastiche and split-personality.

That's apropos, as a then little-known, pre-“Six Feet Under” Lauren Ambrose plays Florence, aka Chicklet, a schizoid who becomes the prime suspect in a series of comically mounting beachside murders. She plays the role as a careening cross between Tallulah Bankhead and Sandra Dee — who of course originated Gidget, the original wannabe surf girl, onscreen in 1959. Screenwriter Busch, who, gay and in his 30s, played the 16-year-old teenage girl Gidget — sorry, Chicklet — in his original off-Broadway stage show here plays the detective-in-drag investigating the murders.

The fizzy, gee-whiz humor clashing with the melodramatic camp makes for one of the mostly wildly unpredictable tones of any candy-colored camp movie — and one that also had an early eye for starlets, including a then still-indie-actress Amy Adams, “Buffy” breakout Nicholas Brendon, “Criminal Minds” star Thomas Gibson, and more. (“Psycho Beach Party,” also, is stacked with shirtless male surfers, and therefore homoerotic tension breaks through like a tidal wave.)

 










“Psycho Beach Party” celebrates its 25th anniversary this month with Q&A screenings (featuring Ambrose, Busch, and director King) on July 30 and 31 at the IFC Center in New York City. The film will also receive a physical media release at a later date, with support from the film's original producer/distributor, Strand Releasing. IndieWire caught up with Charles Busch, who lives in New York, over the phone ahead of the upcoming screenings.

This interview has been condensed and edited for length.

IndieWire: The movie, which you began as a kind of midnight-movie play, is set in the early '60s, but it's more attuned to '50s movies yet with a postmodern, perverted twist.

Charles Busch: The slasher film, too, which was very '70s. The play was somewhat plotless, really. Nobody was being killed. I think the main thing was that somebody was running around shaving people's pubic hair off. I think that was the crime. There's really not much going on. So when Strand wanted to produce the movie, and they teamed me with Bob King, who was a young director/screenwriter who had done a short subject that [Strand] had released, and they wanted to do a feature with him. We were teamed up, and at that point, I had never written a screenplay. Bob was extraordinarily helpful, and he had a great fondness for '70s slasher movies and thought that if we added that element, that would give us a melodrama plot.

 










That also solved the second problem, which was, “Who was I going to play?” I'd originally played the lead in the stage play, a young 16-year-old girl. We all just knew we didn't want the movie to be that stylized. I was in my 40s at that point, and even if I wasn't at that point, we wanted it to be more naturalistic… Having an actual killer suggested we also had to have a detective, and that really fit my stage persona, a Susan Hayward, tough, glamorous lady.

The casting director, Laura Schiff, is a revered TV casting director now who did “Mad Men,” “Shogun,” “The West Wing,” and all these series. She discovered Lauren Ambrose for this movie.

I don't think I had any clue who was playing the parts. With Lauren, it was between her and another actress, and they showed me both screen tests, and Lauren is who I preferred, and we all felt she was the most suited.

How did Strand discover the play?

The actual story is that I had this wonderful manager named Jeff Melnick who died a few years ago. He was an eccentric, fabulous person, and he just loved me. I don't know too many people who can say that their agent or manager thought more of their talents than they did themselves, but Jeff was that. He kept insisting that “Psycho Beach Party” should be a movie, and I didn't really get it. To me, there didn't seem to have much plot. It was a campy theater piece. But he kept pursuing it for years, and every once in a while, he would call me and say, “Oh, so and so passed.” I said, “I didn't know they were looking at it!” Then, he took on as a client Bob King [the director of the film].

 










What do you think about the movie is worth discovering for younger audiences now? There is so much more film literacy now between Letterboxd and Criterion that younger audiences might actually get the references at this point.

It's funny, it started off as a spoof of beach party movies, and the more I worked on it, I thought there was a little more to it. That maybe it is a little bit personal about how, when you're young, and you don't quite know who you are, and you feel like you're a different person with your parents, your friends, at your school, it's a bit of a metaphor for that.

I believe the Criterion Collection has taken on the movie. I was just looking through their catalogue and, my god, to think of it… [to be] in the same collection as the greatest films by Fellini and Kurosawa and Truffaut. It's kind of wild. These movies can kind of disappear, and I'm hoping this will lead to Criterion taking on my follow-up picture, “Die, Mommie, Die!,” which I'm very proud of.

“Psycho Beach Party” plays at IFC Center on July 30 and July 31.

She went on to perform "Vanish Into You," which she cowrote with the businessman.

	Hannah Dailey



	In a quiet moment amidst the mayhem of her show, Lady Gaga gave her fiancé, Michael Polansky, a sweet shout-out during her concert at the Kia Forum on Tuesday (July 29).


	Sitting at the piano after singing her Billboard Hot 100-topping Bruno Mars duet, “Die With a Smile,” solo, the pop superstar tearfully thanked Polansky as Little Monsters in the Los Angeles crowd cheered, as captured in a clip on X. “To Michael, Michael Polansky, the love of my life,” she began, her voice quivering slightly. 

	











	“It's so much more fun doing this with you, my babe,” she continued, before addressing her fans. “Thank you for how you've blessed our life. I hope one day I just vanish into each and every one of you.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Gaga went on to sing “Vanish Into You” from her No. 1 Billboard 200 album Mayhem. Polansky just so happens to have a cowriting credit on the track, as he does on several other songs on the LP. The 14-time Grammy winner has been open about how integral the businessman was in the making of Mayhem, at one point revealing that he was the one who encouraged her to return to dance-pop music in the first place.


	“Like anyone would do for the person they love, I encouraged her to lean in to the joy of it,” Polansky told Vogue last September. “On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her; I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.”

	











	Gaga and Polansky met in 2019 and got engaged in April 2024. The musician has since spoken many times on their close relationship, calling him her “best friend” and revealing in March that she wants to have children with him “more than anything.”


	For now, though, the star's focus is on her Mayhem Ball Tour, which kicked off earlier in July with three nights in Las Vegas. After she finishes four performances at the Kia Forum, she'll bring the trek to New York City, Toronto and Chicago and more North American cities before embarking on a European leg.

The singer vehemently condemned the tweet featuring handcuffed people being loaded onto planes cued to her 2015 single.

	Add British singer Jess Glynne to the long list of musicians who have taken offense at the use of their songs in one of Donald Trump's campaign ads. The singer took to her Instagram Story on Wednesday morning (July 30) to express her disgust about a White House X post on Monday that appeared to make light of undocumented people being deported by ICE cued to her 2015 Billboard Hot 100 No. 86 hit “Hold My Hand.”

	











	“This post honestly makes me sick,” Glynne wrote over a re-post of a screen shot from the ad in which the detainees' faces are visible while the immigration officer's heads are blurred out. “My music is about love, unity, and spreading positivity — never about division or hate,” she added along with two angry swearing emoji.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The cheery 19-second post from the official White House X feed reads, “when ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation… Nothing beats it!,” along with a plane and music note emoji. The accompanying footage is cued to a 2022 ad campaign from British tour operator Jet2 featuring sunny narration from actress Zoë Lister-Jones and a snippet of Glynne's upbeat pop song.


	Actress Lister-Jones also responded in a now-expired Story post asking, “What can be done about the White House using Jet2's sound and my voiceover to promote their nasty agenda?”

	











	The chipper ad has resurfaced over the past two week as a viral TikTok sound used in a raft of videos depicting vacations gone wrong. But in the White House version, Lister's voiceover enthusing “nothing beats a Jet2 holiday!” is used as the background to footage of men bound by their feet and hands in shackles being marched onto planes by officers from the U.S. Immigration and Customs service whose faces are blurred out.


	The post ends with a screen grab of the CBP Home app — a mobile application developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that allows those people in the U.S. without documentation to voluntarily leave at no cost — followed by a video of smiling President Trump giving the thumbs up and pointing to the camera.


	At press time spokespeople for Jet2 and the White House had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment on Glynne's post.


	The White House ad comes just weeks after Trump signed off on his so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” authorizing $170 billion in spending on border and immigration enforcement at a time when illegal border crossings have crashed to their lowest levels since the 1960s. The cash infusion makes ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.


	The Jet2 ad is the latest in a line of White House digital clips making light of its immigration strategy, a roster that includes an ASMR video highlighting the sounds of clinking hand and ankle restraints being placed on detainees and a Studio Ghibli-like cartoon AI image seemingly mocking a woman crying after being taken into custody.

A writer in New York trying to define his love of the city while also navigating his own love life? Oh yeah, the romance is back alright. André Holland produces and stars in Love, Brooklyn, the debut feature from director Rachael Abigail Holder. The trailer for the film, which will enjoy a limited opening on August 29 before hitting theaters nationwide September 5, is suffused with warmth while hitting those classic romantic beats—the impatient editor looking for the writer's next great work, the patient best friend offering words of wisdom, and two beautiful women offering two different versions of love.

Love, Brooklyn follows Holland as he “navigates complicated relationships with his ex, an art gallery owner (Nicole Beharie), and his current lover, a newly-single mother (DeWanda Wise), with the support of his best friend (Roy Wood Jr.),” according to the film's synopsis. Speaking with IndieWire, Holder said the script, written by Paul Zimmerman, wasn't initially written with Black actors in mind. The characters' “culture wasn't defined, so I could fill in the paint in that way,” she said. “A script originally written for white characters needed a culture to be infused into to it, so it wasn't really a challenge, it was an exciting venture to choose what that culture would be. We didn't just want the characters to be Black period. Blackness is a wide scope of people, and I wanted them to be specific.”

﻿

The movie initially premiered at Sundance, where The A.V. Club‘s Jacob Oller observed that “Beharie and Wise are excellent at carving out small details of a dynamic that's more complex that it seems on the surface, but in a larger narrative sense, everyone's making the most out of a thin script.” He added, “It ends up like every other three-person romantic dramedy ends up, but at least Love, Brooklyn boasts competent players going through its motions.”

EXCLUSIVE: The Warner Bros Motion Picture Group is undergoing 10% cuts, we've learned. This follows Monday's news about how leadership is getting split between the new Warner Bros and Discovery Global.


Layoffs are across marketing, distribution, production, strategy, operations and theatre ventures.  


	We hear these cuts have been in the planning since the early part of this year. Leadership assessed what was needed in the current global marketplace, and these strategic changes shift away from a U.S./international management model to a global structure approach. We'll update you as we hear about the departure of key executives. 

	











	Here is the note from Motion Picture Group Co-Chairs Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca:

Team Motion Pictures – Earlier this year, in collaboration with leaders across the film division, we undertook a thoughtful assessment of our current structure and began the work to transform our business as we transition from a US Home Office/International model toward a fully global structure.The exploration led to important conversations and insights to better understand how we reach audiences, what fundamental shifts should be implemented as teams work together across the world to collectively engage today's moviegoers, and what the division needs to be successful.In partnership with our P&C colleagues, and with these new learnings, we spent a lot of time thinking about how we evolve our teams to ensure films made here at Warner Bros. continue to receive world class release campaigns, and we engross audiences with the kind of memorable in-theater experience only the big screen can offer.  Adapting how we work often calls for evolution, and the future of how we run this business has required us to make some very difficult decisions, including staffing adjustments that will impact members of the Motion Picture Group. This week, your department leadership will share what these strategic changes mean for you and your teams. In the coming weeks and months, we will work with leaders around the world to shape and implement this global operating model in a way that reflects local needs and realities.We know news like this is never easy, and we are tremendously grateful to our departing team members whose contributions throughout their time at Warner Bros. Pictures has made a lasting impact on both of us, and so many of you. They each have a lot to be proud of.We know this group will continue to achieve great things together while we remain focused on what's ahead. With gratitude,Mike & Pam 


Warner Bros Discovery made its separation news public in June, with that divide coming in mid-2026. That followed Comcast's move to spin off NBCUniversal's cable networks into a standalone public company called Versant. The decisions to split up these congloms into two were driven by the desire for increased flexibility amid a decline of legacy linear television.


	In the new Warner Bros, WBD CEO David Zaslav will hold the same title. Bruce Campbell will be Chief Operating Officer. His title currently is Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer. Abdy and De Luca will be co-chairs and CEOs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. James Gunn and Peter Safran will each be co-chairman and CEO of DC Studios. Casey Bloys, currently chairman and CEO, HBO and Max Content, will become chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max. Channing Dungey, currently chairman and CEO of the Warner Bros. Television Group and Warner Bros. Discovery's US Networks, will be Chair & CEO, Warner Bros. TV Group. JB Perrette will be CEO & President of Streaming and Games. Avi Saxena will be Chief Technology Officer, reporting to Perrette. Robert Gibbs will be Chief Communications & Public Affairs Officer. A search is underway by Warners for a new Chief Financial Officer and Chief People & Culture Officer exec. It's not clear yet where Zaslav's longtime consigliere David Leavy will land and in what role. He recently departed as COO of CNN Worldwide in May.

…while Zas laughs all the way to the bank.

Hopefully the CEO pay stays the same. We must protect the CEOs at all costs

“a fully global structure”.…I don't know what that means.

If any studio needed to cut the fat of legacy employees its WB. So many overpaid, old dogs.

I was there for 15+ years as an assistant in the Creative Services department and I loved my role before I got laid off.  Many of my colleagues have been there for 15-25 years and they are some of the most innovative and creative people I've ever met. The team rolls with the punches and many have survived multiple rounds of layoffs. They know what they're doing- you're suggesting bringing in a bunch of new people for what purpose?

Zaz the failing up general!

In this week's The Contenders, the last charts rung to climb is the hardest for the surprise pop story of the year.


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated August 9, we look at the chances of the biggest song from the KPop Demon Hunters phenomenon to be able to unseat Alex Warren atop the Hot 100 — and how long that might ultimately take to happen.

HUNTR/X, EJAE, Audrey Nuna & Rei Ami, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): Five weeks into the pop culture takeover of Netflix animated musical KPop Demon Hunters, there are now a whopping nine songs from the soundtrack on the Hot 100 — including not only the in-universe hits from fictional K-pop idol groups HUNTR/X and Saja Boys, but also both of the songs on the set from the IRL genre hitmakers TWICE. But one has clearly separated from the rest of the songs as the OST's breakout hit: HUNTR/X's seemingly unstoppable “Golden.”  




			Trending on Billboard		







	This week, “Golden” jumps another two spots to No. 2 on the Hot 100. (Saja Boys' “Your Idol,” the second-highest-ranking KPDH song, also climbs to No. 12.) Having lapped Justin Bieber and Morgan Wallen (with Tate McRae), now only one chart foe remains left for the superstar superheroes: Alex Warren, whose pop-folk power ballad “Ordinary” has reigned on the chart for eight weeks.  

	











	“Golden” has been fully embraced by audiences on DSPs, topping Billboard‘s Streaming Songs ranking for the first time this week, and has an extra boost coming in the way of a new David Guetta remix, released at the beginning of this tracking week (July 25). But to clear that final Hot 100 hurdle, it will need support from within an arena where Warren has ruled for the last six weeks: radio. “Golden” is currently growing on the airwaves — it debuts at No. 35 on Pop Airplay this week, and is up another 24% in plays July 25-28 over the same period from the week prior (according to Luminate). But it's still got a long way to go to meet “Ordinary” — it's still nowhere to be found on Radio Songs, nor is it particularly close yet — and as long as that gap between the two remains so sizeable, it will be tough for “Golden” to get over the top on the Hot 100.  


Alex Warren, “Ordinary” (Atlantic): “Ordinary” has reigned on the Hot 100 for two months now, and continues to be dominant across the board — in addition to topping Radio Songs for a sixth week, it holds in the top five on Streaming Songs, and ranks at No. 9 as the top non-Ozzy Osbourne-related entry on Digital Song Sales. Like Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” last year, the song's cross-platform dominance is strong and steady enough that it's still unlikely to simply fade from the Hot 100 anytime soon; another song will almost certainly have to actively seize the crown from it.  


	But while the song is unlikely to rapidly recede in the oncoming weeks — and just got a bump in its tracking thanks to the July 18 release of parent album You'll Be Alright, Kid — it does finally appear to have stopped growing. While it spent the last couple of months just getting bigger and bigger on radio, its numbers there are leveling off, though it should still easily reign on Radio Songs for a seventh week next week. The question is if “Golden” can keep its cross-platform momentum going long enough to take advantage of any “Ordinary” slippage and capture its moment — which may still take a few weeks, if it happens at all.  

	











Justin Bieber, “Daisies” (JRC/ILH/Def Jam/Republic): Despite its relatively unconventional, organically warm-feeling sound for a 2025 single, Justin Bieber's “Daisies” is off to a tremendous start within the pop realm. After debuting at No. 2 on the Hot 100, thanks to strong initial performance on DSPs that led to it bowing atop Streaming Songs, it slides to No. 4 after some inevitable week-two weakening — but it's also already really gaining on the airwaves, up 58% in plays July 25-28 as the top gainer on pop radio, and headed top 20 on both Adult Pop Airplay and Pop Airplay. “Daisies” also has a way to go before being a true threat to “Ordinary,” but gaining that solid radio footing also probably means it won't be wilting in the top 10 anytime soon.  


IN THE MIX 


Morgan Wallen feat. Tate McRae, “What I Want” (Mercury/Big Loud/Republic): It's ranked in the Hot 100's top five for all 10 weeks on the chart, and after having to wait its turn a little as prior Wallen singles circulated through radio, “What I Want” is also starting to pick up there: It could reach the top 10 on Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay in the next week or two. It's also slowly making its presence felt on Country Airplay, but it's still mostly in the waiting room there, as “Just in Case” still reigns on that chart and “I Got Better” climbs 25-22 there as the next officially promoted country radio single from Wallen's I'm the Problem.  


Drake feat. Central Cee, “Which One” (OVO Sound/Republic): “What Did I Miss,” Drake's presumed lead single from his upcoming Iceman set, has already slid out of the top 20 of the Hot 100 in just its third week on the listing, but it should be replaced in that chart region next week by new release “Which One,” featuring U.K. rap star Central Cee. The song is getting some early radio support, but will mostly bow based on streaming returns, having bowed at No. 2 on Spotify's Daily Top Songs USA listing and ruled for multiple days on the Apple Music real-time chart — though it has already begun its slide on both DSPs. If it can bow at No. 17 or higher, it will become Cee's top-charting hit on the Hot 100, passing last year's No. 18 peak for Lil Baby collab “Band 4 Band.”

Idles have shared “Rabbit Run,” a new song that they made for Darren Aronofsky's upcoming crime caper Caught Stealing. It's one of four new tracks that the British band recorded for the film's soundtrack. Listen to “Rabbit Run” below.

Rob Simonsen composed the score for Caught Stealing, and Idles brought it to life in the studio. The score and Idles' original songs will be featured on the Caught Stealing soundtrack, which comes out on the same day as the film, August 29.

Aronofsky enlisted Idles to capture the energy of the 1990s New York punk scene that colors Caught Stealing. “I built Caught Stealing to be a roller coaster of fun and wanted to supercharge the film by main lining a punk sensibility,” the director said in a press statement. “I don't think a band has really been tasked with performing a score for a movie. Who better to collaborate with than Idles? It has been a dream watching them bend their notes to blast a hole in our movie screen.”

Caught Stealing is based on screenwriter Charlie Huston's book of the same name. The film stars Austin Butler, Zoë Kravitz, Bad Bunny, Action Bronson, and others. It follows a former high school baseball star named Hank Thompson who winds up in a tangled web of organized crime when his punk rock neighbor asks him to watch his cat for a few days.

The world is saying its final goodbye to Black Sabbath musician Ozzy Osbourne. The rock icon's funeral procession was held on Wednesday, July 30, just over a week after his death on July 22. He was 76. 

Thousands of fans came out to honor Osbourne and share what he meant to them. Crowds gathered on Birmingham's main street, Broad Street, and down past the Black Sabbath Bridge. This is also where the hearse carrying Osbourne's coffin passed through.

Photos from the hearse show purple flowers spelling out the word “Ozzy.” 

Osbourne's family attended the site where fans had left flowers, notes, and other memorabilia to honor the late musician. Sharon Osbourne and her children, Kelly and Jack Osbourne, were front and centre in the photos. They all wore black tailored outfits. 

Sharon and Ozzy's rarely seen daughter, Aimee Osbourne, was also in attendance. She wore a black outfit and wore her hair loose. She also wore a fascinator that had a black veil that covered her eyes. 

Aimee can be seen in tears and later holding up peace signs alongside Sharon, E! News reports.

Also photographed with the family was Ozzy's son, Louis. 

Louis is the son of Ozzy and his first wife, Thelma Riley. He wore sunglasses and was dressed in a suit, a white button-down shirt, and a striking purple tie. You can see him in the background of this photo of his half-brother, Jack. 

The death of Osbourne has had a profound impact on many people, and the tributes for him have poured in since his family first announced his passing. 

“It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” the family said in a statement, Variety reports. “He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”

One of the most private members of the family is Aimee. She chose to opt out of filming her family's MTV reality TV show, “The Osbournes.” The series ran from 2002 to 2005.

Aimee has previously discussed her decision to stay out of the limelight. “For me, I had grown up around having a pretty well-known dad anyway, and … I always really valued my privacy within that family,” Aimée told New York's Q1043 radio, People reports.

She continued, “And for me personally, and for who I am, you know, as far as morally and also just to give myself a chance to actually develop into a human being as opposed to just being remembered for being a teenager, it didn't really line up with what I saw my future as. It definitely worked great for the rest of my family, but for me, and who I am, I just knew it was never something that I would have been able to consider realistically.”

Till death truly did them apart: Sharon Osbourne's quiet tribute to Ozzy spoke volumes without a word. Ozzy Osbourne's widow, Sharon, honored her late husband in a deeply personal way during his funeral procession in Birmingham. As fans gathered in the city to celebrate the life and legacy of the Prince of Darkness, many noticed Sharon wearing Ozzy's wedding ring on a delicate chain around her neck.

The photos shows Sharon's quiet but powerful tribute to their lifelong bond. One fan on X wrote, “Sharon Osbourne wearing Ozzy's wedding ring in a chain around her neck while mourning him. We love you, Shaz.”

Sharon, along with children Kelly, Jack, Aimee & Louis Osbourne, visited the floral memorials and fan tributes. The family, dressed entirely in black, stood tearfully at the Black Sabbath bench, acknowledging the crowd with peace signs and heartfelt gestures.

Fans also took note of Kelly Osbourne's subtle tribute: wearing Ozzy's signature round glasses. Known as his trademark look, the glasses offered a tender nod to her father's legacy. Kelly, 40, stayed close to her mother throughout the procession, comforting Sharon while holding her baby son Sid.

The public procession on July 30 saw thousands of mourners fill Birmingham's Broad Street, paying their respects as the hearse carrying Ozzy's coffin made its way to the Black Sabbath Bridge. The hearse was accompanied by Bostin' Brass performing “Crazy Train,” as the crowd erupted into chants of “Ozzy, Ozzy.”

Ozzy Osbourne, famously known as the “Prince of Darkness,” helped shape heavy metal music with Black Sabbath's iconic albums “Black Sabbath” and “Paranoid.”  Despite battling Parkinson's disease and injuries from a 2003 accident, he kept performing and making music until the very end. 

The Osbourne family's funeral attire went beyond traditional black, it was filled with heartfelt tributes. From Sharon's necklace, believed to hold Ozzy's wedding ring, to Kelly's choice to wear his signature round glasses, every detail honored the man they loved.

Later that day, Ozzy was laid to rest in a private ceremony. Though he's no longer here, his legacy lives on in the hearts of millions.

A daughter's bond with her father is unshakeable. Kelly Osbourne showed up for her late father Ozzy Osbourne in a deeply personal way during his funeral procession in Birmingham, England, on July 30. 

Kelly was seen walking alongside her mother, Sharon Osbourne, and siblings Jack and Aimee Osbourne, laying floral tributes at the Black Sabbath Bridge.

Wearing Ozzy Osbourne's iconic round sunglasses, the 40-year-old quietly paid homage to the legendary rocker as fans filled the streets to say goodbye.

Fans quickly noticed her heartfelt gesture and were moved by the subtle nod to her father's unmistakable style.

The moment was especially emotional as Sharon Osbourne leaned on her children for support while laying flowers at the memorial site. Onlookers described her as being “carried by her children,” including Kelly, who held her hand tightly. 

The Osbourne family's presence offered fans a moment of connection and closure as they grieved the loss of the “Crazy Train” singer.

Ozzy Osbourne's family were today united in grief as they joined tens of thousands of tearful Black Sabbath fans at an emotional funeral procession in the late singer's home city of Birmingham. Kelly Osbourne broke down in tears as Sharon Osbourne appeared overcome with emotion. As she funeral cortege arrived at the iconic Black Sabbath Bridge, Sharon stepped out of the car and was flanked by their children, Jack and Kelly, who held her up as she burst into tears. #kellyosbourne #sharonosbourne #ozzyosbourne #funeral #emotional #blacksabbath #birmingham 

The crowd responded with cheers and chants of “Ozzy, Ozzy!”—a powerful reminder of the impact the “Prince of Darkness” had on generations of fans. 

Many in the crowd were visibly emotional, with one person sharing online, “My heart breaks for her. They've had their ups and downs, but he truly was the love of her life.”

Thousands lined Broad Street and the Black Sabbath Bridge to pay tribute. Ozzy's coffin was adorned with purple flowers spelling out his name, and fans threw additional flowers as the hearse passed. Local band Bostin' Brass played “Crazy Train” and “Iron Man” as part of the tribute.

Best known for pioneering heavy metal through Black Sabbath's groundbreaking albums like “Black Sabbath” and “Paranoid,” Ozzy remained a larger-than-life presence in music for over five decades. His wit never waned either. As he once told The Times about his funeral:

“I honestly don't care what they play at my funeral; they can put on a medley of Justin Bieber, Susan Boyle and ‘We Are the Diddymen' if it makes 'em happy.”

On a day filled with tears and tributes, Kelly's simple gesture reminded the world that Ozzy's legacy lives on.

Filmmakers including Robert Greene, Joshua Oppenheimer, Sarah Friedland, Radu Jude, Levan Akin, and Miguel Gomes are among the more than 35 who have signed an open letter from Film Workers for Palestine calling on indie distributor Mubi to part ways with investor Sequoia Capital.

The venture capital firm has recently invested in Israeli military-aligned businesses, and backlash against Mubi has been growing since the investor's ties came to light in June. Sequoia had just given Mubi a $100 million investment. But since February 2024, Sequoia has also invested in Kela, a military tech startup that finds weapons and military-grade applications for AI and drone tech. Sequoia itself touts the partnership with Kela on its website as a way to “leverage Israel's unique cadre of technowarriors to help defend the Western world order.”

When reached by IndieWire, Mubi had no comment.

Since June, the backlash against Mubi has been growing. These are not the headlines the expanding indie distributor wants just months after having its biggest success to date, by steering its Cannes 2024 acquisition “The Substance” to five Academy Award nominations. Out of Cannes 2025, Mubi made several more prominent acquisitions, including Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind,” and Lynne Ramsay's “Die My Love.” Mubi also has the forthcoming New York Film Festival opening night title, Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother.”

 










The letter from Film Workers for Palestine, obtained by IndieWire, reads:

Dear Mubi leadership,

We write as filmmakers who have a professional relationship to Mubi to express our serious concern regarding Mubi's decision to accept $100 million in funding from Sequoia Capital, aprivate equity firm that, since late 2023 has chosen to double down on investing in Israeli military technology companies with the goal of profiting from the Gazan genocide. In 2024, Sequoia heavily invested in Kela, a military tech startup founded by a former senior manager of Palantir Israel and multiple Israeli military intelligence veterans, as well as military drone manufacturer Neros, and the unmanned aerial vehicle manufacture, Mach Industries.

Mubi's financial growth as a company is now explicitly tied to the genocide in Gaza, which implicates all of us that work with Mubi. We too believe that cinema can be powerful. And we know that we can't always control how audiences will respond to our work, and whether or not it will move and inspire them. But we can control how our work reflects our values and commitments—ones that are wholly ignored when our work is brought into alliance with a genocide-profiteering private equity firm.

Gaza is enduring mass civilian killings, including of journalists, artists, and film workers, alongside the widespread destruction of Palestinian cultural sites and heritage. We don't believe an arthouse film platform can meaningfully support a global community of cinephiles while also partnering with a company invested in murdering Palestinian artists and filmmakers. We approach our work with care for the people and communities they represent, and the audiences who will watch it, because as artists we are accountable to more than the bottom line. Yet Mubi's decision to partner with Sequoia demonstrates a total lack of accountability to the artists and communities who have helped the company flourish. We believe that it is our ethical duty to do no harm. We expect our partners, at a minimum, to refuse to be complicit in the horrific violence being waged against Palestinians.
 










We ask you to heed the call made by Film Workers for Palestine and take action that meaningfully responds to the artists and the audiences who are such an integral part of Mubi's success.

	Dean Cain, who starred as Superman in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, has alleged that he was sexually harassed while filming the popular television series in the Nineties. During a recent interview with Variety, the actor stated, “I could have had the biggest sexual harassment lawsuit in Hollywood history.”


	Cain never pursued action against the person he claims harassed him, and declined to share further details about the allegation. The outlet noted that the harassment “took a toll” on his relationship with Gabrielle Reece, the volleyball player he started dating in 1992. It went beyond the objectification he faced on set from executives and crew members. “Any guy who tells you he feels bad being objectified, I mean, really? Come on,” he said. “It's a wonderful compliment.”


	Cain also insisted that there were incidents unrelated to any harassment that could have resulted in a legal battle. He recalled being “advised not to” sue Warner Bros. over his schedule and finances from the series. “I didn't know enough back then about residuals. Warner Bros. buries the bodies deep and makes it look like it's lost money. There's no possible way,” he said. “But I should have sued.”

	He claimed being overworked on Lois & Clark is the reason he's avoided television since. “There was no time to work out, because they couldn't give me a workout clause, because then they'd have to for every other star and then it sets precedent for Warner Bros,” he said. “That's why I haven't done a series since. It feels like suffocating. You feel claustrophobic.” Before turning to acting, Cain was a professional football player.

	











	Still, Cain has made appearances in a number of shows since his role as Superman ended.

Erin Napier and Ben Napier's secret to their happy marriage is communication, but Erin said they had one tense moment that tested their relationship. Check out the hilarious incident the HGTV star calls “very juicy.”

During the July 18 episode of “The Heirloom Podcast,” Erin discussed how her marriage is so solid because she and Ben are good at communicating.

However, things got a little messy — quite literally — when she and Ben tackled taking out a very full garbage can in his shop.

“I have huge news in something that happened in our marriage this week,” Erin teased. “This is very juicy.”

She explained that the garbage can was long overdue to be emptied. “About August was the last time that trash was taken out. And he's been shoving stuff in it since then,” the “Home Town” star shared.

Erin recalled, “I said, ‘Baby, it's time. It's time. Tomorrow's trash day. The truck's coming. Let's do this together.'”

“Our marriage has never been more tested than it was by this thousand-pound trash can,” she said with a laugh.

They worked together to get the overstuffed trash moved, but it was far from an easy task. “It immediately ripped,” Erin said. “He started cussing.”

“I said, ‘Here's what we got to do. Let's get more bags,” Erin recalled. “He gets more bags. He's getting … I'm talking about filth coming out. He's barehanded. At the bottom, there was lots of liquid.”

Things were getting tense, however, as she joked, “I glared at this man that I love, who is the father of my children. I looked at him with like, hate.”

Erin also admitted that the contents of the can were, in part, wet beach towels she had shoved in it. They moved the contents into four trash bags and then, when pulling out the original trash bag … it gave way. “It ripped. The liquid, whatever it was, came out on the floor,” Erin recalled. “And I said, ‘You have to do better than this.'”

“We got the trash to the road and the trash is gone now … But anyway, what I want you to know is that it tested our marriage for about seven minutes. It was tough,” she said.

Erin called it a “really funky rough moment” when she told her husband, “You have to do better than this,” and then recreated the unhappy look he gave her.

A post shared by Erin Napier (@erinapier)

Garbage can chaos aside, Erin noted that they really are good at communicating, which she calls the “secret” to their great marriage.

“The reason I think we have a happy marriage with very, very little conflict is that I don't let myself tell stories about him. I just say it. I say it right to him. ‘Are you doing this? Are you thinking that?'”

She continued, “And he says right back to me what he's really doing and thinking. We're together all day, so it's very easy for us to do that.”

The HGTV star added, “Our communication level cuts out my [negative] creativity in a very good, positive way.”

Writer/director James Sweeney‘s “Twinless” made headlines at Sundance earlier this year when pirated scenes from the queer dark comedy leaked on social media off the festival's online platform. But don't let those headlines — and IndieWire wrote one of them — lead you to think that's the most shocking twist related to one of the festival's most delightfully screwed-up and mordantly funny movies.

It's led by viral “Ponyboi” and “Teen Wolf” star Dylan O'Brien in a decidedly grown-up role — two, actually — here as grieving brother Roman, who's lost his twin Rocky (also O'Brien) in a freak accident. But he gets a potential new brother, played by Sweeney himself as a calculating and dry-witted twink who may have something to do with Rocky's sudden death. Especially after an ill-fated hookup.

Just because it's been a while since we've seen the film, here's the official synopsis for a refresher: “In ‘Twinless,' two young men meet in a twin support group and form an unlikely friendship. Roman (Dylan O'Brien) and Dennis (James Sweeney) both search for solace and an identity without their other halves and soon become inseparable outside the group. But when Roman meets Dennis' ebullient co-worker, Marcie (Aisling Franciosi), all is revealed to be not what it seems, as each man harbors secrets that could unravel everything.”

“Twinless” is Sweeney's second feature behind the camera after writing and directing 2019's “Straight Up.” As IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote in his Sundance review, “James Sweeney levels up with this confident and extremely clever story about two boys who meet in a support group for siblings who've lost a twin.” Indeed, the movie elicited cheers, laughs, shocks, and gasps when it premiered at the Eccles Theatre at Sundance in January.

“James Sweeney's ‘Twinless' is a film that hinges on the suppleness of the stories we tell about ourselves (among several other things), and this confident, clever, and cuttingly dark comedy almost never misses a chance to indulge in the courage of its convictions, especially when those convictions feel oh so wrong,” our review added.

Lauren Graham, Tasha Smith, Chris Perfetti, and François Arnaud also star in the film, produced by David Permut, James Sweeney, and Alex Astrachan. Dylan O'Brien is also an executive producer on the film, which went viral during Sundance for sex scenes featuring the star. But don't let that alone sell you on the movie, which just released a trailer, below.

Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions release “Twinless” in theaters on September 5. Watch the trailer below.

	President Donald Trump's administration has officially put Americans on notice that it will be doing nothing to address climate change. Actually, worse than nothing, the Environmental Protection Agency also announced that it will soon be taking back everything it had done to date to address the biggest source of climate pollution in the country.


	Specifically, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, is proposing to reverse the “endangerment finding” that is the predicate for rules requiring polluting industries to rein in their greenhouse gas emissions. To hear Zeldin tell it, he is exposing some elaborate, bureaucratic ruse to bilk taxpayers. In fact, the endangerment finding is a simple affirmation that greenhouse gas pollution is causing climate change and therefore endangering people. And, of course, it sits atop a mountain of scientific evidence.


	As a lawyer who has been working on climate change for the last 20 years, it's hard to overstate how much it changed everything when the EPA finally recognized the scientific consensus and took meaningful action to tackle greenhouse gas pollution from cars at last. 

	











	A quick history: By the 1990s, the terrifying inaction of the U.S. government was driving an ambitious push to compel the EPA to act. In 1999, a group of environmental organizations petitioned the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA denied the petition primarily on grounds that greenhouse gases were not pollutants within the scope of the Clean Air Act. The petitioners took the EPA to court, and in 2007, the case made its way up to the Supreme Court. In the landmark decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, the court ruled that greenhouse gases are indeed pollutants that the EPA has the authority to regulate and the obligation to regulate if, in the EPA's judgment, they endanger human health and welfare. 

	











	Once the EPA was required to make that judgment, it had to face up to the climate science that was by then incontrovertible. In 2009, the EPA found that “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and to endanger the public welfare of current and future generations.” Based on this finding, the EPA began setting standards for tailpipes, power plants, and oil and gas fields — the big three when it comes to greenhouse gas pollution in the U.S.

	It is a point of pride at Earthjustice, where I am privileged to work, that we were part of the legal team that litigated Mass v. EPA, along with several subsequent cases concerning the EPA's authority to regulate climate pollution under the Clean Air Act. Over time, the Supreme Court had several opportunities to backtrack, but it never did. Instead, the court repeatedly affirmed the decision that our national clean air statute is capacious enough to address the biggest pollution threat ever.


	At this advanced stage of the climate crisis, there is every reason not to revisit well-settled law, much less question the scientific consensus about climate change that we can all witness for ourselves. But unconscionably, that is exactly what Zeldin and the Trump administration are trying to do.


	It has not even been a month since flash floods took the lives of 135 people including 37 children in the Texas Hill Country. In June, nearly 130 million people were under advisories for dangerously extreme heat. Midwest tornadoes in March: 47 people dead. January: Apocalyptic wildfires that Los Angeles is still reeling from. In the first half of this year alone, there were 15 climate disasters in the U.S. that each caused over a billion dollars in damage — and those are just the losses that can be monetized. And, yes, we know that climate change played a role in these disasters.


	How is it possible that the Environmental Protection Agency is telling us that we aren't endangered now? To observe the pain that millions of Americans are suffering and officially shrug it off — well, it's an epic level of gaslighting. 


	Alongside the cruelty, there is also a cold calculus. If the EPA is able to revoke the endangerment finding for cars and trucks, we expect that it will try to move quickly to rescind all of the other regulations that are premised on the finding. Tuesday's's move is the next step in the Trump administration's intentionally lawless strategy to do as much damage as possible as quickly as possible.

	Have no fear that any of this will go unchallenged. Smart lawyers are preparing to go to court, and the lawsuits will hit as soon as this decision is final. In the meantime, you don't have to be a lawyer to know how wrong this is.

The man accused of orchestrating the 1996 Las Vegas drive-by shooting that killed the rap legend has taken his case to Nevada's top court. Here's why.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Duane “Keffe D” Davis, the man facing a looming murder trial over the 1996 killing of Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas, is now asking the Nevada Supreme Court to toss out the charges.


	Months after a judge allowed the case to proceed to trial, Davis' lawyers are urging the state's top court to overturn that decision – arguing that prosecutors lack any hard evidence and are instead relying on decades-old statements that should be off-limits.

	“This prosecution has captured worldwide attention,” writes defense attorney Carl Arnold in the Tuesday court filing, obtained by Billboard. “The global public is watching how Nevada upholds due process, fairness, and the rule of law in one of the most closely scrutinized criminal proceedings in recent memory.”


	The drive-by shooting that killed Tupac and the subsequent murder of rival Notorious B.I.G. have for decades been two of music's great unsolved mysteries. But in September 2023, Davis was arrested in September 2023 and charged with first-degree murder over allegations that he orchestrated the Shakur slaying.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The 62-year-old, a former Crips gang leader from Los Angeles, had repeatedly admitted involvement in the killing, including in a 2019 tell-all memoir in which he says he obtained the gun and handed it to his nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, who allegedly pulled the trigger. Anderson has since died, as have others who were allegedly in the car.


	Since his arrest, Davis has pleaded not guilty and repeatedly maintained his innocence, including by publicly arguing that did not write the book: “They can't even place me out here,” he told ABC in a March jailhouse interview.


	In January, his lawyers moved to have the charges thrown out, arguing that the state was planning an “illegal trial” that would violate his client's constitutional rights: “They need to have something else, a gun, a witness, something else that puts this gentleman, those three co-conspirators in the car,” Arnold argued during a court hearing.


	But weeks later, Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny denied that motion, allowing the case to move ahead toward a courtroom showdown. A jury trial is currently scheduled for February 2026.


	Appealing that ruling on Tuesday, lawyers for Davis again cite a lack of concrete evidence to support the decades-delayed charges. They say the case is built only on his purported confessions, including during interviews with investigators in which Davis was promised immunity. Outside those statements, they say prosecutors have no real proof.


	“Nevada law is unambiguous: a conviction cannot rest solely on an uncorroborated extrajudicial statement,” Arnold writes. “The State has offered nothing to corroborate the trustworthiness of Mr. Davis's alleged statements, and nothing independently connecting him to the murder itself.”


	Such arguments are sometimes made on appeal after a trial has already been held, seeking to overturn a conviction. But lawyers for Davis say top court must jump in now, warning that post-trial appeals could add years to a case that has already seen “extraordinary delay.”


	“Although Mr. Davis was not charged until 2023, the prosecution arises from a homicide that occurred in 1996—nearly three decades ago,” his lawyers say. “The Court should exercise its discretion to hear the petition on the merits now—before the damage is done.”

Ever since Stephen Colbert's Late Show was canceled earlier this month, the industry has been locked in an existential debate about whether CBS' decision had to do with politics or was purely financial, as the network itself claimed. To Colbert's former Daily Show colleague Samantha Bee, it's a little from column A, a little from column B. 

“I think both things are just true and real,” Bee said in a recent appearance on the Breaking Bread With Tom Papa podcast when asked to weigh in on either side (via TheWrap). “Like it definitely was hemorrhaging money,” she continued. “You know, these legacy shows, they are hemorrhaging their money with no real end to that.” In her view, this state of affairs is due in part to the fact that “people are literally on their phones all the time… so they actually don't necessarily need a recap of the day's events.” She's not wrong; we recently saw the impact of this with the cancellation of E! News‘ broadcast show. The brand will now only produce content for social media.

At the same time, however, Bee continued that it's “also true that when the President of the United States has to give his sign off on a corporate merger, the thing you can't do is make jokes about him. He's a thin skinned idiot, and we know he's like a pernicious cancer, and he cares about that stuff.” 

Bee herself has experience with pressure from the business side of things from her time hosting Full Frontal on TBS, which underwent multiple mergers during the show's run. “Nobody wants to cause trouble,” she said. “You can't, business trumps everything. It doesn't matter what your values are. It doesn't matter how important you think legacy media is, none of that fucking matters. You're talking about people, hundreds of millionaires and billionaires, literally making their business transactions. Everything you think that is important is absolutely impotent, not even a consideration.”

Bee does give Paramount Global execs some credit, saying that the conversations about The Late Show‘s financial issues (before its settlement with Trump, at least) were likely “agonizing.” The execs probably had “many agonizing conversations about what they were going to do to turn the ship around, what they were going to do to make the show profitable again. And that's true probably of all the shows, you know, how do we make this profitable?” she explained. “But the extra element of it is that it's so much easier for them to cut it loose with this merger coming down the pike. It makes the decision such a no brainer. And probably the most agonizing decisions they were having were about, ‘How do we float this? Like, how do we not get a lot of blowback?' Sure they knew it was happening a long time ago, right? And the considerations were, like, ‘How can we position it so that the story can be not as bad as it could be?” 

Whether or not they accomplished that last one is certainly up for debate. Bee herself thinks it's “awful… I know so many people who work there. I love Stephen. I consider him to be a friend. I think he's amazing. So I'm shocked, not surprised.”

The decade-long partnership between Netflix and Adam Sandler's production company Happy Madison has culminated in this: Sandler's legacyquel Happy Gilmore 2 earned the biggest U.S. opening weekend of all time for a Netflix film, per Variety. Holding the number one spot on Netflix's top 10, the movie generated 46.7 million views over three days (views here are defined as total hours watched divided by the total runtime).

Obviously, this is also the best opening for one of Sandler's movies on the streamer, a list that includes Murder Mystery and Hubie Halloween. Happy Madison's output there has mostly been original films, though, so this is the first time he's revisited any of his old classics for Netflix. The nostalgia-bait paid off in spades, as the sequel's success also boosted the original film to number three on Netflix's top 10. (Per Variety, it generated 11.4 million views for its second consecutive week on the list.)

Perhaps some of the film's success can be attributed to the Taylor Swift effect; the pop star gave it one of her rare social media endorsements (her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, has a supporting role). “Happy Gilmore 2 had me cackling and cheering the whole movie!” She wrote in an Instagram Story. “An absolute must watch, 13/10, go watch it on @netflix as soon as humanly possible.”

Mostly, though, the success probably comes from a widespread love of Sandler and Happy. In his B review for The A.V. Club, Jesse Hassenger writes that “Happy Gilmore 2 doesn't stand on its own enough to rate alongside the company's best work for the streamer,” but it's nevertheless “another indication that Sandler is still undertaking his longtime mission of making silly comfort-food comedies with the stealth seriousness of older age.” Given the viewership numbers, that mission is proving quite a fruitful undertaking.

After premiering at this year's Cannes Film Festival, where our own Ryan Lattanzio called it “a visually propulsive portrait” and hailed filmmaker Shih-Ching Tsou as “a confident directorial talent with a rare exuberance,” “Left-Handed Girl” is preparing for its next step: Awards season contender.

Netflix picked up the film, which debuted in Cannes' Critics' Week section, at the festival, and IndieWire can today announce that the streamer will bolster the film with both a theatrical release (on Friday, November 14) and a streaming release on its platform (on Friday, November 28). The film is in contention as Taiwan's national selection for the Oscars and has global distribution. You can also see three new stills, exclusive to IndieWire, both up top and below.

The film is Tsou's debut solo directorial outing, but she's been a mainstay in indie cinema for decades. A longtime collaborator of the celebrated filmmaker (and now multi-Oscar-winning filmmaker) Sean Baker, Tsou produced Baker's films “Starlet,” “The Florida Project,” and “Tangerine.” The duo also co-directed, co-wrote, and produced the 2004 gem “Take Out.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






And their collaboration continues with “Left-Handed Girl,” which Tsou and Baker wrote together (and which Baker also edited). Tsou and Baker also produced the film, alongside Mike Goodridge, Jean Labadie, and Alice Labadie. The film stars Janel Tsai, breakout child actress Nina Ye, Teng-Hui Huang, and Shih-Yuan Ma. Per the film's official synopsis: “A single mother and her two daughters return to Taipei after several years of living in the countryside to open a stand at a buzzing night market. Each in their way will have to adapt to this new environment to make ends meet and maintain the family unity. But when their traditional grandfather forbids his youngest left-handed granddaughter from using her ‘devil hand,' generations of family secrets begin to unravel.”

At Cannes, Tsou told IndieWire how her two-decade experience working with Baker prepared her to direct a movie set in her hometown: “I have learned so much working with Sean, because everything in his films is hands-on. I was doing a lot of things on set, from learning the research process to talking to people from the community. We tried to tell the story as real as possible.”

For Tsou, who has not directed in over 20 years, the experience of making the film has been long in the works and very long desired.  “For ‘Left-Handed Girl,' I had the idea since I was very young. The first time I brought it to Sean, he thought it was really interesting,” she said. “So we started to write the draft together. After every other film that we finished, we would always come back to this film. Unfortunately, the time [to make it] wasn't right. It took a while to get the funding together, to get people interested. I think it's all about timing. This is the time for ‘Left-Handed Girl.' This is the time for me to come back to the director's seat.”

As some of the advertisements for the cop parody legacyquel The Naked Gun remind us, studio comedies—spoofs in particular—are a dying breed. And it's not just that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans) murdered the form in cold blood. There are fewer voices like those of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker focusing on film comedy, compared to the more reliable avenues of TV or podcasts, and fewer opportunities given to them. On top of that, the still-soaring trend of the moment, superhero cinema, has incorporated a sometimes-obnoxious level of self-snark from its early days (though not early enough to avoid a Superhero Movie). This dormancy means that the most familiar thing about the new Naked Gun is its name.

This novelty—and the willingness of Lonely Island director/co-writer Akiva Schaffer (Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Hot Rod) to get silly—allows The Naked Gun to successfully follow in the pratfalling footsteps of the earlier trilogy, mostly unmoored from a cohesive genre and instead incorporating tropes from film noir, action movies, and spy thrillers into its silly string of loosely connected gags. The farce lands a less-lethal (but still effective) number of punchlines mostly thanks to a game Liam Neeson, who proves that he's not just the serious-faced septuagenarian whose name sounded most similar to “Leslie Nielsen.”

Neeson plays Lt. Frank Drebin Jr., whose lineage only ever comes up for a few choice jokes, as another useless cop on the useless Police Squad. He's effectively a live-action version of his role in The Lego Movie, violently traipsing around a world with almost as many visual gags. He's also gruffer, stiffer, and a bit harder to understand than Nielsen ever was, which is fitting considering that Neeson is a decade-and-a-half older than his predecessor in the role. But Shaffer and his co-writers (Dan Gregor and Doug Mand) fill Frank Jr.'s loose investigation into a linked murder and bank heist with the necessary density of gags per square foot of film, letting them bounce off of Neeson's awkward smile, dim-witted stare, and gravelly deadpans.

While Neeson and the sheer quantity of jokes carry much of the film—with Paul Walter Hauser capably filling in the George Kennedy role—it's Pamela Anderson, as Frank's love interest and the sister of the victim, who steals her scenes. Though she easily fits the bill as the object of ogling voiceover, Anderson goes big and ridiculous with an unassuming straight face. This is mirrored by The Naked Gun‘s wise choice not to fill its cast with comedian friends or celebrity cameos (though a few, like Busta Rhymes, slip through), but with veteran character actors able to commit to whatever boneheaded bit is asked of them. Danny Huston devours scenery and dialogue alike as the would-be macho tech-guy villain, stuffing his face with silly names and staring in disbelief at the idiocy he has to put up with as a Elon Musk-adjacent fool. His henchman Kevin Durand and Frank's boss CCH Pounder skewer archetypes they've long mastered while avoiding any name-brand distractions.

And yes, it's all mostly funny. Jokes range from classic over-literal eye-rollers, to riffs on an Oldboy-style hallway fight, to Austin Powers-like silhouette gags that get even raunchier than that horny franchise. Some running bits don't connect, and some lower-hanging fruit sound like leftovers from producer Seth MacFarlane's take on the material. But the topical humor—digging at self-driving vehicles and Silicon Valley manosphere residents—is often as strong as the evergreen stuff—like the shots at police brutality. But the best thing about the comedy is that, over the blissfully brisk runtime of 85 minutes, Schaffer and his team never let one joke, flop or hit, linger for too long before cramming a few more into the frame. And, every so often, a truly surreal detour happily allows the film to luxuriate in ideas that, if The Naked Gun was Saturday Night Live, would've never made it to air.

That stupid-smart mix of clunkers, wordplay, old-school set-ups, prop humor, and left-field ideas that the writers just couldn't stop laughing at doesn't inherently make for a comedy classic—especially as a late plot escalation draws attention to the dull sheen shining over much of the film—but it does prove how effective these films' formula can be when followed properly. All The Naked Gun had to do to make it work in the modern film landscape was, ironically, Trojan Horse it inside of an old IP.

Sound design studio Slate + Ash has released a new virtual guitar based on sounds designed by avant-garde guitarists including Sunn O)))'s Stephen O'Malley, Oren Ambarchi, and David Torn. Each guitarist contributed fragmentary sounds—loops, textures, resonances, and mechanical failures—that Slate + Ash used its playback engine to deconstruct and turn into a number of recursive preset sounds for the Kontakt 8 sampling platform. Watch a showcase for the software instrument, which is titled Ruins, below.

Randall Dunn's Williamsburg, Brooklyn, studio, Circular Ruin, co-created the instrument, and studio co-founders Ben Greenberg and Arjan Miranda—as well as prepared guitarist Bill Horist—contributed further source material. Slate + Ash and Circular Ruin describe the instrument as an “infinitely recursive sonic artefact” inspired by the short story that gave the latter studio its name, Jorge Luis Borges' The Circular Ruins.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	At $170 million in media value, the promotional partner campaign for Disney/Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps is the biggest in some time, ahead of the pushes for Marvel Cinematic Universe's Deadpool & Wolverine and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and even rival studio summer campaigns such as Jurassic World Rebirth ($150M).


Spider-Man: Far from Home at $288M remains the record holder when it comes to overall worth of an MCU promo partner campaign, that 2019 pic made at Sony. Among post-Covid MCU brand campaigns, Fantastic Four‘s overall value ranks behind Spider-Man: No Way Home‘s $202M and counts such brands as Little Caesars, Zillow, Pop-Tarts, General Mills, Citizen watches and more. Several advertisers joined in on the movie's fun embracing its 1960s retro-future spirit, a motif woven into their in-world partnerships.

	











	The movie starring Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Julia Garner is expected to make around $45M in its second weekend at the box office with a firm grip on No. 1. By Sunday, a $200M running total stateside is likely. Two newcomers — Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2 and Paramount's hopeful revival of big-screen comedies, The Naked Gun — look to open to $20M and $15M, respectively.

Fantastic Four partners strategically leveraged their IP across cultural touchpoints — from high-impact traditional advertising to irreverent social media executions to buzzworthy experiential tactics to unique AR content, custom publishing and consumer giveaways.

	











	Interestingly enough, the North American campaign doesn't feature a car partner. Automobile companies typically contribute the boatload of media value in a movie promo campaign. That said, among overseas brand, Fantastic Four‘s has an automobile partner in Australia's Chery, which is launching a line of hybrid family vehicles.


	Fast-food partners are another enormous contributor to a movie's brand campaigns, and for Fantastic Four, that's Little Caesars. The “Pizza-Pizza” retailer was one of five brand partners for the film that developed custom “in world” commercials. Little Caesars also was one of two commercials, , along with Zillow, directed by Fantastic Four: First Steps production designer Kasra Farahani. Little Caesars also was written and produced internally by the Marvel Partnerships team.

	The movie reps Little Caesars' second-biggest partnership with a motion picture to date, with media support across streaming, linear and digital throughout North America and select Latin American markets. Farahani's commercial features Giganto and re-creates the iconic 1961 comic No. 1 cover. The spot has racked up north of 7M views across YouTube. There was also a $4 Fandango movie ticket offer combo in addition to four custom pizza boxes made, each featuring a character from the movie. Little Caesars also sold its “Fantastic 4-In-One” pizza (four different topping combinations on one pizza).


	Real estate site Zillow gave fans the opportunity to tour the period futuristic-themed penthouse from the movie, located in the Baxter Building. Featured highlights included Space Age conversation pit and a rotating fireplace/TV, indoor BBQ, cosmic nursery and Mister Fantastic's futuristic lab. In addition to directing the commercial, Farahani also directed a virtual home tour and co-designed a variety of bespoke print imagery, including an ad for The New York Times. Fans were invited to dial a special telephone number for a personalized tour and explore downloadable high-res images of the Marvel landmark. The campaign kicked off on July 7. Zillow listed the home for $4.44M.


Pop-Tarts‘ push for the pic spotlighted “FanTASTEic Four,” a humorous team of giant pastry mascots that charm Gen-Z audiences but hilariously fall short at heroism. The in-world spot emphasized snack appeal over superhero skills.


General Mills embraced retrofuturism with limited-edition 1960s-themed cereal boxes including Honey Nut Cheerios, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms and Reese's Puffs. Walmart (which featured Cocoa Puffs with Galactus) and Kroger (which had Trix featuring H.E.R.B.I.E.) were among key retailers. There also was a limited-edition Lucky Charms box with Johnny Storm available at Walmart. General Mills was an MCU promo partner on Loki with “Loki Charms,” Thunderbolts* with Wheaties and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. There was support from social media influencers with Evan Tanaka (327K followers) creating his own commercial:

Snapple launched packaging inspired by each of the heroes. Each bottle unlocked an augmented reality (AR) experience with details about the film and a memory card game featuring Galactus. The push included 22M+ themed ice teas of four different flavors. 

	











Synchrony is a longtime MCU partner, and its period spot spotlighted a fiscally savvy family, blending nostalgia with financial literacy. The commercial features a H.E.R.B.I.E.-themed savings calculator, a character-inspired digital board game that transforms budgeting into a heroic journey and even a piggy bank of The Thing.


	How did the pre-swinging generation keep track of time and visualize the future? Citizen watches had an idea with their vintage inspired design and advanced technology Marvel edition Citizen Zenshin timepiece collector's set. The watch features a film-themed blue dial, with icons at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock representing each hero's powers. There were co-branded spots and media placements such as the ABC Super Sign in NYC, taxi media exposure, as well as digital and social media amplification.


	Having just partnered on Marvel Studios' Captain America: Brave New World, sports bar restaurant Topgolf created an in-venue experience where groups of four or more players teamed up and battled Galactus in a themed Block Party digital game available at all U.S. and Scotland locations.


Google Play integrated The Fantastic Four into a priority game launch tied to Google Play Rewards. This was further boosted at San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend. Take a look:


	Other Fantastic Four: First Steps brand partners included Juicy Fruit and Doublemint gum and Formula E, which had a themed takeover of its annual championship ePrix race last weekend in London. Formula E previously teamed with Marvel on Thunderbolts* for a wrap of one of their cars. Marvel Studios also worked with Dairy Farmers of America/Trumoo, which served up their line of TruMoo “Fantastic Berry” low-fat blue milk, inspired by the campaign's bold color palette. There's also film-themed packaged regional milk brands (e.g. Altadena) available through September at retailers such as Target, Walmart, etc. The promotion included four “Power Up Your Pour” color-changing drinking glasses, with one of each of the Fantastic Four character designs released weekly from July 18-August 8.

	“Our team built a truly fantastic global promotional campaign — one that felt completely authentic, immersive and organically woven into the world of the Fantastic Four,” Lylle Breier, Disney's EVP Partnerships, Promotions, Synergy & Events, tells Deadline. “It was a true collaboration between our best-in-class brand partners, the talented filmmakers and our amazing internal creative team who wrote and produced the fully custom spots that seamlessly transformed our promotional content into an extension of the film's marketing campaign and pop culture.”

The metal icon will be laid to rest at a private ceremony in his hometown in the Midlands later in the day on Wednesday (July 30).

	Birmingham, England said goodbye to its most beloved son on Wednesday (July 30) as Ozzy Osbourne's funeral procession passed through the Midlands city. The Black Sabbath singer died last week (July 22) at age 76, just weeks after his final live performance at the all-star charity concert Back to the Beginning. 

	











	Osbourne was raised in the Aston area of the city and the metal icons — made up of guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward — formed in Birmingham in 1968. The group played their first live show in the city at The Crown, dubbed the “birthplace of heavy metal”, on the corner of Station Street and Hill Street. Osbourne and Black Sabbath's final performance earlier in July took place at soccer team Aston Villa F.C.'s home stadium Villa Park.




			Trending on Billboard		







	A hearse carrying Osbourne's body left Villa Park and made its way through the city center, where fans lined the streets to pay their respects, packed in behind barricades and hanging out of windows, with some shouting “Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, oi, oi, oi!” as they waited for the procession to being. A purple floral tribute reading “Ozzy” adorned his coffin and a purple flower crucifix sat atop the hearse. The cortège traveled down Broad Street and passed over the Black Sabbath Bridge where a number of fans have left flowers and tributes to the late singer; the bridge was first opened in 2019.

	











	His wife Sharon and their three children Aimeé, Kelly and Jack, alongside other family members stopped to view tributes on the Black Sabbath Bridge and laid flowers of their own. A visibly emotional Sharon threw up a peace symbol to the crowd to thank the fans who attended, many of whom shouted “Sharon, we love you!”


	Ozzy's cortège was led by local group Bostin' Brass, who performed a number of jazzy instrumental Black Sabbath and solo classics, including “Iron Man” and “Crazy Train,” as the hearse made its way down Broad Street, with fans providing spontaneous vocals. Speaking in 2011, Ozzy said that he wanted his funeral to be “a celebration, not a mope-fest,” so fans who attended applauded the hearse as it made its way down the street, and chanted “Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy!” in celebration. He will later be laid to rest in a private ceremony in the city.


	The procession was live streamed so fans from across the globe could witness the event, and the cortège was paid for by Osbourne's family. Lord Mayor of Birmingham Zafar Iqbal thanked the family for their contribution to the event, and told the BBC that “[Ozzy] put Birmingham on the map. He put Aston on the map.”


	On July 5, Ozzy performed for the last time at an all-star concert that reportedly raised over $190 million for charities, including local causes such as Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Acorns Children's Hospice. He performed nine songs at the event: five from his solo career, and an additional four with the original Black Sabbath band members – the first time they'd been on stage together since 2005.


	Following his passing, Black Sabbath and his solo material has surged on streaming and on the Billboard charts. “Crazy Train” from his 1980 album Blizzard of Ozz recently hit the Hot 100 for the first time, landing at No. 46.

	Béis is taking inspiration from an all-American essential for its latest collab.


	The travel brand founded by Canada-bred actress Shay Mitchell is teaming with Gap on a denim-inspired capsule collection of blue-hued luggage and accessories ($128 to $378) and adults and kids clothing ($8 to $128) in Béis' signature suitcase shades — beige, black and Berry Pink. The 26-piece collection drops online on Aug. 1 at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET at gap.com and beistravel.com, but Gap cardholders can start shopping as early as July 31 at 9 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET.

	The stylish travel label's small and regular carry-on suitcases, large check-in, weekender bag and travel backpack will be available in light blue. Béis' versatility also crosses over into Gap's gear: think convertible cargo pants and bandeau jumpsuits that transform into shorts or pants, travel-ready hoodies with built-in inflatable neck pillows, oversized blanket coats and decidedly nap-ready jean jackets. There are also organic cotton T-shirts and crop tops in vintage finishes, logo-on-logo sweaters, barrel sweatpants, a striped poplin dolman shirt and matching boxer shorts, a sheer black maxi dress, barrel jeans, jorts, baseball hats and other comfort-minded essentials.


	Gap's website will stock the full range of clothing, accessories and travel products, while Béis' site will offer all luggage and bags and a selection of clothing. The collab will be available at select Gap stores in the U.S., Canada and Japan. 


	“Béis is built on functional and accessible design. Partnering with Gap let us bring Béis-ics to more people than ever,” Mitchell says in a statement. “I've been wearing Gap since I was a kid, so designing a collection that allows you to express your personal style while on the go feels like a full circle moment. This line is for anyone who wants to look good, feel good, and travel in style.”

	











	The collab will be supported by a 75-second film — set in a “larger-than-life denim suitcase,” per the release — shot by Bjorn Iooss and directed by Andrew B. Myers. Mitchell also joined forces with her partner, Matte Babel, to creative-direct the joyful video, which stars the couple and their two children, Atlas and Rome, in their first-ever family brand photoshoot.


	Gap has certainly stepped up its style game since hiring designer Zac Posen as creative director. Anne Hathaway debuted his Gap-backed return to the red carpet in a now-sold-out poplin shirtdress, while his GapStudio line has been sported by Demi Moore, Emily Ratajkowski, Timothée Chalamet, Alton Mason and other stars. The retailer has also previously collabed with Disney, Doen, LoveShackFancy, Malbon Golf and many other brands.


	See highlights from the Gap x Béis collaboration below, and shop the collection online starting on Aug. 1 at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET at beistravel.com and gap.com.

Paul Walter Hauser and Danny Huston also appear in director Akiva Schaffer's police procedural spoof built around the son of Leslie Nielsen's Frank Drebin.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	The three-man comedy factory that ruled the 1980s with their fusillades of slapstick, sight gags, loopy non sequiturs and winking innuendo was David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker — Hollywood's ZAZ before David Zaslav. Their legacy rivals that of Mel Brooks in the '60s and '70s, most notably via Airplane! and the Naked Gun movies, though I also have a soft spot for their swerve into more conventional farce with the acerbic dark comedy Ruthless People. Even the misstep of Top Secret! yielded its share of laughs, despite attempting to hit an unwieldy jumble of parody targets.

	Having honed their skills in a college sketch-comedy troupe, the trio's strategy was to throw as many jokes per minute at the screen as possible, the sillier the better, ensuring that enough of them stuck to cushion the ones that missed the mark.

The Bottom Line

	
	Dumb fun that lands often enough to squeak by.
	



Release date: Friday, Aug. 1Cast: Liam Neeson, Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, CCH Pounder, Kevin Durand, Cody Rhodes, Liza Koshy, Eddie Yu, Danny HustonDirector: Akiva SchafferScreenwriters: Dan Gregor, Doug Maud, Akiva Schaffer, based on the TV series Police Squad! created by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker

									Rated PG-13,
								1 hour 25 minutes			






	Their 1982 ABC series spoofing crime procedurals, Police Squad!, lasted just six episodes. But ZAZ resurrected the idea for the big screen in 1988 with The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (these guys seldom met an exclamation point they didn't love), which became a successful trilogy centering on Leslie Nielsen's bumbling but oblivious Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin. 


	Cut to 31 years later …


	Nobody could accuse director Akiva Schaffer (who, like ZAZ, hails from a comedy trio, The Lonely Island) and his co-writers or producer Seth MacFarlane of lacking affection for the material. That's evident in the sweet homages to Nielsen and George Kennedy as Capt. Ed Hocken — O.J. Simpson not so much.

	











	The filmmakers follow the formula to a T in this legacy sequel or reboot or whatever you want to call it, enlisting the sons of Drebin (Liam Neeson) and Hocken (Paul Walter Hauser) as the new Police Squad team to provide plot continuity. Even if the movie kind of stalls midway as Schaffer struggles to balance the gags with the action of an overly elaborate crime plot, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments to keep nostalgic fans of the earlier films happy and maybe make some new converts.


	Just as Nielsen was established primarily as a dramatic actor before becoming a ZAZ linchpin in Airplane! and The Naked Gun, Neeson arrives trailing the gravitas of his late-career reinvention as a steely dispenser of vengeance and retribution, in Taken et al. The actor's dead serious delivery provides a subtle meta underlay as Frank Jr. takes down bad guys and tackles a master criminal, starting with a bank robbery prologue whose funniest jokes are given away in the trailer.


	The heist ties into the suspicious death of a brilliant tech engineer, whose electric vehicle went off the road. The victim's sister, Beth Davenport (MVP Pamela Anderson), seeks Frank's help in investigating what she's convinced was murder. He tells her to leave the detective work to the professionals, but they both turn up at a club run by her brother's boss, Edentech founder Richard Kane (Danny Huston).


	A mogul cut from the Elon Musk mold, Kane has a nefarious plan involving an amusingly named PLOT Device (Primordial Law of Toughness) with mind-altering properties, which is part of what he calls “Project Inferno.” But before that gets activated, he cozies up to Frank with the gift of Police Squad's first electric cop car. 

	











	Weary of dealing with angry calls from the mayor about Frank's blithe trail of city property destruction, police chief Davis (CCH Pounder) warns him to play nice with major donor Kane, since Police Squad's funding is at risk.


	That thread doesn't really go anywhere in the script by Dan Gregor, Doug Maud and Schaffer. Nor does Kane's talk of a “Doomsday Giggle Bunker,” where entertainment will be provided by “Weird Al” Yankovic — one of a handful of celebrity cameos. The same goes for Hauser's thankless role as Ed Hocken Jr., who plays straight man to Frank's self-serious dimwit, when the writers remember to include him.


	Even in a spoof of a police procedural, the crime under investigation needs a minimum of internal logic, but mastermind Kane's big scheme to destroy and remake Los Angeles — and possibly the world — to his own specifications pushes the movie almost into the absurdist espionage territory of the Austin Powers series. Senior or junior, Frank Drebin is an L.A. city cop, not Ethan Hunt.


	Luckily, Neeson and Anderson have enough spark to carry the film, not to mention great chemistry. I could have done without the padding of a winter cabin romantic interlude with a killer snowman — there's a difference between dumb and annoyingly stupid — but their scenes together are the high points throughout.


	Hearing Neeson express Frank's enduring anger about the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident, reflect on the cultural importance of the Black Eyed Peas, berate Beth for messing up his Buffy the Vampire Slayer recordings or break down the characters on Sex and the City after someone says “Miranda rights” is a droll pleasure. His tough-guy physical comedy also scores, as he swats off armed criminals or bites off the barrel of a gun pointed at him without breaking a sweat.

	











	There's a moment early on in which he kneels beneath his father's photograph on the Police Squad wall of honor and says, “I want to be just like you, but at the same time, completely different.” Which is pretty much the manifesto of anyone reviving a popular franchise after multiple decades of dormancy. The Naked Gun is at least a step up from the lifeless Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, to name one recent example.


	Neeson clearly is having a blast sending up his hyperviolent screen persona of recent years, and his enjoyment is infectious up to a point. But even when the narrative momentum sputters as the movie loads up on jokes at the expense of structure or character, Neeson's scenes with Anderson are bliss.


	Continuing her renaissance after The Last Showgirl, Anderson displays impeccable comic timing, never leaning too hard into a line when her breathy throwaway delivery can land a bigger laugh. At one point, Kane asks Beth, “May I speak freely?” She replies, “I prefer English.” In another moment, Frank, curious about where she went to college, asks, “UCLA?” With only the tiniest frown of confusion, she tells him, “I see it every day. I live here.”


	Dialogue like that may come from the hoariest school of comedy writing, but the charm of Anderson's buoyant screen presence keeps it fresh and funny. Beth is a character who defends her crime-solving instincts by saying, “I write true crime stories, based on fictional crimes that I make up.” But it's crucial to Anderson's performance that Beth sails over every idiocy the script throws at her as if she's making perfect sense.

	











	I kept wishing the movie were as consistently entertaining and as sure of its footing as Anderson and Neeson are in their roles. But even if the laughs are hit-or-miss and the plotting shaky, there's enough inspired nonsense here to keep comedy-starved theatrical audiences engaged. To the filmmakers' credit, that includes the kind of retrograde, politically incorrect humor — the cops' anatomical appreciations of Beth are a hoot — that makes the movie feel almost like the old Naked Gun.

“Is This Thing On?,” Bradley Cooper‘s third directorial feature after “A Star Is Born” and “Maestro,” is set to close the New York Film Festival. The dramedy's world premiere is set for Alice Tully Hall on Friday, October 10 — meaning it will skip festivals such as Toronto and Telluride and head straight for NYFF. “Maestro” previously played the New York Film Festival in 2023.

Cooper also co-wrote the script, here with Mark Chappell (“See How They Run”) and the film's star, Will Arnett. “Is This Thing On?” centers on a New York City comedian's midlife crisis, and it's inspired by the true story of British comedian John Bishop, who also executive-produces the Searchlight Pictures release. It co-stars Laura Dern, Ciaran Hinds, Sean Hayes, Peyton Manning(!), Amy Sedaris, and Cooper himself.

More on the film courtesy of NYFF: “In a pair of galvanizing, deeply honest performances, Will Arnett and Laura Dern play Alex and Tess Novak, whose marriage has reached an impasse. With amicable sorrow, the couple — parents of two young boys — mutually agree to split up. Yet in director Bradley Cooper's keenly observed comic drama, their separation leads to unpredictable midlife self-reckonings, most dramatically in Alex's wild career pivot to become a confessional stand-up comedian in New York City's West Village, where he finds new direction and camaraderie.

“This seemingly outlandish scenario — in a script by Cooper, Arnett, and Mark Chappell inspired by the true story of British comedian John Bishop — is never played for easy laughs, while Cooper uses his penchant for naturalism to give the actors space to find their complicated centers. In his beautifully lived-in third feature following ‘A Star Is Born' and ‘Maestro' (NYFF61), Cooper confirms his dexterity for representing the complexities of human relationships, constructing a film that is both lacerating and sweet-souled, funny and tender.”

Cooper said in a statement, “We are honored and humbled to premiere our film at the New York Film Festival. Earlier this year, we had the wonderful opportunity to shoot this story all throughout the city, so it's very exciting to debut it on the closing evening of the festival. NYC injects an energy into every aspect of filmmaking that just can't be replicated. I have attended many premieres at NYFF over the years and to have the support and belief in our film from Dennis Lim and his team is an enormous thing for us. Thank you! On behalf of Will, Laura, and the entire cast and crew — we can't wait!”

“We are thrilled to close the festival with Bradley Cooper's delightful third feature,” said Dennis Lim, NYFF's artistic director. “'Is This Thing On?' is a film of many dimensions and surprises: a fond tribute to New York City's comedy scene, a sensitive study of midlife discontent, and a modern-day comedy of remarriage, pitch-perfect in its balance of humor and feeling.”

 










Searchlight has not yet announced a release date for “Is This Thing On?” “A Star Is Born” and “Maestro” DP Matthew Libatique returns to handle this film's cinematography. He was Oscar-nominated for both, as was Cooper in multiple categories for each film.

As previously announced, the 2025 New York Film Festival will open with the North American premiere of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt.” That screening comes after the film, starring Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri, makes its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival. Also stopping first in Venice is NYFF's Centerpiece selection, Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother.” The triptych drama stars Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps, Tom Waits, Adam Driver, and more, and will bring Jarmusch to the Venice competition for the first time. (Though he has, of course, brought his films to NYFF many times and designed the festival's 2023 poster.)

Presented by Film at Lincoln Center, the 63rd New York Film Festival (NYFF63) will take place from September 26 to October 13. The NYFF Main Slate selection committee, chaired by artistic director Dennis Lim, includes Florence Almozini, Justin Chang, K. Austin Collins, and Rachel Rosen. NYFF63 is supported by festival co-chairs Imelda and Peter Sobiloff and Nanna and Dan Stern; vice-chairs Susannah Gray and John Lyons; and supporters Hillary Koota Krevlin and Glenn Krevlin.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	General audiences at multiplexes likely will not be able to tell that the dead-on spoof of a movie trailer that opens the new reboot of '80s classic The Naked Gun is actually part of the film itself as it no doubt will have just followed 25 minutes of real trailers, but it is an inspired beginning as star Liam Neeson shows up to plead for the return of comedy to theaters, an endangered species he goes on to detail by name-checking numerous funny films of a distant past and encouraging moviegoers to support the comedy of their choice — if they can find it.


	The sad thing is that it is not just a spoof. The style of LOL-, hit-the-wall-with-a-barrage-of-laugh-lines-for-85-minutes-straight comedy has become something of a rarity in theaters, where the sound of laughter can be contagious if experienced communally. Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler are relegated to streamers these days. What's the last comedy Jim Carrey starred in (that doesn't include a Hedgehog)? And that brings us to this film, which is clearly an homage and attempt to bring back the genre that ended 30 years ago after making dramatic actor Leslie Nielsen a household comedic name.

	











	As the new filmmakers including this film's director Akiva Schaffer (Hot Rod, Popstar, Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers), who also collaborated on the screenplay with Dan Gregor and Doug Mand (How I Met Your Mother), go about reinventing what the Zuckers and Jim Abrahams started with their 1980s smash Airplane, which spoofed airplane disaster movies, and continued with Top Secret and their takeoffs on TV police procedurals, their self-professed mantra is “try to be different and original and at the same time being exactly the same.” With rapid-fire gags and a game cast trying hard to play it all completely straight, this nakedly hilarious Naked Gun is a welcome return in a time where we can use a few good laughs. This one has more than a few if sight gags, literal humor and characters short a few cards of a full deck are your idea of a good time.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Fortunately, Neeson, like Nielsen not exactly known for his comedic chops, signed on and knew exactly how to deliver nonsensical lines with a straight face, never trying to be “funny.” And that goes for Pamela Anderson as well, who in her successful second act after getting raves for The Last Showgirl also demonstrates a flair for this kind of stuff. Neeson as Police Lt. Frank Drebin Jr. ushers her femme fatale Beth Davenport into his office with the line, “Please take a chair.” Davenport answers, “Oh no thanks. I have one at home.” That Schaffer and his co-writers can keep up this level of dialogue to the point where the rather dumb plot really doesn't matter is a kind of badge of honor, especially when fans recall the original could hardly be improved upon. But the 2025 version with sight gags that land where they are intended succeeds more times than not.


	What they are going for here essentially is a modern-day film noir in the spirit of Bogart meets the Lethal Weapon-style cop pictures of the '90s. The three Naked Gun pictures from 1988 through 1994 were more spoofs of TV shows like Dragnet and in fact were hatched from the short-lived 1982 series Police Squad that first introduced us to Drebin, earning Nielsen a Lead Comedy Actor Emmy nomination. After the opening trailer spoof, the film tries to get its footing with a violent bank robbery where Drebin singlehandedly wipes out loads of people in dazzling fashion — no doubt an homage to the Willis and Gibson style of police work. Soon we learn he is on the case of billionaire tech maven Richard Cane (Danny Huston), who is out to change the world in his own image. This involves his invention to rile up citizens called the “P.L.O.T. Device” (get it?) or Primordial Law Of Toughness.


	The sultry and mysterious Davenport becomes an ally as she uses her female wiles to help Drebin defeat the threat and avenge the murder of her brother. Like I said none of this matters as long as the jokes keep coming, and despite a couple of lulls, they certainly do. Best in show though is a riotous sight gag involving surveillance across the street from Drebin's apartment where he is entertaining Davenport and making a turkey dinner. The raunchy sexual activity seemingly seen in the surveillance is not at all what is quite innocently taking place; you won't believe what you can do visually with a scrub brush and a friendly pet dog to suggest otherwise. It's classic and you have to wonder how Paramount still managed to get a PG-13.


	Neeson is so perfectly cast here, his Taken image so ingrained, that you really can't imagine who could pull this off any better. Same goes for the gorgeous Anderson, who matches him line for line in reeling off the noirish dialogue. Paul Walter Hauser as Drebin's #2 doesn't get as much to do but is an ideal partner and lands laughs on his own especially as Drebin, like a new-age Mr. Magoo, gets to disastrously try out an electric car. Huston plays the tech billionaire evil bit well, even suggesting a bit of Elon Musk with his over-the-top plans. In addition to the able supporting cast, there are some uncredited surprises including a bit with Dave Bautista that doesn't really come off, and a brief but funny interrogation with Busta Rhymes.


	With next week's reboot of another blast from the past, Freakier Friday, and Happy Gilmore 2 ruling the streamers, The Naked Gun also gives us hope Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to laugh. It just simply has to go back in time to find its lost funny bone.

	











	Producers are Seth MacFarlane  and Erica Huggins.

The Irish know comedy. Not surprised Liam does a kick ass job!

Look forward to seeing it but the role should have gone to Jon Hamm.  Resembles Neilsen and could deliver his same deadpan deer in the headlights looks.

Dan Gregor and Doug Mand – the BEST!!

The beloved character premiered in March 2006 in the Disney Channel show that launched Miley's career.

Miley Cyrus can't quit Hannah Montana. The singer who rose to fame playing the teen who secretly moonlighted as pop star Montana on the show that debuted on the Disney Channel on March 24, 2006, told SiriusXM's TikTok Radio recently that she's working on something “really, really special” to commemorate the series' 20th anniversary.


	“I want to design something really, really special for it because it really was the beginning of all of this that now sits here today,” Cyrus said to host Chris Olsen about the show's March 2026 anniversary. “Without Hannah, there really wouldn't be this kind of… this me. It's so crazy to think, too, that I started as a character that I thought was going to be impossible to shed. And now that's something that when I walk into a space, it's looked at as this sense of nostalgia or something that you have from your childhood, but I've now been as kind of integrated into everyone's life as the character itself. So that's exciting to get to celebrate that.”

	











	Cyrus stepped into the role at age 13 and played Montana over four seasons from 2006-2011 in the teen sitcom that also featured her dad, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus portraying her father, Robby Ray. In addition to the series, Cyrus appeared as both herself and Montana in the 2008 concert movie Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The popular sitcom also spawned the 2006 album Hannah Montana, as well as 2007's Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus, 2009's Hannah Montana 3 and 2010's Hannah Montana Forever, as well as the Billboard Hot 100 hit singles “He Could Be the One,” (No. 10), “Life's What You Make It” (No. 25), “Nobody's Perfect” (No. 27) and “Let's Get Crazy” (No. 57).


	At press time no additional information was available on the plans for the Montana anniversary celebration.

The streets of Birmingham echoed with chants of “Ozzy!” as thousands of fans gathered to honor the late rock legend. Ozzy Osbourne fans will be given a final opportunity to celebrate the heavy metal icon as his funeral cortège moves through his hometown of Birmingham on Wednesday, July 30. The procession will offer a public goodbye before a private family ceremony later in the week.

The Black Sabbath frontman died at age 76 on July 22, just weeks after performing a triumphant farewell concert at Villa Park alongside fellow founding members and music legends like Metallica, Guns N' Roses & Tom Morello.

Osbourne's body will return to Birmingham for a public procession that begins at 1 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) on Wednesday. The route travels down Broad Street in the heart of the city, offering fans a chance to pay their respects.

Along the way, the cortège will pause at the Black Sabbath Bridge, home to a commemorative bench featuring life-size silhouettes of Osbourne and his bandmates Terry “Geezer” Butler, Tony Iommi & Bill Ward.

A live brass band performance by Bostin' Brass will accompany the procession. Thousands are expected to gather along the route, and road closures are in effect throughout Birmingham, including Broad Street, which shut down to traffic early Wednesday.

The event was coordinated in collaboration with Osbourne's family, who are covering all related costs. Birmingham City Council praised the late icon as a true son of the city, with Mayor Zafar Iqbal calling it “a fitting, dignified tribute.”

For those unable to attend in person, a livestream from the Black Sabbath bench will be available. In addition, fans can sign a book of condolence at the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery or visit the “Ozzy Osbourne: Working Class Hero” exhibit launched by Sharon Osbourne in June. 

You can start streaming Ozzy's final farewell here. The live procession is also being covered by several news outlets on their official YouTube pages. 

Osbourne's influence on music is unmatched. As the self-proclaimed “Prince of Darkness,” he pioneered heavy metal with albums like “Black Sabbath” and “Paranoid.” Despite health battles in recent years—including Parkinson's and a 2003 neck injury—his spirit remained unbreakable.

His family shared the news of his passing last week. In a statement, the family said: “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning.”

“He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family's privacy at this time.”

With voices raised and emotions high, the city is paying a fitting tribute to one of its most iconic sons in a farewell filled with love, music, and memory.

"I'm too messy for that," the 'Kingsman' star said about being Denis Villeneuve's 007. "Also, it's possibly not quite the thing that would make me happiest; it kind of consumes your life."


							By 

	Lily Ford



	The race to be Denis Villeneuve‘s 007 is hotting up, but Taron Egerton has bowed out.


	The actor, known for his roles in the Kingsman movies and as Elton John in Rocketman, may have been considered a frontrunner for James Bond after step-siblings Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson formally handed over the rights to Amazon earlier this year. He's young, fit and British, has proven he can play a great spy — why not?




	“I think I'm too messy for that,” Egerton told Collider on Tuesday. “I think I'm not [the right fit]— I really love James Bond and particularly Daniel Craig's tenure.”

	“But I think I wouldn't be good at it,” he continued, “and I think there's so many cool, younger actors who would be great for it. I think it would be wasted on me, probably.”

	Egerton added that the role would be “quite an undertaking” at this stage in his career. “As far as I'm aware, nobody's asking me to do it. But also, it's possibly not quite the thing that would make me happiest,” he said, referring to the restrictive nature of playing Bond. “It kind of consumes your life, a role like that.”


In a 2023 interview, Egerton said it was his weight that put him off the task of Bond. “I've always struggled with my weight,” he said in an interview with The Telegraph. “[Bond] is a bit like being a brand ambassador as well as being an actor. And that could be really fun in microcosm, but I'm sure I read that Barbara Broccoli said that it's a 15-year commitment.”

	











	Rumors are still swirling about who'll be tapped to take over from Daniel Craig after Dune director Villeneuve was confirmed to helm the next era of the James Bond franchise.


	“I grew up watching James Bond films with my father,” the Canadian gushed in a statement after the news broke. “I'm a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he's sacred territory. I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come.”


The Hollywood Reporter recently took an in-depth look at the director's portfolio to decide whether he's the right man for the job.

The acclaimed artist and filmmaker will screen his new feature, 'In the Hand of Dante' out of competition in Venice. 


							By

Europe Bureau Chief


	American artist and director Julian Schnabel (At Eternity's Gate, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Basquiat) will be honored with the Cartier Glory to the Filmmaker Award at the 82nd Venice International Film Festival, Cartier and the Venice festival announced Wednesday. The annual prize recognizes a personality who has made an especially original contribution to contemporary cinema.


	Schnabel will be honored at an award ceremony on Wednesday, September 3, at the Sala Grande, ahead of the out-of-competition screening of his new film In the Hand of Dante.

	The crime drama follows a handwritten manuscript of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, which makes its way from the Vatican library to a mob boss in New York, who turns to writer and Dante expert Nick Tosches to verify its authenticity. Schnabel and Louise Kugelberg adapted the film from Tosches' novel. Oscar Issac, playing Tosches and Dante, leads an ensemble cast that includes Gal Gadot, Gerard Butler, Al Pacino, John Malkovich, Martin Scorsese, Jason Momoa, Louis Cancelmi, and Franco Nero. Produced by DreamCrew Entertainment, MeMo Films, TWIN Productions and Artofficial Productions, In the Hand of Dante is being sold internationally by WME Independent.

	“I first stepped foot in Venice in November of 1976,” said Schnabel, accepting the honor. “At the time, I went to Padua to see the Scrovegni Chapel of Giotto and to see the paintings in Venice. I never dreamed that I would become a filmmaker, let alone be honored with this award, and be included alongside so many filmmakers I admire, because in fact I am a painter. But I guess I am a filmmaker as well. I've now shown my films at the Venice Film Festival for almost 30 years, and to receive the Glory to the Filmmaker Award for the world premiere of my new film In the Hand of Dante means so much to me, as tracking Dante and Nick's trajectory in this film has somehow mirrored my own life. Thank you. I couldn't be happier about this.”

	











	Festival director Alberto Barbera praised Schnabel's originality and artistic vision: “Each of Julian Schnabel's films is a world of its own. None is like the one before or the one after. Yet, it is not a coincidence that most of them are portraits of artists and passionate depictions of the artistic process. As generous as it is wildly imaginative, Schnabel's cinematic output is a gift to film, articulated through a wholly original language. His new feature, In the Hand of Dante, is his most ambitious project to date. As Martin Scorsese said when asked to describe them, Schnabel's films are ‘abundant, overflowing and vibrating with life, pulse. There is always more in the frame to see, to experience, and to feel.'


	Born in New York City in 1951 and raised in Brownsville, Texas, Schnabel first achieved acclaim as a painter in New York during the late 1970s. He has exhibited at the Venice Biennale Art Exhibition five times (1980, 1982, 1993, 1997 and 2003). His directorial debut Basquiat, about the renowned New York street artist, premiered in competition at Venice in 1996. Follow up Before Night Falls (2000), starring Javier Bardem as Cuban poet and novelist, Reinaldo Arenas, won the Venice Grand Jury Prize. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, the story of Elle editor Jean-Dominique Bauby and the stroke that almost totally paralyzed him; won best director in Cannes in 2007 and picked up the Golden Globe for best foreign film. His 2018 feature At Eternity's Gate, starring Willem Dafoe as Vincent van Gogh, won Dafoe Venice's best actor honor.

Europe's writers, actors, musicians and producers accuse the EU of selling out creative industries in favor of GenAI giants and demand urgent reforms to safeguard IP rights.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	A broad coalition of groups representing European writers, performers, producers and publishers issued a joint statement on Wednesday, warning that Europe's AI Act is not properly protecting copyrights.


	In a joint statement, groups, including those representing European actors, writers, journalists, film producers, musicians, translators, and visual artists, took aim at the implementation of the act, which was passed last year and hailed as the world's first and most far-reaching government regulation of artificial intelligence technology.

	Under the act from Aug. 2 of this year, providers of general purpose AI models (GPAI), such as ChatGTP, Deep Seek, and Dall-E have to comply with European copyright law in their use of copyright-protected materials in training their AI systems and provide “fair and appropriate” remuneration for copyright owners.


	Rightholder groups were consulted throughout the drafting of the AI Act, but say now that the way the law is being implemented does not sufficiently protect artists and puts Europe's creative industries at risk.

	“The final outcomes fail to address the core concerns which our sectors – and the millions of creators and companies active in Europe which we represent – have consistently raised,” the coalition said in its statement. “The result is not a balanced compromise; it is a missed opportunity to provide meaningful protection of intellectual property rights.”

	











	Without effective protection, they argue, AI systems, which are already scraping copyright-protected material en masse to train their models, will be able to continue doing so, without proper consultation or compensation for the artists who created the original works.


	“Today, with the EU AI Act implementing package as it stands, thriving cultural and creative sectors and copyright intensive industries in Europe which contribute nearly 7 percent of EU GDP, provide employment for nearly 17 million professionals and have an economic contribution larger than European pharmaceutical, automobile or high-tech industries, are being sold out in favor of those GenAI model providers,” the coalition said in its statement.


	The coalition is asking for the European Commission to revisit its implementation of the AI Act to ensure the law ” lives up to its promise to safeguard European intellectual property rights in the age of generative AI.”


	The U.S. government, which just announced a massive trade deal with the European Union, has been sharply critical of the bloc's AI Act. At an AI summit in Paris in February, US Vice President JD Vance railed against what he called the “excessive regulation” of artificial intelligence by the EU, which he claimed was “tightening the screws” on US tech companies.

	Whether you like it or not, Donald Trump is a pop culture staple, declared Stephen Colbert during his Tuesday monologue on The Late Show. 


	When discussing a House Republican proposal to rename the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts after President Donald Trump, Colbert mockingly defended the bill by arguing, “Trump is a patron of the arts and a staple of the pop culture landscape.” 


	“I'm sorry, but it's true. Trump is a staple of pop culture,” Colbert reiterated, before adding: “Just last week, he was great on South Park. Amazing. So free and open with his body.”


	The host referenced last week's South Park premiere, which attacked the president's “teeny tiny” manhood and depicted him as literally in bed with the devil. The episode arrived after CBS‘ abrupt decision to end The Late Show in 2026. While the network claimed the cancellation was financial, it drew backlash, since the announcement came days after Colbert slammed Paramount, which owns both CBS and Comedy Central, over its decision to agree to a settlement with Trump.

	On Tuesday, Colbert segued the South Park mention to joke, “You know what they say about those who forget the past? They name stuff after Donald Trump.” The host proposed: “So let's just rip the band aid off and rename everything. The Washington Monument will become ‘My Big Pointy Penis,' and the Grand Canyon will become ‘Donald's Gaping Hole.'”


	While the Washington Monument and the Grand Canyon are safe for now, Republican Rep. Bob Onder of Missouri on July 23 presented the “Make Entertainment Great Again Act” that would re-designate the performing arts institution that was named in remembrance of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president who was assassinated in 1963. Onder's proposal arrived after Republicans on the Appropriations Committee approved an amendment in the annual spending bill to rename the Kennedy Center's Opera House to “First Lady Melania Trump Opera House.”

	Don Zimmerman, a film editor known for his work on the Rocky movies, Jumper, Night at the Museum and Men in Black 3, who also received an Oscar nomination for 1978's Coming Home, has died. He was 81.


	The public relations and marketing agency, Perception PR, announced his death on social media, writing, “Rest in Peace Don Zimmerman … He will be greatly missed.” 




	Having grown up in Los Angeles, Zimmerman made his way into the entertainment industry in the early 1970s, working in the editorial department for several projects, such as The Landlord, Harold and Maude, The Last of Sheila, The Nickel Ride, Shampoo and Bound for Glory.

The film, starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight, also earned Zimmerman his first Oscar nomination for best film editing.


	He later collaborated with Ashby again on his 1979 film Being There.


	Zimmerman's other credits included A Change of Seasons (1980), Barbarosa (1982), Best Friends (1982), Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Cobra (1986), The Prince of Tides (1991), Leap of Faith (1992), Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), The Nutty Professor (1996), Liar Liar (1997), Patch Adams (1998), The Cat in the Hat (2003), Flight of the Phoenix (2004), Night at the Museum (2006), Rush Hour 3 (2007), Jumper (2008), Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009), Marmaduke (2010), Men in Black 3 (2012) and RED 2 (2013).

Matthew McConaughey's acting debut clinched the capture of a fugitive murderer who had been on the run for 14 years.

Now one of Hollywood's biggest A-listers at 53, McConaughey was aged just 23 when he portrayed 1978 murder victim Larry Dickens, 26, in Unsolved Mysteries season five episode, Texas Most Wanted, which aired in December 1992.

The future Oscar-winner's portrayal of young father and Marine Dickens' coldblooded shooting by sadistic sex offender Edward Harold Bell moved so many viewers that Bell was apprehended just days after the episode aired.

In the resurfaced clip, a shirtless McConaughey was seen mowing a lawn before his panicked mother, played by Hell or High Water star Margaret Bowman, called the police about a sinister man outside his home who was exposing himself to children.

McConaughey showed off his dramatic acting chops as he confronted the pervert (played by Denver Mattson) took his car keys and lambasted him - before a gun was pulled on him.

He was seen being shot in front of his horrified mother - before staggering back into his garage with his attacker in pursuit.

Matthew McConaughey's acting debut in 1 992 episode of Unsolved Mysteries clinched the capture of a fugitive murderer who had been on the run for 14 years

Now one of Hollywood's biggest A-listers at 53, McConaughey was aged just 23 when he portrayed 1978 murder victim Larry Dickens, 26, in season five episode Texas Most Wanted which aired in December 1992

He was then shot again - with McConaughey's eyes rolling back as he fell to the ground in the arms - with his horrified mother trying in vain to save his life.

In 2023 documentary Unsolved Mysteries: Behind the Legacy, a producer praised the actor's scenes

They said: 'Matthew McConaughey had to do a fairly robust death scene. He was working in his garage and he was shot by a man who pulled up with a shotgun. Let's just say… his acting has come a long way since then.'

Bell was caught by police in Pasadena, Texas shortly after the shooting - but while on $125,000 bail, he absconded.

When he did not show up for his trial, he was designated as a wanted fugitive.

Bell fled to Mexico and Central America on a boat, using his dead cousin's identity. He was named Texas' most wanted fugitive in in 1985.

After McConaughey's Unsolved Mysteries episode aired, a man recognized Bell from a recent meeting in Panama City.

He was finally arrested on February 14, 1993 after a joint operation conducted by the FBI and the Panamanian National Police.

Bell - who is a suspected serial killer - spent 14 years on the run before his capture in 1993

Bell's attorney's bizarrely claimed the killing was done in self-defense but Bell was convicted and sentenced to 70 years in prison.

Bell later claimed he had 'quit being a flasher' in Panama and said he regretted not doing so before killing Dickens. 

McConaughey has spoken proudly of his turn on Unsolved Mysteries and how his appearance led to the capture of Bell 'just 11 days later.'

Bell is also considered a suspect in the murders of a series of young women near Galveston, Texas in the 1970s.

In 1998 he claimed in letters to prosecutors in Galveston and Harris counties that he had killed seven teenage girls between 1971 and 1977. 

He was sentenced to 70 years imprisonment for Dickens' murder and died in 2019

He was also suspected in four rape murders by Panamanian authorities. 

His allegations have never been proven and he was only convicted in Dickens' murder.

McConaughey's performance was also praised by Dickens' family.

Dickens' niece commented on the resurfaced clip: 'Matthew McConaughey first acting job was portraying my uncle. This was actually filmed at my grandmother's former home where it happened. She's been gone but it is nice to see her face and hear her voice despite the tearful reminder of this crime. 

'The man evaded police for over 20 yrs and thanks to Unsolved Mysteries, they found and extradited him back to the states. '

McConaughey's first lead role was in the 1996 film adaptation of the John Grisham novel A Time to Kill, and he's since gone on to win an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and various other accolades throughout his career - pictured 2014

In the early 1990s, McConaughey began working in television commercials and in 1992, he was cast as the boyfriend in the music video for Walkaway Joe, a song by Trisha Yearwood featuring Don Henley.

He  made his first big screen appearance in 1993 movie Dazed and Confused.

TikTok has removed a video by businesswoman and beauty influencer Huda Kattan in which she promoted conspiracy theories about Israel.

The Iraqi-American entrepreneur, who is founder and CEO of the popular Huda Beauty brand, said in a video posted on Sunday that Israel was responsible for "every world war" including World War One and World War Two, as well as the September 11 and 7 October attacks.

The American Jewish Committee said she was "using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories".

TikTok confirmed it removed the video on Tuesday for violating its community guidelines, but did not give further comment. Kattan and Huda Beauty have not responded to requests for comment.

The state of Israel was founded in 1948. World War One ended in 1918, and World War Two, during which millions of Jews were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust, ended in 1945.

In the video to her 1.7 million followers, Kattan claimed there was evidence that "Israel has been behind World War One, World War Two", as well as al-Qaeda's 11 September 2001 attacks on the US and the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

"I had a feeling, I was like, were they behind every world war? Yes. Behind September 11th? Absolutely," she said.

Kattan repeated a range of other claims including unfounded accusations that Israel protects paedophiles.

"These dangerous and historically baseless accusations echo some of the oldest and most pernicious antisemitic tropes," the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement.

A spokesperson for the group, which aims to counter antisemitism, told the BBC: "Having such a big platform for your business and choosing to use it to spread antisemitic conspiracy theories is inflammatory, irresponsible and dangerous."

In a statement to BBC News, the American Jewish Committee said: "This isn't 'criticism of Israel'. It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions.

"A beauty company spreading this ugliness isn't just ironic - it's dangerous. We cannot and will not stay silent while anti-Jewish hatred is normalized. Words have real-life consequences. This rhetoric must be called out, exposed, and condemned."

Kattan was named on the BBC 100 Women list in 2023 and was ranked 15th on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest online creators that year.

TikTok's community guidelines prohibit hate speech or promotion of hateful ideologies, as well misinformation that may cause significant harm, including conspiracy theories.

Supernatural is returning with a new series, but it may not be what fans of the horror show expected. Over the course of its impressive 15-season run, Supernatural became a beloved series. It followed the exploits of Sam and Dean Winchester as they battled various forces of evil, like demons, vampires, and even angels, offering regular doses of humor and emotional depth.

The series expanded into various other forms of media, including comics, books, and even an anime series. Supernatural has even tried their hand at different spinoff ideas to keep the longevity of the IP going, with mostly lackluster results. However, the fan-favorite show is returning with new stories, but it may not be what fans of Supernatural were hoping to get for the next iteration of Sam and Dean.

This Supernatural actor's "Devilish" charm is sure to make him a fantastic choice for The Dark Tower's Man in Black!

Several spinoffs of Supernatural were attempted, with some ideas pursued while the show was still airing. Wayward Sisters was an attempt at a spinoff in the show's thirteenth season, with an episode of Supernatural acting as a backdoor pilot for the idea that would have seen recurring character Sheriff Jody Mills leading her own series of female protagonists. However, the CW passed on the show, much like a similar setup the show attempted in season 9 with Supernatural: Bloodlines, which would have been a gangster crime drama where various monsters headed the families of Chicago's crime scene.

The Winchesters was a spinoff that followed the finale of Supernatural but acted as a prequel, telling the story of John and Mary, Sam and Dean's parents. The show only lasted a single season, failing to recapture the magic of its source material. However, with a fanbase as loyal as Supernatural's, the characters are likely to continue on in a new form or spinoff. There have been rumors of a revival series, which remains to be officially confirmed, but for now, there is a new Supernatural series on the way that could satiate fans.

Supernatural is set to tell new stories set during the show's run in a new comic book series. The horror series has graced the pages of comics before, with the new books offering a unique angle for fans. Thanks to WB and Dynamite Entertainment (via SuperHeroHype), the series will be making the distinct choice to focus on stories set between seasons 1 and 2 of the long-running show. Given the comics' place in the Supernatural timeline, other characters that could prove essential to the comics beyond Sam and Dean would likely be John Winchester, Meg, and Azazel, all of whom played a role in the events of the season 1 finale.

The new Supernatural comic will debut in October. It is written by lauded author Greg Pak and artist Eder Messias. Pak is known for his work on Planet Hulk, World War Hulk, and Star Wars: Darth Vader, and Messias has worked on Spider-Man, Moon Knight, and Predator. The two creators have also worked together previously on Captain America. Pak stated, "Fans of Supernatural know the show is a blast, and it's an enormous pleasure and privilege to be able to dig into this wild world." The author also promised fans of the show:

We're going for fun and grounded, and then we're going to absolutely cut loose when the time comes.

While The Winchesters didn't last, and other spinoffs failed to get off the ground, fans of Supernatural continue to rewatch the series, keeping its legacy alive. There is even a fan-made video game based on the series called Unnatural that is currently being developed. When a show lasts as long as Supernatural, it endures for a reason, and Sam and Dean have repeatedly proven to be that magic. Even when fans enjoy forays in new directions, the brotherly relationship at the center of the shows seems to be what made it work as well as it did. While other attempts at spinoff shows feel likely, fans would love a revival series to bring their beloved characters back for more episodes.

Rumors of a revival series have been hinted at, with the stars of Supernatural, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, reportedly both on the same page about things. Even Castiel actor Misha Collins has expressed similar sentiments about the possible revival. During the recent 20th anniversary interviews (via Tech Advisor), the three were in attendance, and Padalecki stated:

We're all a lot older than we were 20 years ago. I don't know if I have 22 episodes of Supernatural in me. I think a limited series would be great.

The actors have found post-Supernatural success, with Ackles on The Boys, where Padalecki and Collins are set to join him, thanks to the superhero series having the same creator. Padalecki also succeeded with Walker, and Ackles has even voiced Batman several times for DC in recent years. While the actors have kept busy, they remain close and appear to love the series as much as the fans, making the possibility of a revival possible at any point. While an official revival series remains to be seen, Supernatural fans have a run of comics to help flesh out their beloved horror world even more.

Jimmy Hoffa's body has never been found, and more than one person has confessed to his murder

 Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in 1975 is one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in American history, and authorities say it's unlikely that any definitive answers will emerge nearly five decades later.


 Hoffa was a celebrity and controversial figure during his time as a union leader, attracting ire from the Kennedys and the Mafia alike.


 The mystery surrounding the vanishing of the Teamsters president inspired several movies and TV shows, including Martin Scorsese's 2019 film The Irishman (in which Al Pacino starred as Hoffa), Danny DeVito's 1992 directorial debut Hoffa, starring Jack Nicholson in the title role and the 1983 miniseries Blood Feud starring Robert Blake.


 While the truth of what really happened to Hoffa when he disappeared remains unknown, authorities and even some mobsters have several theories — and some alleged confessions.


 So what happened to Jimmy Hoffa? Here's what we know about the missing persons case, and why it's not likely to ever be solved.


Bettmann/Getty

 Hoffa was born James Riddle Hoffa in Brazil, Ind., on Feb. 14, 1913. His father died in 1921, leading his mother to relocate their family to Detroit in 1924. Hoffa reportedly understood his father's death was linked to his working conditions in coal mines, which sparked a lifelong passion for workers' rights, according to Teamster.


 The future union president left school when he was 14 to work in warehouses for Kroger grocery stores to help support his family. In 1932, at just 19 years old, Hoffa organized his first strike to successfully protest poor working conditions.


 The move led to him joining the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union in 1933, first as a local agent in Detroit, then rising up the ranks to become general president of the entire organization in 1957.


 The Teamsters represented almost all commercial trucking in the U.S.


 In addition to being an activist for organized labor, Hoffa also supported racial justice and civil rights leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and prohibited segregation within any area of the Teamsters. Later in life, The New York Times reported, he also became an advocate for prison reform.


Bettmann/Getty

 Hoffa infamously clashed with Robert F. Kennedy, who was an attorney for the Senate's Improper Activities in Labor and Management panel (also called the McClellan Committee), which investigated racketeering.


 When Hoffa was elected president of the Teamsters in 1957, Kennedy began investigating him for impropriety, per The Daily Beast, allegedly using a mole within the union to gather intelligence on Hoffa.


 In March 1957, police arrested the union leader for allegedly trying to pay a McClellan Committee aide for information, The New York Times reported. Hoffa was acquitted of the charges, but his and Kennedy's feud — and Hoffa's legal troubles — continued for years.


 When Kennedy's older brother, John F. Kennedy, ran for president, Hoffa unsuccessfully campaigned for his opponent, Richard Nixon. After taking office, JFK appointed Robert to attorney general, and he focused his attention on Hoffa once more with a "Get Hoffa" squad dedicated to investigating the Teamsters president.

 On March 4, 1964, Hoffa was convicted of two counts of jury tampering in a previous 1962 Nashville, Tenn., criminal trial and acquitted on a third, according to The New York Times.


 Hoffa and his associates offered $5,000 each to a juror and and his son, $10,000 to another prospective juror and a promotion to a third juror, per TIME.


 In a separate case that July, Hoffa was convicted on three counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy for misusing nearly $2 million from Teamsters' pension funds.

 In the Nashville jury tampering case, Hoffa was sentenced to eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine, per The New York Times. For the fraud case, Hoffa was sentenced to five years in prison, for a total of 13 years.


 Hoffa appealed his convictions all the way to the Supreme Court but failed to overturn them. He turned himself in to prison in March 1967 in Lewisburg, Penn., and resigned as Teamsters president.


 While his appeals didn't work, Hoffa still got out of prison early: He served four years, nine months and 16 days before then-President Nixon commuted his sentence on Dec. 23, 1971.


 Hoffa went free under a conditional commutation that specified he couldn't "engage in the direct or indirect management of any labor organization," The New York Times reported, until March 1980 — which is when his full 13-year sentence would have ended.

 Hoffa was last seen on July 30, 1975, and to this day, what truly happened to him remains a mystery, but the prevailing theory is that Hoffa was murdered in a mob hit, which authorities outlined in "The Hoffex Memo."


 Hoffa served his time in prison alongside Anthony "Tony Pro" Provenzano, a member of the Genovese crime family and the president of the Teamsters' Union City, N.J., chapter, and reportedly disrespected him, former FBI organized crime investigator Joe Brennan told ABC 7 Chicago.


 Upon Hoffa's release, he reportedly eyed a return to power in the Teamsters despite the conditions of his commutation from Nixon.


 "Information we got was that the mob was concerned that his re-entry was going to create investigative interest in union activities which could cause problems" for the mob, Brennan explained.


 The day Hoffa, who was 62 at the time, went missing, he was scheduled to meet Provenzano and Detroit Mafia boss Anthony Giacalone at 2 p.m. at the upscale Machus Red Fox Restaurant in Bloomfield Township, Mich. Hoffa called his wife at about 2:15 p.m. to tell her he'd been stood up and would be home by 4 p.m., but never made it.


 Brennan has said he believes that Hoffa was abducted from his car in the restaurant parking lot and killed. His body has never been recovered, and theories about where it ended up vary: Brennan says it was stuffed in an oil drum and driven to New Jersey to show Provenzano, then either buried under the Meadowlands or thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.


 The only evidence ever seized in the case was a burgundy 1975 Mercury Marquis, which belonged to Giacalone's son. A strand of Hoffa's hair was found in the vehicle, though DNA only revealed the match in 2001, ABC News reported. Police dogs also reportedly found Hoffa's scent in the rear passenger seat of the vehicle.


 Other theories place Hoffa's body at various sites in Michigan, Jersey City, the Florida Everglades and Gardena, Calif., but his remains have still never been recovered. He was declared dead in 1982, but his case is still open.


 No charges have ever been filed in relation to his disappearance, but some believe mobster Salvatore "Sally Bugs" Briguglio was the killer. However, others have confessed to the murder, including hitmen Frank Sheeran (who inspired The Irishman) and Richard "The Iceman" Kuklinski.
