                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two weeks after completing her Wimbledon breakthrough, Iga Swiatek dropped just four games in her return to action, extending her run of form in a second-round win over Guo Hanyu. After Iga Swiatek swept to the Wimbledon title, she admitted the breakthrough was so far-fetched she never even dreamed of it happening. “Because it seemed so far away,” Swiatek said afterward. Now that she's checked that elusive box, this question looms: Is there anything she can't do? The most recent confirmation that Swiatek is again in the midst of a dangerous groove came Wednesday afternoon in Montreal when she defeated qualifier Guo Hanyu 6-3, 6-1 in a second-round match at the Omnium Banque Nationale. Let the record show that when she won the opening four games, Swiatek ran her staggering total of consecutive games to 24. And then threw down a perfect 6-0, 6-0 against Amanda Anisimova in the final. So, to review, when Guo broke her serve in the fifth game, Swiatek lost her first game in 20 days -- which, of course, included a seaside vacation. 27 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Eva Lys on Friday. Guo, a 27-year-old from China, is a formidable doubles player, with two titles this year (Bad Homburg and Adelaide) with partner Alexandra Panova. Her 6-3, 6-3 first-round win over Yulia Putintseva was Guo's first-career main-draw win at the WTA level. She was, predictably, no match for Swiatek. Swiatek's career record against players ranked outside the Top 200 is now 21-1. But the Wimbledon result suggested that Swiatek -- after a difficult year when she changed coaches and served a brief suspension -- is ready to challenge her again. At Wimbledon, Swiatek made a conscious effort to be more aggressive, pumping up her serve, taking more risks and flattening out her groundstrokes. Will that trend continue on hard courts? She lost there to eventual champion Jessica Pegula. Based on recent returns, that might be about to change. Two weeks after completing her Wimbledon breakthrough, Iga Swiatek dropped just four games in her return to action, extending her run of form in a second-round win over Guo Hanyu.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek has just won her first match since Wimbledon and she did it in routine fashion after ousting Guo Hanyu 6-3 6-1 in just over an hour of play. After winning her maiden Wimbledon title, the Polish tennis superstar made a lightning start to her Montreal opener, breaking the 259th-ranked qualifier twice in a row to open a 4-0 lead. But once again, she remained unfazed - won the next five games - to complete her win in straight sets. In her pre-tournament Montreal presser, Swiatek admitted that it wasn't easy to get back to work after achieving her dream. But, she still remained true to herself and did her best to be as ready as possible for the summer on hard courts. It requires mental strength and a lot of consistency. You always have to be ready for every tournament, both physically and mentally. Winning Wimbledon was a dream come true. I'm really looking forward to playing the tournament," Swiatek said after arriving in Montreal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton produced another dominant serving display on Wednesday in his opening match at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, where he brushed aside Adrian Mannarino 6-2, 6-3 to reach the third round in Toronto. The fourth-seeded American won 90 per cent (28/31) of his first-serve points and saved both break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to capture his first win against the Frenchman in the pair's third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. "I have played good matches against him but come up short," said Shelton, who previously lost to Mannarino at the Australian Open (2024) and in Miami (2023). "Usually with him a big serve doesn't always work, because his hands are so good and he stands up on the baseline. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has now won eight of his past 10 matches. "It got a little dicey in that last game but I am happy with the way I stay composed at the end and served it out down break point at the end," Shelton added. A semi-finalist in Washington last week, Shelton will next meet 25th seed Brandon Nakashima or Ethan Quinn. Shelton is seeking his first Masters 1000 title this fortnight in Toronto and is currently ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, aiming to make his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals this year. Earlier, Andrey Rublev moved past Hugo Gaston 6-2, 6-3 to record his 250th victory on hard courts. The 27-year-old, who earned his first tour-level hard-court win in Delray Beach in 2015, finished with a 19-17 winners-to-unforced errors count against Gaston to reach the third round. "It is natural against those kinds of players to have your rhythm broken. So it is important to step in and take time away from them, because all of that is natural for them." Chasing his second trophy of the season, the Doha titlist will next meet 28th seed Lorenzo Sonego or China's Buyunchaokete. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has now won eight of his past 10 matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Third-round action gets underway on day five at ATP Toronto on what promises to be an entertaining day of tennis in Ontario. As ever, we here at LWOT will be offering our predictions for every match on the slate, including Daniil Medvedev vs Alexei Popyrin. But who will book their place in the last 16? Learner Tien got a big win in the second round against Denis Shapovalov as his impressive Canadian Open debut continues. He was rock solid thorugh and forced Shapovalov to go for broke, resulting in the Canadian making a few too many errors in a tight two-set challenge. Reilly Opelka will be a completely different challenge, with the older of the two American's out for revenge after losing to Tien in Rome. Opelka will have a better chance against Tien on the fast, bouncy courts in Canada but Tien is also more at home on a North Americann hard court and he will also like his chances every time he gets into rallies. Tomas Martin Etcheverry, meanwhile, played a fabulous match to knock out Tallon Griekspoor in the second round. Etcheverry served brilliantly and made very few errors in one of his best hard-court performances this season. He defeated James Duckworth in straight sets and won 90% of his first serve points. However, he will need to improve his first serve percentage against Alex Michelsen, who is a solid returner and will look to pounce on Musetti's second serves. Expect a close match but for the higher-ranked man to come out on top. He lost just three points behind his first serve but made more errors than usual and will look to rectify that against Matteo Arnaldi, who pushed Zverev in their only previous meeting. Arnaldi is a great mover and can hit winners from anywhere when needed. Since then he has been hooked and spends countless hours watching tennis. Ateet loves to write about things he like and tennis is right at the top on that list.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton and Alex de Minaur have both enjoyed successful 2025 campaigns on the ATP Tour. Both players are set to compete at this week's Canadian Open in Toronto. Shelton faces Adrian Mannarino in his first match while de Minaur will compete against Francisco Comesana. However, two superstars have emerged in the form of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, meaning lower-ranked players will likely have to defeat both players to win a Grand Slam. These two top-10 ranked players also hold an unwanted record which spans the 2025 season. This is a record that must change if they hope to win the US Open in August. Neither Ben Shelton nor Alex de Minaur has beaten a top-10 ATP player in 2025. Shelton first lost to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open quarter-finals. Alex de Minaur has also struggled against top-10 opponents, despite recently winning the Washington Open. His woes continued at the Barcelona Open, where he lost to Alcaraz again, before being defeated by Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon quarter-finals. These two top-10 ranked players simply must improve their record against top-10 players if they are to have any chance of winning the US Open. Very rarely does a draw open up to benefit lower-ranked players, especially when the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are fit and healthy. The last time this happened at a Grand Slam was in 2014, when 14th seed Marin Cilic defeated 10th seed Kei Nishikori to win the US Open title. This match saw the lowest set of seeds contest a US Open final since 2002. Ben Shelton and Alex de Minaur have had contrasting success in terms of tournament victories on the ATP Tour. De Minaur is the proud owner of 10, while Shelton has only won two titles; less than the three Luciano Darderi has won. However, Shelton is the obvious choice in this matter. While de Minaur has demonstrated more consistency over the course of a season, Shelton has regularly performed well on the biggest stages. De Minaur has never reached the semi-final stage of a Grand Slam, despite numerous quarter-final appearances. Shelton, on the other hand, has a booming forehand and monstrous serve; both of which can be used to trouble higher-ranked opponents at the US Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shriver, who was Donna Vekic's coach until recently, is also a former doubles world number one and won a combined 22 Grand Slam titles in her career. There is often a debate about the differences between men's and women's tennis, and what can be done for both tours to be treated equally. Now, Shriver has revealed her wish for the WTA Tour that she believes would make it ‘so much better'. “And now she is here at 22 years old, kind of step by step getting better in her game figuring out how to, talking about someone who needs to figure out how to stay healthy it's Raducanu,” said Shriver. “I know a lot of people question all the turnover in her coaching team, but as you know she's healthy and clear in her head how she wants to construct points, you know she can lean on a lot of different voices and seems to be able to do pretty well. “But, we need these past major winners that should still be in their prime to be able to be a part of the conversation and then can you imagine what we would have on the women's side, so that's my hope for women's tennis is that does happen.” This has been a familiar feeling for the Canadian, who has dealt with many different injury struggles and is currently ranked down at world number 187. The Briton has dealt with many injury struggles of her own since then and underwent surgeries to both of her wrists and left ankle in 2023. Raducanu has been unable to surpass the fourth round of a major tournament since then, with Shriver now giving her verdict on if she can add to her major tally. “Well listen, if you can come out of qualifying and win ten straight matches in straight sets, I'm not going to say she can't do it again,” said Shriver. “Obviously in the last say three and a half years, four years she's kind of fallen back into kind of like a solid player with some good results during the year. “But if you just took her resume, take that US Open out, that one tournament out, you would probably say no she's not going to win one. She might have some quarterfinals, semifinals, but when you know that somebody's had the mindset to do it once you always think sure, they can do it again.” Ironically since Raducanu won the US Open in 2021, it has actually been the only Grand Slam tournament where she has failed to win a single match. In 2025, Raducanu has only lost to Aryna Sabalenka and Swiatek at Grand Slam tournaments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former world No 14 Jerzy Janowicz has offered a harsh assessment of Iga Swiatek's Wimbledon title run as he claimed his fellow Pole “didn't have a single test.” An imperious Swiatek dropped just a single set en route to claiming her maiden Wimbledon crown and sixth Grand Slam title overall. “She played against girls who were much weaker at tennis, she didn't really play against any girls who could give her trouble on grass. Iga Swiatek says losing the No.1 title was ‘freeing' despite ‘not fair' admission Iga Swiatek opens up on failed doping test, branding it a ‘terrible' and ‘confusing' experience One thing we know for sure is that Iga passed the open bracket test perfectly.” “It's hard for me to predict things from my own eyes, because I don't follow every single match,” Janowicz added. “I'd say that even this victory won't solve Iga's typical problems, because Iga usually has problems — let's even call them mental — when there's resistance from the other side. “If her opponent offers no resistance and everything goes according to plan, as Iga hopes, then her facial expression or demeanour don't indicate any problems. “Problems arise when plan A doesn't quite work out as she'd like, because there's resistance from the other side, and that's when these problems arise. After 75 weeks at the top, Iga Swiatek lost her No.1 spot to Aryna Sabalenka following a surprise US Open defeat. “When everything came out [publicly], I was basically crying for two weeks, couldn't practice." Iga Swiatek has lauded Carlos Alcaraz's approach to the sport. Jessica Pegula has a lot of points to defend in Canada, but Iga Swiatek will start with a clean slate while Emma Raducanu's points situation is slightly complicated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek has told Wimbledon chiefs they “did it wrong” after revealing during this summer's Grand Slam event that she likes to eat a strawberry and pasta dish. Swiatek has traditionally struggled on grass and hadn't progressed beyond the Wimbledon quarter-finals ahead of this year's edition of the tournament. But she produced a fine run of form to ease to the title after a string of her rivals were knocked out early on. And following her third-round victory over Danielle Collins, she told the Wimbledon crowd about her favourite meal during an on-court interview with Annabel Croft. Many tennis fans had never heard of the dish, which is known as Makaron z truskawkami in Poland, and her comments went viral as a host of people gave their verdict on the meal. Roddick began: “I was sitting in the Royal Box at Wimbledon and I had the pleasure of watching you play that day. “In that interview - and I know you've talked about this a couple of times - I just need some more information about this pasta and strawberries thing. So congrats on winning Wimbledon and also making this food choice mainstream.” Read more:  Coco Gauff hits new low as tennis star nearly breaks 14-year record in gutsy win Read more:  Grand Slam finalist slams Canadian Open bosses for how they spoke to her dad Read more:  Tennis star who screamed and cried on court pulls out of tournament And Swiatek replied: “It got kind of crazy, I don't know how that happened. She then added: “If anyone watched that Wimbledon video, when they tried it, that's not the proper way to make it, sorry Wimbledon. “Basically you've got to smash the strawberries so they're all kind of juicy. “You don't smash the pasta, come on, that would be too much.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the time of that streak, Tsitsipas was ranked No. 8 and looked like he was on the cusp of a resurgent season. Instead, the 26-year-old won nine of his next 17 matches and is now in danger of losing his seeded status for the US Open. Tsitsipas' off-court dramatics always follow him around, and things are quite noisy right now. Not only is Tsitsipas' high-profile romance with WTA star Paula Badosa over, he also abruptly split with his coach, Goran Ivanisevic, before the North American hard-court swing. Perhaps this is the kind of jolt Tsitsipas needs to close out the year strong, but it's hard not to get worried when there's seemingly always something going on in his camp. O'Connell had a very disappointing campaign on the grass, but he's never seemed comfortable on the surface and should be buoyant after a dominant win over Chun Hsin Tseng in Round 1 in Canada. Tsitsipas could make quick work of O'Connell, but it's more likely that this match has plenty of twists and turns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Danish tennis star Holger Rune found himself on the wrong end of a slightly embarrassing but nonetheless harmful and funny story, as Russian WTA player Veronika Kudermetova revealed that the ATP talent tried sliding into her DMs on Instagram, only to be turned away by the fact that Kudermetova is happily married. Speaking on former Russian player Elena Vesnina's podcast, 2025 Wimbledon women's doubles champion Kudermetova revealed that the Danish top 10 player is one player who approached her, but she had to let him down with grace, on the counts of having a partner and also being six years older than the men's star. If you looked at my Instagram, you'd see I have a husband,'” revealed Kudermetova, who is currently ranked 42nd on the WTA tour, but has formerly been in the top 10. She is currently ranked fifth on the WTA tour in doubles after lifting the Wimbledon title alongside Elise Mertens, the first major title of her career. After that, he stopped saying hi to me,” revealed the Russian, who is currently participating in the National Bank Open in Montreal and is set to play Coco Gauff in the third round of that event. Rune, meanwhile, came through a tricky second round contest against big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi-Perricard in the men's tournament taking place in Toronto. Kudermetova is married to her long-time coach Sergei Demekhine, who has been part of her coaching staff since she was a teenager coming through the ranks in Russia. While she has had a solid singles career, she has had more success on the doubles court, including a statement win at Wimbledon this year. Rune, meanwhile, is looking for more consistency to try and make that big step up from being a contender to being a serious champion on the men's tour. After a breakthrough in 2022-23, Rune dropped out of the top 10, but marked his return earlier in 2025.</p>

Gauff hadn't played since losing in the first round at Wimbledon and appeared to have made a change to her serving grip during her time away. She struggled with it during the match, hitting some serves that were well long and others that were soft and easily pounced on by the powerful Collins. "It was a frustrating match for me," Gauff said. The serve was even more erratic Tuesday, though Gauff did hit a good one to end the match with an ace. Gauff will face Veronika Kudermetova in the third round and said she had plenty left after the match that lasted two hours, 55 minutes, adding she could possibly cut that in half if she cleaned up her serve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Venus Williams will continue her professional tennis comeback at the US Open. The seven-time singles grand slam champion received a wild-card entry for the mixed doubles event alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka, the U.S. Tennis Association association announced Tuesday. Williams, 45, returned to the WTA Tour last week at the D.C. Open after more than a year away, defeating Peyton Stearns 6-3, 6-4 in the round of 32 to become the oldest woman to win a WTA Tour-level match since Martina Navratilova in 2004. Williams lost to Magdalena Frech 6-2, 6-2 in the round of 16. She also won a doubles match alongside Hailey Baptiste at the event. Opelka, 27, stands 6-foot-11 and has a massive serve. The effort seems to have worked. Also in the mixed doubles field are men's world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, who have combined to win all three singles slam titles this year. American men's standouts Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton are also in the field. The highest-ranked woman participating in mixed doubles is No. Williams still could request -- and potentially receive -- a wild-card entry for the singles event.
