                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live as the National Transportation Safety Board begins three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January. Investigators probing the January midair collision of a passenger plane and an Army helicopter over Washington that killed 67 people found the chopper was flying higher than it should have been and its altitude readings were inaccurate. The details came out of the first day of National Transportation Safety Board hearings in Washington, where investigators aim to uncover insights into what caused the crash between the American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, and the Black Hawk helicopter over Ronald Reagan National Airport. The board's final report won't be released until sometime next year, but it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying this route near the airport. The January nighttime incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn't exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings. Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn't find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them. She said as long as an altimeter registers an altitude within 70 feet of the published altitude before takeoff the altimeter is considered accurate under the checklists. Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk's altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet. The greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such small separation distances between helicopters and planes when planes are landing. “The fact that we have less than 500 foot separation is a concern for me,” the Army's Scott Rosengren said. But Rosengren said that “if he was king for a day” he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in this crash and replace them with newer versions of the helicopters. Citing the numbers for runways, Van Vetchen said that “100% of the time when I was on route four and 33/15 was active” he would be instructed to hold until after the plane landed or took off from that runway. During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft, according to the NTSB's History of Flight Performance Study. The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash. “All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,” the report stated. “This resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.” Officials on Wednesday also raised the use of night vision goggles, which limit the wearer's field of view, on the helicopter as a factor. Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capitol with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, introduced legislation Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes. The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes. Associated Press writers Leah Askarinam, Ben Finley and Rio Yamat contributed to this story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The fight over Trump's most unqualified prosecutor is escalating quickly. On Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump called for Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to eliminate what Trump called the “‘Blue Slip' SCAM,” a Senate tradition that gives home-state senators a veto power over some presidential nominees who wield power entirely within the senator's state. The blue slip is an informal Senate tradition, named after the blue pieces of paper that senators use to indicate whether they approve of a judicial or US attorney nominee for their own state. The practical effect of a senator's decision to oppose such a nominee varies wildly depending on who serves as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But, in recent years, senators of both parties have used the blue slip process to veto people nominated to serve as top federal prosecutors and as district judges, the lowest rank of federal judge who receives a lifetime appointment. Trump's call to eliminate blue slips comes just one week after the temporary appointment of Alina Habba, one of Trump's former personal lawyers, as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey expired. Habba's appointment expired last week, and New Jersey's federal judges picked Desiree Leigh Grace, a career prosecutor, to replace her. Bondi then claimed that Grace “has just been removed.” So it is unclear who, if anyone, currently serves as US Attorney for the District of New Jersey. She brought charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and US Rep. LaMonica McIver relating to the two Democrats' protest of an immigration detention facility in New Jersey. The charges against McIver are still pending, despite a federal law that permits sitting members of Congress to enter federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight duties. Habba also opened federal investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, and its Democratic attorney general, Matt Platkin, over a directive limiting state law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration officials. Under a line of Supreme Court decisions stretching back to New York v. United States (1992), the federal government may not compel state police to participate in federal law enforcement. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats from New Jersey. Booker and Kim, in other words, used their blue slips to block the appointment of Habba. In his post denouncing the blue slip, Trump complained that the Senate tradition currently prevents him from installing his choices for judicial and prosecutorial jobs in the blue states of “California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Virginia, and other places.” Given Habba's conduct in office during her brief tenure as US attorney, it is likely that Trump would install loyalists as prosecutors who would target Democrats within those states. Imagine judges like Aileen Cannon, the Trump judge who sabotaged the Justice Department's attempt to prosecute Trump for stealing classified documents, hearing political trials in every blue state. Right now, Trump cannot install loyalist prosecutors in blue states for more than 120 days. And he will have a tougher time installing loyalist district judges. For most of the Obama presidency, for example, then-Senate Judiciary Chair Patrick Leahy (D-VT) didn't just give home-state senators a veto over district judges and US attorneys. Republican senators wielded the power Leahy gave them with brutal effectiveness. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which oversees federal suits out of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, is currently dominated by MAGA judges known for extravagantly reasoned decisions declaring entire federal agencies unconstitutional or permitting red states to seize control of social media platforms — among other things. A major reason why the Fifth Circuit is such a MAGA stronghold is that, under Leahy, Republican senators from Fifth Circuit states could veto anyone President Barack Obama nominated to serve on this court. Similarly, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) exploited Leahy's expansive blue slip rule to hold a seat on the Seventh Circuit open for most of the Obama presidency. Since then, home-state senators have been allowed to veto district court and US attorney nominees, but not appellate judges. There is some logic to this more limited blue slip process. Why should the senator from Wisconsin get to decide who interprets federal law in Illinois — or, at least, why should Johnson's vote count more than any other senator's? But the jurisdiction of district judges and US attorneys is limited to a single state. Some states, like New Jersey, are their own federal judicial district. The current blue slip practice, in other words, permits senators — who are the elected officials chosen to represent an entire state's interests in the federal government — to block nominees who would wield power entirely within their own states. Officials who wield power in multiple states are evaluated by the Senate as a whole. If Trump gets his way, however, he may not just gain the ability to override home-state senators' vetoes — he may also get to install prosecutors who will bring fabricated charges against those same senators. The agency plans to reverse its own legal justification for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. A Vox reporter explains what's going on with the GOP's early redistricting plans.

President Trump takes part in a bill signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room, enacting new legislation designed to help veterans access federal mortgage support. President Donald Trump signed the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act into law Wednesday, cementing a partial claims program aimed at preventing veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The new partial claims program under the Department of Veterans' Affairs' (VA) Home Loan Program will allow veterans who are late on mortgage payments to tack on those payments to the tail end of their loans. But the VASP program faced scrutiny from Republicans, who decried that it was established without input from Congress and claimed it jeopardized the entire VA home loan guarantee program and would be costly for taxpayers. Altogether, the VA estimated that it purchased more than 17,000 home loans totaling more than $5.48 billion dollars under VASP. "This bipartisan and bicameral legislation will assist veterans who are facing financial hardships and provide VA with a tool to better help veterans stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure. The VA Home Loan Program provides one of the best benefits VA has to offer, and has helped veterans and their families build home equity since its inception in 1944," House and Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs leaders said in a joint statement on July 16.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Improving conditions: Tsunami warnings for the US coastline and Japan have been downgraded to advisories after a massive earthquake off Russia's far eastern coast put the region on high alert. • Waves persist: A National Weather Service official urged people in the affected areas to stay cautious over the next 24 hours, as waves remain “pretty stubbornly persistent.” The tsunami's first waves hit Russia and Japan, where nearly 2 million people were evacuated, and waves overnight reached US shores — including parts of Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. There were no casualties in Russia, the Kremlin said. Around 125 aftershocks of magnitude 4.4 or greater have occurred near Russia in the more than 16 hours since massive 8.8 earthquake struck off the coast, according to data from the US Geological Survey. Of those, three have been magnitude 6.0 or greater, with the strongest being a 6.9 that occurred about 45 minutes after the mainshock. Strong aftershocks continue to rock the region, with a 6.4 magnitude aftershock striking around 200 miles southwest of yesterday's main quake's epicenter just before 11 a.m. Aftershocks are generally strongest and most numerous in the hours to days after the main earthquake, decreasing in number and intensity as time goes on. Here's what to expect after a major earthquake, on average: “In turn, the anesthesiologist also secured the equipment that was nearby, because without an anesthesia machine you can't go anywhere. This post has been updated to include the quotes from Gvozdeva. Beaches in Los Angeles County have reopened after tsunami advisories for the West Coast were lifted, the county  said. “While the beaches are open, visitors should check with the nearest lifeguard for information on current conditions and practice good judgment before entering the water,” Los Angeles County said in a statement. Beach camp operators should also check with lifeguards before any in-water activity, the statement said. Chilean authorities said evacuations are underway along parts of the country's coast due to the threat of a tsunami after the large earthquake off Russia's far eastern coast overnight. In social media posts on Wednesday, Chile's national disaster response agency SENAPRED said evacuations had begun along the coasts of seven regions in northern Chile: Arica and Parinacota, Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Atacama, Coquimbo, Valparaíso, and O'Higgins. Videos from social media geolocated by CNN show shrill sirens echoing among the port city of Iquique's waterfront high-rises. After each round of sirens, an automated voice says “emergency” in Spanish. “During the evacuation, do not forget to consider your pet and its needs.” SENAPRED has put the country's entire coast, including its sparsely populated Antarctic Territory, under a “red alert” according to the agency's website. French President Emmanuel Macron called for “vigilance” in French Polynesia and said that all the services of the state have been mobilized in the semi-autonomous territory to “protect our fellow citizens.” “I call for vigilance: follow the instructions of local authorities,” Macron posted on X. It spans across more than 5.3 million square kilometers of the south Pacific Ocean. A surge of water several feet high caused a deck to break off in the Crescent City Harbor District, Harbormaster Mike Rademaker said. “We didn't have any injuries, fortunately, but we did sustain some damage in the Inner Boat Basin,” Rademaker said Wednesday. “At approximately 2:40 a.m., we noticed there was a surge of water several feet in height that caused the decking of H dock to lift along its pilings. Crescent City, in the northwest corner of California, has a long history of tsunami damage due to its geography and crescent-shaped beach. National Weather Service lead meteorologist Matthew Kidwell advised caution for the next 24 hours, noting that while waves are subsiding, Crescent City residents are “not out of woods.” “The waves are slowly diminishing, but they're pretty stubbornly persistent in Crescent City. So, most likely in the next, at some point this morning the tsunami warning will be downgraded to an advisory that still doesn't mean you're out of the woods,” Kidwell said. I would expect through a lot of the day, you'll need to be especially cautious of the ocean.” Kidwell added residents should remain cautious into the evening hours. Tsunami advisories are still in effect for other parts of California as well as portions of Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii as the threat of smaller tsunami waves persists. “It was a long night for all of us,” said Eric Wier, the city manager of Crescent City. We're still dealing with those now, but it did stay within the banks of Elk Creek.” “We still continue to coordinate with the Office of Emergency Services, they are on stand by. Obviously, as we said last night, this is not a one issue, a one wave incident, that we do expect to see is continued activity for the next 30 hours. The only portion of US coastline still under a tsunami warning — the highest-level alert — Wednesday morning is in Northern California. The warning covers about 40 miles of coastline from just south of Klamath, California, to the Oregon border, including Crescent City. As Latin America enters daytime hours, several regions across the Pacific remain under tsunami alerts following the massive earthquake off Russia's east coast. You can read more on the difference between a warning and an advisory here. Ring camera video from a business in Haleiwa, Hawaii, shows a time-lapse footage of water surging from the tsunami. The video starts around 7:20 p.m. local time and about 20 minutes later water can be seen rushing out of the area before a surge. The tsunami alert in Mexico after the earthquake in Russia was issued as a preventive measure, President of Mexico Claudia Sheinbaum said during her morning press conference today. “In reality the alert was issued but it did not generate major risks, there is no damage in Mexico,” she said. Colombia has issued a red alert in its northeastern Chocó region, as its Pacific coast braces for potential tsunami waves resulting from the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's far east. Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared a letter on X from Chocó's regional government, ordering the immediate evacuation of beaches and low-tide lands. Visitor sites in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands have been temporarily closed following the massive earthquake in Russia's far east, according to the Galapagos National Park. The Ecuadorian government said on Wednesday that “there is a high probability of a tsunami being generated” along the country's coast. Waves are expected to reach up to 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) high, the Ecuadorian Oceanographic Institute of the Naval Forces (INOCAR) said in a post on X. Beaches, protected areas that involve maritime access, public areas and remote sites near the locations that tsunami waves might hit have also been temporarily closed, the Ecuadorian Navy said in a statement published by INOCAR. Tsunami alerts are still in effect for large parts of the United States' Pacific coastlines, but some areas are starting to get the all-clear. Alerts were also dropped in parts of Southern California. The highest waves are expected in the next few hours, but they are now expected to be between 1.1 and 2.5 meters (3 and 8 feet), down from previous forecasts of up to 4 meters (13 feet), the High Commission of the Republic of French Polynesia said on Facebook. Early tsunami warnings have allowed for timely evacuations and “appear to have been effective,” Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, told the Science Media Centre. She cautioned, though, “unusual waves and potentially dangerous coastal activity is expected to continue for many hours even once the main tsunami waves pass. People are urged to take the risk to life seriously, remain vigilant, follow all evacuation orders and stay away from coastal areas.” Eurasia's highest volcano has erupted after the earthquake in the Kamchatka region of Russia's far east, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. At 4,750 meters (15,580 feet), Klyuchevskaya Sopka is one of the world's highest active volcanos. “A volcanic eruption, hot lava flowing down the western slope, a powerful glow over the crater and explosions are observed at night. On the contrary, many travelers are expressing a desire to personally observe this natural phenomenon,” RUTI said, according to RIA. Conditions on the volcano are often treacherous and unpredictable, with strong winds, bitterly cold temperatures and snow at high altitudes. This post has been updated with additional information. “This was the highest point we knew,” a woman told CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now. “We came in here (Monday), and we were like, instead of going to the hotel, let's go here.” “I got on the road, and I noticed traffic was getting crazy,” said a man who lives in the suburb of Makakilo and said the traffic was too bad to return home. “I was thinking, no way, that (Interstate) H1 is crazy congested right now.”</p>

Chris Coons, D-Del., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Patty Murray, D-Wash., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Andy Kim, D-N.J., Tim Kaine, D-Va., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Mark Warner, D-Va. said. "Even more dangerously, they risk putting American national security, technological advantage, and economic prosperity on the chopping block in order to do so." Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Chris Coons, left, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, right, slammed President Donald Trump for making "concessions" to Beijing without a "real breakthrough" in trade talks. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te was planning a stopover in New York en route to a trip to Latin America, but the Trump administration reportedly denied permission for the stop after China raised objections. The U.S. does not maintain formal relations with Taiwan, but such stops have happened before. Last week, the Trump administration reversed a ban on selling Nvidia's lower-powered H20 chips to China to power its artificial intelligence, arguing they were only the U.S.' "fourth-best chip." That move was a concession in talks with China over rare earth minerals, in hopes that Beijing would stop cutting off exports of the materials needed for all sorts of American technologies. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly shot back in a statement to Fox News Digital: "Democrats enabled and applauded Joe Biden's weakness when they denied the Wuhan lab leak theory and allowed a spy balloon to surveil our country." "President Trump is putting America First, and his strategy is working — China is sending rare earth magnets to the United States, and tariffs are rapidly leveling the playing field for American industries. This President is successful because he will look anyone in the eye to negotiate better deals for our country, and he will continue to advance American interests, such as bolstering our economy and stopping the flow of fentanyl into our communities." Last week, the Trump administration reversed a ban on selling Nvidia's lower-powered H20 chips to China to power its artificial intelligence, arguing they were only the U.S.' "fourth-best chip." The U.S. and China concluded their third round of high-level trade talks on Tuesday, ahead of an August 12 deadline after which the steep China tariffs Trump announced in April are expected to kick in. Trump, the Democrats claimed, "is emboldening Beijing to take aggressive actions and seek even more aggressive concessions in whatever trade negotiations may follow." Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, right, was planning a stopover in New York en route to a trip to Latin America, but the Trump administration reportedly denied permission for the stop after China raised objections. "Trump and this administration must reset their dangerously weak approach to China and make clear they will no longer accept symbolic wins in exchange for steep American concessions. An administration convinced it can renegotiate the world order needs to stop negotiating against itself." The White House could not immediately be reached for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once a British socialite who lived a life of luxury, Ghislaine Maxwell today is confined in a U.S. prison after being convicted of helping financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, points to a photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, during a news conference in New York on July 2, 2020. This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File) The federal grand juries that indicted Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges did not hear directly from any of the alleged victims in the case, Justice Department officials said in support of their request to unseal transcripts of the usually secret proceedings. While the memo didn't detail what was in the grand jury testimony, it dampened expectations that the transcripts would contain new revelations, saying that “certain aspects and subject matters” contained in them became public during Maxwell's trial in 2021 and that other details have been made public through many years of civil lawsuits filed by victims. Grand jury transcripts are rarely released by courts, unless they need to be disclosed in connection with a judicial proceeding. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that said judges have wide discretion and public interest alone can justify releasing grand jury information. The Epstein grand jury heard from just one witness, an FBI agent, when it met in June and July 2019, the government disclosed. The Maxwell grand jury heard from the same FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective when it met in June and July 2020 and March 2021, according to the submission. It isn't unusual for law enforcement officials to be the only witnesses before grand juries, which have a limited role and don't need to decide whether a person is guilty of a crime. The request to unseal the transcripts came after the Justice Department enraged parts of President Donald Trump's base of supporters when it announced in early July it wouldn't be making public any more investigative files related to Epstein, who was accused of paying underage girls for sexual acts. The decision not to make additional materials public shocked some Trump supporters because members of his administration had hyped the expected release and stoked conspiracies around the well-connected financier. Epstein took his own life in a federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on sex trafficking charges, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories because of his and Maxwell's links to famous people, such as royals, presidents and billionaires, including Trump. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her December 2021 conviction on sex trafficking charges that accused her of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last week, she sat for 1 1/2 days of interviews with Justice Department officials in Florida, answering questions “about 100 different people,” her attorney said. Maxwell was being interviewed because of Trump's directive to gather and release any credible evidence about others who may have committed crimes, the deputy attorney general said. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and claimed he had cut off their relationship long ago. But he faces ongoing questions about the Epstein case, overshadowing his administration's achievements. When reporters last week pressed the Republican president about possibly pardoning Maxwell, he deflected, emphasizing his administration's successes. “There is undoubtedly a clearly expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes,” it says. Under a 2008 nonprosecution agreement, Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. That allowed him to avert a possible life sentence, instead serving 13 months in a work release program.</p>

Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said Tuesday night that she doesn't like seeing the city cast in a negative light, especially in the national news. CINCINNATI – The FBI and Department of Justice have confirmed that there is an open federal investigation into the vicious downtown beating last weekend that went viral online, shocking the nation. "The FBI has been and will continue closely coordinating with the Cincinnati Police Department on this matter," the federal law enforcement group told Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning. A DOJ official also confirmed Wednesday morning that there is an open federal investigation into the matter. A fight broke out on Friday night in Downtown Cincinnati, leaving several people injured. On Sunday night, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon intimated about potential federal hate crime charges. "Our federal hate crimes laws apply to ALL Americans. We [at the DOJ Civil Rights Division] will monitor closely how local authorities handle this attack," she said on X regarding the beatings. "Nobody in our great nation should be the victim of such a crime, and where race is a motivation, federal law may apply." "The do-nothing, extreme liberal Mayor [Aftab Pureval] won't lift a finger to protect his streets and restore order, so it's time to bring in professionals who will," Moreno wrote. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked Moreno for connecting the DOJ with one of the victims, and for "caring so much." Video that has been shared widely online shows a group of people savagely assaulting two others during a confrontation, with a woman being knocked out cold in the street. The corner of Fourth and Elm Street outside LoVe, a local nightclub, where the beating took place, as seen on July 28, 2025 in Cincinnati. As of Wednesday morning, three people had been arrested and taken into custody, while two others had been charged but not yet arrested. Montianez Merriweather, 34, and Dekyra Vernon, 24, were arrested Tuesday night. Merriweather is being held on a $500,000 bond, while Vernon is being held on a $200,000 bond. A third suspect, Jermaine Matthews, was taken into custody overnight and charged with aggravated riot and assault. Meriweather was out on bond after being charged with receiving stolen property, weapons under disability, improper transportation of a firearm and other charges earlier this month. Cincinnati Chief of Police Teresa Theetge denounced the attack at a Tuesday night public safety meeting. Cincinnati Chief of Police Teresa Theetge announces the arrests of two people who were allegedly involved in a fight over the weekend that gained national attention.

Several people were injured, but none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far. People who evacuated to Hiyoriyama mountain watch toward the sea in Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture, northern Japan Wednesday, July 30, 2025 after a powerful earthquake in Russia's Far East prompted tsunami alert in parts of Japan. But along South America's Pacific Coast, new warnings were forcing evacuations in Chile and Colombia. In the immediate aftermath of the quake off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula, residents fled inland as ports flooded, and several were injured while rushing to leave buildings. AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports a powerful earthquake has struck Russia's Far East, producing a tsunami in the northern Pacific. In Japan, people flocked to evacuation centers, hilltop parks and rooftops in towns on the Pacific coast with fresh memories of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster. “We've got water, we got some snacks ... we're going to stay elevated,” said Jimmy Markowski, whose family from Hot Springs, Arkansas, fled their Waikiki beach resort before evacuation orders were lifted. A traffic jam forms in Honolulu Tuesday, July 29, 2025 as people heed a tsunami evacuation warning that coincided with rush hour following a powerful earthquakes in Russia's Far East early Wednesday. While tsunami advisories remain in place along much of the U.S. West Coast, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the worst was over. “We were fully deployed and ready to respond if necessary but grateful that we didn't have to deal with the situation that this could have been,” she told reporters in Chile, where she is meeting officials. Unusually strong currents and unpredictable surges were expected in places as far away as New Zealand, and the National Weather Service warned the San Francisco Bay Area could see “some seriously dangerous currents along beaches and harbors.” The earthquake appeared to be the strongest recorded since the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami and set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency said initial reports showed Japan's nuclear plants were not affected Wednesday. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world. The quake struck at 11:24 a.m. in Kamchatka with a magnitude of 8.8 and a depth of about 21 kilometers (13 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was centered offshore, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kamchatka's regional capital. Meanwhile, lava began to flow Wednesday from Kamchatka's Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano, the largest active one in the Northern Hemisphere. Observers also heard explosions, the Russian Academy of Sciences' geophysical service said. Chile, a place highly vulnerable to earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis, raised its warning early Wednesday to the highest level for most of its lengthy Pacific coast and said it was evacuating hundreds of people. Colombian officials ordered the complete closure and evacuation of beaches and low-tide areas while maritime traffic was being restricted. In this image taken from a video released by Russian Emergency Ministry Press Service, rescuers inspect a kindergarten damaged by an earthquake in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, Wednesday, July 30, 2025. In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kamchatka's regional capital, the quake damaged a local kindergarten, which was not in operation at the time because it was being renovated. Oleg Melnikov, head of the regional health department, said several people hurt themselves while rushing to leave buildings and a hospital patient was injured while jumping out of a window. The port's mayor said no major damage was recorded. Authorities on Kamchatka peninsula and in the Kurils canceled their tsunami warnings but said some risk of waves remains. An advisory means there is the potential for strong currents and dangerous waves, as well as flooding on beaches or in harbors. In northern California, tsunami activity continued to build Wednesday morning with maximum confirmed heights along the coast of 3.6 feet (1.1 meters) in Crescent City. The Oregon Department of Emergency Management said small tsunami waves were expected. “This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,” the department said. A tsunami of less than 1 foot (30 centimeters) was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and waves of up to 1.4 feet (under 30 centimeters) above tide levels were observed in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. People take shelter on the roof of a fire station in Mukawa town, Hokkaido, northern Japan Wednesday, July 30, 2025, after a powerful earthquake in Russia's Far East prompted tsunami alert in parts of Japan. Several areas reported smaller waves, and at least one person was injured. In Iwaki city in Fukushima, which was the epicenter of the 2011 tsunami and quake, dozens of residents gathered at a hilltop park after a community siren sounded and breakwater gates were closed. Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, severely damaged in 2011, took shelter on higher ground while remotely monitoring operations, the operator said. By late Wednesday, Japan had downgraded its tsunami alert but left an advisory in place along the Pacific coast. People were also urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands.</p>

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has filed a lawsuit against a lobster festival in Maine, calling the steaming of lobsters "egregiously cruel." "Today, PETA filed a lawsuit against the Maine Lobster Festival and the City of Rockland in Knox County Superior Court over the city-endorsed event's egregiously cruel method of steaming thousands of lobsters alive in what PETA contends is a violation of Maine law prohibiting the torture and torment of animals," the group wrote. Paul DeSaulniers of Rockland unloads a fresh batch of lobster at the food tent during the Maine Lobster Festival in Rockland on Sunday, August 5, 2018. (Ariana van den Akker/Portland Portland Press Herald via Getty Images) It asked the court to "issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the steaming of live lobsters on public lands." According to the lawsuit, the festival prevents individuals from enjoying Harbor Park and other nearby areas. In the lawsuit, PETA argued that people should be able to enjoy the area "without being forced to witness extreme animal suffering as approximately 16,000 live lobsters are illegally tormented and killed at the festival each year." A rare bright orange lobster shares the tank with regular lobsters. PETA Foundation Director of Litigation Asher Smith said the event amounts to "municipally supported cruelty." "PETA is pushing to end these horrific displays and restore compassionate Rockland residents' ability to enjoy Harbor Park year-round," Smith said. "We are aware of the lawsuit filed by PETA and take any public concern seriously. However, the methods we use to prepare lobster at the festival follow widely accepted and legal culinary practices that have been in place in homes, restaurants, and seafood festivals across the globe for generations," the groups wrote. "While we appreciate PETA's concerns, there is no conclusive scientific consensus that lobsters feel pain in a way comparable to mammals. They do not have a brain capable of processing pain."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first of the National Transportation Safety Board's three days of investigative hearings is underway to help determine what caused the deadly midair collision on January 29 between an Army helicopter on a training mission and American Airlines flight 5342 landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. “You're at three hundred feet, come down for me,” the transcript from the cockpit voice recorder, also known as a black box, says. Pilots on the regional jet performed their checks to land as the tower told the helicopter, call sign PAT 25, to look out for their CRJ-700 regional jet approaching at 1,200 feet. “PAT 25 has the traffic in sight. Request visual separation,” the helicopter responds, asking for permission to avoid it visually. The pilot responds, “Yeah kinda, busy.” “PAT two five has uh – aircraft in sight. Request visual separation,” the helicopter responds. “Alright kinda come left for me ma'am, I think that's why he's asking… We're kinda… out towards the middle.” Aircraft flown by PSA Airlines received collision avoidance alerts caused by helicopters five times in the five months prior to the crash, including one caused by two Black Hawk helicopters the day before the fatal collision, according to documents released in the NTSB docket. The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, sounds an alarm in the cockpit if planes could be getting too close to each other. On January 28, a PSA Airlines flight from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington was leveling off at 3,000 feet when it received a warning due to two Black Hawks one to two miles away and 600 feet below it, the document shows. PSA flights also received TCAS warnings caused by helicopters while landing at Reagan National Airport in September, October, and November. “Notably, the barometric altimeters continued to be 80 to 130 feet lower than the helicopter's determined altitude above sea level when flying at speed over the tidal portion of the Potomac River,” NTSB investigator Marie Moler presented to the hearing. Barometric altimeters use pressure to gauge altitude and can be impacted by a variety of atmospheric and other factors. With allowable errors in the helicopter's altimeters and other equipment as well as Army rules expecting aviators to hold their altitude within 100 feet, it could end up being much closer. “How much tolerance should we have for aviation safety whenever civilian lives are at risk?” asked Todd Inman, NTSB board member. “How much is that tolerance,” he continued. “I think it should be zero.” The Army responded that machines cannot be exact, but when dealing with such close altitudes the variables are concerning. “We have to understand there are physical limitations to that, which is offhand plus or minus 100 feet,” Scott Rosengren, speaking on behalf of the Army responded. “Knowing that there's plus or minus 100 feet, any qualified Army pilot or any civil pilot will (think) the fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern.” “My concern is, where else in the National Airspace does that exist where there are charted helicopter routes?” she said. Homendy also called on the Army to test the altimeters in all Black Hawks, not just a similar model to those involved in this crash. The Army, PSA Airlines, a regional subsidiary of American Airlines which operated the plane, the Federal Aviation Administration and other parties are represented. “This is not an adversarial hearing,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in her opening remarks. “This does not mean difficult questions won't be asked. We are here to improve safety.” The air traffic controller working in the control tower that night was responsible for two different positions on two different radio channels, the timeline animation reveled. However, investigators said interviews with PSA Airline's pilots showed they generally didn't know much about the helicopter routes in the area. Three Reagan National Airport-based captains and one first officer were asked about their knowledge of published helicopter routes and only one PSA captain – who was a former military helicopter pilot in the region – had knowledge of the routes prior to the accident. A determination of what caused the crash will come in January.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The pressure down there is so immense that even submersibles supposedly built for those conditions can, as we know, tragically fail. Now imagine taking a sub nearly three times deeper. That's what an international team of scientists did last summer. The researchers weren't looking for a shipwreck. They were interested in what else might be lurking on the seafloor, which is so deep that no light can reach it. It was there that they found something remarkable: entire communities of animals, rooted in organisms that are able to derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions. Through a process called chemosynthesis, deep-sea microbes are able to turn compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide into organic compounds, including sugars, forming the base of the food chain. This was the deepest community of chemosynthetic life ever discovered, according to Mengran Du, a study author and researcher at the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Using a deep-sea vessel called Fendouzhe, the researchers encountered abundant wildlife communities, including fields of marine tube worms peppered with white marine snails. The worms have a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live in their bodies. Those bacteria provide them with a source of nutrients in exchange for, among other things, a stable place to live. Similar to the tube worms, the clams depend on bacteria within their shells to turn chemical compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide that are present in the deep sea into food. Unlike other deep-sea ecosystems — which feed on dead animals and other organic bits that fall from shallower waters — these trench communities are likely sustained in part by methane produced by microbes buried under the seafloor, the authors said. That suggests that wildlife communities may be more common in these extremely deep trenches than scientists once thought. “The presence of these chemosynthetic ecosystems challenge long-standing assumptions about life's potential at extreme depths,” Du told Vox in an email. These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat. What budget cuts mean for wildlife, climate monitoring — and surviving peak tourism. They were already on the edge of extinction. The Endangered Species Act has a major problem.</p>

(Miguel Martinez/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Graham Gano stayed late at the New York Giants' practice facility Monday watching news coverage of a gunman killing four people at a Manhattan office building that includes the NFL headquarters. “I was praying for just whoever was involved immediately,” said Gano, a veteran kicker and the Giants' union representative. “Our hearts go out to the people in New York, especially the families of the people that passed,” three-time Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. Cleveland Browns owner Dee Haslem, flanked by her husband, Jimmy, said in remarks at camp, “We honor the policeman that also died in the line of duty, and our prayers are with the ones that are injured.” In another memo sent Tuesday evening, Goodell said the league employee was surrounded by family members and “We are all continuing to hope for and support his full recovery.” He instructed those working in the New York office to work remotely through at least Aug. 8 and said there would be a virtual town hall Wednesday. “This has been a challenging time for our entire team,” Goodell said. It means so much to see how our team is pulling together. In the midst of this difficult time, we hold on to hope and optimism for healing and brighter days ahead.” Chicago Bears coach Ben Johnson said the shooting “keeps things in perspective as we enter training camp and the guys are going hard that there's a little bit more to life than just football.” Investigators believe Shane Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building's lobby, then another in a 33rd-floor office on Monday, before he killed himself, authorities said. Giants coach Brian Daboll opened his pre-practice news conference in East Rutherford, New Jersey, by referencing the shooting and saying he had not had any conversations with players or staff about the situation or if they were concerned for their safety. “Our security staff here is fantastic,” Gano said. “I think we've got one of the best. ... We're fully confident in our security team here.” Three-time Tennessee Titans Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons saw reports of the shooting on Tuesday morning. He didn't have a chance to read up on the attack before practice at 8 a.m., but Simmons said that's why mental health is one of the topics brought up in football circles these days. “Mental health is a big thing in this world, and it's our job, especially in this building,” Simmons said. “One thing we talked about as the leaders you never know when a guy's last day may be in this building or he could be on this team forever. So, I just want to treat everybody the same.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is ratcheting up the pressure on India, calling into question the prospects of a deal with a key US trading partner just days before his tariff deadline. Trump, in a pair of social media posts Wednesday, sharply attacked India's trade barriers and directly targeted India's sustained reliance on Russian oil purchases and military equipment. He doubled down on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on all Indian imports and threatened an additional “penalty” in response to India's energy purchases. “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia's largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!” Top trade officials have been transiting back and forth between the Washington and New Delhi for months in pursuit of a final agreement. Trump's ability to secure commitments on market access for US producers has become a particularly salient fixation as Trump has reviewed draft offers in recent days, the officials said. That has created a significant obstacle to the prospects of an agreement with India, one official told CNN. “But the president isn't in a ‘part of the way' mood - he wants barriers removed completely or as close to completely as possible.” Trump's approach is tied in part to a strategy that has become increasingly apparent to foreign trade officials involved in late-stage talks: Trump has no qualms about letting those higher tariffs go into place - a message he's delivered repeatedly in public over the last several weeks. But it's also created an environment in which Trump has embraced a clear sense of leverage over trading partners - even close allies - who are desperate to maintain access to the world's largest consumer market. The tariffs on India, Hassett said, might cause them to “reconsider their practices.” “Over time, I would guess that Indian firms will be onshoring production in the US, and Indians might even open their markets more to us so that we reconsider our future trades,” Hassett added. At the same time, Trump has escalated in parallel his threat to impose secondary sanctions on Russian energy exports in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate attacks on Ukraine. That dynamic, which has long been weighed across successive administrations, would directly impact India and China most as nations who purchase the bulk of Russian energy products. India's oil imports from Russia have ticked up this year as Russia continued to be the top supplier to the world's most populous nation. Russia for roughly 35% of India's overall supplies, followed by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that India would pay 25% tariffs if they don't reach a deal by August 1. When imposing a 50-day deadline on Russia to reach a ceasefire earlier this month, Trump announced that countries that purchase Russian oil would face secondary sanctions. Trump officials have been privately making clear to counterparts that Trump's threat to significantly escalate an already sweeping US sanctions regime on Russia should be taken seriously and is not a negotiating ploy, the officials said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday he shared that message directly with his Chinese counterparts during trade talks in Stockholm. “I think anyone who buys sanctioned Russian oil should be ready for this,” Bessent told reporters at a news conference at the conclusion of the talks. According to an analysis of Russian fossil fuel exports and sanctions conducted by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in June, India continued to be the second-largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels behind China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president's party has lost House seats in all but two midterm elections since 1938. The two exceptions were 1998, when Bill Clinton's party gained five seats amid an unpopular Republican attempt to impeach him, and 2002, when George W. Bush's party picked up eight seats in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. A blue wave could easily wash these majorities away. In the 2018 midterm elections during President Donald Trump's first term, Democrats gained 40 House seats and a majority that would go on to impeach him. But it wouldn't take anywhere near that big a loss to cost Republicans their House majority in 2026. They ended up with a smaller net gain in House seats than they managed in 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden was elected president. But it was still more than enough for Republicans to take control of the House, however narrowly. But the 2022 midterm elections are also a cautionary tale for Democrats. Both parties may have picked so much of the low-hanging fruit in past wave elections that the pickup opportunities are now extremely limited. “I don't foresee anytime soon here where you have a 30- or 35-seat majority,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told the Washington Examiner last year. For years, Democrats held seats in dozens of conservative congressional districts. Republicans seized control of these districts in the 1994 Republican wave under Clinton and then in the 2010 Tea Party election under Barack Obama. Republicans now hold just three seats in congressional districts won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Before the resignation of former Tennessee Republican Rep. Mark Green, 134 out of 220 seats held by Republicans were in districts Trump won by at least 20 points. Another 45 represent districts Trump carried by between 12.6 and 19.9 points. There are 19 Republican districts that went from Trump by between 7.6 and 12.5 points, and another 19 where Trump won with a margin of victory of 7.5 points or less. Democrats scored six upsets in districts Trump won by between 7.6 and 19.9 points. So Republicans will need to do two things to defy history: squeeze more pickup opportunities out of redistricting, especially in states such as Texas and Ohio, while doing a much better job of defending the more marginal Trump districts than they did in his first midterm election. The two biggest advantages Republicans have going into the midterm elections are that they aren't defending many seats in districts that voted against Trump and that Democrats have few options for countering their redistricting push. The Republican majority is smaller, but much better structured for withstanding a moderately hostile political climate. Meanwhile, there are Trump supporters who don't show up when he isn't on the ballot or consistently vote for down-ballot Republican candidates. (Musk was also personally part of the get-out-the-vote operation that turned out these voters.) Nevertheless, with few true swing districts left, we could wave goodbye to red or blue waves for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Through her hearing-room quips and social-media insults, she's become known, at least in MSNBC-watching households, as a leading general in the battle against Trump.” This “general” has appeared on MSNBC dozens of times this year, almost as if she were a paid employee of the network. CNN is also a cozy destination, appearing on that channel many times as well. “The lock screen on her phone is a headshot of herself.” This may be why, according to The Atlantic, “She monitors social-media engagement like a day trader checks her portfolio.” Nope. But in terms of 80-20 issues, she does believe the following. She also believes all those in the country illegally should be granted a pathway to citizenship. She supports men playing against women in sports: “Find the little trans child that is ruining your life,” she once mocked. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is paralyzed, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” She recently asked for Elon Musk to be “taken out” as a birthday present. And when it comes to freedom of the press, Crockett believes in censorship when it pertains to any piece she doesn't approve of 100%. Also per the Atlantic: “Four days before this story was published, Crockett called me to express frustration that I had reached out to so many House members without telling her first. Much can change until Election Day, more than 15 months away, but if that's who Democrats in Texas end up nominating, she'll make O'Rourke look good. The same is happening with Democrats in the mayoral race in New York, where Zohran Mamdani, an antisemitic socialist, leads by double digits against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, incumbent Eric Adams, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. If Mamdani wins in November, his plans include opening government-run supermarkets, which worked so well in the old Soviet Union and Cuba; defunding the police in high-crime areas in favor of social workers; and vehemently opposing Trump and Immigration and Customs Enforcement on deporting violent criminals here illegally. He has vowed to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he enters New York, wants to use millions of taxpayer money to pay for sex changes for minors, and — this is a doozy — would “slowly buy up the housing on the private market and convert properties into communes.” Speaking of Ocasio-Cortez, she's also polling well among Democrats nationally. When CNN asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is, Ocasio-Cortez came out on top, beating 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), former President Barack Obama, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). In a hypothetical race against Vice President JD Vance, Ocasio-Cortez is also within the margin of error, with Vance receiving 44% and her getting a surprising 41% in an Emerson College survey. But while that result is disconcerting, given that she wants to spend trillions on the Green New Deal despite flying on private jets to her “Fight the Oligarchy” rallies, still believes in defunding the police, supports open borders, opposes funding for Israel's Iron Dome, and advocates late-term abortion, how will these positions play in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona? Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), who has called on Democrats to work with the Trump administration on areas where they can find common ground, all while being a staunch advocate of Israel, has been subject to criticism from Ocasio-Cortez and Crockett. There have been subsequent smear pieces this year by legacy media outlets regarding his health, which are completely unfounded. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) is seen as a 2028 presidential contender, but his Jewish heritage could put him at odds with the left flank. We saw this play out when Harris inexplicably chose Gov. Walz, who only installed tampon machines in elementary school bathrooms and provided free healthcare and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, played a sizable role in Harris's defeat following his horrific debate performance. Because what appeals to MSNBC and CNN viewers doesn't play well once you hear their actual positions on key issues. Per Trump on Truth Social recently, “After years of being left out in the cold, including suffering one of the Greatest Losses in History, the 2024 Presidential Election, the Democrats should nominate Low IQ Candidate, Jasmine Crockett, for President, and AOC+3 should be, respectively, Vice President, and three High Level Members of the Cabinet – Added together with our future Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, and our Country is really SCREWED!” The days of centrist Democrats actually governing and compromising on a national level seemingly ended with President Bill Clinton in the '90s. Today's Democrats are about resisting and appealing to the elites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A first-of-its-kind satellite has launched to track nearly imperceptible changes on Earth's surface, an effort that could aid with responses to natural disasters. The radar, pioneered by NASA to use in space, works like conventional radar in that it uses microwaves to detect distant surfaces and objects. But advanced data processing enables the details to be seen at high resolution. NISAR lifted off from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India's southeastern coast at 8:10 a.m. ET (5:40 p.m. IST) Wednesday aboard an ISRO Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, or GSLV-F16. The satellite will orbit Earth 14 times per day in order to complete scans of almost all of the planet's ice and land surfaces twice every 12 days, detecting changes in Earth's surface down to fractions of an inch in the process. The mission, first proposed in 2014, will allow scientists to monitor Earth like never before, changing the way we study our home planet and better predicting a natural disaster before it strikes, said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. “Even though we may not always notice it, much of our Earth's land surface is in constant motion,” Fox said. “The changes, however, are so subtle that right now they're virtually undetectable. “NISAR is an equal 50/50, partnership between NASA and ISRO,” said Wendy Edelstein, NISAR deputy project manager at NASA's JPL, during a July 21 news conference. “These two radars work together to achieve science that neither could see on their own.” Shorter wavelengths in the S-band can measure small objects, like leaves and the roughness of surfaces, to monitor crops, while long wavelengths in the L-band can peer through thick tree canopies to study forest structure and even spot boulders and tree trunks. The radar systems can also take specific measurements of motion, land deformation and moisture content. The satellite's continuous observation could spot potential land movement before a volcanic eruption, or help scientists understand how motion on Earth's surface could disrupt infrastructure like levees or dams. It could even provide insights about where earthquakes may occur, according to NASA. The satellite is the result of conversations between NASA and ISRO that began in response to the National Academy of Science's 2007 decadal survey, which identified research priorities and recommended prioritizing observations of Earth. “We are two nations with one mission,” said Karen St. Germain, director of Earth science at NASA, during a recent news conference. “NISAR unites the US and India to study our home planet together. The collaboration, cooperation and information sharing between our two agencies is a foundation that we really look forward to continuing to build upon.” Previously, some NASA instruments were flown aboard India's first deep-space mission Chandrayaan-1, which launched in 2008 and orbited the moon for nearly two years. Edelstein has traveled to India more than 25 times over the past decade and spent more than 150 days over the last two years working alongside team members at ISRO. But she said the journey has allowed her to get to know her colleagues at ISRO well and be immersed in Indian culture — something she calls a very big personal highlight. Earth is spinning faster, leading timekeepers to consider an unprecedented move St. Germain agrees: “Building a satellite on opposite sides of the world during a global pandemic was really hard, but it strengthened our relationship with ISRO,” she said. Dr. Jitendra Singh, India's Minister for Science and Technology, said the mission is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for India to become a “Vishwa Bandhu,” or a global partner that contributes to the collective good of humanity, according to a news release shared by the country's Press Information Bureau. “This mission is not just about a satellite launch — it is a moment that symbolises what two democracies committed to science and global welfare can achieve together. NISAR will not only serve India and the United States but will also provide critical data for countries around the world, especially in areas like disaster management, agriculture, and climate monitoring,” Singh said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski broke with their party to oppose the nomination, while Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) did not vote. Just hours before the vote, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) sent a letter to the Justice Department's acting inspector general, William Blier, urging an investigation into allegations that Bove once suggested ignoring court orders related to immigration enforcement. “In the event these whistleblower complaints and other reports have not already prompted investigations by your office, we urge you to undertake a thorough review of these disclosures and allegations,” the letter stated. A third whistleblower reportedly emerged Tuesday ahead of the vote, meeting with staff for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), whose spokesperson dismissed the late allegations as “a bad faith attempt to sink a nominee.” In a speech on the Senate floor, Grassley stated how his team encountered challenges while attempting to review the three whistleblower disclosures in good faith, saying, “Any assertion that I or my staff was uninterested in the evidence is false.” Bove, who served as Trump's defense attorney during his criminal cases last year, has denied any wrongdoing previously under oath during his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,” Bove told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added, “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.” The liberal-aligned organization has received millions in funding from George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations and the left-of-center Fund for Constitutional Government. Legal scholars aligned with Trump called the attacks on Bove politically motivated. “Judicial fortitude is a hallmark of a Trump judicial nominee, and I have seen hundreds of judicial nominees; his performance at his confirmation hearing displayed that he has fortitude in spades,” said Robert Luther III, a professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University and former White House associate counsel. “He has undergone abuse beyond the measure of what any person should have to endure to secure a position in public service.” “His temperament — using vulgarities to claim that the Trump administration should disobey court orders — is disqualifying for the bench,” Booker said. Bove will now take a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit, which covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and the U.S. Virgin Islands — replacing Judge Julio Fuentes, a Clinton appointee who assumed senior status.</p>
