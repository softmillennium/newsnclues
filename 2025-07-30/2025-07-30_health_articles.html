                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) finds that prolonged and/or repeated exposure to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) anesthetic agents (sevoflurane, propofol) for infants in the first two months of life resulted in an accelerated maturation of brain electrical activity patterns evoked by visual stimuli when recorded at 2-5 months of age, compared to infants who did not have early general anesthesia exposure. To address such concerns, a large multicenter clinical trial (called TREX) is currently in progress using a combination of anesthetic agents in order to minimize exposure to GABA-active anesthetics. This paper is the fourth in a series emerging from a prospective longitudinal study known as the General Anesthesia and Brain Activity (GABA) Study, led by researchers at Boston Children's Hospital and Northeastern University. This newest paper is the primary translational publication of the GABA Study which is a first direct test in humans of a finding first made in mice that GABA triggers critical trajectories of brain development (Hensch et al, Science 1998; Hensch and Fagiolini, Nature 2000). The PNAS paper represents a proof-of-principle translation into human neurodevelopment from a well-established mechanism that governs neuroplasticity and development in animal models. This translational effort opens up new and important insights into individual variability in developmental timing toward serving a range of clinical populations. These findings build on previous work published in British Journal of Anesthesia-Open that found infants who received early and prolonged anesthesia exposure showed no statistically significant differences in a wide range of basic cognitive, language, motor, and behavioral domains when assessed at 10 months and 2–3 years old. Further research is needed to explore the long-term impacts of prolonged and/or repeated early exposure by school age. General anesthesia in early infancy accelerates visual cortical development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a small trial, Mass General Brigham researchers found a drug designed to treat Celiac disease supported a more rapid return to normal activities for patients following COVID. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that can occur after a COVID-19 infection, presenting as high fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and life-threatening cardiac injury. A small, randomized clinical trial led by Mass General Brigham investigators found the oral drug larazotide-an experimental drug originally designed to treat Celiac disease-was both safe and effective in treating children with MIS-C. Their results are published in Science Translational Medicine. While our study is small, its results are powerful and have implications not only for MIS-C, but potentially for long COVID. Our findings suggest that larazotide is safe and quickly resolves symptoms in children with MIS-C. We are now running a clinical trial to test whether larazotide may also be a useful therapy to treat patients with long COVID." Lael Yonker, MD, lead author, co-director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center, Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutic Development Center, and Pulmonary Genetics Clinic at Mass General Brigham for Children Enter larazotide, an orally administered drug that does target the gut. Larazotide strengthens intestinal barriers to limit the number of materials-like SARS-CoV-2 viral particles-that exit the intestines and enter circulation. To test larazotide's efficacy and safety as an MIS-C treatment, researchers conducted a double-blind clinical trial with 12 children experiencing early-stage MIS-C. Each patient randomly received either a placebo or larazotide four times daily for 21 days, then was tracked over six months of recovery. Children who received larazotide showed faster resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, faster clearance of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, and more rapid return to normal activities. The findings demonstrate larazotide may be a safe and promising treatment option for children with MIS-C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To enable early diagnosis of acute illnesses and effective management of chronic conditions, point-of-care testing (POCT) technology—diagnostics conducted near the patient—is drawing global attention. The key to POCT lies in enzymes that recognize and react precisely with specific substances. Now, a Korean research team has developed a high-sensitivity sensor platform that achieves 38 times higher selectivity than existing nanozymes and allows disease diagnostics visible to the naked eye within just 3 minutes. On the 28th, KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that Professor Jinwoo Lee's research team from the Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, in collaboration with teams led by Professor Jeong Woo Han at Seoul National University and Professor Moon Il Kim at Gachon University, has developed a new single-atom catalyst that selectively performs only peroxidase-like reactions while maintaining high reaction efficiency. Using bodily fluids such as blood, urine, or saliva, this diagnostic platform enables test results to be read within minutes even outside hospital settings—greatly improving medical accessibility and ensuring timely treatment. To address this, inorganic nanozyme materials have been developed as substitutes. Yet, they typically lack selectivity—when hydrogen peroxide is used as a substrate, the same catalyst triggers both peroxidase-like reactions (which cause color change) and catalase-like reactions (which remove the substrate), reducing diagnostic signal accuracy. To control catalyst selectivity at the atomic level, the researchers used an innovative structural design: attaching chlorine (Cl) ligands in a three-dimensional configuration to the central ruthenium (Ru) atom to fine-tune its chemical properties. This enabled them to isolate only the desired diagnostic signal. Experimental results showed that the new catalyst achieved over 38-fold improvement in selectivity compared to existing nanozymes, with significantly increased sensitivity and speed in detecting hydrogen peroxide. By incorporating the catalyst and oxidase into a paper-based sensor, the team created a system that could simultaneously detect four key biomarkers related to health: glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and choline—all with a simple color change. This platform is broadly applicable across various disease diagnostics and can deliver results within 3 minutes without complex instruments or pH adjustments. Professor Jinwoo Lee of KAIST commented, "This study is significant in that it simultaneously achieves enzyme-level selectivity and reactivity by structurally designing single-atom catalysts." He added that "the structure-function-based catalyst design strategy can be extended to the development of various metal-based catalysts and other reaction domains where selectivity is critical."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new technology that harnesses AI to analyze mammograms and improve the accuracy of predicting a woman's personalized five-year risk of developing breast cancer has received Breakthrough Device designation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Developed by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, the software has been licensed to Prognosia Inc., a WashU startup company. This provides a meaningful estimate that is aligned with the U.S. national risk reduction guidelines, so that clinicians will know what steps to take next if a woman's risk is elevated. The FDA Breakthrough Device designation provides an expedited review process for full market approval in an effort to give patients and clinicians accelerated access to new medical devices. Products that receive the designation have already undergone rigorous testing and shown excellent promise in their potential to improve treatment or the diagnosis of debilitating or life-threatening conditions. The software package, called Prognosia Breast, was developed by Graham A. Colditz, MD, DrPH, the Niess-Gain Professor of Surgery at WashU Medicine and associate director of prevention and control at Siteman Cancer Center, based at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and WashU Medicine; and Shu (Joy) Jiang, PhD, an associate professor of surgery in the Division of Public Health Sciences in the Department of Surgery at WashU Medicine. Colditz and Jiang co-founded Prognosia in 2024 in collaboration with WashU's Office of Technology Management (OTM) and BioGenerator Ventures, the latter of which provided both financial support and business strategy expertise from Entrepreneur-in-Residence David Smoller, PhD. The software is a pre-trained machine learning system that analyzes mammogram images and provides an estimate of how likely a patient is to develop breast cancer over the next five years, based solely on images and a woman's age. According to the developers, Prognosia Breast estimates a person's five-year risk of developing breast cancer 2.2 times more accurately than the standard method, which is based on questionnaires that consider factors such as age, race and family history. The system was trained on past mammograms from tens of thousands of individuals who underwent breast cancer screening through Siteman Cancer Center. Some of them went on to develop cancer, teaching the system what to look for in the earliest stages of tumor development. Such early signs of disease can't be perceived even by a well-trained human eye. We're excited about the potential of this technology to improve risk prediction and prevention of breast cancer broadly, no matter where a woman is getting screened. No matter the type of imaging they receive, our data show the software's potential to identify women at increased risk of developing breast cancer over the next five years, providing them with opportunities to take targeted steps to reduce that risk." Graham A. Colditz, MD, DrPH, the Niess-Gain Professor of Surgery at WashU Medicine According to 2023 survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 75% of women ages 50 to 74 reported having received a mammogram in the past two years. Early detection has been shown to make treatment more effective and reduce deaths from breast cancer. "Receiving a Breakthrough Device designation is a powerful validation of the extraordinary dedication and vision of this research team to improve breast cancer diagnosis and care," said Doug E. Frantz, PhD, vice chancellor for innovation and commercialization at WashU. This is a prime example of the vital role of entrepreneurship and commercialization at WashU in transforming cutting-edge research into real-world technologies that improve patient care." According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a five-year risk score of 3% or higher is considered elevated. According to guidelines from these organizations, women with elevated scores should be referred to specialists who can further advise them on their options for additional screening and prevention strategies. Those found to be at elevated risk of this cancer have the option to receive more frequent screening - which may include other types of imaging, such as MRI - and in some cases may choose to take a type of chemotherapy called tamoxifen or endocrine therapy as preventive treatments. With such options available, identifying women at high risk is important so they have access to specialists who can help guide them in making these important choices. Individuals found to be at elevated risk will be referred to Siteman's breast health specialists, who focus on helping individuals navigate the options they have for managing high breast cancer risk. "Despite the sophistication of today's breast imaging and its broad use for identifying existing tumors, today's risk prediction for breast cancer is still questionnaire-based and not very good at estimating future risk," Jiang said. "Our work has focused on filling that need for better methods. Moving to image-based risk prediction - which our studies have shown is much more accurate - has the potential to be revolutionary for patient care."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A current study by the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium is looking at the question of which people with Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of developing a second colorectal cancer. Lynch syndrome (LS), formerly referred to as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC), is the most common hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. It is estimated that around 300,000 people are affected in Germany alone. It is caused by inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, which normally correct errors during cell division. When these genes are defective, errors accumulate in the genome, increasing the likelihood of further tumors, including metachronous colorectal cancers, even after successful initial treatment. Researchers from Bonn and Leipzig therefore investigated risk factors for the occurrence of a second primary colorectal cancer on behalf of the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium. The study draws on data from the central registry of the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium and included 852 individuals with Lynch syndrome who had been diagnosed with a first colorectal cancer. Researchers examined whether variables such as age, sex, tumor location, and genetic subtype influenced the likelihood of developing a second primary colorectal tumor.. "Around one in five of the Lynch syndrome carriers studied developed a second colon cancer over the course of an average of 7.9 years," says lead author Dr. Robert Hüneburg, spokesperson for the German Familial Colorectal Cancer Consortium and senior physician at the Medical Clinic I of the University Hospital Bonn, which is part of the Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Bonn. " This study helps refine individualized risk stratification. The study found that the risk of developing a second colorectal cancer depends on which gene is altered in people with Lynch syndrome.People with changes in the MLH1 or MSH2 genes had a higher risk than those with changes in MSH6 or PMS2. This so-called genotype stratification - i.e. risk assessment according to genetic findings - is an important approach for developing individualized prevention strategies. The analysis is based on one of the largest groups of people with Lynch syndrome examined for this question. The long-term documentation in our registry also makes it possible to map less obvious risk constellations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a highly complex system that encompasses cellular components (such as cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells) and non-cellular components (such as blood vessels and signaling molecules). These diverse components engage in complex interactions with tumor cells and undergo dynamic changes during tumor progression. Specifically, intratumoral microbial metabolites play an important role on the TME. These metabolites, when released into the TME, can influence immune cell function through the modulation of cytokine secretion. Considering the significant role of intratumoral microbial metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, these bioactive compounds may substantially impact cancer immunotherapy outcomes. Although extensive research has focused on gut microbiota-derived metabolites in tumor progression and cancer treatment, it is crucial to distinguish between metabolites from intratumoral microbes and those produced by gut microbiota. In this context, this review provides a systematic analysis of the role of intratumoral microbes in the tumor microenvironment and cancer immunotherapy, specifically examining how intratumoral microbes modulate the tumor microenvironment through: 1) glucose metabolites, 2) amino acids and their metabolites, 3) lipid metabolites, and 4) other metabolites, ultimately affecting the clinical benefits of immunotherapy. Furthermore, this review presents a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms by which intratumoral microbial metabolites function in the tumor microenvironment and investigates the potential connections between these metabolites and immunotherapy efficacy, with the objective of establishing theoretical foundations and research directions for novel cancer treatment strategies, while fostering interdisciplinary integration among microbiology, oncology, and immunology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of Canadian scientists has discovered a surprising new way to improve blood sugar levels and reduce liver damage: by trapping a little-known fuel made by gut bacteria before they wreak havoc on the body. The findings, published in Cell Metabolism on July 29, 2025, could open the door to new therapies to treat metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. But when researchers developed a way to trap this molecule in the gut before it enters the body, they saw dramatic improvements in blood sugar control and fatty liver disease in mice with obesity. We've known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose - a process called the Cori cycle. What we've discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation." In 1947, married scientists Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work showing how muscles in the body generate lactate that fuels the liver to produce blood glucose, which then cycles back to fuel the muscle. The Canadian team found that obese mice - and even people with obesity - have higher levels of a lesser-known molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the more familiar L-lactate made by muscles, most of the D-lactate comes from gut microbes and was shown to raise blood sugar and liver fat more aggressively. To stop this, the researchers created a "gut substrate trap" - a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less insulin resistance, and reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis - all without changing their diet or body weight. "This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we're intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm," says Schertzer, a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation. Gut substrate trap of D-lactate from microbiota improves blood glucose and fatty liver disease in obese mice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Finding a protein that isn't in this top 10 is a bit like looking for Waldo if only one rendition of the character remained in a collection of every "Where's Waldo" comic ever produced. This range of disparity in protein concentration is termed dynamic range, and it makes it more difficult for scientists to identify less-abundant proteins and their matching receptors. Scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys and colleagues at Scripps Research Institute published findings July 7, 2025, in Nature Communications demonstrating a strategy for identifying less-abundant proteins that bind with a specific type of receptor termed an endocytic lectin, and namely the mannose receptor Mrc1 (also known as CD206 and MMR). This approach enabled the research team to uncover hundreds of binding partners that together predicted Mrc1's roles in our health. To boost the signal and overcome the noise of so many proteins appearing at different levels, the investigators employed the prototypical mannose-binding lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) to first enrich for those blood proteins bearing multiple linkages of mannose. "ConA and Mrc1 both have the same mannose linkage binding properties, however Mrc1 is not available as a similarly active recombinant protein," said Mayank Saraswat, PhD, a senior staff scientist at Sanford Burnham Prebys and co-lead author of the study. "We isolated proteins that bind ConA from the plasma of normal mice and from mice lacking Mrc1," said Saraswat. Mrc1 keeps the concentration of various critical blood plasma proteins in a healthy range. It does this by binding to proteins that have been post-translationally modified with mannose, sometimes termed mannosylated proteins. Binding of mannosylated proteins to Mrc1 initiates an endocytic clearance mechanism that limits Mrc1 ligand half-lives and abundance in circulation. They used bioinformatics to review and depict these hundreds of proteins by their functions. We noticed that a lot of the proteins had very important roles to play. Renin and angiotensin converting enzyme, for example, are major regulators of blood pressure." The researchers dug deeper on eight of these proteins known to affect blood pressure, inflammation, organ function and sepsis. "When we looked at samples of blood from human sepsis patients, we found that there was a difference in the proteins that were accumulating when compared to the Mrc1-deficient mice," said Saraswat. "However, when we compared the pathways controlled by these proteins, half of those activated in human sepsis were also activated by Mrc-1 dysfunction." "To understand the part that glycosidic linkages are playing in health and disease by modifying the abundance and activity of blood glycoproteins, we need to decipher this new language spanning protein glycosylation, detect abnormalities and determine how this system translates in the body to affect different physiological functions," said Saraswat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in how our bodies fight infection, heal, and regulate inflammation. When this gene malfunctions, it can lead to a diverse spectrum of diseases—from pigment changes and dental anomalies to severe immunodeficiency (ID) and inflammation. The challenge for clinicians is that these mutations often present in vastly different ways across patients, sometimes with subtle or overlapping symptoms. Due to these complexities, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive clinical map of IKBKG mutations to improve early diagnosis and personalized care. On January 12, 2025, researchers from Chongqing Medical University published a comprehensive review (DOI: 10.1016/j.gendis.2025.101531) in Genes & Diseases, offering one of the most detailed clinical landscapes of IKBKG mutations to date. Analyzing 144 studies and 564 cases, the team systematically classified how specific genetic mutations correspond to a variety of rare disorders—including incontinentia pigmenti (IP), anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), ID, and the recently identified NDAS. By drawing connections between genetic variations and disease severity, the study equips clinicians with a clearer diagnostic framework for recognizing these complex conditions rooted in NF-κB dysfunction. The research revealed a striking range of disease presentations driven by IKBKG mutations. Most cases were diagnosed as IP (78%), followed by EDA-ID (15.8%), ID (5.0%), and NDAS (1.2%). Female patients predominantly had IP, while the other syndromes mainly affected males. Notably, some mutations—like E390RfsX5—appeared across multiple disease categories, complicating diagnosis and treatment decisions. Beyond symptom mapping, the study identified patterns in infection susceptibility. The detailed genotype-phenotype correlations developed in this review offer a roadmap for clinicians navigating ambiguous or overlapping presentations. This research sheds light on a notoriously elusive group of disorders. What makes IKBKG-related conditions so challenging is their variability—two patients with the same mutation can present entirely different symptoms. Our findings offer a much-needed clinical guide to help physicians recognize these cases earlier, improve outcomes, and reduce diagnostic delays, especially in children." The study offers a practical foundation for precision diagnostics in rare ID and inflammatory diseases. By linking specific IKBKG mutations to clinical outcomes, healthcare providers can better anticipate disease progression and tailor treatments—whether through immunoglobulin therapy, stem-cell transplantation, or emerging gene-editing technologies. The review also underscores the urgency of recognizing underdiagnosed cases, especially in infants and young children with unusual infections or skin and dental anomalies. As gene therapy research accelerates, this comprehensive mutation map may serve as a reference point for designing mutation-specific interventions, bringing hope to patients and families affected by these complex syndromes.

Building on prior research, investigators used Rome Foundation diagnostic tools to analyze nationally representative samples from both 2017 and 2023 - offering the first direct, population-level comparison of disorders of gut-brain interaction prevalence before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first population-level study to directly compare rates of disorders affecting gut-brain interaction before and after the pandemic, using a consistent methodology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She had no family history of heart disease or any related symptoms, such as breathlessness, palpitations, lightheadedness, heart racing, or chest pain, Dragolea said. He ordered a Holter monitor and confirmed that the patient had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He started her on weight control treatment and anticoagulants. It's an extension of Dr Google, when patients come to their physicians after having read about a medical condition online. How doctors react (or not) to their patient's wearable data and their legal liability in doing so has implications for both doctor and patient. For example, a Physicians and Malpractice Report 2024 found that A December 2024 survey from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, found that about two thirds of Americans regularly use wearable devices to monitor their heart, including smartwatches, portable blood pressure machines, fitness apps, and wearable movement/fitness trackers. Sharing guidelines can help calm a patient's nerves as well, if the doctor does conduct follow-up testing. Dragolea would ask patients about their family history, symptoms, how they felt when the wearables data were recorded, what the patient's concern is, and any expectations they have in handling it. “Nowadays, they will likely have done research about what it means,” he said. He doesn't recommend overinvestigating an issue that's less concerning. But if doing nothing will make the patient anxious, that's not good either — because they'll likely just make an appointment with another doctor. “The data is not always accurate, and it is not always data we can act on to instruct us in any particular problem or diagnosis,” Dragolea said. Some devices have FDA medical clearance, and others do not. Dragolea takes heart data from an Apple Watch more seriously than devices without this regulatory approval, he said. If a doctor has not heard of the patient's device, they can quickly search online to see if it has FDA clearance or if there are clinical studies citing methodology backing up the outcomes, said Bethany Corbin, a healthcare innovation attorney in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It can take 1 or 2 minutes to type in the device name plus ‘clinical trial' to see if it's vetted from a clinical perspective,” she said. If it's not, that doesn't mean it's inaccurate, but doctors should take the readings with a different grain of salt, she added. William Haas, MD, who specializes in wellness and integrative medicine, uses wearable data more frequently than many practices. When talking to patients about wearables, Haas tells them, “They're not diagnostics, but they're excellent early warning signs.” If a device shows low oxygen saturation at night, it could be sleep apnea. He asks if they wake up tired in the morning. “They may come up with a recovery index based on heart rate variability, but I'd be more apt to look at actual heart rate variation,” he said. And there's overlap with patient-submitted data, which can also be instructive. A lot of doctors are hesitant to recommend wearable technologies, as they haven't vetted them and don't know what's most accurate, said Corbin. “Patients and consumers know more about devices than doctors do,” she added. There can be practice liability if it's not set up to collect and track wearables data in the electronic health record, if they're not consistently monitoring incoming data, and there's no feedback loop. “I don't see doctors embracing digital health tools,” she said. Haas does incorporate wearables in his practice, which focuses on wellness. “In my practice I almost never make a recommendation to my patients that I don't use myself,” he said, as he wants to know how the device works and what potentially can be tracked. He also uses a platform [Headsuphealth] to aggregate smart data, lab testing, and self-reported questionnaires. Haas noted that “you're not legally required to act on every bit of data,” but there are legal risks if a doctor ignores a patient's symptoms alongside wearable alerts without proper documentation. It's an issue worth following, as more patients will report wearables data to doctors in the future, said Dragolea. “I believe the numbers will increase as more people get wearables, rings, watches, and earrings as well.” This will require a lot more conversations with patients about the data quality and maybe more help from regulators on what to do in these cases, he said.
