                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Almost every U.S. president had a sense of the special bond with Canada. Grey told him that “We are, so far as the real big things of the world are concerned, practically one people.” Taft, who had a cottage in Murray Bay, Que., agreed. Of course there was at times neglect and conflict with Ottawa, and some hard measures have been taken, with the presidents acting in their own country's interests. There was no president even remotely like the one today, who is acting like an imperialist pig in trying to subjugate Canada – demanding that we kowtow, or else. Opinion: In a Trump world without rules, what more can Carney do? With their enormous power advantage, other presidents were certainly capable of doing so – of, for example, fabricating a national security crisis and using it as a sledgehammer against this country. Winston Churchill once suggested during the war that Franklin Roosevelt take over Newfoundland, which was then en route to becoming a Canadian province, and turn it into a military base. Harry Truman was a straight-shooter who, when not preoccupied with other matters, accorded Canada great respect. In their book published last year, Building a Special Relationship, Asa McKercher and Michael Stevenson expertly chart how a consensus on cross-border ties between the two countries for the postwar period was fashioned by his administration. Well-documented is the great rapport Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush shared with Brian Mulroney, leading to their agreements on trade and acid rain. I recall seeing Mr. Reagan facing catcalls and booing while addressing a crowd in front of our parliament in 1981, but he didn't let it deter him from his vision of a North American accord, a forerunner to free trade. He once scolded cabinet ministers for advocating a tougher treatment of Canada. This friendly diplomacy continued with president Bill Clinton, a golfing buddy of Jean Chrétien's. Opinion: Canada must avoid rushing into a trade shakedown Gerald Ford brought Canada into the G7, and Jimmy Carter was a noted admirer. “I saw him once get teary-eyed recalling Canada's help in the Iranian hostage crisis,” recalled Arthur Milnes, an expert on presidents' relations with this country. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, though restrained by the protectionist ways of their Democratic Party, hardly had a cross word to say about this country. Teddy Roosevelt clashed with Wilfrid Laurier over the Alaska boundary line; John F. Kennedy had smash-ups with John Diefenbaker; Lyndon B. Johnson lambasted Lester Pearson on Vietnam; Richard Nixon's 10-per-cent tariff angered Pierre Trudeau; George W. Bush was irate over Mr. Chrétien's refusal to join his war on Iraq. Still, he travelled to Ottawa in 1972 and, instead of making demands, issued a pledge of allowing Canada greater independence from the U.S., which is just what Mr. Trudeau wanted. Most every president had a sense of the special bond with Canada. They understood and appreciated the different standing that Taft referenced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Members of Donald Trump's administration monitoring Online Safety Act with ‘great interest and concern' The White House has warned Sir Keir Starmer to stop threatening American tech companies amid mounting backlash over Britain's online safety law. Members of Donald Trump's administration are monitoring the Online Safety Act with “great interest and concern” after key allies said it was censoring free speech and imposing unfair burdens on US businesses. The law, which regulates online speech, allows the British government to levy massive fines on companies like Apple, Truth Social, and X if it finds that rules on hate speech have been broken. “President Trump has made it clear that free speech is one of our most cherished freedoms as Americans,” a senior US State Department official told The Telegraph. “Accordingly, we have taken decisive action against foreign actors who have engaged in extraterritorial censorship affecting our companies and fellow citizens.“We will continue to monitor developments in the UK with great interest and concern.” It has sparked outrage from US lawmakers and legal experts, who say the overreach is a threat by the UK to silence American companies and citizens. “Ask Apple and they would view it as a $500 million attack,” he told The Telegraph. Under the law, social media giants face fines of up to £18m ($24m), or 10 per cent of their annual revenue, if they fail to remove content deemed harmful from their platforms. Social media apps such as X, Reddit and TikTok have been forced to introduce age verification checks since the bill came into effect last week. Since then, the Trump administration has also raised questions about the conviction and sentencing of several high profile cases like that of Lucy Connolly. After rumours spread online online that the killer was an illegal migrant, Connolly called for “deportation now” and added: “Set fire to all the... [asylum] hotels... for all I care”. Three Court of Appeal judges rejected the 42-year-old's case application last week, meaning she will not be released before August. And no case has raised concerns in Washington more than the prosecution of Livia Tossici-Bolt, an anti-abortion campaigner. It is important that the UK respect and protect freedom of expression.” Ms Tossici-Bolt, who could have been handed a prison sentence, thanked the Trump administration for its intervention. In a speech at the Munich security conference in February, JD Vance, the US vice-president, cited British pro-life campaigner Adam Smith-Connor, who too was convicted for breaching a buffer zone outside an abortion clinic. Before his spectacular fallout with the president, Elon Musk was understood to be pushing Mr Trump to raise curbs on social media regulation in trade talks with the UK. Mr Musk, who has described himself as a free speech absolutist, said Britain's online safety laws amount to “suppression of the people”. Several American businesses are now poised to bring a federal lawsuit against Ofcom. Preston Byrne, managing partner of Byrne & Storm, PC who is representing some of the US sites, said no foreign power should be allowed to “cross our waterline”. “I am instructed by multiple American websites to bring a federal lawsuit against Ofcom,” he said. No foreign power will be allowed to cross our waterline with unconstitutional and illegal orders.”</p>

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing widespread criticism after he announced on Tuesday that the U.K. is prepared to recognize a Palestinian state — but only if Israel's genocide in Gaza continues and Israel does not agree to a ceasefire. Announcing the decision to his cabinet, Starmer “reiterated that there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas and that our demands on Hamas remain, that they must release all the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, accept that they will play no role in the government of Gaza, and disarm,” a statement by the government said. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Palestinians and advocates for Palestinian rights have decried the announcement for using Palestinian statehood as a bargaining chip, telling Palestinians that the only way they can be granted a state is if their suffering continues. To The Hague, there he must be,” said Gaza journalist Abubaker Abed. “Not a single time he named the perpetrators Israel for the starving babies or the catastrophic humanitarian crisis,” Abed went on, saying that Starmer makes it sound like “aid was cut off arbitrarily, babies were starved naturally, and people suffered unintentionally.” U.K. activist group Palestine Solidarity Campaign condemned the announcement, saying that it only gives Israel more power to make decisions on Palestinian statehood, while completely cutting Palestinians out of the equation. “Keir Starmer, who refuses even to recognise that Israel is violating international law in Gaza, is offering to recognise a Palestinian state if, and only if, Israel's starvation and atrocities are still ongoing in two months' time,” the campaign said. “If not, what is now being presented as a step towards recognising the Palestinian people's right to self-determination will be rescinded. His grotesque message to Palestinians is that state recognition may come, but only if and when many, many more of you are dead.” “Our demands on this shameful government remain the same: end all arms sales to Israel, impose widespread sanctions, and stop the genocide, now.”Starmer and other European leaders have faced scrutiny recently for putting out statements supposedly condemning Israel's violence in Gaza without taking action to stop it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  Samson Inocencio Jr. is national director for International Justice Mission (IJM) in the Philippines and the regional Vice President of IJM's OSEC Hub, working against the online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC). On this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, I find myself holding two truths in tension: deep despair and profound hope. As part of International Justice Mission (IJM), I lead a team in the Philippines committed to protecting children from this horrific form of human trafficking, where young victims are trafficked to produce child sexual abuse material (CSAM), especially in live videos. At the same time, I am hopeful because we have seen incredible success in our partnership with the Philippine government to address this crime. The message was clear: when justice systems are equipped and accountable, they can stop trafficking. ‘A moral stain': Former UK prime minister, Global Commission deliver new report calling to eradicate modern slavery by 2030 But despite this progress and sustained commitment from governments, this particular form of technology-facilitated trafficking continues to ravage communities in the Philippines and around the world. It has become clear to me that we cannot rely solely on the efforts of individual governments or bilateral partnerships to adequately address the tidal wave of violence against children on the internet. “Technology companies play a pivotal role in protecting victims and vulnerable individuals from being exploited through the use of their online platforms and must be part of the solution to combat human trafficking,” according to the 2024 TIP Report. Countries like the US where sex offenders driving the demand for this crime often live — and the online platforms, payment processors and money transfer services that inadvertently enable it — must take action. This comes at a timely moment for US policymakers, who have been increasingly attentive to the crisis of children being exploited online. It is time for US Congress to pass the STOP CSAM Act (H.R.3921 and S.1829). Momentum is building for this legislation, which was examined at a March hearing before the US Senate Judiciary Committee and advanced on a bipartisan basis by that committee on June 12 in a unanimous vote of 22-0. If enacted, this bill would allow victims to seek legal recourse against online platforms that promote or aid and abet their exploitation — a significant step toward the goal of protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation online. Sold for sex as a teen, she's now helping AI catch child predators The STOP CSAM Act would also help improve the quality of reports submitted by online platforms to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline by requiring platforms to report specific details of child sexual exploitation. Online platforms are already required to report this form of child sex trafficking under the REPORT Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law in May 2024. The STOP CSAM Act strengthens existing reporting obligations and emphasizes the importance of including particular data points in CyberTipline reports that could help identify or locate a child who may be actively being exploited — including user and location information, content details and whether content was previously viewed. Stopping online sexual exploitation of children is a moral duty — and it should be enforced by increased legislative action in the US. Reflecting on the last two decades of this work, I have undoubtedly witnessed humanity's darkest side.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts say thawing of permafrost due to climate breakdown is causing increase in rock collapses across Alps In recent days, visitors reported hearing loud booms followed by rockfalls and thick clouds of dust rising from Monte Pelmo in the Val di Zoldo after rocky pinnacles broke away and crashed down into the valley below in the municipality of Selva di Cadore in Italy's Belluno province. Another collapse was recorded on Cima Falkner, where experts say the entire area is undergoing a process of erosion linked to rising temperatures and the wider climate emergency. “As a result, all climbing routes and hiking trails directly affected by the area have been immediately closed. Following reports of rockfalls, a technical inspection was conducted on Tuesday by the geological service with the support of a helicopter unit, which confirmed that “the entire summit is affected by an ongoing geomorphological process, likely linked to permafrost degradation”. Rockfalls have always occurred in the Dolomites, but experts this year warned of a striking rise in the number of collapses, driven by extreme heat and weather events intensified by the climate crisis. “Never before have we seen such an incredible increase in rockfalls,” Piero Carlesi, president of the scientific committee of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), told la Repubblica. He added: “Mountains, by definition, are destined to collapse – they won't remain as we know them for ever. What's different now is that we're seeing a clear acceleration of these processes, driven by heat and extreme weather events intensified by the climate crisis.” Cold temperatures, causing water seeping into rock fractures to freeze, acted as a kind of glue, holding the rocks together. But now, Carlesi said, with rising temperatures, that glue was disappearing and fractured rock was increasingly breaking off and tumbling down gullies. Their report said Marmolada was losing between 7cm and 10cm of depth a day and that over the past five years, 70 hectares (173 acres) of its surface had disappeared. In late June 2025, Mont Blanc experienced a record-breaking heatwave with temperatures remaining above zero for an extended period at high altitudes, including the summit. Bernard Vion, a 66-year-old mountain guide, has been walking and climbing in the French Alps around Pralognan-la-Vanoise since he was a child and accompanies visitors on climbs. “We have never seen rock falls of such intensity and regularity before. The permafrost, which is like a kind of cement holding the rocks together, is melting, meaning they have no cohesion and they collapse,” he said. “For several years now we have had to develop the ability to observe these phenomenon and spot the warning signs. Even for us guides this is difficult and I worry about amateur climbers who don't have the same mountain culture.” He said “of course” this was due to climate breakdown. Anyone who doubts this should come to the mountains.”</p>

Besides public transport and taxis, do you know any other ways to travel long distances without driving?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's attempts to spread Kremlin propaganda in occupied areas of Ukraine by replacing home TV satellite dishes with ones that only receive Russian broadcasts, have been met with resistance from local residents, according to reports from the Ukrainian Resistance Center (URC). Television, mass and social media are key instruments used to spread Russian propaganda and russify residents of temporarily occupied territories. In just one week, over 1,000 pieces of equipment that enable access to Ukrainian television were taken away, the URC reported on July 21. The "Russkiy Mir" satellite project was launched in December 2022, aiming to provide "citizens of new territories" with access to Russian television. The project was implemented by Russian President Vladimir Putin's political coalition, All-Russia People's Front. The project's official website says it was created specifically for Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporozhia oblasts, and Crimea. The Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson, Volodymyr Saldo, said on June 23 that the Kherson Oblast residents can replace TV equipment for free from July 1 until Nov. 30. Previously, on Feb. 11, Saldo issued a decree recognizing Ukrainian TV satellites as instruments of "enemy propaganda" and prohibited watching it. On March 31, Yellow Ribbon resistance movement activists said that residents had been warned of systematic inspections in the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, with fines and forced confiscation imposed on those using satellite dishes capable of receiving Ukrainian broadcasts. Additionally, private homeowners would be required to dismantle any "suspicious" equipment. Local authorities claimed 25,000 "Russkiy Mir" satellites were installed in Kherson Oblast during 2023 and 2024. Resistance in Russian-occupied territories is dangerous — anyone deemed to be defying the occupying authorities faces the very real possibility of imprisonment and torture. During peace negotiations, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 that Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump recently set out a 10-day ultimatum demanding a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, warning that failure to meet the deadline could result in penalties against nations doing business with Moscow. At a press briefing, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce was asked whether these measures are “too blunt an instrument,” potentially harming US allies. This has clearly been a consideration from the beginning. Russian officials have dismissed Trump's threat, calling it harmful to peace efforts in Ukraine. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said earlier this month that no additional pressure will derail Russia's pursuit of its national interests. Trump has acknowledged there is no certainty that his latest pressure campaign will alter Moscow's approach to the Ukraine conflict. Meanwhile, foreign policy hawks in Congress are pushing for legislation that would authorize tariffs of up to 500% on nations that continue to import Russian oil and gas. China, India, and Türkiye – all major buyers of Russian energy – could face sanctions under the proposed policy. ”Such a move could cause global oil prices to skyrocket,” the New York Times warned on Tuesday, adding that secondary sanctions would likely escalate what it described as Trump's “global trade war.” The newspaper added that earlier efforts by Western nations to limit Russian revenue through an oil price cap “largely faltered.”</p>

NEW YORK, July 30. /TASS/. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is considering the possibility of running for Tennessee governor next year, so he will have to leave his post as Pentagon chief, NBC News reported citing sources.

According to the sources, over the past three weeks Hegseth has been seriously discussing the possibility of running and starting an election campaign. However, according to Pentagon rules, Hegseth's participation in the gubernatorial election will require his resignation from his post as Defense Secretary. This will be the largest reshuffle in the leadership of the US defense department, NBC News noted.

However, Assistant Secretary of the Pentagon for Public Affairs Sean Parnell denied this information in a comment to the TV channel and said that "Hegseth's focus remains solely on serving under President Trump" and "advancing the America First mission at the Department of Defense."

"Fake news NBC is so desperate for attention, they are shopping around a made up story… again. Only two options exist: either the ‘sources' are imaginary or these reporters are getting punked," Parnell added.

According to NBC News sources, if Hegseth does announce that he is running for governor, Trump may temporarily hand over his duties to US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll or Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. In May, Taiwan shuttered its last nuclear reactor, completing a process of denuclearization that had unfolded over four decades. But once military rule ended, in 1987, antinuclear sentiment began to take hold. Taiwan's early democratic activists feared that they could have a Chernobyl disaster of their own and associated nuclear power with Taiwan's authoritarian past. In the following years, Taiwan's government let licenses lapse for six functioning nuclear reactors—all with good track records—and halted the construction of two more. In doing so, they inadvertently undermined the island's energy security. This reliance on energy imports could easily be exploited, especially by China, which has its eyes on unifying with Taiwan. Taiwan supplies nearly all the advanced logic chips that U.S. technology firms use to power artificial intelligence. Chipmakers, both from Taiwan and elsewhere, are now trying to set up more advanced chip factories within the United States. Taiwan is, in some ways, already facing an energy crisis: Taiwan's overtaxed electricity infrastructure is struggling to keep up with roaring AI chip production. Taiwan has spent years preparing for the threat of Chinese harassment. Taipei, for example, has doubled its defense spending over the past decade and now requires young men to serve a year of military service. But the Taiwanese people, like those in many other democracies, see themselves as part of a global commons and have thought about their energy system largely through an environmental lens. The island's energy policy is aimed at moving away from nuclear and coal in favor of renewables and natural gas. Such shifts were underscored by international pressure, especially from many of the U.S. companies that buy chips and other components from Taiwan; Apple, for instance, increasingly demands that local suppliers limit emissions. Just 12 percent of Taiwan's electricity mix came from renewables in 2024, falling short of the government's intention to hit 20 percent by 2025. The culprits are varied: onerous local-content requirements, land use limitations, and broader rising costs. When it comes to construction, Taiwan is more like California than Guangdong, with many people objecting to having new energy infrastructure built in their backyards. That leaves Taiwan little flexibility to surge imports or repair facilities. A third terminal is set to come online this summer, but it is years behind schedule because of environmental protests. In normal operating conditions, the power grid's reserve margins—that is, its buffer to generate extra electricity to meet unexpected shocks—regularly fall below ten percent, levels that would be concerning in the United States. For example, half of Taiwan's chipmaking science parks faced rolling outages in May 2021. Taiwan's insecurity is also exacerbated by its limited capacity to store energy. The United States and Europe can, thanks to their geology, stockpile months' worth of natural gas in depleted underground caverns, but the islands of East Asia—Japan, Korea, and Taiwan—must use tanks, which are much more costly. Taiwan's neighbors have taken steps to address this issue. Japan, for instance, spent the past 50 years bolstering its energy security by building extensive storage and creating its own LNG tanker fleet, now the world's largest, which both transports gas and acts as a form of floating storage. South Korea, meanwhile, maintains a 30-to-40-day supply of LNG to last through its cold winters. Taiwan, by contrast, can store enough for just ten days. In many ways, Germany serves as a useful cautionary tale for Taiwan: both closed well-functioning nuclear reactors, doubled down on a fragile natural gas import strategy, and hoped that renewables would grow fast enough to fill the gaps. In Germany's case, it grew reliant on Russian fuel, and when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Berlin had to scramble to divest and find other sources. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the people of Taiwan have begun to understand that they must take their own security—including energy security—more seriously. They identify with Ukraine, which endures nightly assaults on its power grid. They also see that Ukraine, and Europe more broadly, has suffered economic costs because of energy disruptions. People in Taiwan seem to be changing their minds. According to a poll conducted in August 2024 by Taiwan's CommonWealth Magazine, for example, nearly 70 percent of Taiwanese now wish to preserve nuclear power. Yet in Taiwan's spirited democracy, the antinuclear minority remains powerful and well organized. And there are few outside technical experts that Taiwan can turn to for advice on how to change course, in part because it is not a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's International Energy Agency, whose remit is to analyze and mitigate energy security risks. Despite its extensive work in international energy affairs, for instance, the U.S. Department of Energy has largely ignored Taiwan because of its diplomatic status and Washington's bureaucratic inertia. A more formal analysis of Taiwan's energy tradeoffs, using the same sorts of sophisticated models the U.S. government uses for itself, would help Taiwan's Energy Bureau assess risks and opportunities for changing its system. The U.S. technology sector is also resuscitating nuclear power to meet AI energy needs: Microsoft has signed a contract with Constellation Energy, an electric utility company, to reopen a reactor at Three Mile Island. Taiwan could similarly restart the reactors it has closed over the past few years, including those at Maanshan and Kuosheng. Current and retired leaders of Taiwanese technology firms, such as Pegatron and United Microelectronics Company, have advocated for doing so. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Energy should hold technical talks with its Taiwanese counterparts on relicensing closed reactors, assessing seismic risks to nuclear plants, and managing spent fuel. Cooperation over energy security should go beyond the nuclear realm. They could also establish a working group, made up of people from the public and private sectors, to propose ways to speed up the development of gas storage and handle disruptions to LNG shipping. The fate of Taiwan's democracy may well rest in its ability to produce and store energy. If the island can stockpile more of it and resurrect its nuclear reactors, it would be in a much better position to withstand invasion or disruption. The United States should help Taiwan improve its energy security, not just for the island's sake but for its own. Stacie E. Goddard, Ronald R.
