They said: 'Matthew McConaughey had to do a fairly robust death scene. Let's just say… his acting has come a long way since then.' Bell was caught by police in Pasadena, Texas shortly after the shooting - but while on $125,000 bail, he absconded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok has removed a video by businesswoman and beauty influencer Huda Kattan in which she promoted conspiracy theories about Israel. The Iraqi-American entrepreneur, who is founder and CEO of the popular Huda Beauty brand, said in a video posted on Sunday that Israel was responsible for "every world war" including World War One and World War Two, as well as the September 11 and 7 October attacks. The American Jewish Committee said she was "using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories". TikTok confirmed it removed the video on Tuesday for violating its community guidelines, but did not give further comment. Kattan and Huda Beauty have not responded to requests for comment. In the video to her 1.7 million followers, Kattan claimed there was evidence that "Israel has been behind World War One, World War Two", as well as al-Qaeda's 11 September 2001 attacks on the US and the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Kattan repeated a range of other claims including unfounded accusations that Israel protects paedophiles. "These dangerous and historically baseless accusations echo some of the oldest and most pernicious antisemitic tropes," the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement. A spokesperson for the group, which aims to counter antisemitism, told the BBC: "Having such a big platform for your business and choosing to use it to spread antisemitic conspiracy theories is inflammatory, irresponsible and dangerous." In a statement to BBC News, the American Jewish Committee said: "This isn't 'criticism of Israel'. It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions. "A beauty company spreading this ugliness isn't just ironic - it's dangerous. This rhetoric must be called out, exposed, and condemned." Kattan was named on the BBC 100 Women list in 2023 and was ranked 15th on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest online creators that year.

Okay, for some of you the word “famous” may be used extremely loosely here but for people like Maitlynn, it couldn't be more accurate.

This California family thinks their Ring camera captured footage of two “alien-like” figures walking by their Compton home, so they took to social media to try to get some other opinions.

Lucky for the Ortizes (and let's be real, all of us), THE authority on paranormal investigations, Zak Bagans, is weighing in!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural is returning with a new series, but it may not be what fans of the horror show expected. Over the course of its impressive 15-season run, Supernatural became a beloved series. It followed the exploits of Sam and Dean Winchester as they battled various forces of evil, like demons, vampires, and even angels, offering regular doses of humor and emotional depth. Supernatural has even tried their hand at different spinoff ideas to keep the longevity of the IP going, with mostly lackluster results. However, the fan-favorite show is returning with new stories, but it may not be what fans of Supernatural were hoping to get for the next iteration of Sam and Dean. This Supernatural actor's "Devilish" charm is sure to make him a fantastic choice for The Dark Tower's Man in Black! Several spinoffs of Supernatural were attempted, with some ideas pursued while the show was still airing. Wayward Sisters was an attempt at a spinoff in the show's thirteenth season, with an episode of Supernatural acting as a backdoor pilot for the idea that would have seen recurring character Sheriff Jody Mills leading her own series of female protagonists. However, with a fanbase as loyal as Supernatural's, the characters are likely to continue on in a new form or spinoff. There have been rumors of a revival series, which remains to be officially confirmed, but for now, there is a new Supernatural series on the way that could satiate fans. Supernatural is set to tell new stories set during the show's run in a new comic book series. The new Supernatural comic will debut in October. It is written by lauded author Greg Pak and artist Eder Messias. The two creators have also worked together previously on Captain America. Pak stated, "Fans of Supernatural know the show is a blast, and it's an enormous pleasure and privilege to be able to dig into this wild world." We're going for fun and grounded, and then we're going to absolutely cut loose when the time comes. When a show lasts as long as Supernatural, it endures for a reason, and Sam and Dean have repeatedly proven to be that magic. While other attempts at spinoff shows feel likely, fans would love a revival series to bring their beloved characters back for more episodes. Rumors of a revival series have been hinted at, with the stars of Supernatural, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, reportedly both on the same page about things. Even Castiel actor Misha Collins has expressed similar sentiments about the possible revival. I think a limited series would be great. Padalecki also succeeded with Walker, and Ackles has even voiced Batman several times for DC in recent years. While an official revival series remains to be seen, Supernatural fans have a run of comics to help flesh out their beloved horror world even more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Her work has previously appeared in Parade, The New York Post, Seventeen, PopCrush and more. Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in 1975 is one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in American history, and authorities say it's unlikely that any definitive answers will emerge nearly five decades later. Hoffa was a celebrity and controversial figure during his time as a union leader, attracting ire from the Kennedys and the Mafia alike. While the truth of what really happened to Hoffa when he disappeared remains unknown, authorities and even some mobsters have several theories — and some alleged confessions. Here's what we know about the missing persons case, and why it's not likely to ever be solved. Hoffa reportedly understood his father's death was linked to his working conditions in coal mines, which sparked a lifelong passion for workers' rights, according to Teamster. The future union president left school when he was 14 to work in warehouses for Kroger grocery stores to help support his family. In 1932, at just 19 years old, Hoffa organized his first strike to successfully protest poor working conditions. In addition to being an activist for organized labor, Hoffa also supported racial justice and civil rights leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and prohibited segregation within any area of the Teamsters. Later in life, The New York Times reported, he also became an advocate for prison reform. Hoffa infamously clashed with Robert F. Kennedy, who was an attorney for the Senate's Improper Activities in Labor and Management panel (also called the McClellan Committee), which investigated racketeering. In March 1957, police arrested the union leader for allegedly trying to pay a McClellan Committee aide for information, The New York Times reported. After taking office, JFK appointed Robert to attorney general, and he focused his attention on Hoffa once more with a "Get Hoffa" squad dedicated to investigating the Teamsters president. On March 4, 1964, Hoffa was convicted of two counts of jury tampering in a previous 1962 Nashville, Tenn., criminal trial and acquitted on a third, according to The New York Times. In a separate case that July, Hoffa was convicted on three counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy for misusing nearly $2 million from Teamsters' pension funds. In the Nashville jury tampering case, Hoffa was sentenced to eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine, per The New York Times. While his appeals didn't work, Hoffa still got out of prison early: He served four years, nine months and 16 days before then-President Nixon commuted his sentence on Dec. 23, 1971. Hoffa went free under a conditional commutation that specified he couldn't "engage in the direct or indirect management of any labor organization," The New York Times reported, until March 1980 — which is when his full 13-year sentence would have ended. Hoffa was last seen on July 30, 1975, and to this day, what truly happened to him remains a mystery, but the prevailing theory is that Hoffa was murdered in a mob hit, which authorities outlined in "The Hoffex Memo." Hoffa served his time in prison alongside Anthony "Tony Pro" Provenzano, a member of the Genovese crime family and the president of the Teamsters' Union City, N.J., chapter, and reportedly disrespected him, former FBI organized crime investigator Joe Brennan told ABC 7 Chicago. Upon Hoffa's release, he reportedly eyed a return to power in the Teamsters despite the conditions of his commutation from Nixon. The day Hoffa, who was 62 at the time, went missing, he was scheduled to meet Provenzano and Detroit Mafia boss Anthony Giacalone at 2 p.m. at the upscale Machus Red Fox Restaurant in Bloomfield Township, Mich. Hoffa called his wife at about 2:15 p.m. to tell her he'd been stood up and would be home by 4 p.m., but never made it. Brennan has said he believes that Hoffa was abducted from his car in the restaurant parking lot and killed. His body has never been recovered, and theories about where it ended up vary: Brennan says it was stuffed in an oil drum and driven to New Jersey to show Provenzano, then either buried under the Meadowlands or thrown into the Atlantic Ocean. A strand of Hoffa's hair was found in the vehicle, though DNA only revealed the match in 2001, ABC News reported. Other theories place Hoffa's body at various sites in Michigan, Jersey City, the Florida Everglades and Gardena, Calif., but his remains have still never been recovered. He was declared dead in 1982, but his case is still open. No charges have ever been filed in relation to his disappearance, but some believe mobster Salvatore "Sally Bugs" Briguglio was the killer.</p>
