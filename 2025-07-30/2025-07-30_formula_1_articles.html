                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cooldown Room: Belgium's red flag wholesome moments and commentary confessions! Yuki Tsunoda was unable to capitalise on his best Qualifying result of the season for Red Bull as his Belgian Grand Prix unraveled following a "miscommunication" and strategy error. Tsunoda's race suffered a significant blow in the first pit stop period as, with the track drying, a small handful of drivers gambled and came in to swap to slick tyres. However, Tsunoda – and a small handful of others – stayed out one further lap, which given the length of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, proved to be very costly. When the Red Bull racer pitted, he tumbled from P7 to 12th and found himself in a DRS train behind Pierre Gasly's Alpine. “I requested to switch to the dry tyre, they called me way too late, I unfortunately had just passed the pit entry when they called me. “One lap in these kinds of conditions is very decisive; I lost five positions and was stuck behind a bit all the race. Tsunoda fought hard to make it back to P11 and had DRS at times in his quest to overtake Gasly, but running in the dirty air for so long also cost him tyre wear, and he was picked off late on by both Ollie Bearman in the Haas and a much fresher-shod Nico Hulkenberg. “Overall, a frustrating race and disappointing not to be in the points. Tsunoda remains under pressure to put together some strong results – since joining Red Bull, he has one ninth and two P10 finishes in the 11 Grands Prix he has contested with the team, plus a few points from finishing P6 in the Sprint in Miami. Belgium initially looked like it might be a turning point for Tsunoda, who on Saturday finally received the same package of upgrades that Max Verstappen has been running. But sadly, his best Qualifying of the year and first Q3 showing since Miami did not result in any score.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cooldown Room: Belgium's red flag wholesome moments and commentary confessions! Find out who impressed our judges with their performances at the Belgian Grand Prix. On a weekend where Spa-Francorchamps was engulfed in both bright sunshine and heavy rain, Oscar Piastri came out on top and extended his points lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris. But how did our Power Rankings list for the weekend shake out? Check out the latest scores and overall leaderboard below... Having lost a position to Russell's Mercedes in the early wet running, Albon settled into a rhythm and was able to keep Hamilton's faster Ferrari behind thanks to a superior straightline advantage which yielded sixth at the chequered flag. He never stretched his advantage over the Dutchman to more than a handful of seconds, but showed Ferrari's new suspension package was a step forward for the Scuderia. Only able to grab fourth for the Grand Prix with more downforce applied and despite his best efforts, the four-time and reigning World Champion was unable to find his way around Leclerc's Ferrari. Having held Tsunoda's Red Bull and the Haas of Bearman at bay throughout, the Frenchman was rewarded with a point having been promoted to 10th when Hulkenberg's Kick Sauber ahead stopped for a second time. Was left to follow Verstappen and Piastri home in the Sprint but made amends with a Grand Prix pole position. Despite being helped by a rolling start and clear vision once action got underway on Sunday, the McLaren man was unable to prevent Piastri from overtaking along the Kemmel Straight. Pitting a lap later and for the hard tyre meant Norris had a mountain to climb, with several small mistakes ultimately consigning him to second. The Brazilian's impressive run of form continued in Belgium as he secured his second points finish from three races after finishing P9. Made it through to Q3, out-qualifying Kick Sauber team mate Hulkenberg again, and showed more pace than the German as he was allowed to move ahead after falling behind in the early laps. A spin and then losing his best lap time to track limits in both the Sprint and Grand Prix Qualifying sessions respectively meant Hamilton exited Q1 twice. His reward was P7 after being unable to find a way round Albon's Williams. But there was some joy for the Haas driver, as seventh in the Sprint meant he claimed his first points since Bahrain back in April as he utilised a low-drag set-up to reach Q3. Russell, Ocon and Hadjar all nearly made it inside this week's top 10. Russell took a lonely fifth on Sunday, while both Ocon and Hadjar impressed during the Sprint.</p>
