                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed on order imposing a universal 50% tariff on copper imports, the latest metal he has targeted with a steep import tax. Copper miners Freeport-McMoRan and Southern Copper were down about 10% and more than 6%, respectively. The sell-off, if it holds through Thursday's trading session, will mark the metal's largest single-day decline since 1989. The new, higher copper tariffs go into effect Friday, according to a fact sheet released by the White House. The Trump administration says that the new duties, which follow 50% U.S. tariffs already imposed on steel and aluminum, are aimed at boosting domestic industries and addressing "trade imbalances." But experts warn that they could raise prices on all sorts of products, ranging from construction materials to electronics, that utilize the versatile metal. And Trump's other sector-specific tariffs and ongoing trade investigations, which target imported autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals, could dampen overall U.S. growth, according to the Tax Foundation. Copper is the third-most-consumed metal, behind iron and aluminum. The U.S. imports nearly half of the copper it uses, most of which comes from Chile, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey. — CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON – A divided Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, despite a barrage of criticism from President Donald Trump and dissents from two top officials. The federal funds rate will continue to be set in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. The level sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending, but influences a slew of other rates across the economy. However, the decision met opposition from Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both of whom have advocated for the Fed to start easing in acknowledgement that inflation is under control and the labor market could start weakening soon. This was the first time since late 1993 that multiple governors cast no votes on a rate decision. The post-meeting statement offered only a couple changes in how the committee views economic conditions. "The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. The Wednesday statement said uncertainty about conditions "remains elevated," also a less upbeat assessment from June, which noted that uncertainty had "diminished but remains elevated." A slower economy would boost the argument for lower interest rates, though the committee stopped short of endorsing that view. Markets had overwhelmingly expected no action on rates, but stocks headed lower after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference that the committee hadn't yet determined whether it would cut rates at its September meeting. "We have made no decisions about September," he said. He further explained that the central bank is watching the potential impact of tariffs on inflation. "Our obligation is to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem," he said. Traders had been expecting the Fed to cut in September, but after Powell's comments, the likelihood of a quarter percentage point reduction slipped to 46% from 64%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The committee normally has 12 voters but was without Governor Adriana Kugler at the July meeting. "It is an exceedingly rare occurrence when two Fed governors dissent at an FOMC meeting, but it was the most well telegraphed dissention ever at today's FOMC meeting," said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. McIntyre said he expects the Fed will cut in September, barring any major surprises in the July and August employment reports. The news follows a remarkable stretch for an entity with great sway over the economy but one that has mostly avoided the political fray, at least overtly. Trump has called for Powell's resignation and even toyed with the legally questionable idea of firing him. Though he's largely backed off the threat of sacking Powell, the president has kept up the criticism of a former appointee whom he now regularly calls "Too Late." In addition to the hectoring over rates, the Trump administration has ripped Powell and the central bank for cost overruns on a massive remodeling project at two of the Fed's buildings in Washington. Wednesday brought more news that could influence the Fed's path, Trump's badgering notwithstanding. The Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product grew at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, considerably stronger than expected. Though much of the headline gain was propelled by a reversion of a massive import surge in the first quarter ahead of Trump's tariffs, the report nevertheless reinforced the notion of an economy still on solid ground. Core inflation was a bit higher at 2.5%, but both numbers plunged from their first-quarter levels and neared the Fed's 2% bogey. "We at the White House 100% respect their independence, but we also like to respect their analysis," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Wednesday on CNBC. That's going to be a really big, positive story." The Fed next will gather at its annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has been a target of criticism by President Donald Trump for his handling of legal cases involving former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Shortly after those sanctions were announced, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil, with a statement from the White House referencing de Moraes. "President Trump is defending American companies from extortion, protecting American persons from political persecution, safeguarding American free speech from censorship, and saving the American economy from being subject to the arbitrary edicts of a tyrannical foreign judge," the statement said. The sanctions come five months after Trump's social media company, Trump Media, sued de Moraes for over an order by the justice to the video hosting company Rumble to suspend the accounts of a "well-known politically outspoken user" of Rumble, whose services Trump Media uses. Trump previously said that the 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil are partly in retaliation for the ongoing criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro, an ally of his. De Moraes last year drew the ire of mega-billionaire Elon Musk, who at the time was a close ally over Trump, by blocking Musk's X social media platform nationwide in Brazil for failing to comply with orders banning some user accounts and to remove certain content. "Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies," said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a statement Wednesday announcing the sanctions, which would block any property de Moraes might have in the United States. "De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions — including against former President Jair Bolsonaro," Bessent said. "Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens." The Washington Post on July 17 reported that Eduardo Bolsonaro, a son of Bolsonaro, was "working closely with the White House to impose sanctions on" de Moraes. Eduardo Bolsonaro is a federal congressman in Brazil. De Moraes is the so-called rapporteur of cases against Jair Bolsonaro, and is sitting on a five-judge Supreme Court panel that is overseeing the former president's trial for allegedly trying to stage a coup against sitting Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and other charges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geothermal energy has been used for thousands of years, powering heating systems as early as the 14th century. Beyond geothermal, there's superhot geothermal, which uses ultra-deep drilling to access extremely hot rocks, extracting 5 to 10 times more power per well. Quaise Energy, a  Massachusetts-based startup, is in the market developing the technology, which involves an electromagnetic beam that vaporizes rock. "To access the resource at a scale that actually matters, we have to drill hotter first and deeper second," said Carlos Araque, CEO of Quaise. The company is working to scale it for commercial use, and demonstrated its technology with oil and gas company Nabors Industries in June. While the drilling itself is costlier, the energy output is so much higher that it's ultimately a cost savings for the heat. "We intend to build the first in the world superhot, or super critical geothermal power plant, to show exactly that 10X output that you get by going hotter," Araque said. Quaise plans to pilot the plant near Bend, Oregon, and hopes to have it ready by 2028. Nabors sees it as a very timely play. Nabors is also an investor in Quaise. The company has raised a total of $103 million. Sierra said the technology could also help repurpose a significant portion of the labor force that's working in oil and gas. At a geothermal event in Washington, D.C., in March, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright showed strong support for geothermal energy. He said it could help with the growth of artificial intelligence and manufacturing and lower prices for electricity. Wright also noted that President Donald Trump specifically mentioned geothermal, along with nuclear and hydropower, in his National Energy Emergency executive order. The recently passed tax and spending bill kept funding for geothermal, originally part of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, while cutting money for other forms of renewable energy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a letter outlining his vision for "personal superintelligence" Wednesday, giving investors a glimpse into his artificial intelligence strategy ahead of Meta's second-quarter earnings report. The company has shelled out billions of dollars hiring top AI researchers and engineers in recent weeks, and Wall Street will be listening for what Zuckerberg has to say about the spending spree. Zuckerberg did not outline specific products or applications that Meta plans to build in his letter, but he said he views superintelligence as a tool for "personal empowerment" over automation and efficiency. "This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output," Zuckerberg wrote. Meta has been racing to keep up with competitors like OpenAI and Google. In June, the company announced plans to invest $14.3 billion into Scale AI and hired its CEO Alexandr Wang. Weeks later, Zuckerberg revealed a new business unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs, where employees will work on foundation models such as the open-source Llama family of AI models, products and Fundamental AI Research projects. Wang is leading the lab as Meta's chief AI officer, and the company has also recruited talent from Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. Investors have seen Zuckerberg make expensive decisions around emerging technologies before. In recent years, Meta has poured billions of dollars into building the metaverse, a computing platform involving digital worlds that are accessible through VR and augmented reality devices. He published a similar letter about his vision for the technology in 2021. "The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take," Zuckerberg wrote, "and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress," Zuckerberg wrote in a letter published on Meta's blog and social media platforms. "But perhaps even more important is that superintelligence has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose," he said. "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," he added. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." Meta is bullish on the form factor and has developed and launched multiple models of AI-powered smart glasses, with its AI Ray-Bans being the most popular. It's also working to develop a more advanced version of AI glasses with integrated displays, showing off a prototype of the technology, called "Orion," last year. If the term "superintelligence" sounds familiar, that's because it's one of the phrases AI companies have used to describe a yet-to-be-reached breakthrough generally defined as when AI is capable or more capable than human intelligence. Another similar phrase is "artificial general intelligence," or AGI. The Meta CEO has aggressively recruited established AI talent, including hiring Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang to lead the new lab, and offering jaw-dropping offers to top engineers at OpenAI, Apple, and other AI firms. Over the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. It seems clear that in the coming years, AI will improve all our existing systems and enable the creation and discovery of new things that aren't imaginable today. But it is an open question what we will direct superintelligence towards. In some ways this will be a new era for humanity, but in others it's just a continuation of historical trends. Advances in technology have steadily freed much of humanity to focus less on subsistence and more on the pursuits we choose. At each step, people have used our newfound productivity to achieve more than was previously possible, pushing the frontiers of science and health, as well as spending more time on creativity, culture, relationships, and enjoying life. I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress. But perhaps even more important is that superintelligence has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose. As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be. This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well. The intersection of technology and how people live is Meta's focus, and this will only become more important in the future. Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful. Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices. The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society. Meta believes strongly in building personal superintelligence that empowers everyone. I'm excited to focus Meta's efforts towards building this future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you ask Donna Morris, there's one behavior that's the ultimate red flag an employee won't get far in the workplace: when someone is a "Debbie Downer." Prior to her current role, she spent 17 years at Adobe in a variety of leadership positions — and throughout her career, she's learned a thing or two about red flags in the office. "Nobody wants [to hire] a Debbie Downer," Morris tells CNBC Make It, adding that this kind of person is "constantly negative. I like people who bring the problem and a suggestion for how they might resolve [it.]" If your co-worker has this character trait, they're "only going to support you to a restricted limit," Juliette Han, a Harvard-trained neuroscientist, told CNBC Make It in June 2023. "They need you to stay within a short leash, and might discourage you from meeting new people in the company or going after new projects if it doesn't benefit them directly." That doesn't mean you should practice toxic optimism, pretending everything is fine when your team is facing difficult circumstances, for example. It's unnatural and unrealistic for someone to be happy all the time, Morris says. There are a couple attributes that separate the most highly successful employees to those who fall short, says Morris. She thinks highly of workers who "deliver what you are expecting at the time that you're expecting," she says. "Another green flag is they're open to opportunities, and they put their hand up to take on more," she adds. "Or they bring a problem with the remedy or request help in a timely manner, as opposed to the house is on fire." You can show you have this kind of team player, self-starter attitude by offering help even when you're not asked for it, like volunteering to mentor the new intern or pitching an idea that solves a problem your boss has been dealing with. Demonstrating radical intellectual curiosity, like researching a new AI tool or a new software your competitors are using, then sharing your findings with your boss or manager, also goes a long way, according to Michael Ramlett, CEO of global data intelligence firm Morning Consult.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At age 54, Loren Greiff, an executive career coach and strategist, worked at one of the world's most well-respected executive search firms. Her experience as an older worker inspired Greiff, who lives in Asheville, North Carolina, to found her own career coaching business — PortfolioRocket — in 2020. Since launching her business, Greiff has helped candidates land jobs at companies such as Meta, Target, Ford, and Dick's Sporting Goods. After working with older employees over the past four years, Greiff told BI the problem isn't just ageism in organizations; negative beliefs held by the candidates themselves may keep them from reaching their career potential. Greiff said the second mistake many older job seekers make is believing buzzwords hiring managers may use, such as "overqualified," "too expensive," and "not a culture fit." Instead, she said, words like these may mask biases or deeper systemic issues in the organization. In making her own job transition as an older candidate and guiding others in this age group through theirs, Greiff has devised job-search strategies that help over-40s combat negative thought patterns and direct ageism during applications and interviews. She emphasized that older employees need to repackage their deep work experience using these five strategies: Greiff shared that many older candidates she'd coached assumed that work experience and career relevance were one and the same. But she said two decades of experience might be worth less to employers than someone else's two years if a candidate can't show they've been building value. "Decision makers seek agility and willingness to learn outside of what you already know," Greiff added, saying candidates shouldn't rely on their time in a role to speak for itself. "Start addressing the underlying issues decision makers are concerned about most." Do you engage like someone who's still in the game? Do you comment like someone who sees around corners?" While it feels natural to use the past tense in résumés since the work experience section highlights prior positions, Greiff emphasized that doing so can be a career killer. "This is positioning you as a 'has-been' akin to an obit, sending a signal that your best days are over," she said. Instead of writing, "Created new growth channels and elevated brand health from #5 to #2," Greiff recommends keeping yourself more relevant and present tense with phrasing like, "Revenue and partnership growth expander, systematically advancing global brand health from bottom-tier to near-leadership status." Even when describing something you achieved in a previous job, Greiff advises integrating metrics that point to the future to avoid appearing like old news. "Stop giving them reasons to worry about your value or impact and start giving them reasons to buy it — numbers don't lie, and they don't age," she said. Say, 'Company transformer through AI integration, most recently reducing costs by 40%.'" She said older candidates should provide numbers to address a hiring team's spoken or unspoken fears. Be prepared to provide data-driven proof of your ability to continue delivering measurable results and share ROI figures that show you're worth what you cost. It's vital in many industries to demonstrate that you value lifelong learning and development, which points to your future impact. Greiff stressed that it's fair — and savvy — to consider experiences you've had outside the workplace as part of this dialogue. She shared that a client in her early 50s was applying for C-suite roles, and leveraged that she'd recently climbed Mount Kilimanjaro during her executive job search. "While other 40-plus creatives were ashamed of their freelance patchwork, he showcased every single gig — 22 of them — on LinkedIn," Greiff said. "Most older workers think job-hopping makes you look like you're inconsistent or can't hold down a job, but he made it look like he wasn't bouncing around — he was building." Do you have a story to share about job searching in your 40s, 50s, and beyond?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft pay guidelines obtained by Business Insider reveal how much the software giant generally will pay technical talent, shedding light on an opaque hiring process. The documents, last updated in May, do come with a carve-out: In competitive situations, recruiters can seek approval for higher offers for exceptional candidates. That's a key caveat considering big tech companies are in an all-out battle for AI talent, with some offering staggering pay packages to engineers and researchers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta is offering engineers $100 million signing bonuses. Meta also reportedly poached a former top Apple AI engineer with a pay package worth more than $200 million. Microsoft has a level system to denote seniority. According to the documents, Level 70 candidates can earn a yearly salary of as much as $408,000, depending on location. Their compensation would also include a one-time stock award upon hiring of as much as $1.9 million and could include an additional signing bonus, though a range isn't specified. Their future compensation would include an annual stock award worth as much as $1,476,000, according to the documents. For example, there's a "main" pay range for workers at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters, along with a "high" pay range for workers in higher cost-of-living areas such as San Francisco. Most of Microsoft's hiring happens in these locations, according to a person familiar with the hiring process. The packages outlined in these documents include ranges for salaries, on-hire stock awards, signing bonuses, annual stock awards, and percentages for annual bonuses based on levels. Microsoft's leveling system indicates seniority for engineers and other talent. Use a personal email address and a nonwork device; here's our guide to sharing information securely.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk says he has banished the job title "researcher" from his AI startup, xAI. The distinction between researcher and engineer is a "thinly masked way of describing a two-tier engineering system," Musk wrote in an X post on Tuesday. Musk then drew a comparison to his rocket company, SpaceX, which he said did more "meaningful, cutting-edge" research on rockets and satellites than "all the academic university labs on earth combined." "But we don't use the pretentious, low-accountability term 'researcher,'" Musk said. xAI did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. OpenAI, which Musk co-founded with Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in 2015, uses a similar naming approach for its technical hires. Brockman, the president of OpenAI, wrote in an X post in February 2023 that they did not want to "bucket people into researchers and engineers" and "thought hard about what job titles to use." OpenAI later decided to use the term "Member of Technical Staff." Anthropic, a company founded by former OpenAI employees, said on its website that its "research and engineering hires all share a single title — 'Member of Technical Staff.'" "While there's historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models," Anthropic wrote on its career page.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 80 to 90 pickup-only locations in the US, many of which are located in office buildings and offer no seating, will be phased out, said CEO Brian Niccol. Some will be converted into full-service stores with room to linger. "These stores felt too transactional and didn't deliver the warmth or human connection our customers expect," Niccol told investors on the third-quarter earnings call. Earlier this year, Niccol said that mobile ordering has "chipped away" at the brand's soul. A Starbucks spokeswoman declined to comment, including on how much the store renovations would cost. The company has also been working with CloudKitchens, the ghost kitchen company run by Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick, to broaden Starbucks' network in locations like San Francisco, Business Insider reported in 2023. These ghost kitchens, with private kitchens and no corporate storefronts, get Starbucks orders out on platforms like DoorDash to lessen the burden on brick-and-mortar stores. Starbucks announced on Tuesday that it is developing a new "coffeehouse of the future" prototype that includes 32 seats and a drive-thru, which it plans to debut in the company's next fiscal year. Starbucks is investing $500 million over the next year to bolster staffing and improve in-store wait times. Niccol, who took over as CEO last year, has issued memos telling employees to spend more time in the office as part of his effort to "turn things around." On Tuesday's call, Niccol said unpredictable coffee prices and ongoing pressure from tariffs may mean challenging financials until 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Price changes are the last resort for Starbucks' CEO, Brian Niccol, he said on Tuesday's Q3 earnings call, but he won't rule them out as part of his revitalization efforts of the coffee giant. A quick-service restaurant veteran, Niccol has led successful revitalization campaigns at Taco Bell and Chipotle. His "Back to Starbucks" campaign is proceeding ahead of schedule, the CEO told investors on Tuesday. "But with that said, you know, pricing will be a part of our business model," he added. "There are times where it makes sense to take some price — and when those situations present itself, we're going to do it in the least amount of pricing necessary. So will we have to use it in the future? Since Niccol took over, Starbucks has already implemented changes to its pricing model. The company has removed surcharges for non-dairy milk substitutes and changed the pricing structure for syrups and powder add-ins. A spokesperson for Starbucks declined to comment when reached by Business Insider. Global comparable store sales declined 2% overall, driven by a 2% decline in comparable transactions, according to Starbucks' Q3 earnings report. Most of the decrease was seen in North American markets, as international comparable store sales were mostly flat. The company's revenue — up 4% to $9.5 billion — beat analysts' tepid expectations, Reuters reported. However, it missed on earnings, with an adjusted EPS of $0.50, a 46% decline over the prior year, missing estimates of 65 cents, the outlet reported. Starbucks' stock increased more than 3.5% in after-hours trading following the earnings call. "While our financial results don't yet reflect all the progress we've made, the signs are clear — we're gaining momentum," CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement included in the report. It's grounded in what makes us Starbucks: handcrafted beverages, welcoming coffeehouses, and the human connection that brings it all together." Niccol and CFO Kathy Smith said on the call that the foundational operating model, focused on crafting cravable coffees and enhancing consumer connection, is being rolled out early across stores nationwide after being tested in pilot stores. Coffee houses already using Green Apron Service techniques have driven improvements in transactions, sales, and customer service times, outperforming the broader North American portfolio, Niccol said Tuesday. Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" campaign, which he launched upon taking over last September, aims to improve slumping sales and customer experience complaints that have plagued the international coffee giant. Starbucks has since rolled out a series of changes in-store, including remodeling stores with comfy chairs and ceramic dishes to encourage visitors to stay longer, bringing back the self-serve condiment bar, and asking baristas to hand-write smiley faces and inspirational messages on to-go orders.</p>
