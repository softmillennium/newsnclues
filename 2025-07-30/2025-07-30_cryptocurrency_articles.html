                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins The presale, which has already surpassed $5.8 million in funding as of late July 2025, reflects strong interest from both retail and institutional participants [2]. HYPER aims to improve the scalability of the Bitcoin network through faster transactions and lower fees, aligning with growing demand for Layer-2 solutions that facilitate broader blockchain adoption [2]. The altcoin's rapid fundraising progress highlights a shift in investor sentiment toward innovative projects that combine blockchain with AI technologies. Analysts have pointed out that HYPER's integration of AI could provide distinct advantages over traditional altcoins, potentially opening up new use cases and setting performance benchmarks [3]. These features have contributed to HYPER's emergence as a key player in the Layer-2 space, where it is being closely watched as a potential indicator of the AI crypto sector's overall momentum [1]. Despite HYPER's strong performance, it is important to note that forecasts of 100x returns are speculative and not guaranteed [2]. While HYPER and similar AI-driven projects stand out, traditional assets like Ethereum and spot ETH ETFs continue to show resilience, with the latter experiencing net inflows for 18 consecutive days [4]. HYPER's fundraising phase is set to conclude in early August, after which the project plans to proceed with a token listing and broader market entry [2]. However, as with all speculative crypto investments, potential investors are advised to approach such opportunities with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before committing capital.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drawing from executive actions earlier this year, including the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the group emphasizes regulatory clarity to position America as a global leader in blockchain technology. The recommendations come at a pivotal time, with cryptocurrency markets surging amid growing institutional interest. The working group, formed under a January executive order, includes industry figures like David Sacks and focuses on dismantling bureaucratic hurdles that have long stifled decentralized finance (DeFi) growth. This push for “safe harbors” and regulatory sandboxes would allow innovative products to reach consumers without endless delays, according to details in the report covered by Bloomberg. Insiders note that such measures could unlock billions in institutional capital, particularly for stablecoins and tokenized assets. A White House release, as reported in White House fact sheets, highlights this as a strategic move to bolster economic security, akin to oil reserves. The working group suggests regulatory frameworks that encourage federal investment in digital assets, potentially including tokenized Treasuries on permissioned blockchains like XRP. Recent posts on X reflect enthusiastic sentiment, with users praising the potential for nationwide crypto trading and DeFi expansion. For instance, discussions emphasize how these reforms could enable banks to settle transactions in seconds, weakening traditional financial monopolies. Proposals include easing custody rules for digital assets and promoting direct SEC-CFTC oversight to simplify market structures. Industry experts warn, however, that implementation will require congressional buy-in, especially for legislative proposals tied to the stockpile. Yet, challenges loom: volatility in crypto markets and regulatory risks could undermine adoption. Posts on X highlight optimism around XRP and other assets, but also underscore the need for balanced oversight to prevent fraud.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week the ruling and opposition parties tabled separate stablecoin bills. “We wanted to make it clear that this is not a department that only does research,” a BOK official said, according to Yonhap News. “There will not be much change in the original work.” Several Korean media outlets reported that the Bank of Korea suspended Project Han River, its wholesale central bank digital currency and tokenized deposit initiative, following resistance from participating banks. These seven financial institutions are now forming a consortium to launch their own stablecoins, capitalizing on recent government initiatives that will expand stablecoin issuance opportunities. The initiative combined bank deposit tokens with a wholesale CBDC for interbank settlement. Both major political parties tabled stablecoin bills this week with key differences that will be explored in a subsequent article. One bill supports interest bearing stablecoins while the other does not. “Stablecoins are surging like a tsunami, but we are fighting over who will run a small boat in the face of a tsunami,” said Min Byung-duk, who chairs the ruling party's Special Committee on Digital Assets, according to the Financial Times. The central bank has raised financial stability concerns and seeks a supervisory role over stablecoins. It would prefer limiting issuance to banks, which appears unlikely. The currency is not currently traded offshore and has limited trading hours. Issuing a won denominated stablecoin would immediately enable 24/7 global trading. While many won foreign exchange controls have been relaxed, restrictions still persist. While this may seem risky, as Min Byung-duk noted, the won is a small boat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's tight consolidation just below $120,000 suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate an uptick in volatility. Bitcoin remains stuck in a narrow range, suggesting a breakout could be around the corner. The FOMC minutes and Federal Reserve interest rate decision could set the tone for crypto's next steps. Although Bitcoin is on a strong wicket, the up move may face seasonal headwinds. According to Axel Adler Jr., BTC has recorded an average return of just 2.56% in August in the past 13 years. However, near-term uncertainty or August's historical weakness has not stopped Strategy from buying more BTC. The firm said on Tuesday that it had acquired 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256, boosting its total holding to 628,791 BTC. Glassnode said in a post on X that ETH's perpetual futures volume dominance has surpassed BTC, marking the “largest volume skew” on record. Could BTC break out of its range? Will select altcoins continue their bull run? BTC continues to trade inside a tight range between $115,000 and $120,000. If buyers drive the price above $120,000, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to a new all-time high above $123,218. The pair may then ascend to $135,000. Conversely, a break and close below $115,000 suggests the bears have overpowered the bulls. That could sink the price to $110,530. This is a vital support to keep an eye on because a break below it opens the gates for a drop to $100,000. ETH is trying to maintain above the breakout level of $3,745, signaling that the bulls are not hurrying to book profits as they anticipate another leg higher. Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge at $4,094, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket toward $4,868. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $3,745, it suggests that the bulls have given up. XRP (XRP) is witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day SMA ($3.16). Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2.95 level because a break below it could start a deeper correction toward $2.65. Alternatively, a strong rebound off the $2.95 level suggests solid demand at lower levels. BNB has pulled back to the breakout level of $794, which is a crucial support to watch out for. A break and close above $861 could start the next leg of the uptrend to $900. On the contrary, a break and close below the $794 level signals profit-booking by short-term buyers. The pair could then dip to the 20-day SMA ($751), which is likely to attract buyers. Solana (SOL) has pulled back to the 20-day SMA ($178), which is likely to act as solid support. That suggests the pair may extend its stay inside the large range between $110 and $209 for a few more days. Sellers are expected to defend the $0.29 level with all their might because a close above it could propel the pair to $0.35 and then to $0.44. That suggests the pair may remain inside the large $0.14 to $0.29 range for a while longer. Cardano (ADA) slipped below the 20-day SMA ($0.79) on Tuesday, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge. Such a fall suggests that the pair may remain inside the $0.50 to $0.86 range for a while. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day SMA. That suggests a lack of aggressive selling at lower levels. Why XRP was one of the worst performers this week Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below $0.40. If they manage to do that, the XLM/USDT pair could decline to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.37 and then to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.34. Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to make a comeback by pushing the price above $0.46. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the overhead resistance of $0.52. Sui (SUI) rose above the $4.30 resistance on Sunday, but the breakout proved to be a bull trap as the price turned down sharply on Monday. If they do that, the SUI/USDT pair could drop to $3.51. If the price turns up from $3.51 and breaks above the 20-day SMA, it suggests a possible range formation. The pair may swing between $3.51 and $4.30 for some time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In late 2024, US regulators put an end to a longstanding fight between banks and technology companies over control of their customers' financial data: Customers have the right to demand, download and transfer their data, for free, per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's landmark open banking rule. Less than 10 months later, policymakers say they're going back to the drawing board, the country's biggest bank is planning to charge for access to customers' data, and executives at some of the biggest financial technology companies, crypto firms and retailers are furious. “I thought we were done with this one, but here we are again,” said Leigh Phillips, chief executive officer of the nonprofit SaverLife, which runs an app that accesses its users' bank data to reward them for saving. If new fees trickle down to the organization's hundreds of thousands of mostly low-income members, “it's not a marginal effect,” she said. “Our families are really struggling, so anything that increases costs or your risk of fees is a big deal.” The CFPB said in a court filing Tuesday that it would reconsider the open banking rule, less than three weeks after Bloomberg reported JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s plan to start charging tech firms for access to customers' data. The move — and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.'s subsequent announcement that it would consider similar charges — sent shock waves through the digital world, which relies on that flow of information to power almost every consumer financial app on the market. App developers hustled to understand the consequences for their business models. Across the industry, there's widespread agreement – in theory – that consumers should control who accesses their data and when. Companies like Plaid Inc. and MX Technologies Inc., along with others owned by Stripe Inc., Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., provide the digital tools that deliver customers' data from the banks to almost every financial technology app on the market, a business model that, the banks say, takes advantage of their investments in infrastructure and compliance for their own profit. “Data middlemen endlessly access our customers' data for free — 90% of the time without a customer request — and then charge third parties for that same data,” a JPMorgan spokesperson said in an emailed statement. JPMorgan plans to start charging the data aggregators within months. Banks and tech companies have been sparring over access to customers' data for at least a decade. In the early days, apps would collect users' bank or credit card login credentials, then funnel it to aggregators like Plaid or Yodlee, which used it to scrape and structure users' data and pipe it back to the app. They also realized that some of the fintechs were offering services – overdraft alerts, for example, or high-yield savings – that threatened parts of the big banks' businesses. Roughly half of US consumers have interacted with Plaid at some point. The bank now receives around 2 billion “data calls” each month, according to people familiar with the firm's operations but not authorized to speak publicly about them. The digital inquiries originate when Robinhood Markets Inc., Coinbase Global Inc., Wealthfront or any of the hundreds of other fintechs verify a user's account balance or track transactions. JPMorgan plans to create a similar fee structure, charging the aggregators for each call. Rates and terms seem negotiable — the bank announced plans to offer customers a direct link to Coinbase — but in at least one case, the proposed pricing exceeds transaction revenue by 1,000%, according to a person who'd seen the terms. For smaller companies, particularly those that provide financial advice or budgeting apps, higher costs for data could upend their entire businesses, Quan said. Many other banks are considering whether to follow JPMorgan. Capital One Financial Corp. declined to comment but previously pushed for the “recoupment of reasonable costs.” A Bank of America Corp. spokesperson said its clients “own their data and should control how, when and by whom it is used,” but declined to say whether they were planning to charge for the data. In addition to a new layer of costs, many in the industry are objecting to what they see as a unilateral move by JPMorgan to dictate the framework and fee structure for consumer data. “Horrible anti competitive behavior from JPMC,” venture capitalist and Trump supporter Ben Horowitz wrote on X. The crypto outcry reached the White House, with both senior adviser David Sacks and Donald Trump Jr. amplifying a post from Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss accusing “the banksters” of trying to kill fintech and crypto companies. “You recognize the transformative potential of digital financial technologies and are leading efforts to enact and implement digital asset legislation,” they wrote in a letter. The 2024 open banking rule is now on indefinite hold, its April implementation deadline stayed by a federal court judge on Tuesday at the CFPB's request. Research reveals a 4% year-on-year increase in expenses that one in five Americans, including one-quarter of Gen Xers, say they have not planned for. Raymond James also lured another ex-Edward Jones advisor in South Carolina, while LPL welcomed a mother-and-son team from Edward Jones and Thrivent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The long-awaited White House crypto strategy is out, but the 163-page report isn't likely to tell the crypto industry much that it doesn't already know — including about the federal bitcoin reserves, which remain a black box for a sector keen to learn anything new. Senior administration officials said on Wednesday that it's meant as a guidepost against which the government's progress can be measured. One of the officials said the infrastructure is well underway for that project and that there will be more information soon. Bo Hines, one of Trump's top crypto advisers, had suggested earlier this month that the president's executive order calling for the reserves had required a report on the process but that the administration wasn't yet making it public and may choose not to. The lack of specifics had many crypto observers hoping the plans might be further revealed in this week's more comprehensive document. The industry's stakes remain high on that project, which had initially disappointed many observers by promising a fund built only on assets organically seized by government agencies, but that also hinted at the administration's desire to find other ways to fund it. Lawmakers in Congress may also play a part by working on legislation that reinforces the process. Senator Cynthia Lummis has been in the vanguard of that with her Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, but it hasn't yet moved. Meanwhile, Wednesday's report could be read by sitting U.S. regulators as a call to action. That's a push to get started with regulation even as Congress produces its market structure work, and though the CFTC still lacks a permanent leadership under Trump, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has suggested his agency has the authorities to act that he's been exploring. A package of tax revisions she included in her legislative effort are meant to reduce burdens on crypto users, including by setting a minimum value by which a transaction should be subject to capital-gains considerations and an overhaul of when gains should be factored into crypto rewards from practices such as staking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON, United Kingdom – July 30, 2025 (ICROWDNEWSWIRE) – BODIAM CAPITAL LTD. (doing business as Bay Cryptocurrency) – In the era of rapid financial technology development, blockchain is no longer the exclusive domain of programmers or institutional investors. Mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), are becoming new tools for everyday users to explore digital participation and realize diversified returns. Against the backdrop of continued economic uncertainty, many people hope to reduce their reliance on a single source of income through "passive income". Cryptocurrencies based on smart contracts and decentralized networks are becoming part of this trend, helping users interact with value in a more flexible way. These mainstream currencies build the key foundation of the blockchain ecosystem, and any user can find an application method that suits them in these systems. Platforms like Bay Cryptocurrency are following this trend and providing tools for ordinary users to explore on-chain participation without a technical background. Visit the Bay Cryptocurrency official website and register as a new user to receive a welcome gift worth $15, allowing you to experience participation without any cost. BayCryptocurrency's new contract model is based on a three-step system. Users sign up, select their preferred yield contract, and activate it with XRP. Yields are tracked in real time and can be withdrawn or reinvested based on user preferences. Some fintech services already support connecting digital wallets through cloud interfaces, so users can try to participate in certain revenue-generating mechanisms without having to deploy any equipment or learn complex processes. Most services use smart contract mechanisms to ensure transparency and automation. Users only need to set a wallet address to allocate assets into different on-chain modes, such as liquidity support, protocol staking, or stablecoins. Bay Cryptocurrency simplifies the entire process with a built-in dashboard to help users visualize their assets and participation paths. The platform supports BTC, ETH, and XRP, especially for users who want to participate steadily but do not have a technical background. Its Bay Cryptocurrency platform is committed to providing global users with a simple and secure way to participate in cryptocurrency through smart contracts and mobile tools. If you also want to understand the blockchain economy, platforms such as Bay Cryptocurrency provide a simple and guided entry path, whether you are in the learning stage or already practicing a passive participation strategy. To learn how digital assets can be integrated into daily life, you can visit Bay Cryptocurrency official website or download the APP, which allows you to easily manage crypto assets anytime, anywhere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan and Coinbase team up to make crypto access easier for its customers as JPM expands into digital assets. Further, by 2026, JPM plans to let users link their Chase bank accounts directly to COIN wallets through a secure API, allowing smooth transfers between bank and crypto accounts. JPMorgan will be the first big U.S. bank to turn loyalty points into digital currency. This partnership is part of JPMorgan's broader move into digital assets. The bank has launched JPMD, a deposit token built on Coinbase's Base blockchain, to help institutional clients settle transactions and make cross-border payments. It is also exploring crypto-backed loans, with plans to offer lending against Bitcoin and Ether by 2026. Meanwhile, JPM's blockchain unit, Kinexys, is building tools for token-based settlements, aiming to become a leader in stablecoins and blockchain-based finance. These moves come as CEO Jamie Dimon's stance on crypto has softened. He recently said, “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” marking a shift from his earlier criticism of the cryptocurrency. Turning to Wall Street, JPM stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, five Holds, and two Sells assigned in the last three months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please conduct your own research before taking any action based on the content. After Bitcoin touched a new all-time high of over $123,000 in mid-July, the crypto market has entered a sharp corrective phase, with nearly $400 million in long positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin alone accounted for $159 million in liquidations, while altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin dropped more than 5%. Analysts suggest this pullback is a “healthy and necessary correction,” especially as long-term holders appear to be taking profits. The total market capitalization briefly exceeded $4 trillion, and analysts now consider $3.4 trillion as a key support level for the ongoing bullish trend to remain intact. However, analysts from major institutions like Citigroup continue to project long-term upside, estimating Bitcoin could reach $135,000 by year-end. As momentum temporarily cools, investor focus is shifting toward undervalued altcoins with real-world use cases and strong fundamentals. Hence, they need assets that could gain traction once market volatility subsides. One such emerging project is Tapzi, a Web3 skill-based gaming ecosystem aligning utility with Ethereum's expanding institutional narrative. So, without any further ado, let's check the top undervalued altcoins to buy now that could make you rich soon. Tapzi is an emerging altcoin in the Web3 gaming space, building infrastructure around competitive, skill-based PvP experiences. As the market enters a consolidation phase, projects like Tapzi that prioritize product delivery and long-term utility are gaining attention from early-stage investors. Click Here to Join the $TAPZI Presale Before It's Too Late! The first public-facing phase is set for Q3 2025, followed by platform beta and token listing in Q4. Instead of idle farming or luck-based gameplay, Tapzi focuses on real-time competition through games like chess, checkers, and rock-paper-scissors. Tapzi is not yet listed on major exchanges, making it a relatively undervalued entry for investors who anticipate utility-led altcoin growth in the post-hype GameFi cycle. As presale phases begin, its value proposition aligns with a maturing digital asset landscape. Tron has quietly become one of the most used blockchain networks, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia and Africa, where affordable and fast transactions are critical. Its focus on decentralized content distribution, entertainment, and stablecoin transfers makes it highly relevant to real-world users. As institutional capital begins to recognize networks with real adoption rather than hype, TRX could see a major re-rating. For investors seeking mainstream utility wrapped in a high-performance chain, Tron offers deep value at current prices. With Telegram's 900 million+ user base forming a latent distribution network, TON is uniquely positioned to mainstream crypto functionality through social messaging. As TON expands into DeFi and dApps, developers are increasingly turning to it as a scalable, user-friendly alternative to crowded L1s like Ethereum and Solana. Despite this strong technical foundation and growing ecosystem, TON remains largely under the radar in Western markets. However, the upcoming rollout of crypto-native features across Telegram could act as a catalyst for mass adoption. With real distribution channels and embedded usability, Toncoin is a prime example of an undervalued asset poised to go mainstream. VeChain is a purpose-built Layer-1 platform focused on supply chain management, logistics, and sustainability tracking. While not a typical DeFi or gaming protocol, VeChain's real-world partnerships, including Walmart China, BMW, and PwC, make it one of the few blockchains actively solving enterprise-level problems. Despite being active since 2015, VeChain is still undervalued due to its low retail hype. Cardano is a research-first blockchain protocol that emphasizes long-term sustainability, decentralization, and peer-reviewed development. ADA also supports several projects across sectors such as education, identity, and healthcare, especially in developing economies like Ethiopia. Currently priced below its historical highs and underrepresented in mainstream narratives, ADA offers a low-risk, high-conviction entry point for long-term investors. As the crypto market navigates through corrections and macro uncertainty, one thing is becoming increasingly clear. The spotlight is shifting toward real-world use cases, proven fundamentals, and application-layer innovation. Projects like Tron, Toncoin, VeChain, and Cardano stand out not just for their technical resilience but for the real impact they're making across industries and geographies. While hype-driven tokens may continue to grab headlines during bull runs, long-term value often lies in ecosystems built for scale, utility, and inclusivity. For investors seeking early exposure to the next wave of mainstream adoption, these top undervalued altcoins present a compelling opportunity. Among them, Tapzi deserves special mention for seamlessly blending blockchain utility with Web3 gaming in a way that prioritizes both transparency and long-term player engagement. Thus, it is a model that many crypto whales are watching and waiting for the opportunity to grab!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Corporate interest in bitcoin certainly doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. As a whole, this amounts to well over $67 billion and that number is growing fast. Back in June, Elliot Chun of Architect Partners reported that since April 2, 2025, 32 public companies released new crypto Treasury strategy plans. In total, these plans are looking to raise at least $11.3 billion in capital, according to Architect Partners. This report showcases how interest in applying the digital currency to corporate strategies is expanding beyond a few select names. Meanwhile, these deals are happening as the cryptocurrency continues to flirt with new highs on a regular basis. However, even with all this momentum, some advisors and investors might be wondering if it's too late to jump into bitcoin during this rally. The price of bitcoin could always head into a new bout of volatility, even as companies look to add it to their Treasuries. Keeping these concerns in mind, advisors still have plenty of tools at their disposal to access bitcoin exposure in a risk-managed way. These funds look to offer distinct upside to bitcoin's price performance along with a barrier of downside security. For investors, CBOY provides 100% downside protection across the entire one-year outcome period. Meanwhile, the fund still offers return opportunities through bitcoin's price movements. That said, there is an upside cap on potential returns. This framework makes CBOY an attractive vehicle for navigating the current bitcoin market. The fund can help advisors and investors tap into momentum within bitcoin, while providing peace of mind through its downside overlay. For more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Content Hub. Before investing, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. An investment in the Fund is subject to risks, and you could lose money on your investment in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Your investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. The Fund also has specific principal risks, which are described below. More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus. For a detailed list of fund risks see the prospectus. While the Fund seeks to provide 100% protection against losses experienced by the price of Spot bitcoin for shareholders who hold Fund Shares for an entire Outcome Period, there is no guarantee it will successfully do so. If the Fund's NAV has increased significantly, a shareholder that purchases Fund Shares after the first day of an Outcome Period could lose their entire investment. An investment in the Fund is only appropriate for shareholders willing to bear those losses. There is no guarantee the Capital Protection and Cap will be successful and a shareholder investing at the beginning of an Outcome Period could also lose their entire investment. The Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before taking fees and expenses into account, track the positive price return of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate – New York Variant (“BRRNY”) (“Spot bitcoin”) up to a predetermined upside cap (the “Cap”) while seeking to protect against 100% of losses (before fees and expenses) of (i) Spot bitcoin or (ii) one or more of the Underlying ETPs and/or Bitcoin Indexes, in each case, over a period of approximately one (1) year (the “Outcome Period”). The Fund will not invest directly in bitcoin. Instead, the Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before taking fees and expenses into account, track the positive price return of Spot bitcoin by investing in options that reference the price performance of either (i) one or more underlying exchange-traded products (“Underlying ETPs”) which, in turn, own bitcoin or (ii) one or more indexes that are designed to track the price of bitcoin (“Bitcoin Index”). Digital Assets Risk: The bitcoin network was first launched in 2009 and bitcoins were the first cryptographic digital assets created to gain global adoption and critical mass. Although the bitcoin network is the most established digital asset network, the bitcoin network and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. Moreover, because digital assets, including bitcoin, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this prospectus. Cap Rate – Maximum percentage return an investor can achieve from an investment in the Fund if held over the Outcome Period.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This move shows that interest in crypto across South Korea is on the rise. Besides, this is especially as the country inches closer to legalizing stablecoins and expanding its crypto efforts. The main goal of this committee is to monitor the crypto market, support ongoing legislative efforts, and keep tabs on won-pegged stablecoins. This is important as banks prepare to issue their own stablecoins and lawmakers push forward with regulation. It will monitor developments in the crypto sector, especially those tied to Korean won-pegged stablecoins and upcoming legislative changes. South Korea's central bank forms a Virtual Asset Committee to monitor crypto markets & stablecoin legislation. Big shift toward digital finance in East Asia  #Crypto #CBDC pic.twitter.com/EJmqJc08qj A BOK official told Yonhap News that the team will also be responsible for cooperating with government agencies throughout the legal process. In line with this shift, the Bank of Korea has also renamed and restructured its CBDC teams. Previously, the teams operated under the title of “Digital Currency Research.” Now, they've been renamed to reflect more practical business operations, rather than just theoretical work. Overall, these changes show the central bank's change from crypto being related mostly to academic research, to being used in real-world applications. According to BOK officials, this is part of the country's active deployment plan, if a CBDC becomes necessary. Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong echoed this sentiment, stating, “Whether we choose stablecoins or deposit tokens, South Korea will need digital currency in the future.” While the central bank is still considering CBDCs, eight major South Korean banks are moving forward with plans to issue stablecoins backed by the Korean won. These coins are expected to launch between lQ4 and early next year. Banks continue to argue that stablecoins are more flexible and less costly than CBDCs. The BOK has also acknowledged these arguments and may gradually shift responsibility to banks for issuing such digital assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many of the biggest names in NFT trading last year have returned." Now, they're back again, bringing unique stories and bets. Meanwhile, NFT market trading volume has rebounded, with a surge in buyers. The market's macroeconomic data presents a puzzling contradiction. On the one hand, long-term expectations remain optimistic. Authoritative institutions such as Vancelian predict that the market size will exceed tens of billions of dollars this year. However, this apparent retreat has not caused market panic; instead, it reveals a structural shift. According to DappRadar data, in the second quarter of 2025, although the total NFT transaction volume declined due to a decrease in high-priced collectibles, the number of transactions surged 78% from approximately 7.02 million to 12.5 million, and the number of unique buyers also increased significantly by 44% from 651,000 to 936,000. As Coindoo reported: Despite a decline in trading volume, the increase in sales and the decline in average transaction value indicate broader market participation, and that the driving force behind transactions is shifting from pure speculation to practicality and community consensus. And at this delicate juncture, A group of previously departed "star players" have returned. This was a golden age where dreamers and speculators danced together. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $69,000, and NFTs leapt from niche toys to global buzz. In October 2021, Maji spent 425 ETH to buy Cyborg Bored Ape, FOMO exploded instantly. Amidst multiple shocks, including black swan events, high inflation, interest rate hikes, and war, Bitcoin plummeted below $20,000, and the crypto market capitalization halved to $1 trillion. Edison Chen, Shawn Yue, and Annie Yi successively launched NFT projects, but all ultimately collapsed in the bear market. Theirsverse plummeted from 0.219 ETH to 0.02 ETH has plummeted over 96%, earning Yi Nengjing the label "The Queen of Chives." 2025: Old faces return, new forces enter the game He bets real money on BLAST and PUMP tokens, publicly sharing his profits and losses, becoming a "number one gambler" who thrives with the market. Furthermore, legendary businessman Qian Fenglei, with his "tens of billions" fortune, entered Web3 earlier this year, claiming to invest $100 million in the creation of a "Peach Blossom Spring NFT." Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz quietly switched to Pudgy. It feels like we've returned to 2021, with stars returning and the market thriving. But this time, the excitement is tempered by less blind faith and more restraint. In the NFT market of 2025, the community will no longer be a mere participant, but will transform into a true "judge." The prices of blue-chip projects like Penguins continue to climb. However, this time, the community's reaction has been unprecedentedly calm. "The 2021 NFT craze won't be repeated,"@RicecakeNFT stated bluntly on X,"The barrier to entry has significantly increased, and investors prioritize practicality and community value. Community member @waleswoosh predicted: "By 2025, not a single top NFT project may exist, but we will see several with floor prices exceeding 50 ETH. From hype to consensus, from frenzy to rationality, this profound shift in the NFT market represents a reshaping of value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SBRs function similarly to traditional strategic reserves of assets like gold, as there is a finite supply of Bitcoin.1 A government (or corporation or individual investor) might wish to add a non-sovereign asset like Bitcoin to their portfolio with the expectation that such assets will appreciate over time or at least maintain a relatively stable value. Recent SBR legislation passed in several states shows Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a long-term financial strategy rather than as a speculative asset. These laws also serve as a marketing strategy to position those states with SBRs as tech-friendly and pro-crypto – particularly in light of shifting priorities under the new administration. On March 6, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled the "Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile," noting: "The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC's strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system." The order directs the U.S. Treasury Department to establish and manage a SBR to create long-term reserve holdings capitalized by Bitcoin previously forfeited in civil or criminal proceedings. This would mark a departure from the government's prior policy of selling Bitcoin and digital assets forfeited in legal proceedings, typically through public auctions, and would represent a policy shift in embracing crypto assets. The order also directs Treasury to establish an office to manage the "United States Digital Asset Stockpile" that would consist of holdings of other cryptocurrency or digital assets obtained in forfeiture proceedings, subject to exceptions for digital assets returned to crime victims or used for law enforcement purposes. Treasury would be required to make regular public reports about the reserve fund. The bill text also includes congressional findings recognizing Bitcoin as a useful diversification method and a hedge against economic uncertainty and monetary instability. While the bill remains in committee, its introduction signals that Congress and the White House are open to treating digital assets as a legitimate asset class worthy of public investment. Meanwhile, as the federal government begins work on its own SBR, several states were already in the process of developing legislation of their own to implement Bitcoin reserves. New Hampshire became the first state to pass an SBR law. HB 302 authorizes the state treasurer to invest up to 5% percent of the total amount of public funds in precious metals or digital assets that have a market cap of over $500 billion (Bitcoin is the only digital asset that currently meets this criterion). Under the law, digital assets are presumed abandoned three years after a written or electronic communication sent to the account owner is returned as undeliverable. Similar bills are pending in other state legislatures, including Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. If more states establish such funds, it will be interesting to see the effect on the price of Bitcoin as, presumably, more supply of the coin would be acquired and thereafter held in storage and would not generally be traded on exchanges. While states have taken different approaches to establishing SBRs, their adoption signals a growing willingness to investigate the potential for certain established digital currencies as to become recognized strategic asset classes for long-term investment of state funds. States pursuing these initiatives also hope that such laws might attract professionals and businesses seeking jurisdictions with more favorable crypto regulations. The success of these early adopters could also lead to innovation at the federal level as lawmakers observe these policies in practice. Although the creation of SBRs at the state level mirrors what institutional and individual investors are doing with Bitcoin stockpiles or investments in similar ETF products, their adoption presents potential legal and regulatory risks. States must first ensure that they have the expertise and specialized secure infrastructure necessary to store their digital assets or otherwise contract with a qualified custodian to do so. Texas's SB 21, for example, requires cold storage, an offline method of custody. Additionally, bills like Arizona's HB 2749 raise procedural concerns similar to those associated with the forfeiture of any type of unclaimed assets, by allowing the state to repossess unclaimed digital assets after a period of time. Legal challenges could arise over asset seizure, and account owners in such states should maintain periodic vigilance over accounts to maintain an active presence. Lastly, Bitcoin's price, having risen since the new administration took office, is not guaranteed to continue climbing and may experience future volatility. With Bitcoin reaching new highs in the past year, it's possible that states purchasing or acquiring Bitcoin at its peak could experience losses in the future or that Bitcoin could underperform as compared with traditional assets (of course, bitcoin and other digital assets acquired via forfeiture of criminal proceeds would sidestep this concern). A sudden drop in value could raise questions about the general responsibility of state officials to prudently manage public funds. Laws in states like Arizona, Oregon, New Hampshire, and Texas signal a gradual step toward modernizing state treasuries and reflect the growing legitimacy of digital assets as an enduring asset class. However, with the momentum comes risks, including questions about secure custody, property concerns and general management responsibilities. As more states consider incorporating SBRs into their long-term financial strategies, the U.S. is attempting to position itself as a leader in global financial crypto policy. Bitcoin will eventually reach its hard cap of 21 million BTC around the year 2040. Once this number is reached, no new bitcoins will be minted, absent an action by a consensus of network participants to agree on a code change, which is highly unlikely given that Bitcoin's fixed supply is central to its value proposition. "Secure custody solution" means a technological product or blended product and service which has all of the following characteristics: (1) The cryptographic private keys that secure digital assets are exclusively known by and accessible by the government entity; (2) The cryptographic private keys that secure digital assets are exclusively contained within an encrypted environment and accessible only via end-to-end encrypted channels; (3) The cryptographic private keys that secure digital assets are never contained by, accessible by, or controllable via a smartphone; (4) Any hardware that contains the cryptographic private keys that secure digital assets is maintained in at least 2 geographically diversified specially designated secure data centers; (5) The secure custody solution enforces a multi-party governance structure for authorizing transactions, enforces user access controls, and logs all user-initiated actions; (6) The provider of the secure custody solution has implemented a disaster recovery protocol that ensures customer access to assets in the event the provider becomes unavailable; (7) The secure custody solution undergoes regular code audits and penetration testing from audit firms. Note: A previous Arizona bill (SB 1373), which would have established a digital assets strategic reserve funded by monies appropriated by the state legislature, was vetoed by the governor in May 2025; another bill (SB 2324), which would have using confiscated digital asset funds from criminal cases for a state reserve fund, was vetoed by the governor in early July.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is still trending up on strong exchange-traded fund (ETF) demand and low exchange reserves, but its dominance is slipping as altcoins rally and regulations evolve, crypto bank Sygnum said in a new Q3 report. At the same time, exchange reserves have dropped to a near seven-year low, tightening available supply. According to CryptoQuant data, BTC reserves across exchanges currently sit at around 2.37 million coins. Earlier this year, Bitcoin surpassed Google to become the sixth-largest asset globally by market capitalization, “further cementing its status as a credible macro asset in global markets,” the report reads. BTC is currently trading at around $117,000 with a market cap of $2.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin's dominance also recently hit its highest level since early 2021 – but that trend has reversed, with its share of the market falling more than 6% amid a broader altcoin rally, led by large-caps like ETH, XRP and BNB. Currently, BTC dominance hovers around 61%, according to TradingView data. Moreover, with regulatory clarity expected to further boost the altcoin space, Bitcoin's dominance could continue to slide, the report said. The report notes that sentiment around Ethereum has recently shifted partly because of its successful Pectra upgrade, which raised the staking cap from 32 to 2048 ETH and implemented several core improvement proposals (EIPs). “Ethereum's tailwinds have also led to exchange reserves returning to cycle lows, with market data revealing large whale accounts accumulating Ether and a steady rise in on-chain transactions and active users,” the report added. “If these demand trends pick up in the coming quarter, we cannot rule out the possibility of a supply squeeze and an upward price shock.” Meanwhile, XRP last week reached an all-time high of $3.64. “As regulatory clarity extends to altcoins, capital could rotate towards projects with real economic use cases and sustainable token models, and perhaps this shift is already underway as some sectors currently show,” Sygnum's report reads. The GENIUS Act sets rules for stablecoins, while the Clarity Act creates a regulatory framework for digital assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geopolitical tensions and US fiscal uncertainty earlier this year led to a sell-off across the altcoin sector. “As regulatory clarity extends to altcoins, capital could rotate toward projects with real economic use cases and sustainable token models, and perhaps this shift is already underway as some sectors currently show,” Sygnum wrote. The report also noted a decline in Bitcoin dominance, which hit its highest level since 2021 amid geopolitical and trade-related macro pressures, but recently dropped over 6% amid capital return to altcoins. The report said that liquidity trends for Bitcoin (BTC) remain “extremely bullish,” as a persistent supply and demand imbalance has driven the largest cryptocurrency by market value to new all-time highs. “Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now exceeded USD 160 billion in assets under management, accumulating more than 110k BTC last quarter alone,” Sygnum wrote. Ether (ETH) followed with falling exchange balances, ETF inflows and nearly 30% of its liquid supply staked. The Ethereum narrative shifted after a successful Pectra upgrade, which “raised the staking cap and introduced several protocol improvements.” Regulatory clarity has reinforced this trend, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission clarified that protocol staking “does not fall under securities law.” Sygnum said Ether has “conclusively broken its long-term downtrend,” citing a surge in institutional demand. Decentralized exchanges hit a record high last quarter, capturing 30% of all crypto spot trading after memecoin launches pushed DEX volumes to $530 billion. “The DeFi lending sector is one of the strongest beneficiaries of market rallies, with active loans on Ethereum surging to new all-time highs as investors take on greater risk and leveraged exposure,” Sygnum wrote. However, the bank warned that the current momentum in altcoins could spark another memecoin bubble, which history suggests may end in a sharp correction if it continues unchecked.</p>
