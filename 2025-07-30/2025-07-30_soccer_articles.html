                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea requested US President Donald Trump to be part of the 2025 Club World Cup celebrations, his son Eric has claimed. Following a 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13 at MetLife Stadium, Chelsea were crowned Champions of the World and were recognised as the first ever side to win the Club World Cup, a newly-formatted competition. READ MORE: Why Chelsea are the only official Club World Cup champions amid FIFA decision After the full-time whistle blew in the United States, Chelsea made their way to collect their medals, passing co-owner Todd Boehly, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Trump, before waiting on the stage for club captain Reece James for the trophy lift. As James entered last to collect his medal, he was handed the trophy by Trump on Infantino. Despite Infantino stepping to one side, Trump remained on stage, to the confusion of Chelsea's players, who tried ushering the President off the stage but to no success. “Well, listen, he's the Commander in Chief of the United States of America," Eric told BBC Sport. “And by the way, I was there, I was watching it, the place went crazy, and there's no one that's done more for sport than him, and I think in time that will be rewarded.” Eric's claims haven't appeared to be backed up by any of the Chelsea squad, all of whom appeared incredibly confused by the situation. Reece James stated Donald Trump wanted to remain on stage, admitting: "They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Soccer Federation is made up of 27 National Teams, nine of which are Extended National Teams, including Deaf, Cerebral Palsy, Power Chair, Beach and Futsal teams. It's important to Stuart Sharp, head of Extended National Teams at U.S. Soccer, to use “extension” when talking about the nine teams that fall under his purview. “So, we have an opportunity in our department to create relevant role models well beyond the grass, the court or the sand for people to see [that] there's a National Team player that I aspire to be.” “These athletes want to be treated like National Team players and certainly that's our approach with our staffing and resources.” Sharp isn't above “sliding into DMs” of potential U.S. Soccer players. “[It's] crazy and apologetically, I will say yes,” Sharp said. Podcasts like this, any news articles we put out there are a way of recruiting new talent across our Extended National Teams.” Sharp recently came across National Team talent by searching the web, and sending a player a direct message on social media.Initially, they received a “no” from the atheletebut thatwasn't a dead end for Sharp and his recruiting team. They reached out to a reporter who wrote a story on the athlete, got in touch with his family and recruited the future U.S. Soccer player. There are few lengths Sharp won't explore to offer someone who never thought they had an opportunity to play at the highest level of soccer. “Many of our players had a major moment in their life or they were born with a disability or impacted in another way later in life [have] an opportunity to represent this nation on another level,” Sharp said. “... We're working with National Team athletes because that's what they bring to the table.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In many ways, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup served as a crucial testing ground—not just for its revamped format, its place on the international calendar, and the complex logistics involved, but also for innovative features introduced by FIFA. Among these, one stood out as a clear fan favorite: the Ref Cam, and it's now set to expand into domestic leagues worldwide. This first-person perspective proved to be an instant hit. FIFA's clips showcasing the referee's point of view quickly went viral across social media, earning praise for enhancing transparency and bringing supporters even closer to the action. However, it comes with a catch: leagues will have to foot the bill themselves. FIFA will not subsidize the cost of implementing the system, meaning that any domestic competition hoping to introduce Ref Cams must be prepared to make a significant financial investment. It's likely just a matter of time before more competitions jump on board. The feature not only adds a new layer of drama and immersion but could also help educate fans about refereeing decisions, fostering a deeper understanding of the game's challenges from an official's perspective. In an era where engagement, content, and innovation drive growth, the Ref Cam has emerged as a powerful storytelling tool. As football continues to evolve, this small camera might just become a game-changer in how we watch and understand the beautiful game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Inter defender Marco Materazzi has thanked Enzo Maresca and Chelsea for "avenging" Inter's defeat in the Champions League final against PSG and says former Everton manager Walter Smith treated him like his own son. The World Cup winner with Italy spoke about his experience in the Premier League in an interview with Lega Serie A. Materazzi: Time at Everton was "beautiful and difficult" My wife convinced me, she said: ‘This will change our lives for the better', and it did. "I remember everything from that time in England, the manager – who unfortunately is no longer alive – Walter Smith. The fact that he loved the Italians also helped, because he treated me like his son, and when you're abroad, having someone who supports you and believes in you not only as a player but also as a person, helps you a lot to adapt." A very physical defender, Materazzi's characteristics suited the Premier League style well in those years. Materazzi thanks Maresca for Club World Cup victory over PSG At that time, the only teams that played in a 'Latin' way were West Ham, who played very beautifully, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's Arsenal. "As for the others, when you played against Wimbledon, for example, the dressing rooms were small, but their strikers were so big they made me look small. Maresca even became world champion, and I have to thank him for avenging Inter's defeat in the Champions League final." Maresca's Chelsea became the first-ever Club World Cup winner earlier this month after defeating PSG in the final held in New York. He spent ten years at San Siro, winning several trophies, including five Serie A titles, four Coppa Italias and a Champions League. Materazzi retired from football in 2017 after a three-year spell at Chennaiyin.

Italy World Cup winner Materazzi spoke about his time in the Premier League in an interview with Lega Serie A. Materazzi left Perugia in 1998 to join Everton, where he played for one season before returning to the Stadio Curi. “We were alone, and I can't deny that I would have stayed in Perugia because we had won the [Serie B] league. “My wife convinced me, she said: ‘It's going to change our life for the better', and it's what happened. “I remember everything about my time in England, the coach, who unfortunately is no longer here, Walter Smith. He loved Italy and always brought his teams to Italy for pre-season camp, so that was very helpful. The fact that he loved Italians was helpful because he treated me like a son, and when you go abroad, having someone who supports you and believes in you, not just as a player, but also as a man, helps a lot with settling in.” A very physical centre-back, Materazzi's characteristics suited the Premier League's style in those years. In those years, the only teams that played the ‘Latin way' were West Ham, who played very well, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's Arsenal. However, English football has evolved now and has adapted to the philosophies of the likes of Maresca, Guardiola. Maresca even became World Champion, and I have to thank him for avenging Inter's defeat in the Champions League Final.” Maresca's Chelsea became the first Club World Cup winners earlier this month after beating PSG in the Final played in New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, the New York Times-owned outlet announced the hires of former U.S. Men's National Team forward Charlie Davies and ex-Yahoo Sports standout Henry Bushnell. Their arrivals follow the departure of longtime staff writer Pablo Maurer earlier this year. Davies joins as a regular contributor, making his debut in written journalism with The Athletic. In his first foray into the medium, the expectation is that Davies will regularly produce opinion columns, appear regularly on podcasts, and produce insightful explainer videos. Last playing professional soccer in 2017, Davies has since become an analyst for CBS Sports, as well as a color analyst for the New England Revolution on NBC Sports Boston. Bushnell, meanwhile, arrives from Yahoo Sports, where he built a reputation as one of the most respected U.S. soccer journalists. While these additions point to why The Athletic chose not to renew Maurer's contract, the outlet believes this refreshed lineup will better position it to deliver top-tier coverage heading into next year's World Cup. He also has a love/hate relationship with the New York Mets and Jets. "The fanbase down there is actually pretty damn good. They just waiting on the Pelicans to do something." Charles Davis will replace Tiki Barber in his last year on NFL coverage, while JJ Watt takes the No. "We'll be getting some tweets about that, I'm sure." Barber worked alongside Andrew Catalon and Jason McCourty in a three-man booth last season. "The fanbase down there is actually pretty damn good. They just waiting on the Pelicans to do something."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Football's lawmakers have extended the use of referee body cameras for broadcast purposes to worldwide domestic and international competitions. Other competitions wishing to participate in the trial and implement referee body cameras must seek permission from IFAB and FIFA to do so. This is a similar process to the introduction of previous new officiating measures, such as in-stadium VAR announcements. Jarred Gillett became the first Premier League referee to wear a body camera during the fixture between Crystal Palace and Manchester United in May 2024. The footage was not made available for immediate broadcast and was described as a “one off” for a programme promoting match officials. The technology was also trialled during a Bundesliga game between Eintracht Frankfurt and Wolfsburg in February 2024. “I think that right at the start this will be less a topic for the live area, rather for the highlight area and social media, because we have had good experiences with reach and audience enthusiasm.” The technology trial was initially limited to FIFA competitions following approval at an IFAB meeting in March. Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the FIFA referees committee, said in April the use of body cameras would offer broadcast viewers a “new experience”. Referee body cameras were first trialled in English grassroots football in 2023 with the aim of improving behaviour and respect from players and supporters towards match officials. “And this was not only for entertainment purposes, but also for coaching the referees (and) to explain why something was not seen on the field of play.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Hayes reflects on her first year in charge of the USWNT. The transition of the U.S. women's national team since Emma Hayes took over as coach has marked a staggering, unprecedented level of experimentation for the world's most successful women's soccer team. Twenty-four players have made their international debuts in the first 24 games with Hayes in charge over the past year, even with U.S. winning a gold medal at last summer's Olympics. Now, Hayes has said she has seen enough to narrow down her core of players and focus on developing the group she hopes will win the Americans a fifth World Cup in Brazil in 2027. So after all that experimentation, which new players are most likely to be on the roster for the Women's World Cup two years from now? We've ranked the debutants by who appears to fit into Hayes' 2027 plans. It's about talent, yes, but also the team's positional needs, meaning some players rank higher or lower based on necessity. Gaetino's lone U.S. appearance to date was her debut last year in a 3-0 win over Argentina. Malonson's only cap to date, however, came last year against Argentina. Other fullbacks have been featured more heavily recently. Chicago's struggles this year have made it difficult for Staab to stand out upon her return. There are few bigger advocates for the Legend of LaBonta than this writer, but she has tough competition in midfield. There's a youth movement afoot as Hayes builds for the next decade. Meza was impressive in her debut against Ireland last month, an opportunity she earned through her steady play in midfield for Seattle. She has potential as a deeper-lying midfielder, but there are better-known entities ahead of her on the depth chart. Rodriguez is an attacking force at fullback in the NWSL. Like Rodriguez, Abello is an attack-minded fullback with limited international reps thus far, but she gets the edge for versatility. She can play centrally in a three-back capacity -- which Hayes noted recently -- and she also handles a more advanced winger role for Orlando at times. She has great upside and should continue to get opportunities. McGlynn debuted last fall as the race to replace Alyssa Naeher entered full swing. Only Hayes can truly say why, but Sams appears to be at least fourth on the center-back depth chart. Her club form for Orlando remains strong and she is great in one-on-one situations. Reale was exceptional in the U.S. team's most recent game against Canada. Those left-footed crosses she can serve up from the wing? At 21, this defender looks like the Reale Deal (we'll be here all day, thanks). The long-term future of Bugg as a starting U.S. center back seems inevitable; it's a question more of when, not if. How quickly that development progresses and, maybe, whether FIFA expands the World Cup rosters to 26 players, could determine her immediate future. But Bugg is already thriving in the NWSL and drawing comparisons to Naomi Girma for her composed defending. Hershfelt has not played for the U.S. in 2025 due to injury, but don't forget she was part of last year's Olympic run. Sears continues to refine her technical game and decision-making, the latter being a development Hayes praised during the most recent window. Sears is tied for fifth in the NWSL with six goals this season, second among Americans and the most of any player with senior U.S. caps. McKeown is one of the most interesting developments in the player pool after a well-documented conversion from forward in recent years. She has appeared in eight of 10 U.S. games this year since making her debut. Her background means she profiles as a more aggressive, ball-playing center back -- someone who could complement the steady, all-world Girma against the right opponent. X factors at this position include the future health of Tierna Davidson, but McKeown has shown marked progress internationally even in a few months. A brief injury in the spring kept Ryan out of U.S. camp, but don't forget that she has been dynamic and effective from multiple positions in her brief stints with the team. Ryan can play anywhere across the front four. The most important thing for her in the near term is making sure she keeps producing at the club level for a Houston team that still hasn't found its footing. Her older sister, Alyssa, has already had her breakout moments for club and country; Gisele's are on the horizon. Cooper can take on defenders on the wing and get to the end line, and she can score from central areas. There is stiff competition for the winger roles -- don't forget that the starting Olympic forward trio of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson are likely due back at some point -- but Hayes has clearly been impressed by Cooper. She ranks second behind Aubrey Kingsbury (who was the No. Bethune is a creative talent with the bravery to attempt risky passes and the technical ability to execute them. She tied the NWSL record for assists last year as a rookie while debuting ahead of the team's Olympic run. 10, as she reminded the world in a recent dazzling performance against Canada, but Bethune, who is six years younger, has a similar skill set that can't be ignored. Bethune just needs refining and more time on the field after a long injury layoff. Patterson might have had the best run of spring games of any new USWNT player, punctuated by a strong showing against Canada earlier this month. She's an exceptional two-way fullback with the right mix of athleticism and vision. Her ascent is perfectly timed with Hayes' search for solutions at the position. Patterson's goal against Ireland last month was a tangible reward. Come 2027, she might line up as the fullback opposite Emily Fox. She is Sam Coffey's primary competition -- and seven years younger. There's something about Sentnor when she gets on the ball. She appears to move faster with the ball at her feet in the open field than when she sprints without it, leading U.S. great Tobin Heath to compare her to Lionel Messi. It's her starting role to lose, and by way of the need for a new trio of goalkeepers, only injury or an unfathomable dip in form would keep her away from the 2027 World Cup team. Her recent transfer to OL Lyonnes from Ajax marks the next step in her development to train alongside top world players daily. Yohannes is remarkably composed as a deep-lying playmaker, and her final ball to break defensive lines shows the kind of skill set the U.S. wishes it had in recent years. Hayes has worked hard to control the hype around Yohannes, but the reality is that any midfield starting combination in 2027 will come together around her.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arda Güler emerged as a standout performer for Real Madrid during their recent FIFA Club World Cup campaign, despite the team's disappointing 4-0 semifinal defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. Güler, alongside fellow breakthrough star Gonzalo Garcia, was a constant threat in the final third, leaving a significant impression on observers. According to MARCA, Alonso was particularly impressed not only by Güler's technical quality but also by his tactical maturity and adaptability. During the tournament, Güler was deployed in a deeper midfield role, operating in a system with three central defenders behind him. This position was unfamiliar to the young Turk, yet he thrived, showcasing his technique and vision while also demonstrating a willingness to contribute defensively. The tactical shift aimed to leverage his creative abilities while demanding more defensive responsibility. This positive development marks a significant turn for Güler, who endured a frustrating start to his Real Madrid career due to injuries and limited playing time. He now appears to have found a coach who believes in his potential. While Xabi Alonso has a considerable task ahead in implementing his playing style at the Santiago Bernabéu, all indications suggest that Güler will play a pivotal role in his plans. This newfound prominence for Güler is a promising sign for Real Madrid, especially amidst recent reports linking star forward Rodrygo with a potential departure from the club this summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>chants at the U.S. women's soccer team's 2019 World Cup triumph. People who have been involved in women's sports for a while couldn't help remembering 2019, when the U.S. women's soccer team's World Cup title was greeted by chants of “Equal pay!” in stadiums from the  United States to France, where the tournament was held. And while WNBA players have their own goals at the bargaining table, the connection wasn't just made by outsiders. Spend enough time watching basketball and soccer, and you'll see a fair number of players from both sports at each other's games, especially in cities with WNBA and NWSL teams. They don't just pass by each other, either. Megan Rapinoe is a courtside regular at New York Liberty games with her equally famous fiancée, Sue Bird, who was a Seattle Storm teammate of Breanna Stewart for years before retiring. Rapinoe also spent many of her playing years in Seattle with the NWSL's Reign, so it was it was only natural that she also befriended Stewart. And given Rapinoe's history of advocacy, it's only natural now that Stewart can seek her advice. “That will probably be my next conversation after the next meeting at the end of July,” Stewart said, adding that WNBA players noticed the historic gains made by NWSL players in their CBA deal last year. So then thereafter, it creates a standard for all the other leagues.” » READ MORE: WNBA players say ‘Pay Us What You Owe Us' at All-Star Game, while commissioner remains ‘optimistic' as CBA tensions rise Kahleah Copper, the pride of North Philadelphia, said, “It means a lot to have the public support because it's just giving us another platform to really push for what we want.” So to want to see the players that make their experience that much better at these games, at these venues, at these arenas — they know that this is a collaborative effort. Former U.S. star midfielder Sam Mewis spent years on her union's bargaining committee. Now a member of the media herself as a podcaster with the Men in Blazers network, she still vividly recalls her feelings from that magic summer. “I remember our lawyers and PR team insisting that the public pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to come to terms with us was a huge factor in our negotiations. Its president at the time, Carlos Cordeiro, famously botched pronouncing Rapinoe's name during the team's World Cup victory celebration at New York's City Hall. But that was a small misstep compared to the one he made six months later: a lack of oversight of sexist language in a legal filing by U.S. Soccer's lawyers in the equal pay suit. The furor that ensued forced his resignation, amid criticism not just from the women's game but also U.S. men's team coach Gregg Berhalter and MLS commissioner Don Garber. For as much criticism as Engelbert has taken from fans and players, it seems hard to believe she'll suffer a fate that severe. Though the former Deloitte consultant has been accused of lacking a common touch — just as Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs banker, was — she spent a lot of time talking with players at the All-Star Game, and got credit from them for it. Engelbert also knows where the WNBA needs to get, even if that doesn't make it any easier to convince  the people who sign her paycheck: WNBA team owners, and NBA team owners who also invest in the league without owning teams. The players want a big increase in their share of league revenues, and they see three factors. NBA players get around 50% of that league's basketball-related revenues, while WNBA players get only around 9.3% of theirs. But while the WNBA obviously hasn't made as much money over the years, the league now has a $2.2 billion media rights deal starting next season, plus three expansion teams paying $250 million entry fees. “All these teams are being added, we don't see a dime of it,” Cloud said. “How much does it cost to buy into our league? So why don't we see any of it? “I think there [are] a lot of people on social media who don't know,” she said. » READ MORE: Kahleah Copper is leaning into leadership for the Phoenix Mercury — and offering advice for Philly's WNBA franchise It ultimately was won by his successor, Cindy Cone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joel Latibeaudiere, now at Coventry, and Manchester City's Phil Foden were Curtis Anderson's team-mates in 2017 Anderson, a former Manchester City goalkeeper who helped England win the Under-17s Fifa World Cup in 2017, is able to sip his flat white in relative peace as he explains why he gave up his dream and became a financial adviser instead. Of the 21 players who triumphed in India eight years ago, Anderson is the only one who is no longer playing football at any level. Anderson works for an independent financial adviser, where he heads the sports department. Half of his time is spent exclusively with athletes - mainly footballers - helping them make informed financial decisions to maximise their earnings from a short career. "You can literally change people's lives by taking money stresses away," Anderson tells BBC Sport. England had a squad including future Premier League regulars Phil Foden - who was named player of the tournament - Morgan Gibbs-White, Conor Gallagher, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Marc Guehi, and produced a remarkable comeback to beat Spain 5-2 after trailing 2-0. "We were so relaxed and confident, nobody panicked," Anderson recalls. "We pulled a goal back then went into half-time thinking 'we've got this'. There was no one getting stressed or going crazy in the dressing room." Anderson was on top of the world but, by his own admission, he became impatient. Anderson saved a spot kick as England beat Japan 5-3 on penalties in the last 16 With few options on the table, Anderson decided to join American side Charlotte Independence of the United Soccer League on a permanent basis in March 2019. It was a decision he came to regret - three months later, the manager who signed Anderson was sacked, and he found himself out of favour. "I was in such a desperate rush to do everything. I was looking at other young players, what they were doing, and not really valuing the path that I was on. "Playing for City and England, my trajectory would have been straight up." After a year on the books at Wycombe Wanderers, Anderson dropped down into non-league before retiring in 2023. "The spark of football just wasn't really there," he says. The decision to fully stop playing came quite easily." "Being in a high performance environment every single day, where you try to achieve the highest level, working as hard as you can and being called out if you're not at the level - not many kids are exposed to that," he says. "Football gave me absolutely everything, in terms of exposure and the opportunity to mature really young." When the coronavirus lockdown left Anderson unable to find a new club, he started wondering how the money he had earned at City had dwindled away. "I remember being 17 and not knowing what to do with the money, it was a daunting thing," he says. Anderson passed accountancy and finance exams after contacting the Professional Footballers' Association for guidance. He's worked in financial planning and advice ever since, turning down several offers to return to the Football League as his heart wasn't in it. "At Wycombe, I'd get questions from older players," he says. "I realised there is a lack of education and support about finance in football. "There's not enough education, guidance and support for young people with high earnings. "If you're a lower-league player, your immediate priority should be to plan for life after football. But when he sees his former England team-mates succeeding at the top of the game, does he have any regrets? If you offered to put me in their situations now, playing week-in week-out in the Premier League, I wouldn't trade that for what I'm doing now.
