                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, over a week later, the rock icon has been laid to rest. Naturally, many of his family, close friends, and colleagues attended the funeral. Notably, Ozzy Osbourne's funeral procession was held on July 30 in Birmingham, his hometown. July 30 was a profoundly emotional day for the Osbourne family as they were joined by many to bid farewell to Ozzy. Jack also wore a pair of black shades to the funeral. According to Page Six, he included a solver cross embellishment on his black Chrome Hearts tie. This is a nod to the fact that Ozzy Osbourne often donned jewelry, which typically included crosses. Sharon Osbourne wore one of his gold rings as a necklace to the funeral. Kelly wore a pair of sunglasses that resembled the ones her father wore, while Aimee donned a bat brooch. Ozzy Osbourne was honored in his hometown with a funeral procession. According to CBS News, it stretched from Broad Street all the way to a canal bridge that's named after Black Sabbath. The bridge features life-size renderings of the Black Sabbath members, which, in addition to Ozzy Osbourne, include Terry “Geezer” Butler, Tony Iommi, and Bill Ward. There is currently a memorial at the bridge for Ozzy, and Sharon Osbourne added flowers to it during the procession. Lord Mayor of Birmingham Zafar Iqbal also attended the procession and released a statement. It reads, “Ozzy was more than a music legend — he was a son of Birmingham.” Ozzy will be missed by his family, friends, and countless fans from all over the world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The runner-up in the 2024 U.S. presidential election won't be running for California‘s top job next year, but Kamala Harris isn't ruling out a 2028 White House bid yet. After months of speculation and impressive polling, the former Vice President has made it official: She's not going to be on the ballot to lead the Golden State. “After deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for Governor in this election,” Harris said Wednesday. The news certainly comes as a surprise to those outside Harris' inner circle, though sources say Gov. A little ahead of schedule, today's announcement may send some shockwaves through the West Coast body politic as all indications were that the former Veep was staffed up and ready to roll up to Sacramento. Eleni Kounalakis, ex-Rep. Katie Porter, and current CA Attorney General Rob Bonta have all publicly stated that their own plans would be contingent on what Harris decided. For one thing, as we await Trump's inevitable condescending social-media response to his rival's decision, Harris certainly intends to be in the trenches for the 2026 midterms, even if she's not running. “I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.” For another thing, the use of the term “for now” gives career politician Harris that wiggle room all POTUS contenders like to have if events and donation swing in their favor. With Trump constitutionally unable to run again, at least in theory, current VP JD Vance looks to be the top GOP contender – a match-up over which Harris and many other Democrats can barely contain themselves. A University of California, Irvine poll earlier this month showed that Harris would be the top choice of Californians, garnering 41% support, while an unnamed Republican got 29%. A large number of voters were undecided.But even with her advantages, a gubernatorial race carried some risks, particularly if next year's midterms reflect another cycle of voter discontent. It's rather rare for a former vice president, much less one who has been at the top of a national party ticket, to seek another office other than the presidency. Richard Nixon's career was written off for dead after he ran for California governor in 1962 and lost, after serving as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president. Walter Mondale sought to return to the Senate in 2002 after serving as Jimmy Carter's vice president and lost that bid. So far, the Democratic field for governor is heavy in party stalwarts, like Kounalakis and Porter – albeit they are not as well known as Harris. It also includes former assembly speaker Toni Atkins, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.Additionally, said to be mulling a run for governor is developer and former Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rick Caruso. On Instagram earlier this week, the onetime Republican and Democrat posted a photo of himself with Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor and Assembly powerhouse, who once dated Harris. Over the past six months, I have spent time reflecting on this moment in our nation's history, and the best way for me to continue fighting for the American people and advancing the values and ideals I hold dear.I am a devout public servant, and from the earliest days of my career, I have believed that the best way I could make a difference in people's lives and fight for a better future was to improve the system from within. And it has been a profound honor to do that work and serve the people of California and our nation—as a prosecutor, Attorney General, United States Senator, and Vice President.In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their Governor. At the same time, we must recognize that our politics, our government, and our institutions have too often failed the American people, culminating in this moment of crisis. As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking—committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook. For now, my leadership—and public service—will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans. And We, the People must use our power to fight for freedom, opportunity, fairness, and the dignity of all. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

I'm a liberal but it would be disastrous if she runs again in 2028 after the country gave her a resounding “NO!”. Good idea Kamala you can probably rule out 2028 also!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Osbourne died last week at the age of 76, sparking tributes from throughout the music world: Green Day played a snippet of Black Sabbath's “Iron Man” onstage to thank Osbourne, Alice Cooper and his band sang Sabbath's “Paranoid,” and artists from Pearl Jam to Metallica posted remembrances. The powerhouse country vocalist has talked often about her love of hard rock, performed with Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose numerous times, and covered songs by fellow umlaut bands Mötley Crüe and Motörhead in concert. She's also been known to slay “Mama, I'm Comin' Home,” Osbourne's 1991 power ballad.

Tony-nominated actors Gad and Rannells have been close friends since starring together on Broadway in the 2011 hit musical The Book of Mormon. This marks their first on-screen collaboration beyond their cameos in History of the World, Part II alongside about 100 other actors. “For over a decade Andrew and I have been the Laverne and Shirley of our generation (according to our mothers. “It only makes sense to now do a TV series where we can literally do an episode as ‘Laverne and Shirley' (assuming the rights to those characters aren't prohibitively expensive and that the algorithm rewards ‘Laverne and Shirley' viewership. Added Rannells, “Personally, Josh and I have always reminded me more of a Sam and Diane or at times a Cagney and Lacey, but either way, I am thrilled we are reuniting once again! This time with Akiva, Greg and Jordan, who seem even more unhinged than we are.” This also marks a reunion between Cahan and Rannells after working together on Showtime's Black Monday. Cahan co-created and executive produced the series, in which Rannells starred opposite Don Cheadle and Regina Hall, earning a Critics Choice Award nomination. Known for his role in HBO's Girls opposite Lena Dunham, Rannells recently reunited with her in her Netflix comedy series Too Much.

Through Goldsman's Weed Road Productions, he also is writing an animated feature for Michael B Jordan through Warner Brothers on the feature side.

You may have seen “Psycho Beach Party,” director Robert Lee King and writer Charles Busch's wickedly funny send-up of classic Hollywood, while surfing on late-night cable channels in the early aughts. Based on Busch's own play from 1987, which was itself inspired by Frederick Kohner's late-'50s Gidget character and her initiation into surf culture, “Psycho Beach Party” is exactly as the title sounds: part slasher, part beach movie, and all pastiche and split-personality. That's apropos, as a then little-known, pre-“Six Feet Under” Lauren Ambrose plays Florence, aka Chicklet, a schizoid who becomes the prime suspect in a series of comically mounting beachside murders. She plays the role as a careening cross between Tallulah Bankhead and Sandra Dee — who of course originated Gidget, the original wannabe surf girl, onscreen in 1959. Screenwriter Busch, who, gay and in his 30s, played the 16-year-old teenage girl Gidget — sorry, Chicklet — in his original off-Broadway stage show here plays the detective-in-drag investigating the murders. Related Stories The American Cinematheque's ‘Friend of the Fest' Brings Your Favorite Movies and Podcasts Together Academy Museum of Motion Pictures to Host ‘Cyberpunk' Series at NYC's Paris Theater The fizzy, gee-whiz humor clashing with the melodramatic camp makes for one of the mostly wildly unpredictable tones of any candy-colored camp movie — and one that also had an early eye for starlets, including a then still-indie-actress Amy Adams, “Buffy” breakout Nicholas Brendon, “Criminal Minds” star Thomas Gibson, and more. (“Psycho Beach Party,” also, is stacked with shirtless male surfers, and therefore homoerotic tension breaks through like a tidal wave.) “Psycho Beach Party” celebrates its 25th anniversary this month with Q&A screenings (featuring Ambrose, Busch, and director King) on July 30 and 31 at the IFC Center in New York City. The film will also receive a physical media release at a later date, with support from the film's original producer/distributor, Strand Releasing. IndieWire caught up with Charles Busch, who lives in New York, over the phone ahead of the upcoming screenings. This interview has been condensed and edited for length. IndieWire: The movie, which you began as a kind of midnight-movie play, is set in the early '60s, but it's more attuned to '50s movies yet with a postmodern, perverted twist. Charles Busch: The slasher film, too, which was very '70s. So when Strand wanted to produce the movie, and they teamed me with Bob King, who was a young director/screenwriter who had done a short subject that [Strand] had released, and they wanted to do a feature with him. We were teamed up, and at that point, I had never written a screenplay. Bob was extraordinarily helpful, and he had a great fondness for '70s slasher movies and thought that if we added that element, that would give us a melodrama plot. I was in my 40s at that point, and even if I wasn't at that point, we wanted it to be more naturalistic… Having an actual killer suggested we also had to have a detective, and that really fit my stage persona, a Susan Hayward, tough, glamorous lady. The casting director, Laura Schiff, is a revered TV casting director now who did “Mad Men,” “Shogun,” “The West Wing,” and all these series. She discovered Lauren Ambrose for this movie. The actual story is that I had this wonderful manager named Jeff Melnick who died a few years ago. I don't know too many people who can say that their agent or manager thought more of their talents than they did themselves, but Jeff was that. He kept insisting that “Psycho Beach Party” should be a movie, and I didn't really get it. But he kept pursuing it for years, and every once in a while, he would call me and say, “Oh, so and so passed.” I said, “I didn't know they were looking at it!” Then, he took on as a client Bob King [the director of the film]. What do you think about the movie is worth discovering for younger audiences now? There is so much more film literacy now between Letterboxd and Criterion that younger audiences might actually get the references at this point. I was just looking through their catalogue and, my god, to think of it… [to be] in the same collection as the greatest films by Fellini and Kurosawa and Truffaut. These movies can kind of disappear, and I'm hoping this will lead to Criterion taking on my follow-up picture, “Die, Mommie, Die!,” which I'm very proud of.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sitting at the piano after singing her Billboard Hot 100-topping Bruno Mars duet, “Die With a Smile,” solo, the pop superstar tearfully thanked Polansky as Little Monsters in the Los Angeles crowd cheered, as captured in a clip on X. “It's so much more fun doing this with you, my babe,” she continued, before addressing her fans. Gaga went on to sing “Vanish Into You” from her No. “Like anyone would do for the person they love, I encouraged her to lean in to the joy of it,” Polansky told Vogue last September. The musician has since spoken many times on their close relationship, calling him her “best friend” and revealing in March that she wants to have children with him “more than anything.” For now, though, the star's focus is on her Mayhem Ball Tour, which kicked off earlier in July with three nights in Las Vegas. After she finishes four performances at the Kia Forum, she'll bring the trek to New York City, Toronto and Chicago and more North American cities before embarking on a European leg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This post honestly makes me sick,” Glynne wrote over a re-post of a screen shot from the ad in which the detainees' faces are visible while the immigration officer's heads are blurred out. “My music is about love, unity, and spreading positivity — never about division or hate,” she added along with two angry swearing emoji. The cheery 19-second post from the official White House X feed reads, “when ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation… Nothing beats it!,” along with a plane and music note emoji. The accompanying footage is cued to a 2022 ad campaign from British tour operator Jet2 featuring sunny narration from actress Zoë Lister-Jones and a snippet of Glynne's upbeat pop song. Actress Lister-Jones also responded in a now-expired Story post asking, “What can be done about the White House using Jet2's sound and my voiceover to promote their nasty agenda?” The chipper ad has resurfaced over the past two week as a viral TikTok sound used in a raft of videos depicting vacations gone wrong. But in the White House version, Lister's voiceover enthusing “nothing beats a Jet2 holiday!” is used as the background to footage of men bound by their feet and hands in shackles being marched onto planes by officers from the U.S. Immigration and Customs service whose faces are blurred out. The White House ad comes just weeks after Trump signed off on his so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” authorizing $170 billion in spending on border and immigration enforcement at a time when illegal border crossings have crashed to their lowest levels since the 1960s. The Jet2 ad is the latest in a line of White House digital clips making light of its immigration strategy, a roster that includes an ASMR video highlighting the sounds of clinking hand and ankle restraints being placed on detainees and a Studio Ghibli-like cartoon AI image seemingly mocking a woman crying after being taken into custody.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>André Holland produces and stars in Love, Brooklyn, the debut feature from director Rachael Abigail Holder. The trailer for the film, which will enjoy a limited opening on August 29 before hitting theaters nationwide September 5, is suffused with warmth while hitting those classic romantic beats—the impatient editor looking for the writer's next great work, the patient best friend offering words of wisdom, and two beautiful women offering two different versions of love. Love, Brooklyn follows Holland as he “navigates complicated relationships with his ex, an art gallery owner (Nicole Beharie), and his current lover, a newly-single mother (DeWanda Wise), with the support of his best friend (Roy Wood Jr.),” according to the film's synopsis. “A script originally written for white characters needed a culture to be infused into to it, so it wasn't really a challenge, it was an exciting venture to choose what that culture would be. We didn't just want the characters to be Black period. Blackness is a wide scope of people, and I wanted them to be specific.” Club‘s Jacob Oller observed that “Beharie and Wise are excellent at carving out small details of a dynamic that's more complex that it seems on the surface, but in a larger narrative sense, everyone's making the most out of a thin script.” He added, “It ends up like every other three-person romantic dramedy ends up, but at least Love, Brooklyn boasts competent players going through its motions.” Lena Dunham's Too Much is just right By Juan Barquin July 10, 2025 | 11:00am JEZEBELAna de Armas Holds Hands With 'Friend' and 'Mentor' Tom Cruise PASTEThe Sandman Showrunner Breaks Down Dream's  Season 2 Journey and Bringing the Comic Saga's Epic End to Life</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Idles have shared “Rabbit Run,” a new song that they made for Darren Aronofsky's upcoming crime caper Caught Stealing. Aronofsky enlisted Idles to capture the energy of the 1990s New York punk scene that colors Caught Stealing. “I built Caught Stealing to be a roller coaster of fun and wanted to supercharge the film by main lining a punk sensibility,” the director said in a press statement. Who better to collaborate with than Idles? It has been a dream watching them bend their notes to blast a hole in our movie screen.” Caught Stealing is based on screenwriter Charlie Huston's book of the same name. The film stars Austin Butler, Zoë Kravitz, Bad Bunny, Action Bronson, and others. It follows a former high school baseball star named Hank Thompson who winds up in a tangled web of organized crime when his punk rock neighbor asks him to watch his cat for a few days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world is saying its final goodbye to Black Sabbath musician Ozzy Osbourne. The rock icon's funeral procession was held on Wednesday, July 30, just over a week after his death on July 22. This is also where the hearse carrying Osbourne's coffin passed through. Osbourne's family attended the site where fans had left flowers, notes, and other memorabilia to honor the late musician. Sharon and Ozzy's rarely seen daughter, Aimee Osbourne, was also in attendance. Aimee can be seen in tears and later holding up peace signs alongside Sharon, E! Also photographed with the family was Ozzy's son, Louis. Louis is the son of Ozzy and his first wife, Thelma Riley. The death of Osbourne has had a profound impact on many people, and the tributes for him have poured in since his family first announced his passing. “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” the family said in a statement, Variety reports. “He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.” She chose to opt out of filming her family's MTV reality TV show, “The Osbournes.” The series ran from 2002 to 2005. Aimee has previously discussed her decision to stay out of the limelight. “For me, I had grown up around having a pretty well-known dad anyway, and … I always really valued my privacy within that family,” Aimée told New York's Q1043 radio, People reports. She continued, “And for me personally, and for who I am, you know, as far as morally and also just to give myself a chance to actually develop into a human being as opposed to just being remembered for being a teenager, it didn't really line up with what I saw my future as. It definitely worked great for the rest of my family, but for me, and who I am, I just knew it was never something that I would have been able to consider realistically.”</p>

Filmmakers including Robert Greene, Joshua Oppenheimer, Sarah Friedland, Radu Jude, Levan Akin, and Miguel Gomes are among the more than 35 who have signed an open letter from Film Workers for Palestine calling on indie distributor Mubi to part ways with investor Sequoia Capital. The venture capital firm has recently invested in Israeli military-aligned businesses, and backlash against Mubi has been growing since the investor's ties came to light in June. But since February 2024, Sequoia has also invested in Kela, a military tech startup that finds weapons and military-grade applications for AI and drone tech. Sequoia itself touts the partnership with Kela on its website as a way to “leverage Israel's unique cadre of technowarriors to help defend the Western world order.” Related Stories The American Cinematheque's ‘Friend of the Fest' Brings Your Favorite Movies and Podcasts Together Academy Museum of Motion Pictures to Host ‘Cyberpunk' Series at NYC's Paris Theater Out of Cannes 2025, Mubi made several more prominent acquisitions, including Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind,” and Lynne Ramsay's “Die My Love.” Mubi also has the forthcoming New York Film Festival opening night title, Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother.” The letter from Film Workers for Palestine, obtained by IndieWire, reads: We write as filmmakers who have a professional relationship to Mubi to express our serious concern regarding Mubi's decision to accept $100 million in funding from Sequoia Capital, aprivate equity firm that, since late 2023 has chosen to double down on investing in Israeli military technology companies with the goal of profiting from the Gazan genocide. In 2024, Sequoia heavily invested in Kela, a military tech startup founded by a former senior manager of Palantir Israel and multiple Israeli military intelligence veterans, as well as military drone manufacturer Neros, and the unmanned aerial vehicle manufacture, Mach Industries. Mubi's financial growth as a company is now explicitly tied to the genocide in Gaza, which implicates all of us that work with Mubi. We don't believe an arthouse film platform can meaningfully support a global community of cinephiles while also partnering with a company invested in murdering Palestinian artists and filmmakers. Yet Mubi's decision to partner with Sequoia demonstrates a total lack of accountability to the artists and communities who have helped the company flourish. We believe that it is our ethical duty to do no harm.

It went beyond the objectification he faced on set from executives and crew members. “Any guy who tells you he feels bad being objectified, I mean, really? He recalled being “advised not to” sue Warner Bros. over his schedule and finances from the series. “I didn't know enough back then about residuals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Stephen Colbert's Late Show was canceled earlier this month, the industry has been locked in an existential debate about whether CBS' decision had to do with politics or was purely financial, as the network itself claimed. “I think both things are just true and real,” Bee said in a recent appearance on the Breaking Bread With Tom Papa podcast when asked to weigh in on either side (via TheWrap). “You know, these legacy shows, they are hemorrhaging their money with no real end to that.” In her view, this state of affairs is due in part to the fact that “people are literally on their phones all the time… so they actually don't necessarily need a recap of the day's events.” She's not wrong; we recently saw the impact of this with the cancellation of E! The brand will now only produce content for social media. Bee herself has experience with pressure from the business side of things from her time hosting Full Frontal on TBS, which underwent multiple mergers during the show's run. It doesn't matter how important you think legacy media is, none of that fucking matters. You're talking about people, hundreds of millionaires and billionaires, literally making their business transactions. Bee does give Paramount Global execs some credit, saying that the conversations about The Late Show‘s financial issues (before its settlement with Trump, at least) were likely “agonizing.” The execs probably had “many agonizing conversations about what they were going to do to turn the ship around, what they were going to do to make the show profitable again. And that's true probably of all the shows, you know, how do we make this profitable?” she explained. Like, how do we not get a lot of blowback?' Sure they knew it was happening a long time ago, right? And the considerations were, like, ‘How can we position it so that the story can be not as bad as it could be?” Whether or not they accomplished that last one is certainly up for debate. Bee herself thinks it's “awful… I know so many people who work there.

Sound design studio Slate + Ash has released a new virtual guitar based on sounds designed by avant-garde guitarists including Sunn O)))'s Stephen O'Malley, Oren Ambarchi, and David Torn. Each guitarist contributed fragmentary sounds—loops, textures, resonances, and mechanical failures—that Slate + Ash used its playback engine to deconstruct and turn into a number of recursive preset sounds for the Kontakt 8 sampling platform. Watch a showcase for the software instrument, which is titled Ruins, below.

Randall Dunn's Williamsburg, Brooklyn, studio, Circular Ruin, co-created the instrument, and studio co-founders Ben Greenberg and Arjan Miranda—as well as prepared guitarist Bill Horist—contributed further source material. Slate + Ash and Circular Ruin describe the instrument as an “infinitely recursive sonic artefact” inspired by the short story that gave the latter studio its name, Jorge Luis Borges' The Circular Ruins.

Mitchell also joined forces with her partner, Matte Babel, to creative-direct the joyful video, which stars the couple and their two children, Atlas and Rome, in their first-ever family brand photoshoot. Gap has certainly stepped up its style game since hiring designer Zac Posen as creative director. Anne Hathaway debuted his Gap-backed return to the red carpet in a now-sold-out poplin shirtdress, while his GapStudio line has been sported by Demi Moore, Emily Ratajkowski, Timothée Chalamet, Alton Mason and other stars. The retailer has also previously collabed with Disney, Doen, LoveShackFancy, Malbon Golf and many other brands.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul Walter Hauser and Danny Huston also appear in director Akiva Schaffer's police procedural spoof built around the son of Leslie Nielsen's Frank Drebin. The three-man comedy factory that ruled the 1980s with their fusillades of slapstick, sight gags, loopy non sequiturs and winking innuendo was David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker — Hollywood's ZAZ before David Zaslav. Their legacy rivals that of Mel Brooks in the '60s and '70s, most notably via Airplane! and the Naked Gun movies, though I also have a soft spot for their swerve into more conventional farce with the acerbic dark comedy Ruthless People. Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson Gush About Their Team-Up in 'The Naked Gun': "So Much Fun" Dumb fun that lands often enough to squeak by. Release date: Friday, Aug. 1Cast: Liam Neeson, Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, CCH Pounder, Kevin Durand, Cody Rhodes, Liza Koshy, Eddie Yu, Danny HustonDirector: Akiva SchafferScreenwriters: Dan Gregor, Doug Maud, Akiva Schaffer, based on the TV series Police Squad! Their 1982 ABC series spoofing crime procedurals, Police Squad!, lasted just six episodes. (these guys seldom met an exclamation point they didn't love), which became a successful trilogy centering on Leslie Nielsen's bumbling but oblivious Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin. Nobody could accuse director Akiva Schaffer (who, like ZAZ, hails from a comedy trio, The Lonely Island) and his co-writers or producer Seth MacFarlane of lacking affection for the material. That's evident in the sweet homages to Nielsen and George Kennedy as Capt. and The Naked Gun, Neeson arrives trailing the gravitas of his late-career reinvention as a steely dispenser of vengeance and retribution, in Taken et al. The actor's dead serious delivery provides a subtle meta underlay as Frank Jr. takes down bad guys and tackles a master criminal, starting with a bank robbery prologue whose funniest jokes are given away in the trailer. The victim's sister, Beth Davenport (MVP Pamela Anderson), seeks Frank's help in investigating what she's convinced was murder. He tells her to leave the detective work to the professionals, but they both turn up at a club run by her brother's boss, Edentech founder Richard Kane (Danny Huston). A mogul cut from the Elon Musk mold, Kane has a nefarious plan involving an amusingly named PLOT Device (Primordial Law of Toughness) with mind-altering properties, which is part of what he calls “Project Inferno.” But before that gets activated, he cozies up to Frank with the gift of Police Squad's first electric cop car. Weary of dealing with angry calls from the mayor about Frank's blithe trail of city property destruction, police chief Davis (CCH Pounder) warns him to play nice with major donor Kane, since Police Squad's funding is at risk. That thread doesn't really go anywhere in the script by Dan Gregor, Doug Maud and Schaffer. The same goes for Hauser's thankless role as Ed Hocken Jr., who plays straight man to Frank's self-serious dimwit, when the writers remember to include him. Senior or junior, Frank Drebin is an L.A. city cop, not Ethan Hunt. His tough-guy physical comedy also scores, as he swats off armed criminals or bites off the barrel of a gun pointed at him without breaking a sweat. There's a moment early on in which he kneels beneath his father's photograph on the Police Squad wall of honor and says, “I want to be just like you, but at the same time, completely different.” Which is pretty much the manifesto of anyone reviving a popular franchise after multiple decades of dormancy. Neeson clearly is having a blast sending up his hyperviolent screen persona of recent years, and his enjoyment is infectious up to a point. Continuing her renaissance after The Last Showgirl, Anderson displays impeccable comic timing, never leaning too hard into a line when her breathy throwaway delivery can land a bigger laugh. At one point, Kane asks Beth, “May I speak freely?” She replies, “I prefer English.” In another moment, Frank, curious about where she went to college, asks, “UCLA?” With only the tiniest frown of confusion, she tells him, “I see it every day. Dialogue like that may come from the hoariest school of comedy writing, but the charm of Anderson's buoyant screen presence keeps it fresh and funny. Beth is a character who defends her crime-solving instincts by saying, “I write true crime stories, based on fictional crimes that I make up.” But it's crucial to Anderson's performance that Beth sails over every idiocy the script throws at her as if she's making perfect sense.
