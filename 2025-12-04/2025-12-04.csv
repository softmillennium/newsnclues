            Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seize Ukraine's Donbas region “by military or other means,” digging in on one of his key demands as Ukrainian officials prepare for more peace talks that have yet to yield a deal.
    


            Putin arrived in New Delhi on Thursday where he will be hosted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two days after a meeting at the Kremlin with a US delegation led by special envoy Steve Witkoff.
    


            Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are traveling to the US on Thursday, where they have been invited to hold talks with their American counterparts on a plan to end Moscow's war, a Ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation told CNN.
    


            Ahead of the Modi summit, Putin gave an interview with India Today, in which he said Russia would “liberate Donbas and Novorossiya in any case – by military or other means,” according to Russian state media TASS.
    


            Asked what would constitute a victory for Russia in the war, Putin said: “We will finish it when we achieve the goals set at the beginning of the special military operation, when we free these territories. That's all.”
    


A trade deal with Washington and a warm welcome for Putin: Can India have it both ways?



            One of the Kremlin's biggest demands is for Ukraine to surrender territory in the Donbas region, which Russia has illegally annexed but not yet fully conquered. Novorossiya, or New Russia, is a historical term referring to territories toward the west during the Russian empire; Putin has revived the term, and used it in declaring the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea as part of Russia in 2014.
    


            As Russia doubles down on these territorial demands, which Ukrainian officials continue to reject, the path towards any compromise seems increasingly unclear.
    


            Despite Putin's bullish claims, Russian forces would only seize the entire Donetsk region in August 2027 at the current rate of their advance, an analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, found.
    


            In Putin's description of his Tuesday meeting in Moscow with Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, he said Russia did not agree with some of the points of the US proposal, but that it was a “difficult task.” He reiterated Russia's demands that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the Donbas and “refrain from military action,” according to TASS.
    


            The meeting lasted a long time as both parties had to “go through each point of the peace proposals,” Putin added, according to TASS.
    


            Trump said Wednesday the US delegation had a “very good meeting” with Putin, and that they believed the Russian president “would like to see the war ended” – though the talks failed to yield a breakthrough.
    


            “What comes out of that meeting?” he added. “I can't tell you, because it does take two to tango.”
    


            Both sides have remained coy about any progress they made in this latest round of negotiations, which have been ongoing since a 28-point plan drafted by the Trump adminstration was leaked in late November. Several points in that plan were widely seen as concessions to Russia and contained ideas that had previously been rejected by Ukraine and European officials.
    


            Only small details from these meetings have been released, such as Putin's aide and foreign policy advisor Yury Ushakov acknowledging that they discussed territory in the meeting on Tuesday, “without which we do not see a solution to the crisis.”
    


Putin sends Trump's messengers packing, with eyes on a geopolitical win



            He added that some points in the American proposals “look more or less acceptable,” while others “do not suit us.”
    


            Ukrainian officials Rustem Umerov, the head of the country's delegation, and Andrii Hnatov, Kyiv's Chief of the General Staff, are traveling to Miami Thursday for their own peace talks with the US. There, they will discuss the results of Witkoff and Kushner's meeting in Moscow, according to Oleksandr Bevz, advisor to the Presidential Chief of Staff and a member of the negotiations team.
    


            These talks comes four days after a previous high-level meeting between US and Ukrainian officials that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as “a very productive and useful session where … additional progress was made.”

UNITED NATIONS, December 4. /TASS/. Russia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya has arrived in Lebanon as part of a delegation of UN Security Council member states.

""On December 3, Permanent Representative V. A.

NEW DELHI, December 4. /TASS/. The proposals on a Ukrainian settlement brought by American envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are based on agreements reached during the Russia-US summit in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted in an interview with India Today.

He also noted that Washington proposed breaking a 28-point peace plan drafted by the United States into four separate packages and discussing them that way.

TASS has compiled the main statements made by the Russian leader.

The meeting with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in the Kremlin was ‘very useful.""

It lasted ""five hours,"" as each point should be discussed in detail.

The proposals on a Ukrainian settlement brought by American envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are based on agreements reached during the Russia-US summit in Alaska: ""What our US colleagues brought us was based one way or another on our agreements from my meeting with [US] President [Donald] Trump in Alaska, as we discussed these issues at the meeting in Anchorage.""

US President Donald Trump is sincerely trying to find a consensus solution to the Ukrainian problem, but that ""is no easy feat.""

There were issues during work on the peace plan for Ukraine on which no consensus was reached, ""but it is difficult work. <...> In some cases, we said, 'Yes, we can discuss this, ' but we cannot agree on it.'""

While a 28-point peace plan drafted by the United States earlier is still valid and being discussed, Washington proposed breaking it into four separate packages: ""They just broke these 28 or 27 points into four packages. And they proposed discussing these four packages with us. But, in effect, they are the same [points].""

Moscow proposed that Kiev pull back Ukrainian armed forces from Donbass, which would have avoided any military confrontation, but Ukraine opted to continue hostilities: ""We immediately told Ukraine, the Ukrainian troops: the people do not want to live with you, they held a referendum and voted for independence — withdraw your troops, and there will be no military actions. No, they prefer the path of armed confrontation.""

Russia will liberate Donbass and Novorossiya either by military or other means: ""It all boils down to this: either we will liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories and stop fighting there.""

Europeans need to engage in the work on a Ukrainian settlement, not hinder it.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Der Spiegel quotes leaked call in which European leaders voice doubts about Washington's approach to peace talks

Emmanuel Macron has reportedly warned Volodymyr Zelenskyy that “there is a chance that the US will betray Ukraine on territory, without clarity on security guarantees”, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported, quoting a leaked note from a recent call with several European leaders.

Der Spiegel said it had obtained an English summary of Monday's call, featuring what it said were direct quotations from European heads of government in which they expressed fundamental doubts about Washington's approach to the talks.

The French president described the current tense phase of the negotiations as harbouring “a big danger” for Ukraine's embattled president, according to the summary. Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, reportedly added that the Ukrainian leader needed to be “very careful”.

“They are playing games with both you and us,” Merz was reported as telling him – a remark the magazine concluded was a reference to a diplomatic mission to Moscow this week by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The magazine said other leaders also voiced their concerns, with Finland's Alexander Stubb, who has bonded with Trump over golf, reportedly warning “we must not leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys”.

Even the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte – who in public is very complimentary of Trump – reportedly said he agreed with Stubb “that we need to protect Volodymyr”.

Der Spiegel said it spoke with “several” participants of the call, who confirmed it took place, and two of them reportedly said the remarks were “accurately reproduced”.

A spokesperson for Zelenskyy declined to comment, as did Merz's office, while the Élysée Palace contested the quotes attributed to Macron. Der Spiegel said Rutte's office had declined to comment.

The magazine produced a report in German and separately published an English version, saying it contained original quotes from the summary note.

Last month, Washington presented a 28-point proposal to halt the war in Ukraine, drafted without input from Ukraine's European allies and criticised as too close a reflection of Moscow's maximalist demands.

A flurry of diplomacy has followed, with US and Ukrainian negotiators holding talks in Geneva and Florida before Witkoff and Kushner headed to Moscow on Tuesday.

The pair spent five hours in talks with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin and Witkoff is due to meet Ukraine's national security council chief, Rustem Umerov, in Miami on Thursday.

The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said in parliament on Thursday that an imposed peace would be “disastrous” not only for Kyiv but also Europe's security.

He called on European nations not to let up in their support for Ukraine.

“A dictated peace would be disastrous for Europe … because a Ukraine which is militarily beaten or potentially even defeated at the negotiating table (or) destabilised domestically through Russian influence, would put Europe's security at risk,” Pistorius said.

In a guest column for the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Merz argued for the use of frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine, and said Europe appeared to be largely on its own in protecting its interests.

“The question of European independence is being decided today, when our security interests are under threat. And it will be decided by whether we rise to this challenge,” he said.

“We are sending a signal of European independence, a signal that we Europeans decide and shape what happens on our continent.”

Merz stressed that “we cannot leave it to other, non-European countries to decide what happens to the financial resources of an aggressor that have been lawfully frozen within the jurisdiction of our constitutional state and in our own currency.

“What we decide now will determine the future of Europe.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Amnesty International finds immigrants at Florida facility were shackled and left outside in metal cage for up to a day

Detainees at the notorious Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” were shackled inside a 2ft high metal cage and left outside without water for up to a day at a time, a shocking report published on Thursday by Amnesty International alleges.

The human rights group said migrants held at the state-run Everglades facility, and at Miami's Krome immigration processing center operated by a private company on behalf of the Trump administration, continue to be exposed to “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” rising in some cases to torture.

The cage, known to detainees as “the box”, is used by guards for the arbitrary punishment of trivial or non-existent offenses, according to the report compiled from interviews with detainees and advocacy groups, and a site visit to Krome made by Amnesty workers in September.

“It's a box outside, exposed to the south Florida sun and humidity, and exposed to mosquitos,” one detainee told the group.

“One time, two people in my cell were calling out to the guards telling them that I needed my medication. Ten guards rushed into the cell and threw them to the ground. They were taken to the ‘box' and punished just for trying to help me. I saw a guy who was put in it for an entire day.”

The Florida department of emergency management (DEM) operates “Alligator Alcatraz” independently of federal facilities under the umbrella of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Molly Best, press secretary to Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis, told the Guardian the Amnesty report was “nothing more than a politically motivated attack”.

“None of these fabrications are true. In fact, running these allegations without any evidence whatsoever could jeopardize the safety and security of our staff and those being housed at Alligator Alcatraz,” she said.

DEM has also previously denied any mistreatment of migrants held awaiting deportation from the remote camp. Despite those claims, the camp, which opened in July following a boastful visit from Donald Trump, quickly earned a reputation for harsh conditions including alleged human rights abuses and denial of due process.

It was ordered to close by a federal judge in August after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges, one whose husband has close ties to DeSantis, blocked the closure ruling.

Amnesty International's report details allegations at “Alligator Alcatraz” of “unsanitary conditions, including overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into where people are sleeping, limited access to showers, exposure to insects without protective measures, lights on 24 hours a day, poor quality food and water, and lack of privacy”.

It said: “People interviewed shared that access to medical care is inconsistent, inadequate, or denied altogether, placing individuals at serious risk of both physical and mental harm. People reported being always shackled when they were outside their cage.”

The group also said it found a similar situation at the “chaotic” Krome North Service processing center in west Miami. That center was notably the subject of a separate July report by Human Rights Watch, who alleged detainees were shackled with their hands tied behind their backs and made to kneel to eat food from styrofoam plates “like dogs”.

Amnesty documented what it said were delays in intake procedures, overcrowding in temporary processing areas, inadequate and inaccessible medical care, “alarming” disciplinary practices including the use of prolonged solitary confinement and challenges in access to legal representation and due process.

Violence and racist abuse by guards against migrants were commonplace, Amnesty said, adding that one of its own staffers witnessed a guard violently slamming a metal flap of a door to a solitary confinement room against a man's injured hand.

Other arriving detainees were forced to sleep for several days on a bus with no toilet facilities or air conditioning, Amnesty said, until space could be found inside.

“Krome's extreme overcrowding, medical neglect, and reports of humiliating and degrading treatment paint a picture of harrowing human right violations,” said Amy Fischer, the group's director of refugee and migrant rights.

Day-to-day operations at Krome are provided by the for-profit Akima Global Services LLC, which signed a $685m contract with ICE last year during the final months of Joe Biden's presidency. The company does not list a media contact on its website, and a request for comment from ICE was not returned.

Amnesty also criticized the unorthodox operation of “Alligator Alcatraz”, the country's first state-run immigration jail supporting federal operations, and funded by a $608m reimbursement to Florida taxpayers in October by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“It operates outside federal oversight, without the basic tracking systems used in ICE facilities,” the report said, claiming that some detainees ended up there after multiple transfers between facilities in short order, making it impossible for their families or legal representatives to know their whereabouts.

“The absence of registration or tracking mechanisms for those detained facilitates incommunicado detention and constitutes enforced disappearances.”

Amnesty's report concludes with a number of recommendations, including a call for Florida to close “Alligator Alcatraz” and end all agreements and cooperation with federal immigration authorities. It also calls on the Trump administration to halt the “criminalization of migration” and end mass detention.

“These findings are a wake-up call,” said Mary Kapron, a member of Amnesty International's research team.

“The treatment of people inside these immigrant detention centers is cruelty, hard stop. The medical neglect, filthy and inhuman conditions, and dehumanizing punishment, in some cases amounting to torture, is abhorrent. Federal and state officials must act immediately to end this human rights crisis.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Humanity's future lies in some of the most vulnerable spots on the planet.

We have seen that in stark relief of late. A UN report last month concluded that the world's population is increasingly crowded into a group of often low-lying, middle-income megacities in Asia and Africa.

Jakarta and Dhaka have dethroned Tokyo's long-held status as the world's biggest city, with 42 million, 37 million and 33 million people respectively. Mexico City and Sao Paulo were overtaken by Shanghai and Cairo among the global top 10. Bangkok, New Delhi, Karachi, Lagos, Luanda and Manila are some of the fastest growing among metropolises of more than 10 million.

Illustration: Mountain People

Many of these very regions have been hit by a devastating run of floods. The monsoon belt from Southeast Asia to West Africa is at the same time the swath of the globe that is urbanizing fastest, and the one where catastrophic rainfall is set to increase most dramatically. More than 1,000 people have been killed in a wave of storms that have stretched from Sri Lanka to Vietnam, with more than 700 dead in Indonesia and at least 267 fatalities in Thailand.

Such disastrous events are hardly unprecedented. Most of our earliest civilizations grew up along inundation-prone river valleys, as evidenced by the near-universality of deluge myths. In the same rural areas of Southeast Asia that have been among the worst-hit by the rains, homes were traditionally built on stilts under steeply pitched roofs to allow water to run away without doing harm. Local traditions often warn against building near wild rivers prone to bursting their banks.

The sophistication of this vernacular technology is underappreciated, but — as with the more technical modeling that is done to mitigate flash flooding in the modern urban environment — it is inadequate to the challenges we face as our planet warms.

With each degree that the local temperature rises, the atmosphere's ability to hold moisture goes up by about 7 percent. That is an immense amount when you consider that a cyclone can easily hold half a billion tonnes of water. Indigenous knowledge, like modern flood maps, is grounded in a historical understanding of how rainwater behaves, but the heating of our planet is making all those old predictions irrelevant.

The risks of this are greatest in the expanding megacities. The current rural population of about 1.5 billion would barely grow before heading into permanent decline in the 2040s, according to the UN, but two-thirds of population growth from now to 2050 would be in cities. About half of the billion new urbanites would be in just seven countries, most of them in the Asian and African monsoon belts — India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Bangladesh and Ethiopia.

Unlike rural-dwellers who can often site their settlements in more stable locations, city migrants rarely have much choice about where to live. That is why so many shantytowns are built on land previously neglected as too risky, from the landslide-prone hillsides of Brazil's favelas and Venezuela's barrios to the swamps that gave rise to slums in Mumbai's Dharavi, Bangkok's Khlong Toei and Lagos' Makoko.

Precious few of these places have the sort of wealth to handle the engineering challenges of weather-proofing their built environment. Out of 1.8 billion flood-threatened people worldwide, just 11 percent are in high-income nations.

Unlike famine and infectious disease, tragic urban floods are rarely the result of absolute poverty. Instead, they are most often the outcome of development that is failing to keep pace with the problems it brings in its wake — cities whose allure is drawing people in so fast that infrastructure is incapable of moving at the same speed.

The most damaging flooding over the past week in Thailand was in Hat Yai, a bustling tourist and shopping destination close to the Malaysian border that is home to a special economic zone and one of the nation's busiest airports. In Sri Lanka, the fast-growing capital, Colombo, was the worst-hit.

That puts a grave responsibility on municipal and national governments. All are counting on cities as the engines of growth over coming decades, but they need to work hard in the face of natural disasters that would perpetually threaten to tear apart the urban fabric. The great centers of India, straining under water shortages and choking urban pollution, show what can happen to a nation when urbanization starts to fail.

Bringing fresh water and global connections with them, rivers and coastlines have long been the lifeblood of the world's great cities. As rising seas and devastating floods now make those same places increasingly unlivable, we must confront the possibility that these life-giving attributes could be their doom as well.

Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) on Tuesday announced that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications would offer weekday accommodation discounts, birthday specials and other domestic travel incentives beginning next March, aiming to encourage more travel outside the usual weekend and holiday peaks.
The government is right to focus on domestic tourism. Although the data appear encouraging on the surface — as total domestic trips are up compared with their pre-COVID-19 pandemic numbers — a closer look tells a different                                    



                                                                                For more than seven decades, the Chinese Communist Party has claimed to govern Tibet with benevolence and progress. I have seen the truth behind the slogans. I have listened to the silences of monks forbidden to speak of the Dalai Lama, watched the erosion of our language in classrooms, and felt the quiet grief of a people whose prayers are monitored and whose culture is treated as a threat. That is why I will only accept complete independence for Tibet.
The so-called “autonomous region” is autonomous in name only. Decisions about religion, education and cultural preservation are made in Beijing, not                                    



                                                                                Apart from the first arms sales approval for Taiwan since US President Donald Trump took office, last month also witnessed another milestone for Taiwan-US relations. Trump signed the Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act into law on Tuesday. Its passing without objection in the US Senate underscores how bipartisan US support for Taiwan has evolved.
The new law would further help normalize exchanges between Taiwanese and US government officials. We have already seen a flurry of visits to Washington earlier this summer, not only with Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍), but also delegations led by National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu                                    



                                                                                I recently watched a panel discussion on Taiwan Talks in which the host rightly asked a critical question: Why is the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) spearheading a robust global movement to reject China's ongoing distortion of UN Resolution 2758?
While the discussion offered some context, a more penetrating analysis and urgent development was missed. The IPAC action is not merely a political gesture; it is an essential legal and diplomatic countermeasure to China's escalating and fundamentally baseless campaign to manufacture a claim over Taiwan through the deliberate misinterpretation of a 1971 UN resolution.

High-end fashion brands taking part in Paris Fashion Week, which was held from Sept. 29 to Oct. 7, vied for excellence in their attempts at sustainability. Fashion is a key industry in France, and the country has introduced laws and regulations on the issue and is working on public-private partnerships to achieve environmental measures.

Ninety percent of new pieces presented by U.S. fashion brand Gabriela Hearst at Paris Fashion Week for Spring/Summer 2026 were made with leftover fabric recycled from previous seasons.

British label Stella McCartney presented a collection featuring groundbreaking materials, such as dresses made with plant-based artificial feathers and denim that absorbs and neutralizes pollutants contained in exhaust gases.

Equipment and furnishings used at the runway shows during fashion week are actively recycled to reduce environmental impact. For example, Chanel will donate 4,500 tote bags made from fabric used for decorations at the brand's runway show in Paris to a charity organization.

What is behind these efforts is criticism of the fashion industry for taking mass consumption and disposal of clothing for granted. In 2019, U.N. Trade and Development described the fashion industry as the second most polluting industry in the world.

According to the U.N. Environment Programme, the fashion industry produces 92 million tons of textile waste every year. On the other hand, just 8% of all apparel used recycled material in 2023.

In the meantime, the transition to a sustainable economy has become a high-priority as a political issue in the European Union. To deal with the problem, the Fashion Pact, a framework for multinational companies to reduce the environmental burden of fashion, was launched in 2019, led by French President Emmanuel Macron and presided over by Kering, a major French group of luxury brands. Currently, 56 companies participate in the Fashion Pact. Among them are high-end fashion brands taking part in Paris Fashion Week, such as Chanel and Chloe, as well as other big-name brands, such as H&M Group and Asics.

“In the context of serious global warming, fashion is inseparable from efforts to achieve environmental friendliness in Europe. In France, the public share a high level of crisis awareness, so the country is making progress in establishing the relevant laws and regulations,” said Mitsuru Omori, a senior manager at The Japan Research Institute, appraising the situation positively.

In France, the anti-waste law for a circular economy came into effect in 2020. The law prohibits luxury fashion brands and others from disposing of dead stock products. In 2021, the Climate Resilience Law was promulgated. Based on the law, an “eco score” labeling system for clothes, which quantifies the environmental cost of each item by giving it a score, was launched in October 2025.

French fashion brand Agnes b., another regular participant in Paris Fashion Week, started using QR codes on the tags of clothes sold at its Paris stores in October. Customers can find the eco score of each product via the QR code.

The French parliament this year passed a law regulating “ultra-fast fashion” — mass-produced, extremely cheap garments from China and other countries — which do not meet environmental standards. The law is aimed at reducing the environmental impact of such clothing and protecting domestic industries.

The problem is how to steadily implement relevant laws and regulations and how to spread sustainability in fashion.

Clothes made from recycled fabric or other eco-friendly material require more time and effort to produce and tend to prove costly. Even environmentally concerned consumers may feel reluctant to pay a fortune for them, which hampers the spread of eco-friendly fashion.

“One effective measure is to reduce the prices of products by introducing a tax break system and subsidies for environmentally conscious companies,” said Shinichi Shuto, a professor in marketing at Bunka Fashion Graduate University.

Japan is lagging behind the efforts of countries in Europe. To address this, the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry and the Environment Ministry set up a panel for building a resource circulation system for textile products in 2023. Based on a report by the panel, a council of the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry drew up a road map for resource circulation of textile products in June 2024.

According to a survey by the Environment Ministry in the same year, the domestic supply of clothing amounted to about 820,000 tons annually. Meanwhile, about 560,000 tons of clothes were discarded by businesses and homes. Garments recycled as second-hand clothes or for other purposes remained at about 170,000 tons.

Goals in the road map include a 25% reduction in clothing waste from homes compared to the 2020 level by fiscal 2030, and recycling 50,000 tons of discarded clothing into new materials annually.

Since clothing products are often made from blended fabric comprising various materials, textile recycling is slow to progress for technical and financial reasons. Therefore, textile makers and other businesses are working on research and development to boost recycling practices.

Japanese apparel companies venturing into the European market face the risk of being kicked out unless they take appropriate measures that are compatible with local environmental regulations. Uniqlo Co., which is proactively working on the issue, collects and reuses its clothes and has made it a goal to change about 50% of materials it uses to those with lower greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal 2030.

“If there's a standardized public system for clothes, such as the one for plastic bottles, recycling of clothes will have a better chance of taking root in society,” said Yoshiko Ikoma, the chairman of Japan Ethical Initiative, an organization promoting ethical consumption. “It's necessary to promote it in public-private collaboration so that consumers and companies can work on [recycling].”

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Dominican nun Lucia Caram says Pope Francis, who died in April 2025, left her money in his will specifically to purchase ambulances for her humanitarian missions in Ukraine. Caram talked about the donation during an interview on the Barcelona TV program Órbita B (Betevé).

Caram, who has traveled to Ukraine more than 20 times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, said the gesture deeply moved her. ""He did tell me, in our meetings, that he would help me in some way, but I didn't imagine he would do it like this,"" she said, according to a news report published on Dec. 2.

The nun heads the Santa Clara Convent Foundation in the Spanish town of Manresa and has been involved in delivering medical assistance and evacuation support in front-line regions.

Although Pope Francis consistently condemned the violence of Russia's invasion, his legacy in Ukraine was strained by several controversial remarks about the war. In 2024, he urged Ukraine to show ""courage"" and ""raise the white flag"" to negotiate with Moscow — a comment widely criticized in Kyiv. 

In the same interview, Caram also spoke about her meeting with the newly elected Pope Leo XIV, whom she described as reserved but direct. She recounted spending nearly an hour with him in August to discuss her work in Ukraine—far longer than many senior clergy received, she added. 

Caram said Leo XIV is ""a pope who speaks little, observant, cautious, and prudent,"" yet ""when he does speak, he tells things clearly.""

Pope Leo XIV — formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost — was elected to lead the Catholic Church on May 8, following the death of Pope Francis. President Volodymyr Zelensky attended his inauguration Mass on May 18, later calling the new pontiff ""a symbol of hope for peace."" 

Their meeting focused on the return of Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia and broader humanitarian concerns.

Since assuming the papacy, Pope Leo has repeatedly urged ""a just and lasting peace"" in Ukraine and signaled the Vatican's readiness to host negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky has expressed support for such an initiative, while Russian officials have rejected the proposal.

Head of North America desk

Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. She is based in Edmonton, Alberta. Olena has a master's degree in publishing and editing from the Institute of Journalism in Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Olena was a 2016 Alfred Friendly Press Partners fellow who worked for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for six months. The program is administered by the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia.



The discussion reflected growing concern in European capitals over Washington's posture as the latest peace push moves forward.

Seven more Ukrainian children taken to Russia have been returned to their families, U.S. first lady Melania Trump said.


Successful strikes by Ukraine's military intelligence agency destroyed a Russian MiG-29 fighter jet and an Irtysh radar system in Russian-occupied Crimea, the agency said.

The visit comes as Cyprus is about to take over the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in January, with Nicosia viewing enlargement as a ""key priority,"" a Cypriot government spokesperson said.

The closure came after several days of sustained attacks by drones and artillery, targeting the halls and equipment of the plant, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin.





According to the military, the man refused to present his documents, acted aggressively, and eventually stabbed the officer in the groin, causing a critical bleed. 

Russia, Belarus and Iran have voted against the resolution. Fifty-seven countries, including China, India and Brazil, abstained from voting. 

Russia has centralized volunteer drone units like Rubikon into a professional system that is eroding Ukraine's early edge in UAV warfare and threatening its front lines.



Tran's case is just the latest case of Russian prosecution of a captured foreign fighter as a mercenary, which, in Moscow's interpretation of international law, deprives them of the rights traditionally held by prisoners of war (POWs).

Putin's trip to India tests how far New Delhi will go to protect its ties with Moscow while pressure mounts from Ukraine, Europe and the U.S.

India's balancing act between Russia and Ukraine faces a key test this week as it hosts Russian President Vladimir Putin amid Moscow's war against Kyiv. 

The Thursday-Friday trip is Putin's first to India since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and the Kremlin says he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss their “particularly privileged strategic partnership.” It will test how far Modi will go to preserve India's energy and defense ties with Moscow while under pressure from Kyiv, Washington, and European capitals to help curb Russia's war effort.

For Putin, the trip is a chance to show he is not isolated and to shore up vital oil and arms ties with a major power in the Global South.

Analysts in Kyiv are apprehensive and question whether Modi will live up to his August 2024 pledge to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to help bring an end to Russia's war while meeting Putin. European diplomats also hope that India will take Europe's security interests into account when engaging with the Russian leader.

The decades-old friendship between India and Russia dates back to the early years of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union supported India in its 1971 war with Pakistan. Since then, Indian leaders have often referred to Russia as the subcontinent's most reliable friend.

“Russia is an old relationship, it's a serious relationship, it's a strong relationship,” Indian politician and member of the country's opposition party Shashi Tharoor told journalists in New Delhi on Wednesday, calling the upcoming meeting between Modi and Putin “very important.”

New Delhi is also Moscow's key trade ally, with bilateral trade totaling $68.7 billion between 2024–25. During the two-day meeting, Russia and India are expected to bolster trade ties and sign new defense, energy, and transportation agreements.

According to Shairee Malhotra, deputy director at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in New Delhi, Putin's visit will reaffirm India-Russia ties and shows that Russia is far from isolated, particularly in the Global South, where countries have their own priorities and may not necessarily share Western or European sentiment toward Moscow.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, Modi has held talks with both Putin and Zelensky and has called for a cessation of violence.  Yet on the global stage, India has remained officially neutral and repeatedly abstained from resolutions condemning Russia's actions at the United Nations, a position it also maintained in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.

Despite Western efforts to sanction Russian oil companies, a key source of revenue funding Moscow's war, India has continued to import seaborne Russian crude oil.

But after Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil in August, Indian oil imports from Russia fell by nearly a third, according to analytics company Kpler. 

Oksana Nesterenko, an international policy and legal analyst and associate professor at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said Putin will use the upcoming meeting “to convince Modi to return to previous conditional oil agreements or even increase oil purchases in the future.

“That can provide serious economic sustenance for Russia with its very weak economy these days,” she added.

In August, Modi became the first Indian prime minister to visit Kyiv, where he signed four cooperation agreements, and told Zelensky that he was ready to play a role in bringing peace and added that India respected Ukraine's “sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat, who has worked as deputy chief of mission in the Embassy of India in Moscow and has also served as India's ambassador to EU member Malta, stressed that Modi will reiterate the importance of ending the war with Putin this week.

“During the discussions, global and regional developments will be discussed including Putin's perspective on U.S. President Donald Trump's Peace Plan,” he said.

But Ukraine will watch how that plays out amidst India's energy ties with Russia, according to Nesterenko. 

“If Putin succeeds [in convincing India to continue importing oil], it is a very bad practical sign for Ukraine because it creates a rational source to continue this war against Ukraine,” she said.

Ukrainian leaders have, however, expressed that Kyiv does not seek to pressure India to stop its purchase of Russian oil. 

In an interview with Indian media outlet the Print in August, Ukraine's ambassador to India Oleksandr Polishchuk said this would not “directly influence” current or long-term ties with India.  

After the fall of the Soviet Union, India recognised Ukraine as a sovereign country in 1991, and since then, the two countries have focused on bolstering their economic ties. 

Bilateral trade between the two countries totalled $1.22 billion between 2024–2025.  According to the Embassy of India in Kyiv, the relationship includes trade in agricultural and industrial goods, while pharmaceuticals account for most Indian exports to Ukraine. 

The two countries also have a Joint Working Group on Defense Cooperation and agreed to strengthen their defense cooperation after Modi met Zelensky last August. Trigunayat also noted that New Delhi has also provided significant humanitarian assistance to Ukraine during the war. 

According to Malhotra, there is potential for India and Ukraine to “cooperate in high-end defense, cyber, and agricultural technologies, including co-production of drones and electronic warfare systems.” 

Currently, at the meeting with Putin, New Delhi seeks to purchase additional S-400 air defense units from Moscow, but Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine has delayed deliveries.

“The war has accelerated India's diversification of defense imports. Even while units such as the S-400 and traditional weapons systems will continue to remain important, drone warfare is becoming the new battlefield and Ukraine has emerged as a world leader and innovator in this domain, with lessons and expertise to share with India,” Malhotra said.

She added that in the future, India and Indian companies could also have an opportunity to participate in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction and bolster ties.

Meanwhile, as the European Union and U.K. seek to end the war, European leaders hope India, while adhering to its strategic autonomy, will keep Europe's overall security interests at heart. 

Herve Delphin, EU ambassador to India, pointed to concrete examples of Russian hostility: “We have cyber warfare, which is waged. We have drones flying off, subsea cables cut off, disinformation operations… all of this is documented,” he said on Wednesday, according to Indian daily The Print. “Russia is an aggressor… hostile to Europe's interests. So I think India has to factor that in,” he added.

Malhotra said that Putin's visit to India is bound to ruffle feathers in Europe but may not substantially change the upward trajectory of India's relations with the EU and its member states, which have strengthened in recent years against the backdrop of India's balancing act and the Russia-Ukraine war. 

“In today's volatile geopolitical and geoeconomic landscape, both the EU and India view each other as a priority, and therefore, the Free Trade Agreement is being negotiated with urgency, even while the EU's 19th package of sanctions against Russia included some Indian entities,” she said.

She warned, however, that questions of strategic trust could still limit a deeper EU-India security partnership.

Dan Driscoll, the U.S. army secretary known as an ardent advocate of military modernization, was thrust into an unexpected role as Washington's leading negotiator in Ukraine.

His trip to Kyiv last month, which was expected to focus on technology cooperation, instead saw him present Ukraine with a U.S.-Russia-drafted peace plan that imposed punishing conditions on Kyiv.

Despite having no prior diplomatic experience, the 39-year-old Pentagon official remains a key figure in the ongoing talks as Ukraine pushes for a better deal.

In Ukraine, Driscoll is still mostly an unfamiliar figure, known mainly for his close ties to U.S. Vice President JD Vance — the leading figure of the administration's camp skeptical of continued support for Kyiv.

Arta Moeini, the managing director of U.S. Operations at the Institute for Peace & Diplomacy, nevertheless argues that Driscoll is not antagonistic toward Ukraine.

""He's not ideological… he's a pragmatist,"" Moeini adds, describing the ex-army officer as somebody Trump simply trusts to get the job in Ukraine done.

Driscoll's recent weeks were marked by frantic diplomacy, with a flurry of meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian ministers, and other officials in Kyiv in late November.

The army secretary then joined consultations with Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva on Nov. 23 to revise the controversial peace plan, before holding talks with Russian representatives in Abu Dhabi.

Though timing remains unclear, Ukraine said it is expecting to host Driscoll again soon, as Trump announced that the army secretary will continue to lead the negotiations with the Ukrainian side.

But despite the smiles and handshakes in front of cameras during his last trip to Kyiv, multiple media reports suggest that the talks were anything but warm.

In a briefing with Western diplomats, Driscoll reportedly delivered a grim overview of the state of war, warning that Russia is building up a powerful missile arsenal.

According to NBC News, the U.S. official also told his Ukrainian counterparts that they face an imminent defeat at the hands of Russia and would be better off accepting the unfavorable peace deal.


“He is known as a pragmatist, he's a veteran, and he is a doer. And that's why the White House really likes him.”
    

Although U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied the story, it has nevertheless sparked backlash from Ukrainian observers, who doubt whether Driscoll accurately assessed the situation.

Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of the Foreign Relations and International Security Programs at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, asks whether Driscoll's military background as a first lieutenant allows him to ""make assessments on the strategic level.""

""If you don't have a proper objective picture of the subject that you're dealing with, the possibility of finding a proper solution is rather low,"" the expert added, noting that while Ukraine faces a difficult situation at the front, it is not critical.

At the same time, Melnyk notes, Driscoll's messaging may simply indicate that he is trying to please Trump, who was aggressively pushing Ukraine to accept the deal.

Driscoll's spokesperson has not responded to the Kyiv Independent's request for comment.

Born into a military family in North Carolina, Driscoll spent over three years in the Army –  which included a deployment in Iraq – before working as a businessman and a lawyer.

A Yale graduate, he maintains a close relationship with his former classmate, Vance, which some say became a key factor in his political rise.

In January, Driscoll was made the youngest U.S. army secretary, a civilian Pentagon role responsible for administrative matters of the armed branch. His popularity quickly grew within the administration.

""He is known as a pragmatist, he's a veteran, and he is a doer. And that's why the White House really likes him,"" Moeini said.

Much of his Pentagon tenure is defined by his push to modernize the U.S. military — a goal he frequently frames through lessons drawn from the Russia-Ukraine war. This focus earned him the nickname ""drone guy"" from Trump.

During a Senate hearing in June, Driscoll referred to Ukraine as the ""Silicon Valley of warfare,"" saying the country stands at the front of the new military revolution.

The official also named drones the ""future of warfare"" and spoke admirably about Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb, highlighting that ""a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones… took out almost $10 billion worth of equipment in Russia.""

But Driscoll's ascent is not driven solely by his push for military modernization — it is also fueled by personal connections to top White House players. As Moeini notes, the army secretary now has ""a direct line to both the vice president and Trump.""

In an unexpected twist, the youngest army secretary has been tasked with helping broker an end to a war the Trump administration has struggled to resolve for the past 10 months.

""The rise of Driscoll has been meteoric,"" says Volodymyr Dubovyk, head of Odesa National University's Center for International Studies, adding that it is unusual for an army secretary ""to be so heavily and suddenly involved"" in the peace process.

Driscoll's lack of experience in diplomacy and proximity to Vance has given Ukrainian observers some pause.

""Driscoll seems to be JD Vance's man,"" Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. ""I don't expect much from him because he doesn't seem to have a diplomatic background.""

Vance is viewed in Ukraine as part of the U.S. administration's more hardline, Ukraine-skeptical wing, and he was a key backer of the controversial peace plan Driscoll delivered.

With Keith Kellogg – Trump's special envoy in Kyiv who was advocating for continued U.S. support – stepping down soon, Melnyk and Merezhko suggested that Driscoll might become his successor.

But the army secretary's new role might also be part of a bigger play in Washington.

Pointing to Driscoll's closeness to Vance, Dubovyk argues that the secretary's appointment should be seen through the prism of a ""power struggle within the administration"" and ""in the context of people positioning themselves for the 2028 elections.""

Driscoll's new role in the spotlight fueled speculation about his rise to the top positions, including to the seat of controversy-mired Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Moeini disputed the rumors, saying that the two Pentagon officials ""are very much aligned."" However, Dubovyk believes that Hegseth must feel ""quite uneasy” about his subordinate's sudden and speedy rise.

With notable exceptions – such as the error-strewn farce ahead of the 1982 tournament – the World Cup draw usually goes off without a hitch. 

Lottery balls are plucked from buckets, the identities of the teams are revealed, the groups are methodically filled, and fans across the planet can start plotting their teams' path to glory.

While there is nothing to suggest that on the surface, Friday's event will be anything but a success, others whisper quietly that it could be improved.

Improvements aren't sought in the amount of pomp around the star-studded event but in the process that is used to fill each of the round-robin groups.

After dividing the teams into tiered pots – generally seeded according to the world rankings – FIFA employs a sequential method to fill the groups in order, so that each will contain one team from Pot 1, one from Pot 2, and so on. There are various constraints added on top of that, such as restricting the amount of teams from each of the six confederations to one per group – with the exception of UEFA, which is allowed at least one and no more than two per group, owing to the 16 European teams in the draw.

Everything you need to know about the World Cup draw

However, these constraints, alongside the sequential method – which moves the conflicted team to the next available group – introduce the possibility for inherent bias in the proceedings. 

That's the opinion of Jeffrey Rosenthal, a professor of statistics at the University of Toronto. Rosenthal collaborated with Gareth Roberts, a colleague at Britain's University of Warwick, three years ago to produce a paper looking at World Cup draws, specifically examining the probabilities surrounding the draw for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

What they found was that FIFA's sequential method slightly tweaked the purely random possibilities of certain teams ending up with certain other teams. For example, with the host Qatar – which was seeded in Pot 1 despite being the world's 50th-ranked team at the time – getting drawn in that group became a far more desirable outcome than alongside teams such as Spain or Argentina.

But while Canada should have had a 15.4-per-cent chance of ending up with the Qataris in a truly random draw, with FIFA's process, it was 16.5 per cent. Similarly for the United States, what should have been a 9.06-per-cent chance rose to 12.5 per cent under the sequential system.

“It can change it by some number of per cent,” Rosenthal said. “That was a relative increase of 38 per cent, that is to say it was 38 per cent more likely that the United States would be in the group with Qatar based on their sequential draw than it would have been with a truly random draw.”

In the end, the extra percentage points made no difference, as Canada and the U.S. were drawn with Belgium and England respectively from Pot 1.

While neither Rosenthal nor Roberts were able to find the time to study this year's draw in depth, Rosenthal thinks that much of the same level of bias will still be present. And that's even with the addition of another 16 teams, with 48 teams being divided into 12 groups in what is the biggest men's World Cup in history. Also, FIFA has introduced pathways to ensure that the top four seeds won't meet until the semi-finals, provided they win their groups.

“I think probably the amount of sort of non-uniform bias just rose,” he said, noting that there are more teams, more groups, rules and constraints this time around. 

“Basically, if there weren't any constraints, it's just any team can be in any group, and there's no rules, then the sequential method would be just fine. There'd be no bias, there'd be no problem.”

In their 2022 study, Rosenthal and Roberts came up with three alternative methods that would have removed the possibility of additional bias. While at least one of them wouldn't have worked for FIFA's draw – it was basically a computer program, with no need for a red-carpet event – one would have maintained the use of lottery balls and could have done the job. Rosenthal said that Roberts reached out to a contact who worked for FIFA, but to no avail.

“They had some back and forth e-mails or something,” he said. “But it didn't go too far.”

Three years ago, Rosenthal accurately predicted Canada would not make it out of its World Cup group. 

However, he did give Canada a 97.3-per-cent chance to score a goal – a feat it had been unable to achieve during its three previous men's World Cup games, in 1986. He was proved right in the second game as Alphonso Davies found the back of the net. 

As a seeded team this time around, there is an above-average chance that Canada gets a much more palatable group, whatever the percentage level of bias in the proceedings.

“I think there's certainly a very good chance they'll have their best World Cup showing ever,” Rosenthal said.

“And I'd say there's quite a decent chance they'll make it out of the group stage and into the elimination rounds, and I'll be rooting for them all the way. I haven't looked so I don't have a specific probability prediction, but I think they'll probably do well.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in New Delhi on Thursday to start a two-day state visit, and India and Russia both said they want to boost mutual trade and expand the variety of items in transactions.

Putin's first visit to India in four years aims to increase sales of Russian oil, missile systems and fighter jets and broaden business links between the countries beyond energy and defence equipment, amid U.S. pressure on India to move away from Moscow, which is waging war in Ukraine.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi received Putin at the airport in Delhi, a rare gesture underlining the warm ties between the two countries and the leaders.

They embraced on the red carpet after Putin walked down from the aircraft and then drove away in the same vehicle.

Modi is hosting Putin for a private dinner on Thursday and the two will hold summit talks on Friday. Senior Russian ministers and a large Russian business delegation are in New Delhi for Putin's visit.

India and Russia aim to raise two-way trade to US$100-billion by 2030. Their commerce rose more than five-fold from about US$13-billion in 2021 to near US$69-billion in 2024–25, almost entirely driven by Indian energy imports.

Bilateral trade eased to US$28.25-billion in April–August, 2025, reflecting a decline in crude oil imports following punitive tariffs on Indian goods and sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.

At the same time, India is looking for new destinations to increase exports of its goods hit by a punishing 50 per cent tariff imposed by Trump, half of that over India buying Russian oil, which Washington says helps finance Moscow's war in Ukraine.

India agrees to stop buying Russian oil, Trump says

Russia wants to import more Indian goods to balance bilateral trade, which is currently heavily skewed toward energy, Deputy Kremlin Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin told a business conference in New Delhi.

“The Russian delegation and business representatives have arrived with a very specific goal ... We have come for Indian goods and services. We want to significantly increase their purchases,” Oreshkin said.

“This is not a momentary story, but a strategic choice in developing relations” between the two countries, he said, adding that India's share in Russian imports does not exceed 2 per cent.

Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said New Delhi wants to diversify exports to Russia and increase sales of automobiles, electronics goods, data-processing equipment, heavy machinery, industrial components, textiles, and foodstuffs.

“Russia has a huge demand for a wide range of industrial goods, consumer products, presenting multiple untapped opportunities for Indian businesses,” Goyal told the conference.

“We need to bring more diversity in our trade basket. We need to make it more balanced between Russia and India. We need to add more variety,” he said.

Russian Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut said Russia was prepared to increase imports of shrimp, rice, and tropical fruits from India. She mentioned that Russian firms were also interested in Indian food-processing equipment.

India is the world's largest exporter of shrimp, and Lut noted that it was possible to increase India's share in Russian imports of shrimp, currently at 20 per cent.

India was the biggest supplier of shrimp to the U.S. but Trump's tariffs have badly hit exports, causing a decline in shipments and forcing companies to seek alternative markets.

Sam Mraiche's company, MHCare, had been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of procurement contracts from Alberta Health Services.PAUL SWANSON/The Globe and Mail

It's not unusual for business owners to forge ties with governments, but there are rules around conflicts of interest when it comes to procurement. In February, 2025, an Alberta senior public servant stepped forward with allegations of political interference in the awarding of large health contracts. These allegations prompted investigators, auditors and opposition politicians to look closely at the ties between Premier Danielle Smith's government and an Alberta businessman, Sam Mraiche. 

Mraiche's company, MHCare, had been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of procurement contracts from Alberta Health Services. A Globe and Mail investigation found that the connections between Mr. Mraiche, purchasing officials, and senior Alberta political figures have existed longer – and are more extensive – than previously reported. 

Today, Carrie Tait, a reporter with The Globe's Calgary bureau, and Tom Cardoso, an investigative reporter with The Globe, are on the show to talk about their investigation into the ties between a serial entrepreneur and the Alberta government.

The draw for the 2026 World Cup is on December 5, and Donald Trump will attend and pick up FIFA's new peace prize. Is FIFA President Gianni Infantino really a ""close friend"" of Trump, or just trying to stay onside?

The eyes of the political world have been firmly fixed on Washington for the whole of 2025 and, on Friday, the eyes of the football world will join them for the 2026 World Cup draw.

Gianni Infantino, the president of world football's governing body, FIFA, will be the ringmaster. But even the most powerful man in the world's biggest sport will likely be in the shadow of US President Donald Trump despite the very public friendship the two men have formed.

""I'm really lucky. I have a great relationship with President Trump, who I consider really a close friend,"" Infantino said recently of a friendship that has also included a recent photo op with Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portugal star was subsequently given a part-suspended ban for a highly unusual red card in World Cup qualifying that would normally have seen him miss Portugal's first two tournament matches.

""Of course, he's been very, very helpful in everything we do for the World Cup,"" Infantino continued on Trump. ""He has such an incredible energy and this is something that I really admire. He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He says, actually, what many people think as well, but maybe don't dare to say.""

Given that the US will host most matches in the 2026 tournament, with a handful in neighboring Canada and Mexico, a closer working relationship between the two men is normal, according to Sylvia Schenk.

""It's all about the situation,"" the German former Olympic runner who has worked in sports as a volunteer for Transparency International, told DW. She was also a member of FIFA's independent Human Rights Advisory Board and is an arbitrator at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) .

""If the World Cup weren't happening in the US, Trump wouldn't be bothered about Infantino. So that's the starting point. And the same other way around. Infantino needs a good tournament next year and for that he needs a working relationship with Trump.""

Schenk said that finding a balanced and stable dynamic with Trump has been beyond most world leaders, and Infantino must tread a delicate line. But she also believes the pair have similar character traits.

""They are both vain and both want to be flattered and both have a very, very, very big ego,"" said Schenk, who spent time with Infantino during her work with FIFA. She added that she has seen less interest in human rights issues from Infantino the longer he has been in power.

FIFA, under Infantino, have emphasized political neutrality, purporting to ensure an absence of political interference and a certain standard of human rights in its associations as well as banning overtly political gestures from players or coaches.

And though Infantino is required to have a relationship with Trump, his presence at the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks with the US president was the latest in a series of appearances on the political stage that have raised eyebrows.

As has Infantino's decision to introduce a FIFA Peace Prize, to be awarded on Friday at the draw a mile from the White House. Though the recipient is not confirmed, it's not a huge leap to imagine it will go to Trump, who lost out on the much-coveted, and much longer-established Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition activist Maria Corina Machado just a few weeks before FIFA launched their version.

""The question is whether Infantino is doing too much and I think a Peace Prize would be far too much,"" said Schenk.

Trump has made a series of policy decisions, and statements that will have a bearing on the tournament. Last week, the Iranian FA (FFIRI) said they would not be sending anyone to the draw after a lack of visa guarantees for their delegates. On Wednesday, the English-language Tehran Times reported that Iran had reversed its stand and would send a small delegation to the draw. 

Iran is one of several countries on Trump's travel ban list, along with fellow qualifiers Haiti. Exceptions are made for athletes and some, but apparently not all, support staff. No fans from those nations on the list will be able to travel to the US.

""The last time the FIFA president was present in the national team's dressing room was the 2025 AFC (Asian Football Confederation) final against Uzbekistan, when he announced to the Iranian players that the Iranian convoy's presence would be guaranteed from the beginning of the draw ceremony until the last day of the national team's participation in the World Cup, including workshops,"" the federation's spokesperson Amir Mehdi Alavi told Iranian outlet Tarafdari.

Such disputes threaten Infantino's high-wire act with Trump, as does the president's threat earlier in November, when he again floated moving matches away from Democrat-controlled cities. ""If we think there's going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask [Infantino] to move that to a different city,"" Trump said.

Schenk said this kind of political situation may force Infantino to stand up to Trump, though there are no guarantees in that regard.

""I think in the end he probably has to. But if Trump one day says — in four weeks, in February or whenever — 'We will move games from Los Angeles to whatever other city' it will be very, very difficult for FIFA to say: ‘We don't accept the risk analysis of the government of the US, we think it's safe and we will stay there.' This is risky too.""

Whether Trump and Infantino's friendship is genuine, or a PR match of convenience, will likely be tested even more severely in the six months preceding the opener, in Mexico City on June 11. The International Olympic Committee will surely face similar tests when the Olympics arrive in LA in 2028.

The German president is visiting London amid increasing security ties between the UK and Germany. Meanwhile, the Left Party has paved the way for a fraught pension bill to overcome an inner-CDU rebellion. DW has more. 

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is in the UK for a 3-day state visit.

He was received by King Charles and met Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He will speak in the UK Parliament on Thursday.

Steinmeier is the first German president to get a state visit in the UK in 27 years.

This blog is now closed. Below is a roundup of news, analysis and background from Germany on Wednesday, December 3:

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Downing Street, praising close cooperation between the two countries. 

Starmer said Britain and Germany are working together on Ukraine, migration, trade and economic growth, saying the partnership from was going from ""from strength to strength.""

Steinmeier noted relations are in far better shape than during the difficult post-Brexit years.

""We have to engage in improving the situation and coming closer in this changing world with new threats to all of us,"" he told Starmer.

The two leaders joined a roundtable with UK and German business leaders. 

Steinmeier's three-day state visit includes a banquet and a speech to Parliament, underscoring a renewed security alliance that has helped rebuild London-Berlin relations.

Following criticism from India's Ministry of External Affairs of an opinion piece co-authored by Germany's ambassador that criticized the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, the German Foreign Ministry has rejected its accusation that the article represented ""unacceptable diplomatic practice.""

In response to a question from DW, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Martin Giese said the assessment of Russia's behavior contained in the article was ""completely shared by almost all countries across the world.""

""This kind of information in a daily newspaper is precisely the task that our ambassadors have to carry out worldwide. It is not interference but a representation of the German position,"" he said.

""We stand up for this here in Germany; we stand up for this across the world,"" he said, adding: ""And here, we completely have our ambassadors' backs.""

The op-ed, co-written by German Ambassador Philipp Ackermann together with his counterparts from France and Britain and published in the Times of India, was entitled ""World wants the Ukraine war to end, but Russia doesn't seem serious about peace.""

It was published just days before Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to arrive in India on a state visit on Thursday.

Germany is set to host the women's Euros in 2029. In a bid process that saw Italy and then Portugal drop out, Germany was victorious over bids from Poland, aiming to become the first Eastern European nation to host a women's tournament, and a joint bid from Denmark and Sweden. 

Germany hosted the men's Euros in 2024, but this is Germany's women's first tournament since the 2011 World Cup. The last women's Euros was even longer ago, back in 2001, which was a tournament that Germany also won.

Beata Zschäpe, the convicted neo-Nazi and member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) terror group, showed remorse for her crimes in court on Wednesday.

""I am ashamed,"" the 50-year-old told the Dresden court.

She was speaking during the trial of her alleged confidante, Susann E., who is being prosecuted for allegedly supporting the NSU, providing Zschäpe with her insurance card and personal details.

Zschäpe was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to life. She said she had only become aware of the impact of her crimes, which included several murders, during her trial and that she had now come to terms with her sentence.

She was part of the NSU along with Uwe Böhnhardt and Uwe Mundlos. They carried out 10 murders across Germany between 2000 and 2011. The victims were mostly Turkish and Greek businessowners as well as one police woman.

Zschäpe's accomplices killed themselves after the network was uncovered.

The Left Party has said it will abstain on Friday's vote on the pension reform package, practically ensuring that the vote will now pass.

By abstaining, they lower the needed majority from 316 votes to just 252.

The coalition government currently has 328 seats, but 18 members of the youth wing of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's own party had threatened to vote against the bill. Its failure would have put a strain on the already fractured coalition.

The bill aims to keep pensions at 48% of the average income. The young conservatives had feared this would prove too high a cost borne by younger generations in the long term.

The Left Party members justified their abstention, saying they were afraid a failed pension bill would see the rate fall below 48%. 

""We won't accept the pension rate being further squeezed and have therefore decided as a party to abstain from the planned vote on the government's pension package on Friday,"" said Heidi Reichinnek, the leader of the Left Party in the Bundestag.

Germany is finally looking to ratify the 2023 UN-agreed High Seas Treaty.

The treaty had already been signed by 160 countries, including Germany, but needs a formal law to be fully ratified. A draft bill was approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday and will now go to the Bundestag for a vote.

The treaty allows for the creation of marine protected zones on the high seas and calls for environmental assessments of human activities, such as fishing.

""The oceans are vital for our survival. They produce oxygen, provide us with food and are the largest ecosystem on the planet,"" Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said.

He added that they are under extreme pressure due to plastic pollution, overfishing, climate change and chemicals.

The high seas are not part of any national sovereignty and until the 2023 treaty had no environmental rules governing them.

The victims of sexual abuse in schools have often been left alone, without any help, a study from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in Germany has found.

The study found many cases where teachers and other school staff knew about the abuse but failed to intervene.

They often ignored assaults or even covered them up to protect the school's reputation.

The study included 133 reports from between 1949 and 2010.

It found that girls made up 80% of the victims, with the vast majority of perpetrators being men.

The assaults and abuse were reported to mostly have taken place inside the school building, in sport halls, changing rooms and classrooms.

In most cases, they were not one-off cases with many reports of perceived ""romantic"" relationships between teachers and students.

""The affected were often only able to recognize the manipulation and name the abuse retrospectively,"" the study said.

More and more German companies are unhappy with the country's famously strict data protection laws that they think are inhibiting digitalization and AI development, according to a survey published on Wednesday by Bitkom.

Some 603 companies from a range of sectors were surveyed.

Here are the main results of the survey:

""Artificial intelligence is the deciding future technology and AI needs data,"" Bitkom expert Susanne Dehmel said.

""The data protection regulations should be reviewed with a view to Germany's position in the future AI world,"" she added.

According to a KPMG study from May, around two-thirds of Germans use AI, but only around one-third trust it.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul joined his NATO counterparts in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss further support for Ukraine.

Wadephul said Berlin will provide an additional $200 million (€171.6 million) worth of military equipment for Ukraine through NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) mechanism.

Ahead of the meeting, the German foreign minister said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has not yet shown any real willingness to negotiate.""

""Putin wants to continue undermining European and Euro-Atlantic security. He wants to test our defense readiness. He wants to divide us in order to weaken our alliance,"" he said.

""But he will not succeed,"" Wadephul added.

Following Tuesday's test vote on the contentious pension reform package, its opponents have been told to come forward by midday on Wednesday for talks with senior members of the conservative bloc.

Although the vote showed a majority would support the bill on Friday when it will be voted on in the Bundestag, there were still many who voted ""no.""

Those against the reform are from the youth wing of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's CDU/CSU bloc. They have said it will be too costly, with the burden falling on younger generations.

Amid fears of what might happen to the strained coalition government if the vote fails on Friday, those who did vote ""no"" have been told to come forward so that they can have one-on-one chats with senior lawmakers.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's state visit to the United Kingdom comes as the two countries have been enjoying closer relations, especially on issues of security, following years of post-Brexit fracture.

Steinmeier will meet with King Charles at Windsor Castle — reciprocating the meeting the two had in Berlin's Bellevue Palace in 2023 when Charles made his first state visit as monarch to Germany.

The president will also be given the rare opportunity to speak to British lawmakers in Parliament as well as hold talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The visit talks are expected to focus on support for Ukraine and security for Europe.

On Friday, Steinmeier is set to visit Coventry, a city devastated by German air raids during the Second World War.

Steinmeier was serving as foreign minister during the Brexit vote and spoke of ""irresponsible politicians"" who ""lured"" people into leaving the EU at the time. But German-British relations have improved in the last few years, especially under former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now Starmer.

Iran is to be represented at Friday's draw for the 2026 World Cup. The country's FA had previously said it would boycott the draw after several members of its planned delegation were denied visas for the United States.

Iran is now expected to have a delegation at Friday's World Cup draw in Washington D.C. after all. Iranian Sports Minister Ahmad Donjamali told state news agency Irna on Thursday that head coach Amir Ghalenoei would attend.

This comes almost a week after the Iranian FA (FFIRI) announced that it would boycott the draw in protest after learning that several members of its planned delegation had been denied entry visas for the United States. 

According to the English-language website Tehran Times, FFIRI President Mehdi Taj was among those who have been refused entry. In his statement Donjamali said that visas had now been issued, but it wasn't clear whether the FFIRI president would be part of the delegation. 

Iran and the US have been at loggerheads for decades, having broken off diplomatic relations in 1980. US President Donald Trump has imposed a general entry ban on Iranian citizens, with limited exceptions.

As things stand, Iranian football fans would not be allowed to travel to the United States to support their team during the World Cup. This also applies to fans from Haiti, which has also qualified for the World Cup.

However, the travel ban does not affect these countries' national team players and coaches. The Trump executive order makes exceptions for, among others, ""any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state.""

Next summer's World Cup will mark Iran's fourth consecutive participation in the tournament and its seventh overall. The country has never advanced to the knockout stage, but it has faced the United States twice. Iran beat the US 2-1 in the group stage of the 1998 tournament in France. The United States got its revenge in 2022, beating Iran 1-0 in Qatar.

The 2026 World Cup, which is to be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, is to kick off on June 11, with the final to be played at New York New Jersey Stadium on July 19.

Thomas Markle is in intensive care after undergoing emergency surgery, his son has said.

The Duchess of Sussex's father was rushed to hospital on Tuesday after he was taken gravely ill at his home in the Philippines.

He was in an intensive care unit on Wednesday night after undergoing three hours of surgery earlier in the day.

Mr Markle will need to undergo a second operation to remove a blood clot.

“I took dad to a hospital close to our home and they did various scans and the doctors said his life was in imminent danger,” his son Thomas Jnr told the Daily Mail.

“They raced us by ambulance, with the sirens going, to a much bigger hospital in the centre of the city. My dad has undergone emergency surgery. I would ask everyone around the world to keep him in their thoughts.”

Mr Markle, who has been estranged from his daughter since her wedding to the Duke of Sussex in 2018, has been in poor health for several years.

He said his daughter was furious with him when he posed for paparazzi pictures on the eve of her wedding and previously said his “only wish is to see my grandchildren before I die”.

He suffered two heart attacks just before Meghan's wedding at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, which prevented him from flying from Los Angeles to London to be by his daughter's side. The King ended up walking Meghan down the aisle.

Mr Markle later suffered a stroke in 2022 which left him unable to speak for months.

His son said he hoped Meghan, who released the Christmas special of her Netflix show earlier on Wednesday, shows her father “some compassion”.

“He is literally fighting for his life,” Thomas Jnr added.

Mr Markle's daughter Samantha, 61, said she believed the strain of the past few years had taken its toll on her father and made him more fragile.

“He is a strong man, but he has been through so much. I am praying that he is strong enough to survive this,” she said. “My father has been through two heart attacks, a stroke and an earthquake. I hope he can pull through this.”

The Telegraph has approached The Duchess of Sussex's representatives for comment.

An Amnesty official noted that the abusive conditions the organization observed at the facilities “are not isolated.”

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Two immigration detention centers in Florida have gained notoriety for inhumane conditions since Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, in close alignment with President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant agenda, has rapidly scaled up mass detention in the state, and a report released Thursday detailed how human rights violations at the two facilities amount to torture in some cases.

Amnesty International published the report, Torture and Enforced Disappearances in the Sunshine State, with a focus on Krome North Service Processing Center and the Everglades Detention Facility, also known by its nickname, “Alligator Alcatraz.”

As Common Dreams has reported, many of the people detained at the facilities have been arbitrarily rounded up by immigration agents, with a majority of the roughly 1,000 people being held at Alligator Alcatraz having been convicted of no criminal offense as of July.

Amnesty's report described unsanitary conditions, with fecal matter overflowing from toilets in detainees' sleeping areas, authorities granting only limited access to showers, and poor quality food and water.

Some of the treatment amounts to torture, the report says, including Alligator Alcatraz's use of “the box” — a 2×2 foot “cage-like structure people are put in as punishment” — which inmates have been placed in for hours at a time with their hands and feet attached to restraints on the ground.

New report out today: Florida's “Alligator Alcatraz” isn't just a detention center — it's a human rights disaster. Torture, disappearances, no oversight. All happening right now in the United States. Read more: https://t.co/YBOVySUiAa

“These despicable and nauseating conditions at Alligator Alcatraz reflect a pattern of deliberate neglect designed to dehumanize and punish those detained there,” said Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights with Amnesty International USA. “This is unreal — where's the oversight?”

At Krome, detainees have been arbitrarily placed in prolonged solitary confinement — defined as lasting longer than 15 days — which is prohibited under international law.

“The use of prolonged solitary confinement at Krome and the use of the ‘box' at ‘Alligator Alcatraz' amount to torture or other ill-treatment,” said Amnesty.

The report elevates concerns raised in September by immigrant rights advocates regarding the lack of federal oversight at Alligator Alcatraz, with nearly 1,000 men detained at the prison having been “administratively disappeared” — their names absent from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's detainee locator system.

“The absence of registration or tracking mechanisms for those detained at Alligator Alcatraz facilitates incommunicado detention and constitutes enforced disappearances when the whereabouts of a person being detained there is denied to their family, and they are not allowed to contact their lawyer,” said Amnesty.

The state of Florida has not publicly confirmed the number of people detained at Alligator Alcatraz.

One man told Amnesty, “My lawyers tried to visit me, but they weren't let in. They were told that they had to fill out a form, which they did, but nothing happened. I was never able to speak with them confidentially.”

At Krome, detainees described overcrowding, medical neglect, and abuse by guards when Amnesty researchers visited in September. ICE has constructed tents and other semi-permanent structures to hold more people than the facility is designed to detain.

The Amnesty researchers were given a tour of relatively extensive medical facilities at Krome, including a dialysis clinic, dental clinic, and a “state-of-the-art” mental health facility — but despite these resources, detainees described officials' failure to provide medical treatment and delays in health assessments. Four people — Ramesh Amechand, Genry Ruiz Guillen, Maksym Chernyak, and Isidro Pérez — have died this year while detained at Krome.

“It's a disaster if you want to see the doctor,” one man told Amnesty. “I once asked to see the doctor, and it took two weeks for me to finally see him. It's very slow.”

Researchers with the organization witnessed “a guard violently slam a metal flap of a door to a solitary confinement room against a man's injured hand,” and people reported being “hit and punched” by officials at Krome.

In line with the Trump administration, DeSantis and Republican state lawmakers have sought to make Florida “a testing ground for abusive immigration enforcement policies,” said Amnesty, with the state deputizing local law enforcement to make immigration arrests and issuing 34 no-bid contracts totaling more than $360 million for the operation of Alligator Alcatraz — while slashing spending on healthcare, food assistance, and disaster relief. Florida has increased the number of people in immigration detention by more than 50% since Trump took office in January.

The organization called on Florida to redirect detention funding toward healthcare, housing, and other public spending, and to ban “shackling, solitary confinement, and punitive outdoor confinement” in line with international standards.

“At the federal level, the US government must end its cruel mass immigration detention machine, stop the criminalization of migration, and bar the use of state-owned facilities for federal immigration custody,” said Amnesty.

Fischer emphasized that the chaotic and abusive conditions Amnesty observed at Alligator Alcatraz and Krome “are not isolated.”

“They represent a deliberate system of cruelty designed to punish people seeking to build a new life in the US,” said Fischer. “We must stop detaining our immigrant community members and people seeking safety and instead work toward humane, rights-respecting migration policies.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

At the behest of Trump, several GOP-led states have redrawn maps to give the party an advantage in next year's midterms.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

In an interview on Monday, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated that he will likely call a special session of the state legislature in the near future to redraw congressional boundaries, as many GOP-led states across the country have already done in order to benefit the Republican Party.

In his comments to The Floridian, DeSantis was unforthcoming about the partisan nature of his plan, framing the move as a “requirement,” depending on the outcome of a Supreme Court case involving Texas's mid-census redistricting. 

“So, we're going to redistrict,” he told the publication. “We're going to do it next spring.”

Florida maps have already changed somewhat, following a challenge by state Republicans to a previously drawn map that had created a Black-majority district. The conservative state Supreme Court ruled that map was unlawful, splitting the district up and diluting Black voting power in the process.

DeSantis indicated that, pending the outcome of the federal Supreme Court case, Republicans may make more changes to Florida's congressional maps, calling considerations for race as outlined in the Voting Rights Act “defects” that may have to be “remedied.”

Several progressive organizations in the state have decried the governor's statements.

Genesis Robinson, executive director of Equal Ground Education Fund, a voting rights organization focused on empowering Black voters, called the move “a mid-decade redistricting process designed to tip the scales of power for political purposes and silence voters, particularly those in the most marginalized communities of our state.”

Robinson further described the plan as being “unprecedented, dangerous and fundamentally undemocratic.”

Notably, Florida voters decided in a 2010 ballot initiative to change the state constitution, forbidding partisan gerrymandering. Despite DeSantis claiming that his intentions are to “remedy” a flawed map, any new maps would likely be challenged on that basis, given the redistricting scheme orchestrated by several GOP-led states to stymie any Democratic Party gains in the 2026 midterms next fall.

“Lawmakers are taking the illegal step of redrawing districts halfway through the normal cycle to avoid being held accountable by voters,” said Brad Ashwell, Florida state director for All Voting is Local.

A rally is planned for Thursday at the Florida state Capitol building to voice opposition to the redistricting plans. 

The voluntary redrawing of maps by state legislatures is rare — indeed, from 1970 to 2024, there were only three instances of state lawmakers deciding to redistrict their congressional maps before the next census. But this year, at the urging of the Trump administration, four Republican-led states have passed new maps for partisan reasons, with one Democratic-led state, California, doing so in response to those states' actions. Several more states are planning to redistrict before next year's midterms.

Although both major political parties have engaged in partisan gerrymandering, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress have proposed a bill aimed at limiting the practice. The Redistricting Reform Act requires states to comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and to draw maps that would “respect communities of interest” and “representational needs based on common ethnic, racial, economic, Tribal, social, cultural, geographic, or historic identities, or arising from similar socioeconomic conditions.” 

The bill also requires states to establish independent redistricting commissions to ensure that state lawmakers are not drawing their own political maps to benefit themselves. It would forbid mid-census redrawing of maps unless a state is ordered to do so by a court to remedy a noncompliant map.

The bill does not have a high likelihood of passage, given that the House and Senate are both controlled by Republicans who are supportive of Trump's efforts to redraw maps to keep their party in control of Congress. However, the measures outlined in the bill are incredibly popular among voters across the U.S.

According to an NBC News/Decision Desk poll conducted in September, 82 percent of voters support the idea of states having nonpartisan commissions redraw maps instead of state lawmakers themselves. A Common Cause poll from that same month found support among voters from all political stripes for restricting mid-census redistricting, with 76 percent of Democratic-leaning voters and 57 percent of Republican-leaning voters agreeing with that idea.

 A Bad Deal Is Worse Than No Deal

 Sergey Radchenko

In August, U.S. President Donald Trump was disappointed when a meeting in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to produce a breakthrough in ending the war in Ukraine. “We didn't get there,” Trump acknowledged at the time. Putin had evinced little interest in ceding ground on his maximalist demands, making a peace deal look remote, but the entirely predictable failure of the Alaska misadventure evidently did not deter Trump from trying again. In November, a 28-point peace plan—which media reports suggest was put together by both Russian and American officials—sent Kyiv and Ukraine's European allies into conniptions because it largely reflected Russian positions on territory and Ukraine's future. In tough negotiations with the United States, the Ukrainians successfully pushed back against many of these Russian-leaning positions, arriving at a new plan that Putin has yet to agree to.

Amid this pageantry of proposal and negotiation, Trump remains committed to chasing a fantasy. The U.S. president is seemingly unwilling to accept that his Russian counterpart does not want to end the war without securing Ukraine's complete surrender. Trump continues to believe that, if only provided with sufficient inducements or threatened with new sanctions, Putin will trade his long-term goals for a reasonable settlement that will preserve a truncated but basically independent Ukraine, one able to defend itself against further Russian encroachment.

Impatient for deliverables, Trump has so far failed to develop a consistent, professional process for attaining them. His approach to peacemaking has suffered from an improbable degree of improvisation, exclusion of regional expertise, and consequentially, shallowness and flights of fancy. The 28-point plan was no exception: produced without consulting European allies and delivered in haste to the weary Ukrainians, it was riddled with inconsistencies and outright errors, and had to be walked back almost at once, undermining the credibility of the entire effort. The leak of transcripts that show Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff advising the Russians about the right way to talk to the U.S. president highlights mind-boggling lapses of judgment among key officials entrusted with looking after American national interests.

Although Trump sincerely wants peace, he has not quite understood how that peace fits within U.S. grand strategy. By pursuing peace at what appears to be almost any price—including at the cost of making significant concessions to Russia—the United States risks strengthening an adversary and allowing Putin to grasp victory from the jaws of certain strategic defeat.

It should be evident to anyone who has closely followed this conflict that, nearly four years on, Russia is much worse off than it was in February 2022. Its economy, resilient as it has been, is now in dire straits. With runaway inflation and an interest rate of 16.5 percent, Russia is on a steady track to recession. It has a shortage of labor, especially highly qualified labor. There is also a shortage of manpower for Russia's war machine (an unsurprising fact, given the astronomical casualty numbers, perhaps over a million men, that Russia has sustained). Lower oil prices make it more difficult for the Kremlin to fill the holes in its budget, leading to lower spending on those areas not directly related to the war, such as health care and education. Russia finds itself increasingly dependent on China as a source of key technologies and as a market for Russian hydrocarbons; such dependence makes Russia deeply vulnerable to the whims of Beijing.

In short, this war has made Russia poorer, accelerating its demise as would-be great power. But while Russia's trajectory toward irrelevance is all too clear, its aggressive behavior toward its neighbors (some of it clearly a sign of desperation in the Kremlin) has played into the West's hands. Putin's belligerence, including his boastful and entirely unrealistic claim that he is ready for war with Europe “right now,” is helping focus the Europeans on the need for a long-term plan to contain Russia. Since 2022, NATO has grown rapidly and seamlessly, with Sweden and Finland strengthening the alliance's northern flank. In the meantime, fear of the war in Ukraine spilling over into eastern Europe—spurred by Moscow's mindless provocations and penchant for hybrid warfare—has driven increased defense spending and ever closer defense cooperation within the European Union. All of this is very bad for Russia, which simply cannot afford a long-term confrontation with the world's most powerful alliance.

To be sure, Ukraine is facing tremendous difficulties of its own. These include finding men to fight and financing war operations. There is also growing resentment in the country at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's governing methods and the alleged corruption of some of his associates, such as Andriy Yermak, the president's erstwhile chief of staff. The Russians have indeed made some gains on the battlefield, but not of the kind that would justify the optimism that Putin is so desperate to project. In reality, both countries are losing this war. The question is which one will lose first. There is no reason to believe that Russia—still mired in the Donbas after four years—will suddenly achieve the battlefield breakthroughs that will lead to Kyiv's immediate capitulation. Instead, all the indications point toward a war of attrition that neither side can bring to a meaningful end.

Putin has repeatedly claimed that Russia wants peace in Ukraine. But as Carl von Clausewitz memorably put it, an aggressor is “always peace-loving” insofar as it would prefer to invade unopposed. In his time, Joseph Stalin spoke about the importance of grasping the “banner of peace” as a way of rallying global public opinion to the Soviet cause (which, in his case, was frequently war). Putin stands squarely within this tradition. But his peace-loving statements—conditioned as they necessarily are by the requirement that Ukraine surrender to Russia's demands—do affect how many people in the West perceive the war in Ukraine. It is intuitively appealing to believe, as Trump does, that peace may be around the corner if only Western officials gave the Russians a chance and offered them something.

Yet the parameters of Russia's peace have been clear well before the 28-point proposal flummoxed Western capitals in November. The draft agreement from Russian-Ukrainian talks in Belarus and Istanbul in March and April 2022, and the Kremlin's later pronouncements (including those demands the Russians presented to Ukraine in the more recent iteration of the Istanbul talks in May and June 2025) have long shown what the Russians will and won't accept. Putin's conditions include Ukraine's permanent neutrality, which would preclude the country's possible NATO membership or the presence of foreign troops on its soil; severe restrictions on the Ukrainian military, including caps on troop numbers and the types and weapons that Kyiv would be allowed to have; and weak security guarantees that Russia can veto if and when it opts to invade Ukraine again.

Putin has even more ambitious goals. He wants Ukraine and Western countries to accept Russia's conquest of the Donbas, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia—even though significant parts of these territories are still in Ukrainian hands—and his annexation of the Crimea. He demands Ukraine's withdrawal from the entirety of Donetsk oblast, which Russia has tried but failed to capture. He wants sanctions on Russia to be lifted, and for countries to drop any attempt to hold the Kremlin—and him personally—accountable for this war. He wants Ukraine to change its laws around language and historical remembrance to accommodate Russia's preferences for Ukraine's national and historical identity.



Finally, Putin wants Zelensky removed from power. He justifies this point—ironically enough for an illegitimate autocrat—with references to Zelensky's lapsed legitimacy (Kyiv has been reluctant to stage now overdue presidential elections in wartime). The real reason, unquestionably, is that Putin is indignant that Zelensky stood up to his bullying. He wants the Ukrainian president gone to send a signal to other would-be challengers in Russia's immediate neighborhood.

Not everything in the initial 28-point plan is without merit, however. For example, there is nothing to be gained by clinging to the clearly unrealizable idea of Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO. In these nearly four years of fighting, neither the United States nor its European allies have shown any indication of their willingness to go to war with Russia over Ukraine. The fantasy of Ukraine's accession to NATO should be dispensed with. Ukraine and its allies could accommodate other Russian demands, too, including the protection of the rights of Russian speakers in Ukraine, or even the reinstatement of the Russian Orthodox Church, which Kyiv banned in 2024.

But even if Ukraine were willing to make such concessions, Russia would offer little in return. Any premature peace settlement that undermines the prospects of Ukraine's survival as a sovereign country and lets Russia get away with territorial aggression would fly against Western interests, to say nothing of Ukraine's. It is for this reason that Trump's 28-point plan triggered such a backlash among the European allies, as well as in Kyiv. It accepted most of the Kremlin's demands as a starting point for negotiations. And it offered a so-called peace that might, in fact, be much worse for both Ukraine and the West than the continuation of war. Bloody, grinding wars are costly in human and material terms, but if the alternative to such a war is the peace of surrender to Putin's Russia, then that peace can wait.

Trump's heart is in the right place: ending a war that has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives appears to be a reasonable goal. And Trump's engagement with Moscow has already brought important dividends. For example, the Kremlin has toned down its nuclear saber-rattling. At the same time, the United States should not seem too eager for peace. That is invariably a bad negotiating strategy. Being too eager for anything usually indicates weakness, and in this case, the United States is clearly in a position of strength. It is supporting the noble cause of a country that has become a de facto American ally, a country that Washington can afford to back indefinitely. Support for the Ukrainian war effort costs the United States far less than any of its recent wars in the Middle East did.

What is more, while it is true that Ukraine wants to end this war as soon as possible, it is not desperate to capitulate to the aggressor. Ukrainian public opinion polls—for example, those conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology this autumn—show overwhelming opposition to the idea of voluntarily ceding any territory to Russia that is still in Ukrainian hands. A healthy majority of Ukrainians also oppose giving up any territory at all.

A public consensus in Ukraine holds that this is a war of national survival. For as long as this consensus prevails, the United States has no valid reason to force Ukraine into making sweeping concessions to the Kremlin. If these concessions served U.S. national interests, it would certainly be another matter. But the United States gains nothing from Ukraine capitulating to Russia. It's quite the opposite. The United States should not want to allow a revisionist, aggressive state intent on dismantling the U.S.-led international order to win a major European war. U.S. national interests are therefore best served by continuing to provide intelligence and military equipment to Ukraine, especially when U.S. allies in Europe are happy to pay for American arms. Among other benefits, such American commitment will help Moscow reach the conclusion that this war is unwinnable, which may well lead to a real desire for peace and a willingness to make necessary concessions.

Deal-making is worthwhile only when those deals serve a clear and well-considered purpose. The United States should not be desperate to bring about a peace that benefits U.S. adversaries at the expense of U.S. allies and the United States itself. Washington will gain nothing from extending the Russians a lifeline in the form of U.S.-sponsored peace talks that coerce Ukraine into an effective surrender and meet Putin's essential demands.

To offer an analogy, giving in to Russia now would be a little bit like President Ronald Reagan, in 1983, forcing the Afghan opposition to accept Soviet demands. To what end? And how would that have benefited the United States? Reagan never had any such intention, and he continued supporting the Afghan resistance, ultimately forcing the Soviets to reconsider their goals in Afghanistan. Indeed, the Soviet leadership almost immediately recognized the mistake of their invasion (just as today many in the Russian leadership unquestionably understand the folly of the invasion of Ukraine). But hubris and inertia kept the Soviets bogged down in the unwinnable war for a few years still. In the end, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, describing Afghanistan as a “bleeding wound,” called it quits. His decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in 1989 is now seen as an important element in the story of Soviet retrenchment and, eventually, the Soviet Union's imperial collapse. It would not have been possible if Reagan—guided as he certainly was by the general desire for peace—facilitated a deal that would leave the Soviets entrenched in Kabul.

Trump must recognize that despite the visceral horrors of the war, he should not be in a rush to force a bad deal. The Europeans are clearly desperate to play more of a role in the conflict. If Europe continues funding American weapons purchases for Ukraine—which, by any measure of burden sharing, they certainly should and are willing to do—then there is yet time to work out a better deal. It demands little from the United States to exercise patience and remain on the side of the Ukrainians and their European supporters. If Trump can show the American public that the costs of the war in Ukraine are borne mostly by Europe, and not the United States, then he will not be so unnecessarily pressed to surrender Ukraine to Russia.

The best thing that can happen to Russia is that it discovers the limits of its imperialism the hard way—by getting bogged down in Ukraine. By contrast, winning the war (and this is what Putin clearly hopes to accomplish, whether on the battlefield or through peace negotiations) would only further inflame Putin's hubris and encourage more aggression. Russia should face the consequences of its misguided policies, not reap the rewards of territorial enlargement. It should be made to realize that there are better ways to achieve greatness than invading one's neighbors. For the sake of peace, Trump should not place further obstacles in the way of this belated realization.

 The President's Transactional Style Is Well Suited to the Region

 Ray Takeyh

The Middle East is a place that most American presidents want to avoid. Yet inevitably, they find themselves mired in its quarrels. Despite periodic calls for a pivot toward other geostrategic challenges, the perception that its core interests are at stake in the region has kept the United States from leaving. The oil depositories of the Persian Gulf remain vital to the global economy. A menacing Iran sits near the nuclear threshold. The Arab world's political dysfunction has produced generations of militants and terrorists, a collection of whom attacked the United States in 2001, resulting in the worst mass-casualty event it had suffered on its homeland since Pearl Harbor.

Since the turn of the twenty-first century, U.S. presidents have tried to solve the Middle East's conundrums through armed invasions, diplomacy, and limited humanitarian interventions. All have failed. Some of these efforts spawned even more pernicious phenomena. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, for example, gave rise to a new legion of terrorists. The limited 2011 military foray into Libya resulted in chaos across a large swath of North Africa. And yet administration after administration has remained, in some way, enchanted with the idea of imposing a regional vision.

That is, until Donald Trump. This president, like his predecessors, has not extricated Washington from the Middle East. But unlike them, Trump has approached the area with little idealism. His stances have instead been entirely driven by pragmatism and a preference for power politics. Like the Middle East's own strongmen, Trump divides the world into winners and losers and steadfastly aligns himself with the former. Israel is strong, so he lets it do as it wishes. The Arab Gulf sheikhdoms have oil and make deals, so he engages with them. But the Palestinians are the region's losers, and thus not worth much concern.

This approach is doubtless crude. But the results are clearly positive. During his five years in office, Trump has normalized ties between Israel and multiple Arab states. In October, he put a stop to the fighting between Israel and Hamas, sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023, assault on Israel. He has ensured that American firms get preferential access to the Gulf's oil and markets. And he has successfully attacked groups and governments that menace American interests, including the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Trump's decisions have not made the Middle East more democratic. They certainly have not ameliorated the region's historical grievances. But they have kept it comparatively stable while advancing Washington's positions. They have, in other words, helped Trump accomplish far more than his sophisticated and well-intentioned predecessors ever did.

To understand why Trump has succeeded where other presidents have failed, consider the United States' approach to the Arab countries, which make up most of the Middle East. For decades, American presidents have tried to solve these states' inherent tensions by attacking or otherwise prodding them. President George W. Bush stands out as his country's most ambitious and humbled politician in this regard. His initial response to the September 11 terrorist attack—invading Afghanistan to drive the Taliban from power and launching a “war on terror”—was reasonable. But then Bush and his seasoned advisers came to believe that the best way to stabilize the Middle East was to invade Iraq. Doing so, the theory went, would ultimately transform the region's many authoritarian regimes into democratic, pro-Western ones. Instead, it sharpened the Middle East's sectarian divide and empowered Iran. By the time Bush left office, the region was more unstable than when he arrived.

Bush's Democratic successors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, were both determined not to get entangled in the Arab world's messy politics. They sensed Americans' exhaustion with endless wars and rightfully declared that it was time to rely less on armies and more on diplomats. But each was, in his own way, hopelessly afflicted by idealism. During the Arab Spring, Obama sided with the street, nudging Egypt's U.S.-friendly president, Hosni Mubarak, out of power and staging a humanitarian military intervention in Libya that deposed Muammar al-Qaddafi. Neither was successful. Mubarak was replaced by a democratically elected Islamist who, after trying to concentrate power, was deposed by a new military dictator. Libya fractured and now has two competing authoritarian governments. Biden never promoted regime change, but his hostility toward the region's main monarchy—he called Saudi Arabia a “pariah” after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of a dissident journalist—undercut his country's regional interests. The royal families, for example, resisted Biden's efforts to increase oil production and pressure Hamas into agreeing to a cease-fire.

Trump, by contrast, practices politics without judgment. He is happy, for example, to deal with the jihadi turned suited statesman Ahmed al-Shara, the new president of Syria, if Shara joins his fight against the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). He is also deeply transactional. Trump supports Saudi Arabia and other Gulf sheikhdoms because they are a source of capital, an export market for semiconductors and weapons, and an important aspect of the global energy markets. These are people he can do business with.

The Arabs' princes and kings have reciprocated. At Trump's behest, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates signed the 2020 Abraham Accords, normalizing relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia remains outside the accords, but it has its own subtle partnership with Israel involving intelligence sharing and security cooperation. Qatar flirts with Islamist forces, but it continues to house a large U.S. military base and was instrumental in crafting the armistice in Gaza. All three countries are engaged in financial dealings with the Trump family. In that part of the world, personal fortunes are enmeshed with national ones, and the lines between commerce and diplomacy are frequently blurred. This is precisely how the Gulf elites like it.

Since the advent of the Islamic Republic in 1979, successive American administrations have treated the Iranian regime less like a unified entity and more like a collection of factions competing for political power, some of which are susceptible to U.S. influence. Many presidents have thus made supporting Iran's moderates central to their agenda. The high point of such efforts came during the Obama administration, which pursued arms control diplomacy in hopes of empowering more reasonable actors. The result was the 2015 nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in which Iran agreed to limit its enrichment and accept increased international monitoring in exchange for sanctions relief.

But this approach is based on a faulty premise. Although Iranian officials may not all hold the same views, they do all share a hatred for the United States—anti-Americanism is the glue that binds the regime. As a result, Iran would only agree to a deal after Washington recognized its right to domestic enrichment and stipulated that Iran could move toward industrial-scale enrichment after various clauses expired. The regime's powerbrokers, meanwhile, used the economic dividends from sanctions relief to fund terrorism abroad and repression at home.



Instead, the best way to get results with Tehran is through force. After storming the U.S. embassy in 1979, for example, Iran's revolutionaries threatened to put captured American diplomats on trial. In response, U.S. President Jimmy Carter sent a private note to Iran saying that if Tehran harmed the hostages, Washington would retaliate. Soon, all the talk of public trials was shelved. Two decades later, after Bush had invaded Iraq and was menacing Iran, the Iranian regime suspended its nuclear program until the United States became bogged down in a quagmire in Iraq—at which point Iran resumed its nuclear program with greater vigor. When it comes to Iran, threats have been the exception, not the rule. The irony of the United States' approach to Tehran is that Washington has not learned the lessons of its own success.

Except, again, for Trump. In his first term, he disposed of the nuclear deal and reimposed devastating sanctions on Iran. He sensed, correctly, that the agreement was not a sturdy barrier to Iranian proliferation and that the deal benefited Tehran more than Washington. Trump then ordered the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, the legendary commander of Iran's Quds Force, who had knit together a transnational army of proxies and terrorists that did Iran's bidding across the region. Rather than sparking a larger war, as some analysts fretted, Soleimani's assassination permanently set back Iran's proxies. In 2011, when the Syrian civil war started, Soleimani was instrumental in organizing Syrian defenses and marshaling an auxiliary force of approximately 70,000 militiamen that rescued President Bashar al-Assad's regime. But after Soleimani's death, the Syrian army was hollowed out. Eventually, it lost its ability to fight altogether. When Shara's rebel forces began their advance from the north in late November 2024, Syrian troops fled their posts, and Damascus fell in less than two weeks.

But perhaps Trump's biggest accomplishment was the June 2025 strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. For two decades, many policymakers and pundits had insisted that attacking Tehran's nuclear program would provoke a regional conflagration. As a result, they not only forswore U.S. attacks; they also blocked Israeli ones. Israel wanted to attack Iran's nuclear facilities during the Obama years, only to be rebuffed. But Trump gave the Israelis the green light—and then joined in when things appeared to go well. “No president was willing to do it, and I was willing to do it,” he later bragged.

For decades, American officials have pushed for an independent Palestinian state. A two-state solution, they declared, was essential to bringing peace to the Middle East and integrating Israel into the region. Bush became the first president to formally call for an independent Palestinian state, in June 2002, during the run-up to the Iraq war. Obama kept up these efforts, having his secretary of state, John Kerry, shuttle between Israel and the West Bank. Biden also championed this proposal, even after the October 7 attacks.

But these attempts went nowhere. Bush's endeavors led to a summit, and little else. Obama was able to secure nothing more than temporary, partial freezes on settlements. Biden's efforts were almost entirely rhetorical—designed, it seemed, to shield him from liberal backlash while he sold Israel every weapon he could and insulated the country from criticism and pressure at home and abroad. The sum total of Washington's two-state endeavors is a sheaf of memoirs lamenting a lost peace.

There has always been something improbable about an independent Palestinian state. Palestinian leaders were trying to win at the negotiating table what they had lost in wars that they and their Arab allies had frequently started, and history rarely rewards such truculence. The Palestinians were still able to persuade Israel, at various times, to offer up Gaza and portions of the West Bank that it seized in 1967 in exchange for recognition and some territorial concessions. Yet these concessions were never enough for Palestinian leaders, and Israel's position hardened as time wound on and terrorist attacks by Palestinian militants continued. The tragedy of the Palestinian people is that their leaders are too invested in their narrative of grief and loss to accept any compromise until their options have been even further eroded.

The chimera of a two-state solution still has widespread backing within Washington's traditional foreign policy establishment. But not from Trump. This president cares little for subnational actors. He understands that Israel does not want to cede land and should not be asked to do so. And he realized that many Arab governments grasp this fact, as well. He was thus able to broker the Abraham Accords, to the shock of many analysts. The Arab signatories have stood by the agreements, even during Israel's onslaught in Gaza.

Still, Trump knows better than to hand Israel a blank check. He has been sensitive to Arab leaders' public relations concerns and has warned the Israelis not to annex the West Bank, although he allowed them to incrementally increase the size of their settlements. He also successfully pushed Israel into signing the October cease-fire. But Trump was able to exert this leverage because he is one of the most popular politicians in Israel and has solid relations with Arab monarchs, who could, in turn, pressure Hamas. Trump was also willing to break Washington's unwritten rule against engaging directly with Hamas, which helped him secure the cease-fire.

Trump has calmed the Middle East. But he has not fixed it. Despite his protestations, peace is not in hand in the Holy Land. The Iranian nuclear program has not been obliterated. And the Arab world remains plagued by political dysfunction. In a region where things frequently go wrong, much can still fall apart.

Consider, for example, the recent cease-fire. Armistices in the Middle East are always shaky, and the one worked out between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's aide Ron Dermer and Trump's all-purpose envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner will be no exception. Both Hamas and Israel are still inclined to pressure each other militarily when convenient. The deal does not address the expansion of Israeli settlements. The 20-point plan for disarming Hamas, reconstructing Gaza, and creating a pathway for Palestinian statehood is therefore likely to remain dormant. It is hard, for example, to see a multinational force of Arab troops entering Gaza and finishing off the stubbornly violent remnants of Hamas, as the plan calls for. Instead, Gaza will likely remain a festering wound, a densely populated refugee camp subsisting on food aid from humanitarian relief agencies. The Israel Defense Forces will bear the brunt of the security responsibilities, patrolling demilitarized zones and occasionally bombing emerging threats.

The Iranian nuclear challenge, meanwhile, could again rear its ugly head. Iran's clerical oligarchs are shaken and still sorting out how their defenses were compromised and their intelligence apparatus penetrated. They will want to settle internal scores and sideline Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who made catastrophic misjudgments about Israel's power and is physically frail. Although the regime will lie low, it is waiting for the moment when the United States becomes distracted with other crises and Israel loses its focus. Then, it will resume its nuclear program with alacrity.



Washington must be ready to respond with attacks. The most important long-term consequence of the 12-day war between the Islamic Republic and Israel (and, later, the United States) is that military intervention is now the instrument of counterproliferation in Iran. It is hard to imagine the regime putting its trust in agreements that can be abrogated or international institutions, such as the UN Security Council, that can easily be bent to Washington's will.

Israel seems to understand that this is the new normal. It knows that no victory in the Middle East is permanent; there is a reason its doctrine for handling adversaries is called “mowing the lawn.” But it is unclear whether Trump has the same grasp of the facts. Instead of continuing to menace Tehran, the president has declared victory and invited Iranians to talk. Trump may get away with this approach; his unpredictability, and Netanyahu's bellicosity, will temper the mullahs' atomic ambitions for now. But he has almost certainly saddled his successors with a vexing Iran challenge. They may have little choice but to bomb the country again.

Some analysts hope that Iran's nuclear program will go away on its own, when the regime finally collapses. But Iran's war with Israel and the United States suggests that, despite its massive domestic failures, the Islamic Republic is far more resilient than many thought. Israel was able to quickly degrade Iran's proxies, including the vaunted Hezbollah in Lebanon. Yet when Netanyahu called on the Iranians to rise up and overthrow their regime at a moment of profound vulnerability, not much happened. Iran's cantankerous elite came together, and the public remained passive. The Islamic Republic is a problem to be managed, not wished away.

None of this means the Middle East can't be made better. Poor governance, institutional decay, and environmental degradation remain endemic problems in the region. The Arab ruling elites know they are presiding over a region marred by corruption and dysfunction. Their lust for power often blinds them to popular disaffection. The United States cannot persuade or compel these leaders to govern in a more enlightened fashion, but it can still encourage them to broaden political participation and reform their economies.

But any such conversations or efforts must be circumspect and limited. The Middle East is ultimately no place for idealism and lofty ambitions. It is, instead, a place for power and realism—which makes it perfect for this U.S. president. For now, oil continues to flow, the Iranian threat has been diminished, the fighting in Gaza has subsided, and there are no major upheavals. In a region known mostly for chaos, these are consequential achievements.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Safety volunteer charged in the fatal shooting of a Utah ‘No Kings' protester","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/us/matthew-alder-charged-no-kings-protest-shooting-hnk","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 07:50:11 GMT","


            A safety volunteer accused of fatally shooting a man taking part in a “No Kings” protest last June in Salt Lake City while firing at another man he believed to be a potential mass shooter has been charged with manslaughter, prosecutors announced Wednesday.
    


            Matthew Alder allegedly fired three shots — one hitting a man who had been seen assembling an AR-15 rifle near the crowd and a third inadvertently killing the rally participant, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, according to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill.
    


            While Alder had a right to use lethal force to stop a perceived threat and a right to carry a gun under Utah law, his third shot, fired over people's heads at a large gathering, was reckless and constituted a crime, Gill said.
    


            “In this case our argument is that the third bullet was reckless and, if it is reckless, it is manslaughter,” Gill said at a news conference. He noted that another safety volunteer with Alder did not think it was safe to open fire at the time because the man with the rifle was moving toward the crowd.
    


            An email and a telephone message left for Alder's lawyer, Phil Wormdahl, seeking comment were not immediately returned.
    


            Ah Loo, known as Afa, was a successful fashion designer and former “Project Runway” contestant who devoted his life to celebrating artists from the Pacific Islands.
    


            His widow, Laura Ah Loo, who has demanded accountability for her husband's death, said Gill's decision to charge Alder was “moral and just.” Fighting back tears, she described her husband as “an incredible father, advocate, creative and champion for others.”
    


            “The grief of losing him has been profound and overwhelming,” Ah Loo said.
    


            Utah is an open-carry state, meaning people who can legally own a firearm are generally allowed to carry it on a public street.
    


Utah ‘No Kings' protest: What we know about the fatal shooting



            The man who was seen assembling the rifle, Arturo Roberto Gamboa, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder and accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death, police said at the time.
    


            Gill said Gamboa would not be charged. In a letter explaining the decision, prosecutors noted there was not enough evidence to show Gamboa had broken any law even though his actions could “reasonably be perceived as alarming and irresponsible.”
    


            A telephone message left for Gamboa's lawyer was not immediately returned.
    


            The lawyer, Greg Skordas, has previously said Gamboa was walking with the rifle unloaded pointed at the ground before he was shot. Skordas has said he does not believe that Gamboa heard anyone tell him to drop the weapon.
    


            Alder told investigators that he fired at Gamboa after Gamboa began moving toward the crowd and did not respond when he yelled at the man to stop, according to Alder's charging document. He told detectives that Gamboa's behavior “scared the hell out of me,” the document said.
    


            The “No Kings” protests were nationwide demonstrations in the U.S. earlier this year that opposed the administration of President Donald Trump, citing perceived authoritarian and anti-democratic actions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Hegseth rides into controversies on a Trump-fueled tide of convention-busting bravado","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/politics/hegseth-controversies-trump-collinson","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 06:27:45 GMT","


            When a scandal-plagued top official needs a public vote of confidence from a president, it's usually a certain sign they're headed for the exit.
    


            But Pete Hegseth is starting to look like a defense secretary with nine lives. After surviving a bitter confirmation showdown that included damning details of his personal life, he's now in the midst of additional controversies that would have been career-ending in more normal political times.
    


            Hegseth, who prefers to be called the secretary of war, was on Thursday in the middle of two raging Washington melodramas sparking calls for his resignation. But President Donald Trump is standing firm.
    


            — A new government watchdog report finds that Hegseth risked compromising sensitive military information, which could have endangered US troops and mission objectives, when he used Signal in March of this year to share highly-sensitive attack plans targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen, CNN exclusively reported, citing four sources familiar with the contents of a classified assessment.
    


            — A storm is intensifying over what orders Hegseth issued and what he knew about a follow-up attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean on September 2, that reportedly killed surviving crew members, prompting Democrats to claim those involved may have committed a war crime. Hegseth says he didn't know about the second strike in advance, but that the admiral who he says did order it, Frank “Mitch” Bradley, has his full support.
    


            The backlash from both incidents is creating new distractions for a president whose approval ratings have plunged and a Republican Party looking with trepidation towards next year's midterm elections. In such circumstances, White Houses often conclude it's best to tip the scandal-plagued official overboard.
    


            But this is not a normal White House.
    


            A blow like the one delivered to Hegseth in an inspector general's report would have most public officials contemplating their position. But Trump has dismantled the government's architecture of accountability. He's fired multiple inspectors general and turned the Justice Department into a vessel to target his enemies. Hegseth has enthusiastically followed suit at the Defense Department, ousting military lawyers and purging top brass he considered insufficiently loyal to Trump.
    


            In an administration determined to purge the “deep state,” an unfavorable report from an inspector general doesn't even rank as a blip.
    


            But Hegseth's value to Trump runs deeper.
    


            The former Fox News anchor might bring bad headlines, but he's also a pure distillation of the president's convention-busting psyche — an outsider bent on smashing the status quo, a fighter who picks the same enemies as his boss and who views laws and rules of engagement as things to be fought against in a quest to unleash American might.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement Wednesday that “President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth” and argued the IG report proved no classified information was leaked and operational security was not jeopardized in Hegseth's posts to top officials on Signal.
    


            For now Hegseth seems safe.
    


            True, Trump's assurances of confidence have sometimes had a short half-life. He backed first term Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson before he fired them. His initial support for Matt Gaetz, his first pick for his second term attorney general, couldn't stop his nomination from quickly dissolving. And many Trump subordinates have discovered that loyalty often goes only one way when they become a millstone for a transactional president.
    


            The president's confidence in Hegseth is hardly shared on Capitol Hill. Senior Republicans danced a tightrope when asked if they share his assessment. Hegseth “serves at the pleasure of the president” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN's Manu Raju, arguing he was part of a team that made America safer. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker said the defense secretary was in a “pretty good position” in regard to the IG report but did not respond when Raju asked if he had confidence in him.
    


            Other Republicans are less discrete. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul this week implied Hegseth had lied about the September 2 boat attack. Alaska Sen Lisa Murkowski pointed out that she had never backed Hegseth. “I had suggested that perhaps we can and should do better,” she said.
    


            Democrats want Hegseth gone. They include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, who is locked in a feud with the defense secretary after the Pentagon warned he could be called back into uniform and court martialed over a video in which he and other Democrats reminded service personnel they didn't have to obey illegal orders. “Pete Hegseth should have been fired,” said Kelly, a retired Navy pilot, war hero and astronaut, referring to the Signalgate fiasco.
    


            Aside from Hegseth's shifting explanations of the boat strike and Signalgate, he has given his critics plenty of evidence for their case that his lack of top-level government experience, temperament and hyper-partisan antics make him a bad fit to run the Pentagon.
    


            There was the furious rhetorical assault on the “fake news” media at the White House Easter Egg roll and another overwrought rant at the press in Hawaii. Hegseth's Defense Department kicked out the press corps that refused to sign up to draconian censorship rules and welcomed pliant MAGA-oriented replacements.
    


Secretary of Culture War: How Hegseth wields power at the Pentagon



            His willingness to bring the antics and pyrotechnics of conservative news to showdowns with foreign officials surely appeal to a president who is a master of stunt politics.
    


            And as much as he can be a headache, it would be an inconvenience for Trump to lose Hegseth. No White House relishes a difficult confirmation hearing for a new nominee, especially one that would bring unflattering scrutiny of its own conduct.
    


            And the president will struggle to find a like-for-like replacement.
    


            Hegseth may be safe so far because he's not made the same mistake as two of Trump's first-term defense secretaries. Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis tried to leaven the president's “America first” foreign policy instincts. He quit when Trump demanded the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. Another of Trump's former defense secretaries, Mark Esper, wrote his resignation letter months before a departure that was made inevitable when he publicly said he'd oppose the use of troops to quell domestic political protests.
    


            Hegseth has been an enthusiastic proponent of Trump's bid to send US reservists and even active-duty Marine units into American cities on law enforcement missions that several judges ruled flouted the Constitution and the law.
    


            It's not just that Hegseth's campaign against “woke” generals and diversity, equity and inclusion in the Defense Department reflect the president's own culture wars.
    


            He's an avatar for the MAGA movement and America First. Like the president, he believes that many of the rules the US military long sought to honor show weakness. If Trump were to reject Hegseth, he'd not simply be losing a key supporter, he'd be rejecting a value system that mirrors his own.
    


            Trump has long railed against what he considers politically correct behavior and adherence to laws that he thinks spike the power of the US military. He has expressed admiration for autocrats like Chinese President Xi Jinping and former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who killed drugs traffickers without due process — remarks which seem especially relevant to the administration's attacks on what they have declared to be narco terrorists in the Caribbean Sea.
    


            Hegseth emerged from his own decorated military service in the Army National Guard and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan with strident views against what he saw as left-wing laws of war and even the Geneva Conventions.
    


            In his book “The War on Warriors” Hegseth wrote, “When you send Americans to war, their mandate should be to lethally dominate the battlefield.” He added: “Should we follow the Geneva Conventions? What if we treated the enemy the way they treated us? … Makes me wonder, in 2024 — if you want to win — how can anyone write universal rules about killing other people in open conflict?”
    


            Such sentiments alarmed Hegseth's many Capitol Hill critics as well as former military top brass who believed that the United States had an imperative to show moral leadership on the field of battle.
    


            Hegseth tried to qualify his views during his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year. He argued that lawyers worried about ethics and international conventions were getting in the way of troops in the field, and that certain rules of engagement are outdated in the face of non-state actors and terror groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS that US troops encountered in the war on terror.
    


            One of Hegseth's most prominent critics, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee, told CNN's Kasie Hunt on Wednesday that Hegseth lacked a basic understanding of why the US should conduct military action according to international law or that the soldier's first duty was to the Constitution, not an individual political leader.
    


            “We do that for self-interest,” Reed said. “If we don't respect the law, how can we expect opponents of ours to treat our prisoners, or wounded or those that are no longer hostile — to treat them fairly and according to the law.”
    


            Such arguments don't fit the ruthless, no quarter attitude to warfare envisioned by Trump and Hegseth. And in retrospect, Hegseth's contempt for rules of engagement makes it seem inevitable that under his leadership the Pentagon would face accusations of crossing ethical, moral and legal lines.
    


            Trump has said that he believes Hegseth didn't order the second strike on September 2, and that he wouldn't have wanted it to happen himself.
    


            But the worldview that makes Hegseth so unacceptable for so many critics seems to be what recommends his continued service to a commander-in-chief who flouts rules of engagement across the spectrum of political life.

            Everything seemed normal at Minneapolis's Somali markets: Men sat in barber chairs, women browsed colorful garments at the boutiques and patrons sampled fried sambusas and rice dishes at the eateries, sometimes as the Muslim call to prayer was sung at low volume over the loudspeakers.
    


            But beneath the calm surface, a quiet anxiety was palpable.
    


            Pockets and purses hung a little heavier with immigration documents and passports as the specter of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown loomed over the gathering spots for the Somali diaspora in the Twin Cities – home to the nation's largest population of people from the East African country.
    


            A new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation targeting undocumented Somali immigrants has begun in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, a source with knowledge of the plans told CNN Wednesday. The cities are the latest target of Trump's sweeping deportation push that has seen a surge of federal agents flooding the streets of blue cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans.



            With the President of the United States disparaging their community as “garbage,” many in Minneapolis's Somali community were feeling unsettled – as evidenced by the sparser than normal crowds at two different malls and the occasional shuttered shop.
    


            A young man working at a bakery at the Karmel Mall south of downtown Minneapolis said the shopping center on Tuesday night was dead compared to usual.
    


            The man, who only gave his first name, Fawzi, said he is nervous even though he was born in Minneapolis.
    


            “I feel scared,” he said. “Imagine you're just sitting in your car and then just someone walks up and is like, ‘Yo, you gotta come with me.'”
    


            At the sprawling indoor mall, offices offering visa and overseas shipping services are interspersed with henna shops, rows of boutiques selling traditional Somali attire, colorful prayer mats and gold jewelry. Overhead, a blue ceiling with white stars symbolizes the flag of Somalia.
    


            At another market about 2 miles away, 24 Somali Mall, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey paid a visit to calm jangled nerves and show his support on Wednesday afternoon.
    


            Frey was waiting in line to buy a Somali confection at a bakery when a woman went up to him and showed him her green card. She told him she was carrying it because she was scared.
    


            “I mean, she's an American citizen,” Frey later told CNN. “She's been here for 25 years, in Minneapolis.”
    


            As the mayor posed for photos and chatted with shoppers at 24 Somali Mall, a different scene played out just outside.
    


            Three vehicles with tinted windows and Virginia plates pulled to a stop near a man who was panhandling on a snowy street. Multiple armed men in law enforcement vests marked “ERO,” or Enforcement and Removal Operations, came out, CNN witnessed.
    


            They asked him for his identification before letting him go, the man later told CNN.
    


            The man, who declined to give his name, said he is a 35-year-old US citizen who was born in Buffalo, New York.
    


            He said he showed the agents his “papers,” and added he wouldn't have had a problem with doing so had the agents not been so “aggressive.”
    


            “They grabbed my hand,” he said. “You shouldn't do that. … Other than that I got no problem being verified.”
    


            Frey noted that of the more than 80,000 people of Somali descent in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the vast majority are citizens or legal residents; just a few hundred have temporary protected status – a protection that President Donald Trump has threatened to remove.
    


            “It's a fairly small number, but again, they are here legally,” he said, adding he fears federal agents will violate the Constitution by “arresting American citizens for looking like they're Somali.”
    


            Others told CNN they, too, were carrying ID cards and papers for fear of getting stopped.
    


            Kamal Ali, who runs a dump truck business with his father and brother, made sure to stick his passport in his wallet before heading to Karmel Mall to grab dinner.
    


            “I don't want no issues,” said the 39-year-old, who said he came to the US at age 10 with his parents after living in a refugee camp in Somalia.
    


            The mayor on Wednesday signed an executive order to prohibit federal, state and local law-enforcement agents from using city-owned parking lots, ramps, garages or vacant lots for staging immigration enforcement operations.
    


            The order was modeled on a similar policy in Chicago, where federal immigration authorities had previously used municipal lots to stage operations, Minneapolis city officials said in a statement.
    


            Frey's order will also create a “signage template” for local businesses and property owners who want to mark their property as off-limits for these activities, the statement said.
    


            Abdul Abdullahi, who runs an employment office at 24 Somali Mall, said he finds Trump's words about the Somali community “shameful.”
    


            “It's very unfortunate for someone in the highest office in the world to generalize and demean a whole community by saying that they are garbage – they're of no good,” said Abdullahi, 39, who said he's been living in Minneapolis for decades. “This is just an attempt to divide us – an attempt to pit us against each other.”
    


            When asked about comments from President Donald Trump about not wanting Somali immigrants in the United States, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, speaking with CNN, cited data analysis on Somalis in Minneapolis and other parts of the country that suggests there is “widespread fraud, particularly marriage fraud, when it comes to immigration.”
    


            Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority — 87% — are naturalized US citizens.
    


            Citizens of Somalia were first granted Temporary Protected Status in 1991 when the country was plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown. In 2013, the US officially recognized the Somali government in Mogadishu for the first time in two decades.
    


            Somalis have maintained Temporary Protected Status “due to insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees,” according to the legislation.
    


            Not all who spoke with CNN were critics of Trump. Some said they voted for him.
    


            Among them was a 40-year-old patron at Karmel Mall who said he attended a Trump rally in Minneapolis in 2019 but was turned away as the venue was filled to capacity.
    


            “The economy was really good the first term,” said the man, a mechanical engineer who only wanted to share his first name, Mohamud. “I'm a numbers guy.”
    


            Still, Mohamud said he believes Trump's rhetoric will boost the president's standing at the expense of the local Somali community.
    


            “This will give him a boost of support,” he said. “You know, people will rally behind him, you know … making America great, whatever that means, right?”
    


            Nasir Abdi, a patron at 24 Somali Mall, echoed the sentiment.
    


            “This is just a show,” he said.
    


            Some Somali residents addressed a $300-million fraud scandal in Minnesota in which dozens of people – the vast majority of them of Somali descent – were charged.
    


            Trump referenced the scandal, which diverted money meant to feed children during the pandemic to fraudsters, a week before Thanksgiving, calling Minnesota a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” as he announced plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents in the state.
    


            “There's a few bad apples, you know, that committed crimes and broke the law, but at the same time, you can't do a collective punishment,” said Ali, the man who works at his family's dump truck business.
    


            Frey put a similar point in stronger terms.
    


            “If you stole food from children and money that should have gone towards housing, you should go to jail,” he said, while eating a plate of goat meat and rice at 24 Somali Mall. “You do not hold an entire community accountable for the actions of the fraudsters.”
    


            He added: “I'm Jewish, and nobody ever held me accountable for Bernie Madoff's financial crimes.”

The vote could abandon the universal hepatitis B vaccine recommendation for infants. On Friday, the discussion turns to ingredients and timing for vaccines on the childhood schedule.
    


            • About the panel: The members of the committee were handpicked by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, after he abruptly fired the 17 sitting members earlier this year.
    


            “This is the third version of the questions that most of the [ACIP] received in 72 hours,” Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a member of the committee, said Thursday as the group headed toward a potentially seismic vote to remove a universal recommendation that newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine. “We're trying to evaluate a moving target.”
    


            It was a sign of some of the confusion that pervaded previous meetings of the committee, which is composed of members handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he fired all previous sitting advisers in June.
    


            Dr. Robert Malone, the ACIP vice chair running Thursday's meeting, called it an “audio/visual harmonization” problem as new voting language couldn't immediately be put up on slides, before calling for a short break to sort things out.
    


            “We really need to know what we're voting on,” a voice over the livestream said as the committee, some of whom were joining remotely, took a pause.
    


            In response to a social media post from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy that criticized his scheduled participation in ACIP presentations on the childhood vaccine schedule, lawyer Aaron Siri challenged the Louisiana doctor and lawmaker to a debate about vaccines.
    


            “Bring your evidence and let's have a long form public debate where we each get 10 minutes to go back and forth on each major vaccine topic,” Siri posted on X.
    


            Siri disputed Cassidy's claim that he “makes his living suing vaccine manufacturers,” saying that he “cannot virtually ever sue vaccine companies for vaccine deaths and harms because of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.”
    


            That law created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, or VICP, after lawsuits against vaccine makers threatened to drive them from the market and cause vaccine shortages. The VICP provides a way for people who have rare but serious side effects from vaccinations to receive compensation from pharmaceutical companies without those manufacturers being found negligent.
    


            It has been a target of US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who pledged in July to “fix” it, a move Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco who focuses on vaccine issues, said “serves a broader anti-vaccine agenda.”
    


            Siri, an attorney with ties to Kennedy, is scheduled to make a presentation to the ACIP Friday morning about the childhood and adolescent immunization schedule.

            Some members of the vaccine advisory committee have repeated that the United States is one of only a few wealthy nations that have adopted the hepatitis B birth dose for all infants.
    


            “It's really important to keep in mind that the US is an outlier in recommending a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine compared to other high-income nations,” said Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, who was recently appointed acting director of the US Food and Drug Administration‘s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and attended the ACIP meeting as an ex officio member.
    


            “There are only a couple of other Western nations that still employ birth dose for hepatitis B,” Dr. Robert Malone, vice chair of ACIP said in a video created by the nonprofit MAHA Action and shared on social media. “The rest of them delay it.”
    


            The United States was a pioneer in the recommending that all infants receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine as early as the day of birth. Universal vaccination of infants has been recommended in the US since 1991.
    


            In 2009 and 2017, the World Health Organization recommended a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for infants, and of its 194 member states, 116 have adopted the policy, according to a recent CDC analysis performed at the request of the committee.
    


            Among a subset of 37 wealthier nations, including Canada, countries in the European Union, the UK, Japan, Switzerland, Australia and South Korea, the US is 1 of 8 to recommend a dose of hepatitis B vaccine to all infants at birth, according to the CDC review.
    


            Most of these countries recommend vaccination soon after birth for infants born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B.
    


            For babies born to mothers who test negative for hepatitis B, most wealthy countries reviewed by the CDC still recommend vaccination during infancy. Eighteen recommend that babies get their first dose of vaccine by 2 months of age.
    


            However, experts say countries that have delayed the birth dose for babies born to moms who screen negative have key differences with the US — including universal health care for their citizens — that have informed their policies. Changing US policy to align with countries that have different demographics and needs would be shortsighted and risks eroding decades of progress in eliminating a serious infection that can cause cancer and death, they say.
    


            “Countries with at-risk recommendations typically have much smaller populations, often a fraction of the US population, and have health care systems that support constant screening, testing and care coordination,” Dr. Michelle Goveia, who is a former epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC who is now executive director of global medical and scientific affairs at Merck, said in a comment at the meeting.
    


            “In contrast, US health systems face significant challenges in identifying people living with hepatitis B, making the diagnosis of maternal infection and subsequent vaccination of newborn systematically more difficult and likely to lead to congenital infections.”
    


            According to the CDC analysis, no other country in the world that has had a universal birth dose has ever reverted from a universal to selective recommendation. The United States would be the first.
    


            The presentations Thursday on hepatitis B vaccination “are not following science,” Dr. Jason Goldman, a liaison to the ACIP for the American College of Physicians, told CNN.
    


            Studies casting doubt on the need for hepatitis B vaccination and its safety were quoted out of context, and the proposed language for voting on vaccine recommendations “is inappropriate,” Goldman added.
    


            The first vote scheduled for Thursday is whether to remove the universal recommendation that newborns receive a hepatitis B vaccine that's been in place in the US since 1991. Instead, for babies whose mothers haven't tested positive for the virus, the recommendation would move to “individual-based decision-making.” If parents forgo a birth dose, the vote would recommend babies receive the vaccine no earlier than two months of age.
    


            But, Goldman pointed out, “all decisions are individual-based. Nothing is a mandate.”
    


            He compared the nature of the recommendation that all babies receive a dose at birth with one he might make as a physician for other health decisions, such as whether patients should get a colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer.
    


            “I recommend a colonoscopy to a patient. They still have a choice to do it. The evidence shows colonoscopy reduces incidence of cancer,” Goldman told CNN. “Same analogy. I recommend the hepatitis B vaccine. [The] patient can refuse. The evidence shows benefit of [the] vaccine in reducing disease.”
    


            Speaking during the meeting, Goldman said the meeting should be ended now, before a vote.
    


             “You are wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter,” he said. “The best thing you can do is adjourn the meeting and discuss vaccine issues that actually need to be taken up.”
    


            In another departure from past practices, the CDC vaccine committee heard a presentation from Dr. Cynthia Nevison, a research associate at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she is an atmospheric scientist.
    


            One of her research studies, called “Autism Tsunami,” was written with the next ACIP presenter — Dr. Mark Blaxill, who introduced himself as a critic of the CDC who is now working at the agency — was retracted by the journal that published it.
    


            The editors of the journal said the authors misrepresented and selectively cited. or cherrypicked, data and that there were no valid justifications for the mechanisms the authors proposed for prevention.
    


            “This is someone with no hepatitis B expertise and a well documented anti-vaccine bias. They could not find an expert to present on this?” wrote Dr. Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California at San Francisco and a vaccine policy expert who was posting about the meeting on social media.
    


            In her presentation, Nevison, who introduced herself as a contractor to the CDC, suggested that hepatitis B infections had never been a real threat to infants.
    


            Nevison's presentation sought to cast doubt on the importance of the hepatitis B vaccine and on recent modeling evidence that indicated doing away with the birth dose would increase the number of preventable hepatitis B cases and deaths in kids.
    


            “There's very little evidence that horizontal transmission has ever been a significant threat to the average American child, and the risk probably has been overstated,” Nevison said.
    


            Nevison noted that the greatest declines in hepatitis B cases had been among younger adults, ages 20 to 39 — exactly the age group born after the universal birth dose was first recommended in 1991.
    


            Instead, she said the decline in cases in this age group “had to be [due to] other measures.” She said other measures that may have been driving down hepatitis B infections, including better screening of blood products used for transfusion, safer dialysis and the adoption of safer sex practices due to the AIDS epidemic.
    


            In reality, the adoption of screening and recommendations to lower the risk of transmission to infants has been stepwise.
    


            In 1984, the CDC first recommended vaccination of infants born to mothers who tested positive for hepatitis B. Four years later, in 1988, the CDC first recommended hepatitis B screening for all pregnant women. In 1991, the CDC recommended universal hepatitis B vaccination for infants, then, in 2005, the CDC updated the recommendation to specify that babies should get a shot before they leave their birth hospital. In 2018, the recommendation was revised to specify that all infants should get the shot within 24 hours of birth. Nevison failed mention this history in her presentation.
    


            Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth and the only current member of ACIP who has experience on the committee, said he took “strong positions against each of the three presentations.”
    


            “This disease has gone down in the United States thanks to the effectiveness of our current immunization program,” Meissner said.
    


            “The way I look at a neonatal birth dose is that it is a safety net.”
    


            Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by a virus.
    


            After an acute hepatitis B infection, many adults clear the virus. But acute infection can lead to chronic hepatitis B, which is linked to increased risk of liver cancer, organ failure and cirrhosis, or scarring over the liver. People with chronic hepatitis B are 70 to 85% more likely to die early.
    


            Infants and children who are infected with hepatitis B are more likely to develop chronic disease, including about 90% of infants and 30% of children ages 1 to 5.
    


            The hepatitis B virus is extremely infectious. It is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who's not infected.
    


            Certain medical conditions, behaviors and other factors increase an individual's risk of acquiring hepatitis B — including injecting drugs and sexual activity — but anyone can get it. The hepatitis B virus can also be passed easily during childbirth from a pregnant woman to child during either a vaginal delivery or C-section.
    


            Many people with hepatitis B do not have symptoms, and more than half may not be aware of their infection.
    


            The latest data from the CDC shows that there were about 2,200 newly reported cases of acute hepatitis B in 2023, but estimates suggest that the actual number of cases was more than six times higher — closer to 14,400.
    


            The CDC also estimates that about 640,000 adults in the US have chronic hepatitis B.
    


            Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that WHO estimates that 254 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection, with about 1.2 million new infections each year.
    


            There is no treatment for acute hepatitis B, but there are some medications that can be used to treat chronic cases. There is no cure but treatment for chronic hepatitis B can be lifelong.
    


            The best way to prevent hepatitis B infection is vaccination.
    


            Most people who have hepatitis B were infected as infants or young children when their immune systems were not fully developed. Currently, it is recommended that all infants get vaccinated shortly after birth.
    


            Universal vaccination against hepatitis B was first recommended for infants in 1991, and the strategy has been credited with cutting the number of hepatitis B infections in kids from about 18,000 cases a year to an estimated 20 cases a year now.
    


            The hepatitis B birth dose is given to infants within 24 hours of birth, before they leave the hospital. Anti-vaccine activists, including HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have long questioned the necessity and safety of this vaccine, despite decades of evidence supporting it. The virus spreads through bodily fluids — drug use and sex can increase risk.
    


            However, many people do not know they are infected. Everyday activities can also spread the virus, and it's especially easy to transmit to babies during birth.
    


            On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy incorrectly claimed that the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine was linked to higher risk for autism and suggested that the recommendation was made to drive profits for pharmaceutical companies.
    


            “They recommended the hepatitis B vaccines for babies when they're an hour old, the first day of life, they get that. And you know, hepatitis B, if your mother's got it, you should get it. And you can pass through maternal transmission, but every mother that goes to the hospital in this country is tested for it. So we know which ones are vulnerable, which aren't,” Kennedy said
    


            But testing doesn't catch every case.
    


            At the committee's September meeting, CDC scientists reviewed recent studies showing that an estimated 12-16% of pregnant women are not screened for hepatitis B during pregnancy, and fewer than half of infants born to mothers infected with hepatitis B are identified through prenatal screening.
    


            Women are typically tested during their first three months of pregnancy. t's possible to miss maternal infections if a woman catches the virus after she's tested for it. Maternal testing also doesn't protect babies from being exposed to other positive family members or caregivers.
    


            Infectious disease experts say vaccinating every baby provides a critical safety net to catch those at risk when maternal screening misses.
    


            Senator Bill Cassidy, the Republican doctor who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, posted on X Thursday morning that “the ACIP is totally discredited. They are not protecting children.”
    


            Cassidy, who struggled openly with his pivotal vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary, linked to the meeting's agenda and specifically cited a Friday presentation by Aaron Siri, an attorney Cassidy said “makes his living suing vaccine manufacturers. He is presenting as if an expert on childhood vaccines.”
    


            Siri, who's worked closely with Kennedy and served as his personal lawyer during Kennedy's presidential campaign, has handled a number of vaccine-related cases, particularly challenging vaccine requirements. In 2022, he filed a petition on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, a nonprofit that challenges the safety of vaccines and vaccine mandates, for the US Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the polio vaccine used in the US.
    


            A managing partner at the law firm Siri & Glimstad LLP, Siri is scheduled to open Friday's ACIP meeting with a presentation about the childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule.

            In an opening statement at today's meeting, ACIP Vice Chair Dr. Robert Malone said that a vote about the hepatitis B vaccination schedule was postponed at the last meeting because there were gaps in the data that was presented to the committee, and the evidence fell short of what was needed to make a “confident evidence-based recommendation.”
    


            “That decision was not about hesitation or reluctance. It was about standards,” he said. “I want to emphasize this is exactly how the scientific process is supposed to function.”
    


            Since then, a dedicated working group was formed to examine those issues in greater depth. Malone said that he was “not able to disclose the nuance of that work group, but it is quite diverse in membership and represents a full spectrum of opinion regarding hepatitis B vaccination.”
    


            He underscored that the primary mission of ACIP is to provide independent advice to the CDC director, and said that his hope was that the committee approach today's meeting “with seriousness, clarity and a willingness to challenge our own prior assumptions as its credibility depends on our commitment to a deliberative, transparent, evidence-based process.”
    


            Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O'Neill is serving as acting director of the CDC. He assumed the role after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired Director Dr. Susan Monarez earlier this year.
    


            This is the third meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices since HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. — who has long questioned the safety of vaccines while downplaying their benefits — abruptly dismissed all 17 of its sitting members in June.
    


            Kennedy immediately replaced them with eight of his own picks One of his choices, Dr. Michael Ross, dropped out during a mandatory review of each member's financial holdings, leaving seven members on the panel.
    


            In September, Kennedy announced five additional members bringing the committee's roster to 12 voting members.
    


            This week, the reconstituted committee lost its chair, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who was appointed to a new role within HHS: chief science officer for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. During the last meeting, Kulldorff broke an important tie vote when the committee deadlocked 6-6 over a proposed recommendation that people should get a prescription from their doctor before they could get a Covid-19 vaccine, a shift that would have made it more complicated for people who wanted the shots to get them.
    


            That brings the total number of voting members to 11. The new chair is Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who is trained as a pediatric cardiologist. Because Milhoan was joining the meeting remotely on Thursday, the committee's vice chair, Dr. Robert Malone, was facilitating the meeting.
    


            Malone was an early researcher of mRNA technology and has suggested that Covid-19 vaccines cause cancer — something regulatory agencies say is not the case. Malone also served as a paid expert witness in an antitrust lawsuit over Merck's measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, testifying that plaintiffs compensated him at a rate of $350 per hour.
    


            For decades, infants born in the United States have been universally recommended to get the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine as early as the day they're born.
    


            CDC vaccine advisers selected by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, will vote Thursday on whether to change that recommendation, although the strategy nearly eradicated hepatitis B cases among children.
    


Anticipated votes posted online late Wednesday suggest “individual-based decision-making, in consultation with a health care provider” for a “birth dose” of the hepatitis B vaccine when parents have tested negative for the virus or whose status is unknown. For babies not receiving the birth dose, “it is suggested that the initial dose is administered no earlier than 2 months of age,” it says.
    


            A second vote considers whether parents of a child who has already received a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine should work with a doctor to test the level of protection ahead of additional doses.
    


            Here's the voting language:
    


VOTE 1: ACIP recommends a birth dose of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin for infants born to women who test HBsAg-positive. ACIP recommends individual-based decision-making, in consultation with a health care provider, for parents deciding whether to give the HBV vaccine birth dose to infants born to women who are HBsAg-negative or whose HBsAg status is unknown. Parents should consult with health care providers and decide when or if their child will begin the HBV vaccine series. Parents and health care providers should consider vaccine benefits, vaccine risks, and infection risks. For those not receiving the HBV birth dose, it is suggested that the initial dose is administered no earlier than 2 months of age. Y/N



Footnote: Parents and health care providers should also consider whether there are risks, for example, such as a household member is HBsAg-positive or when there is frequent contact with persons who have emigrated from areas where Hepatitis B is common.



VOTE 2: When evaluating the need for subsequent HBV vaccine dose in children, parents should consult with health care providers to determine if a post-vaccination anti-HBs serology testing should be offered prior to subsequent HBV vaccine dose administration. Serology results should determine whether the established protective anti-HBs titer threshold of ≥10 mIU/mL has been achieved. The cost of this testing should be covered by insurance. Y/N



            Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are expected to vote today whether to make a major change to the childhood vaccine schedule.
    


            The members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices were handpicked by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, after he abruptly fired the 17 sitting members earlier this year.
    


            The agenda for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting — which runs today and tomorrow — includes a vote about hepatitis B vaccines for newborns, and more discussion on ingredients and timing for vaccines on the childhood schedule.

            Who's tired of being sick? Me, definitely.
    


            So many family members, friends and coworkers would raise their hands right now, too, if I asked them. Since temperatures dropped across the United States, my family has gotten through some nasty colds and undiagnosed viral infections, bronchitis, and several Covid-19 tests (all negative, thank goodness).
    


            I'm sure Thanksgiving holiday travel has spread all sorts of illness (not that I'm blaming the crowds who joined me at the National Gingerbread House Competition in Asheville, North Carolina). Meanwhile, the appearance of a new flu variant and lagging vaccination rates will probably contribute to a severe flu season, much like last year or even worse.
    


            What should you and I do? I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore's health commissioner.
    


            I know she can't guarantee good health all winter, but I bet she can help to reduce the odds of getting sick, navigate the illness once it does happen (because you most likely will fall ill sometime this winter), and decide when it's time to get medical treatment. And bless you, if you just sneezed.
    


CNN: Do we really fall ill more frequently in winter, or is it just all this travel?



Dr. Leana Wen: We do see more respiratory infections in the winter months. Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consistently shows that illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and many viruses that cause the common cold surge between late fall and early spring. Covid-19 cases also have tended to rise during this period.
    


            There are several reasons for this seasonal pattern. First, colder weather means people are spending more time indoors and nearer one another. Windows are closed, ventilation is reduced, and people gather at school, at work and during holidays. That all creates ideal conditions for viruses to spread.
    


            Second, dry air helps respiratory viruses survive longer in the environment. Studies have shown that some virus particles remain airborne longer and stay infectious longer when humidity is low, which is common in winter months.
    


            Travel adds another important layer. Airports, planes, buses and family gatherings bring together large numbers of people from different places. If viruses are circulating, travel and holidays can accelerate transmission, especially when people go from event to event without knowing that they are contagious. So yes, travel affects spread, but it is working on top of winter conditions that already favor viruses.
    


CNN: How do I reduce my chances of getting sick?



Wen: There is no guaranteed way to avoid illness entirely, but some steps can lower your risk. Vaccination is one of the most effective tools to reduce severe illness. Getting the flu vaccine, the updated Covid vaccine and the RSV vaccine for eligible individuals helps to reduce the risk of hospitalization and severe complications.
    


Respiratory virus season has arrived. What to know about getting this year's vaccines



            Hand hygiene is also key. It's good practice to wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using shared public spaces, after coughing or sneezing, and before eating. Handwashing helps prevent the transfer of viruses from surfaces to your mouth, nose or eyes. When soap and water are not available, alcohol-based sanitizer is a reasonable backup.
    


            If you are in crowded spaces, especially indoors or around people who are coughing or sneezing, a well-fitting N95 or equivalent mask can add a layer of protection. This step is especially important for people at higher risk, including those over 65, people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or lung disease, or those with a weakened immune system. If you're sick, masking can help reduce the odds that your loved ones will get sick.
    


            Ventilation can help, too. Opening windows when possible, improving airflow with fans or using a portable HEPA, or high-efficiency particulate air, filter can dilute airborne viruses. These strategies are especially useful when hosting gatherings inside. If weather permits, outdoor gatherings also substantially reduce infection risk.
    


            Finally, if you are sick, stay home. Reschedule that holiday meal or exchange gifts another day. One of the most important ways to reduce spread is for people to avoid exposing others while contagious.
    


CNN: What do I do if I am sick? Should I get tested?



Wen: Most respiratory infections can be safely managed at home. Rest and drink plenty of fluids, especially if you have fever or congestion, because dehydration can worsen symptoms like headache and fatigue.



            Testing can be helpful in certain cases. People eligible to receive antiviral medications if they have Covid-19 or influenza should test as soon as they have symptoms since it can be helpful to know what's making you sick in case you need to get treatment. Flu and Covid tests, individually and in combination, are widely available over the counter and should be used by those who are medically vulnerable or living with those who are.
    


CNN: What if I have a fever?



Wen: Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can reduce fever and provide relief for symptoms such as headache and fatigue. Here again, hydration is essential. Fever causes the body to lose more fluid than usual, which can lead to dehydration. Drink plenty of water, broth or electrolyte drinks.  



            For babies younger than 3 months, fever should be evaluated by a clinician. You should call the pediatrician right away if a young baby develops a fever greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Parents of children 3 months or older and up to 2 years old should call the child's physician if they have a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit or greater, or if they have had a fever for more than 24 hours without an obvious cause.
    


CNN: What about for older kids and adults? When should they head to the doctor?



Wen: Seek medical care if symptoms last more than a week without improvement. Also, if you start getting better and then suddenly worsen again, it could be a sign that you have a secondary infection, such as a bacterial infection, that needs to be treated. People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease or weakened immune systems should reach out sooner because they are more prone to complications.
    


            Other reasons to contact a health care clinician include trouble catching your breath, persistent wheezing, severe headaches, one-sided ear pain, sinus pain lasting more than a few days or dehydration. And if you are eligible for antiviral treatment, you should also reach out to your doctor as antiviral medications are most effective if prescribed early in the course of illness.
    


CNN: When should I go to the emergency room?



Wen: Emergency care is necessary when symptoms suggest a serious complication or when breathing is affected. Warning signs include difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, severe dehydration, inability to stay awake, bluish discoloration of the lips or face, or symptoms that rapidly worsen.
    


            For infants, additional red flags include difficulty feeding, fewer wet diapers, fast or labored breathing or unusual sleepiness. If you are unsure but concerned about someone's breathing or alertness, it is best to seek emergency care right away.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Fact check: The five wildest conspiracy theories from Trump's late-night posting spree","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/politics/truth-social-trump-fact-check","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:00:58 GMT","


            President Donald Trump promoted a bunch of unfounded conspiracy theories during a late-night social media posting spree on Monday.
    


            Trump wrote or shared more than 150 posts on his Truth Social platform between 9 p.m. and midnight. Many of them were unremarkable political fare, but others were bananas – outlandish conspiratorial tales the president shared with his 11-plus million followers even though they were detached from reality.
    


            Here is a fact check of (arguably) the five wildest.
    


            Trump shared a social media post from notorious conspiracy peddler Alex Jones that said, “WILD: Michelle Obama May Have Used Biden's Autopen in the Final Days of His Disastrous Administration to Pardon Key Individuals, Patrick Byrne Reveals.” Both Trump's post and Jones' post included a video of Byrne – a businessman who has promoted unfounded conspiracy theories about the 2020 election – claiming in an interview with Jones, “I think there were four or five pardons she gave.”
    


            There is no basis for this tale. A fictional story had previously spread among pro-Trump conspiracy theorists on social media that Michelle Obama had snuck into the Oval Office alone during the Biden presidency and “grabbed the autopen” to grant pardons; that simply did not happen.
    


            Trump shared a social media post in which pro-Trump social media commentator Mila Joy wrote, “Jeffrey Zients, Bidens Chief of Staff, says that even though the paper he is reading SAYS he approved the use of the autopen, that he actually DIDNT APPROVE it. Someone else FORGED HIS APPROVAL!” As supposed evidence of a forgery, Mila Joy included a 14-second video clip of Zients testifying before the House Oversight Committee in September about an email related to pardons Biden granted at the end of his presidency.
    


            But the 14-second video left out critical context in which Zients made clear to the committee that the email was not forged.
    


            The video showed Zients being asked about an email that was sent under his name on the last night of Biden's term, which said, “I approve the use of the autopen for the execution of all the following pardons. Thanks, JZ.” It showed Zients being asked, “Did you, yourself, write this email?” and Zients responding, “I do not believe I did.”
    


            The video ends there. But the full transcript of Zients' testimony shows that Zients immediately went on to say that he had authorized his chief of staff Rosa Po to send the email.
    


            He said: “Rosa asked me about, if I approve everything, and I said, yes, and then she did what she did on occasion, which was to send the email, because I was at home, and she was there (at the White House), and time was of the essence.”
    


A key tenet of the QAnon conspiracy movement is that various Democratic and “deep state” perpetrators of crimes against children and the country will be arrested under Trump and face justice before military tribunals. On Monday, Trump shared a post from a QAnon-promoting account that said, “When the Director of National Intelligence tells the public, Obama committed TREASON and President Trump is your President, you can 100% know we will see his MILITARY TRIBUNAL.”
    


            We won't.
    


            Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard did claim in July that Obama and/or top officials in the Obama administration engaged in a “treasonous conspiracy” by creating an intelligence document that Gabbard significantly mischaracterized related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. There is no evidence Obama did anything criminal. But even if he had hypothetically committed some crime for which he did not have presidential immunity, he would not face a military tribunal; the president is a civilian who is not subject to the armed forces' justice system.
    


            Trump has long used false claims to try to blame Democratic former House speaker Nancy Pelosi for the attack on the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters on January 6, 2021. On Monday, he shared a Mila Joy post that said, “Nancy Pelosi's former top staffer said Nancy planned January 6th for two years. Lock her up.”
    


            But that's not what the former Pelosi staffer, Ashley Etienne, actually said.
    


            Mila Joy's post and Trump's post included a 14-second video of Etienne, Pelosi's former communications director and senior adviser, saying in an October interview, “We were planning – when I was working for Pelosi, I don't know that this has ever been made public, or I've never said this publicly – but planning for a January 6th-type of an event two years before it happened.”
    


            She said “planning for,” not “planning”; even that sentence alone should make clear to reasonable-minded viewers that Etienne was saying Pelosi's office prepared in advance to deal with an attack like the January 6 assault, not saying Pelosi orchestrated the assault. And the full video of Etienne's comments includes context that makes her meaning even clearer.
    


            Etienne made the remark about January 6 after saying it is essential for Democrats to anticipate Trump's moves ahead of time. Etienne praised Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek for preparing months in advance to address the president's attempt to send National Guard troops into Portland this year, and she added, “And this is something we did around January 6th. She (Kotek) anticipated that this was going to happen.”
    


            Then Etienne added: “We were planning – when I was working for Pelosi, I don't know that this has ever been made public, or I've never said this publicly – but planning for a January 6th-type of an event two years before it happened. Right? Just understanding the mentality of the president.”
    


            Etienne's words about “understanding the mentality of the president” make it extra-obvious she was attributing the Capitol riot to Trump, not to Pelosi.
    


            No Trump conspiracy-pushing blitz would be complete without some nonsense about the 2020 election he legitimately lost to Biden. The president shared a post from a pro-Trump commentator who called the election “stolen” and who then rattled off a variety of nonsense about supposed election-rigging by machines – including a claim that 51%-to-49% margins of victory are “no coincidence” but occur “because that's the way the programs to steal elections were designed.”
    


            No, they occur because some US elections end 51% to 49%. There is no basis for claims that some nefarious technology is spitting out fake numbers to make US elections look close; the fact is that, in a polarized country with two major parties, they often are close.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will take center stage at Friday's World Cup draw in Washington, rolling out the welcome mat for teams and fans from around the globe at a time when his administration is expanding restrictions on travel to the United States for people from 19 countries and he has hardened his rhetoric against immigrants.

The administration is betting that its push to expedite visa processing for visitors and the excitement about the matchups for next summer's tournament — hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico — will outweigh concerns that Trump's immigration messaging undercuts the theme of global unity that the World Cup is meant to represent.

In the past week, Trump has said he wants to permanently pause immigration from poor countries and he has singled out Afghans and Somalis for particular contempt. The Republican president is also overseeing the signing a peace agreement between Rwanda and Congo on Thursday at an event with leaders from a host of foreign countries and he is expected to be honored for his peacemaking efforts by FIFA, international soccer's governing body, during the World Cup draw.

Critics say the dueling messages are jarring. 

“The Cup is supposed to be a moment when the world comes together, puts aside the differences to celebrate sport, and while it symbolizes the world coming together, you have a president of the United States who is trying to keep the world out, to keep people out,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.




“Right there at the most fundamental level, you have a president who represents everything that the World Cup does not stand for,” Van Hollen said.

But Andrew Giuliani, the executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told foreign reporters Wednesday that “there is a fictional narrative out there that the president is not welcoming to foreigners to come into the United States” and he dismissed concerns about Trump's rhetoric.

“He's a New Yorker like me; sometimes we say things that are a little different than polished politicians say,” Giuliani said.

Trump's administration is preparing to expand a travel ban enacted in June. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday that she plans to recommend a “full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.” 

The restrictions have ensnared two countries that have qualified for the quadrennial tournament — Iran and Haiti. The ban bars entry to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries, and there are heightened restrictions for visitors from seven others.

The ban includes exceptions for World Cup athletes, coaches, “persons performing a necessary support role” and their immediate relatives. Fans, a major source of tourism revenue for any World Cup event, from those banned nations cannot enter. 

Iran has said it will boycott the draw at the Kennedy Center after visas were denied to key members of its delegation. But its soccer federation says the coach, Amir Ghalenoei, will be there with one or two staff members to ensure Iran's seat is not left vacant.

Federation spokesman Amir-Mahdi Alavi told YJC.ir, a news agency affiliated with Iran's state TV, on Wednesday that Ghalenoei's attendance was purely technical and did not amount to walking back the federation's protest.

Alavi said in initially announcing the boycott that federation officials faced visa obstacles that went beyond sports considerations. The White House referred comment on the matter to the State Department, which said the administration is committed to supporting the World Cup while upholding U.S. law and ensuring national security and public safety.

“Part of the delegation got approved and part of the delegation did not get approved,” Giuliani said. “Every single decision is a national security decision.”

The visa denials came despite assurances earlier this year by Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president who has close ties to Trump and is a frequent White House visitor. In October, he told reporters at a European Football Clubs assembly in Rome that “there will be no issues with regard to visas obviously for the participating teams and delegations and so on. And we are working on something for fans, hopefully some good news will come out very soon.” 

The White House has emphasized it is pouring resources to expedite visa processing elsewhere for fans coming to 48-nation tournament, with the majority of the matches held across 11 U.S. cities.

Rep. Darin LaHood, who has participated in multiple FIFA task force meetings at the White House this year and is one of Capitol Hill's most avid soccer fans, pointed to shortened visa wait times as proof of the administration “wanting to make this work and wanting people to come here.”

“I think sports and the World Cup transcends politics,” said LaHood R-Ill. He said FIFA will be part of a new public relations campaign featuring soccer legends emphasizing the welcoming nature of the United States.

“There has to be a welcoming message of people feeling comfortable to come to the United States,” LaHood said. “I think you'll start to see that after the draw and things are set.” 

The State Department has deployed more than 400 additional consular officers to handle global visa demand, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that in about 80% of the world, travelers to the U.S. can get a visa appointment within 60 days. A new system, “FIFA Pass,” allows those who have purchased World Cup tickets through FIFA to get expedited visa appointments. 

Yet there have been very visceral reminders of how the administration's immigration crackdown could interfere with World Cup events. 

During the Club World Cup tournament this summer, Alex Lasry, the CEO of the New York/New Jersey World Cup host committee, noticed official government social media posts warning that federal immigration agents would be “suited and booted” at the matches. Lasry recalled that he immediately flagged the issue to Giuliani, who assured him that the agents' presence would be the same as at any other major event. 

Asked on Wednesday about the possibility of immigration raids at World Cup matches, Giuliani told reporters that Trump “does not rule out anything that will help make American citizens safer.” 

Some fans are already confronting the reality that they will not be able to travel to the United States. 

Rich André, the director of state and local initiatives at the American Immigration Council, is the son of immigrants from Haiti, a “soccer-crazed nation” that qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 50 years. He said many Haitians would love nothing more than to come to the U.S. for the World Cup, but likely will not get the chance. 

“Certainly, they're trying to create a carve-out here so the show can go on,” André said, pointing to the exemptions for athletes, coaches and others close to the team. “But the show doesn't go on without the fans being able to come and cheer their team on in person.”

The information from Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who is now the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, comes at a potentially crucial moment in the unfolding congressional investigation into how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth handled the military operation in international waters near Venezuela. There are mounting questions over whether the strike may have violated the law.

A Navy admiral told lawmakers Thursday that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as Congress scrutinizes an attack that killed two survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters near Venezuela.

Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley “was very clear that he was given no such order, to give no quarter or to kill them all. He was given an order that, of course, was written down in great detail,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, as he exited a classified briefing.

Cotton defended the attack, but a Democrat who also was briefed said that while there was no “kill them all” order from Hegseth, he was still deeply concerned by video of the second strike.

“What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,” Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters. “You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, were killed by the United States.”

Bradley was joined at the Capitol by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for sessions that came at a potentially crucial moment in the unfolding congressional investigation into how Hegseth handled the military operation in international waters near Venezuela. There are mounting questions over whether the strike may have violated the law.

Other news we're following: 








The Republican and Democratic leaders on the Senate Armed Services Committee offered diverging takeaways from the Pentagon inspector general report on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to share sensitive information.

Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair, said in a statement that Hegseth “acted within his authority to communicate the information in question to other cabinet level officials.”

But Wicker said that senior leaders also need more tools to share classified information “in real time and a variety of environments.”

Sen. Jack Reed of Oregon, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Hegseth violated military regulations and showed “reckless disregard for the safety American servicemembers.”

Reed said in his statement that anyone else would have faced “severe consequences, including potential prosecution.”

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney plans to have a brief meeting with Trump while at the Kennedy Center in Washington for the World Cup draw Friday.

Carney's spokesperson Audrey Champoux says Carney will also have a brief meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.

The United States, Canada and Mexico are hosting the 64-nation World Cup next year.

A Navy admiral has told lawmakers that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

That disclosure Thursday comes as Congress scrutinizes an attack that killed two survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters near Venezuela. 

Sen. Tom Cotton told reporters about what he heard from Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley in classified briefing and Cotton is defending the attack. But a Democratic lawmaker who was also briefed says he's deeply concerned by video of the second strike.

The Pentagon inspector general's report released Thursday criticized the use of unapproved messaging apps and devices across the department.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the authority to declassify the material he shared with others in a Signal chat, the watchdog found. But it also says the release of details about the strike on Houthi militants in Yemen violated internal Pentagon rules about handling sensitive information that could put service members or their missions in danger.

The report noted that the information that Hegseth sent — the quantity and strike times of manned U.S. aircraft over hostile territory about two hours to four hours before those strikes — “created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed U.S. mission objectives and potential harm to U.S. pilots.”

Hegseth wrote on social media: “No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission.”

The South Carolina Republican told reporters during a virtual news conference on Thursday that she's going to finish her term but is “100%” frustrated with the slow pace of the House.

Mace was asked about reporting by The New York Times that she is looking to meet with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to discuss following the lead of the Georgia Republican, who has announced she's leaving Congress in January.

Mace said she's expressed her frustrations to House Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she supports and said she expects to outlast recent criticism of his management of the House.

Mace, first elected in 2020, is seeking the GOP nomination for South Carolina governor in next year's elections and is not expected to run for another House term.

Protesters held signs that read “No Collaboration with ICE/DHS” and begged city leaders to create “ICE-Free zones” during a City Council meeting Thursday. It was the second day of a federal immigration enforcement operation in the city.

After public comment was suspended, and protesters refused to yield their time at the podium, City Council members paused the meeting and left the room.

As protesters chanted “Shame,” city police officers ordered them to leave the building. While some protesters complied, multiple others were pushed or physically carried out by officers.

Trump administration lawyers on Thursday accused plaintiffs of “throwing in the towel” with “procedural gamesmanship” after they moved to dismiss their lawsuit over the aggressive tactics of federal immigration officers in the Chicago area.

The coalition of protesters and journalists behind the suit called the dismissal a victory, saying the Trump administration's “Operation Midway Blitz” had largely wound down. But the case was on its way to a skeptical appeals court that had already frozen an order limiting agents' use of force.

“The moment they have to explain themselves to an appellate court, they run for the hills,” said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer says a bill Democrats will bring to the Senate floor for a vote next week would allow for a three-year extension of enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of this year.

Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a vote on a proposal of their choosing as part of a path forward to ending the historic, 43-day government shutdown earlier this fall.

Schumer said every Democrat will support the bill. It's most likely to fail, though.

“Republicans have one week to decide where they stand. Vote for this bill and bring health care costs down or block this bill and send premiums skyrocketing,” Schumer said.

A White House official said Trump would be making the trip Tuesday to discuss ending the inflation crisis he says was inherited from his predecessor, Joe Biden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the trip hasn't been formally announced. It wasn't immediately clear where in Pennsylvania Trump would be visiting.

Last month's off-year elections showed a shift away from Republicans as public concerns about affordability persist. White House officials said afterward that Trump — who has done relatively few events domestically — would put a greater emphasis on talking directly to the public about his economic policies.

The president has said that any affordability worries are part of a Democratic “hoax” and that people simply need to hear his perspective to change their minds — an approach also embraced by Biden, who in early 2024 went to the Pennsylvania borough of Emmaus to take credit for economic improvements after inflation spiked in 2022.

Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff in honor of U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, a West Virginia National Guard member who was shot Nov. 26, blocks from the White House, and later died of her wounds. Trump issued the proclamation “as a mark of respect for the memory” of Beckstrom.

Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, commented after seeing a video of two boat strike survivors in what he said was “clear distress” at a classified morning briefing.

“Admiral Bradley has a storied career, and he has my respect and have the respect of all of us,” Himes said on CNN.

“But what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service. You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel were killed by the United States.”

The Trump administration says it's begun a top-to-bottom review of all ties with Tanzania, citing recent actions by the East African nation that call into question its reliability as a U.S. partner.

The State Department made the announcement shortly before Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president of Tanzania's neighbor Kenya signed a new global health agreement with Rubio praising Kenya's role as a regional and international leader.

In a statement, the department said the U.S. values is partnership with the people of Tanzania but “recent actions by the Government of Tanzania, however, raise grave concerns about the direction of our bilateral relationship and the reliability of the Tanzanian Government as a partner.”

The statement cited repression of religious freedom and free speech, restrictions on U.S. commercial interests in the country along with “disturbing violence” before, during and after Tanzania's disputed Oct. 29 elections. “These actions have put American citizens, tourists, and U.S. interests in Tanzania at risk, and threatened to undermine the mutual prosperity and security that have defined our partnership for decades,” it said.

President Trump's effort to install political loyalists as top federal prosecutors has run into a legal buzz saw lately, with judges ruling that his handpicked U.S. attorneys for New Jersey, eastern Virginia, Nevada and Los Angeles were all serving unlawfully.

Now, another federal judge is poised to consider an argument by New York Attorney General Letitia James that the administration also twisted the law to make John Sarcone the acting U.S. attorney for northern New York.

A court hearing is scheduled to be held Thursday as James challenges Sarcone's authority to oversee a Justice Department investigation into regulatory lawsuits she filed against Trump and the National Rifle Association.

James, a Democrat, is disputing the legitimacy of subpoenas issued as part of Sarcone's probe, which her lawyers say is part of a campaign of baseless investigations and prosecutions of Trump's perceived enemies.

The State Department has renewed a dire warning to Americans against any travel to Venezuela as tensions between Washington and Caracas have spiraled over U.S. military strikes against alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers in the Caribbean and signs that the Trump administration may be preparing for operations inside the country.

In an updated travel alert released Thursday, the department emphasized that U.S. citizens should cancel any plans to visit Venezuela or remain in the country if they're already there “due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure.”

“All U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately,” it added. “Do not travel to Venezuela for any reason.”

The deals will prioritize combating infectious diseases in countries deemed to be aligned with the president's broader foreign policy goals and positions.

The five-year, $2.5 billion agreement with Kenya was signed Thursday by Kenyan President William Ruto and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to replace a patchwork of previous health agreements that had traditionally been run by the U.S. Agency for International Development for decades until the Trump administration dismantled it earlier this year.

The elimination of USAID as a separate agency sparked widespread criticism and concern in the global health community as its immediate impact resulted in the defunding of hundreds of programs focused on the developing world, including cuts to maternal and child care, nutrition and anti-HIV/AIDS programs.

Rubio said the agreement with Kenya “aims to strengthen U.S. leadership and excellence in global health while eliminating dependency, ideology, inefficiency, and waste from our foreign assistance architecture.”

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says the Trump administration is working to ensure that travel is “seamless” for overseas visitors traveling to the U.S. next year for the World Cup.

“If you're watching around the world, we're going to make travel seamless for you as you come into the country,” Duffy said at an event kicking off World Cup celebrations at DOT headquarters in Washington. “We're going to make it as easy as possible so you can come in and enjoy the great World Cup that's going to go off.”

As the tournament nears, there have been concerns that visitors from abroad may be reluctant to visit the U.S. amid an immigration crackdown. The administration announced a plan last month that would allow visitors to get interviews for visas more quickly.

The draw for the World Cup will happen in Washington on Friday.

At least one Republican senator is raising concerns about Kennedy's vaccine committee and the anti-vaccine voices it has platformed.

Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a liver doctor who's been outspoken in support of the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, took to X to post the agenda of the committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. He noted one of the presenters scheduled for Friday is a trial attorney who's worked with Kennedy to sue vaccine makers.

“He is presenting as if an expert on childhood vaccines,” Cassidy wrote. “The ACIP is totally discredited. They are not protecting children.”

Cassidy voted to confirm Kennedy as health secretary earlier this year but the two have repeatedly clashed over vaccine policy.

Adm. Bradley and Caine have just walked into the secure area at the Capitol where top lawmakers will also gather for the closed-door classified morning briefing.

The details about the strike on alleged drug smugglers are crucial as lawmakers question Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon amid concerns about the legality of the strike on survivors in the waters off the coast of Venezuela.

A federal vaccine advisory committee is meeting in Atlanta on Thursday to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine on the day they're born.

The committee, which makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is considering whether to recommend a birth dose of the vaccine only for babies whose mothers test positive. That would mark a return to a public health strategy that was abandoned more than three decades ago — and defy the guidance of many doctor groups that have long recommended the birth dose.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all members of the vaccine advisory committee earlier this year. He replaced them with his own picks, including several anti-vaccine voices. The panel has made several decisions that angered major medical groups.

The first lady says the children are six boys and one girl.

That brings to at least 15 children who've been reunited with their families after they were separated by the Russia-Ukraine war.

Melania Trump announced in October that eight children were back with family following ongoing talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

She had written Putin a letter and had her husband, President Donald Trump, hand delivered it when the leaders met in Alaska in August.

The newest member of Congress won a nationally watched special election in Tennessee this week that helped maintain the GOP's slim grip on power in the chamber.

House Speaker Mike Johnson swiftly swore Van Epps into office, a speedy addition to the GOP ranks — in stark contrast to the seven-week-long delay in swearing in the newest Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Johnson had refused to swear her into office during the government shutdown.

A West Point graduate and former state general services commissioner from Nashville, Van Epps defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn to represent the 7th Congressional District.

Lawmakers have many questions for Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who the White House has said ordered the follow-on strike on the alleged drug boat off the Venezuelan coast that's drawn grave scrutiny.

The military attack reportedly on survivors in the water has led to questions of its legality. Some lawmakers have called on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign.

Bradley is expected to speak to top leaders of the congressional committees handling national security matters during a day of meetings at the Capitol.

Dozens of reporters turned in access badges and exited the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to government-imposed restrictions on their work, pushing journalists who cover the American military further from the seat of its power.

The New York Times filed the lawsuit Thursday against the Pentagon, attempting to overturn new rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that have led to most mainstream media outlets being banished from the building.

The newspaper said the rules violate constitutional freedom of speech and due process provisions, since they give Hegseth the power to determine on his own whether a reporter should be banned. Outlets like The Times walked out of the Pentagon rather than agree to the rules as a condition for getting a press credential.

The Trump administration has instead populated the Pentagon press room with mostly conservative outlets that agreed to the rules, who participated Tuesday in a briefing with Hegseth's press secretary.

“The policy is an attempt to exert control over reporting the government dislikes,” said Charles Stadtlander, spokesperson for the newspaper. The Times filed the case with the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

The FBI has made an arrest in its nearly 5-year-old investigation into who placed pipe bombs in Washington on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Thursday.

The arrest marks the first time investigators have settled on a suspect in an act that had long vexed law enforcement, spawned a multitude of conspiracy theories and remained an enduring mystery in the shadow of the dark chapter of American history that is the violent Capitol siege.

The official who described the arrest spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss a case that hasn't yet been made public. The arrest took place Thursday morning and the suspect is a man, the official said. No other details were immediately available, including the charges the person might face.

The pipe bombs were placed on the evening of Jan. 5, 2021, near the offices of the Democratic and Republican national committees in the District of Columbia. Nobody was hurt before the bombs were rendered safe, but the FBI has said both devices could have been lethal.

The peace signing Thursday will also open access to the region's critical minerals for the U.S. government and American companies.

Lauded by the White House as a “historic” agreement brokered by President Trump, the so-called Washington Accords for Peace and Prosperity between Presidents Felix Tshisekedi of Congo and Paul Kagame of Rwanda follows monthslong peace efforts by the U.S. and partners, including the African Union and Qatar, and finalizes an earlier deal signed in June.

The Central African nation of Congo has been battered by decadeslong fighting with more than 100 armed groups, the most potent being the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. The conflict escalated this year, with M23 seizing the region's main cities of Goma and Bukavu in an unprecedented advance, worsening a humanitarian crisis that was already one of the world's largest with millions displaced.

Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The Trump administration has renamed the U.S. Institute of Peace after Trump and has planted the president's name on the organization's headquarters despite an ongoing fight over the institute's control.

It's the latest twist in a seesaw court battle over who controls the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonprofit think tank that focuses on peace initiatives. It was an early target of the Department of Government Efficiency this year.

On Wednesday, the State Department said it renamed the organization to the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace to “reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history.” The new name could be seen on its building, which is near the State Department.

Trump has spent months openly lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize even though he was passed over for this year's installment — arguing he had a hand in easing a series of conflicts around the world. But Trump has also ordered strikes on suspected drug vessels off the coast of Venezuela and repeatedly threatened that attacks on land could be coming, which would be an act of war against that country.

The family of a Colombian man has filed the first formal challenge to U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats, arguing in a petition to the premier human rights watchdog in the Americas that his death was an extrajudicial killing.

The petition from the family of Alejandro Carranza says the military bombed his fishing boat on Sept. 15, when he was sailing off Colombia's Caribbean coast, in violation of human rights conventions. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights received the complaint Tuesday, and while the Trump administration has said it supports the commission's work, the U.S. does not recognize the jurisdiction of an international court associated with the commission. Therefore, any recommendations that could result from the family's petition would not be binding.

The family's attorney, Daniel Kovalik, said Carranza's four children and spouse want to be compensated as their loved one was their primary breadwinner. He explained that the family chose the commission because of the obstacles that a federal case would face, but the possibility has not been ruled out either.

Henry Cuellar's lawyer said federal authorities have informed him that the Democrat is not the target of an investigation that led FBI agents to search the congressman's South Texas home, Wednesday, April 13, 2022. (Delcia Lopez/The Monitor via AP, File)



Trump pardoned Cuellar and his wife in a federal bribery and conspiracy case on Wednesday, citing what he called a “weaponized” justice system.

Trump, who has argued that his own legal troubles were a partisan witch hunt, said on social media without presenting evidence that Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, were prosecuted because the congressman had been critical of President Joe Biden's immigration policies.

Trump, a Republican, said in a social media post that Cuellar “bravely spoke out against Open Borders” and accused Biden, a Democrat, of going after the congressman and his wife “for speaking the TRUTH.”

Federal authorities had charged Cuellar and his wife with accepting thousands of dollars in exchange for the congressman advancing the interests of an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House.

The Pentagon knew there were survivors after a September attack on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea and the U.S. military still carried out a follow-up strike, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The rationale for the second strike was that it was needed to sink the vessel, according to the people familiar with the matter who spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly. The Trump administration says all 11 people aboard were killed.

What remains unclear was who ordered the strikes and whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was involved, one of the people said. The details are becoming crucial as lawmakers have launched investigations and are seeking to determine whether the U.S. acted lawfully during its military operations.

Hegseth is under growing scrutiny over the department's strikes on alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, and in particular the follow-on strike that reportedly killed survivors. Some legal experts and lawmakers say that the strike would have violated peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict.

The Navy admiral who reportedly issued orders for the U.S. military to fire upon survivors of an attack on an alleged drug boat is expected Thursday on Capitol Hill to provide a classified briefing to top congressional lawmakers overseeing national security.

The information from Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who is now the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, comes at a potentially crucial moment in the unfolding congressional investigation into how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth handled the military operation in international waters near Venezuela. There are mounting questions over whether the strike may have violated the law.

Lawmakers are seeking a full accounting of the strikes after The Washington Post reported that Bradley on Sept. 2 ordered an attack on two survivors to comply with Hegseth's directive to “kill everybody.” Legal experts say the attack amounts to a crime if the survivors were targeted, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are demanding accountability.

Bradley will speak to a handful of top congressional leaders, including the Republican chairs and ranking Democrats of the House and Senate committees on Armed Services, and separately to the GOP chairman and Democratic vice chairman on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Fifty-two-year-old Dinam Bigny sank into debt and had to get a roommate this year, in part because of health insurance premiums that cost him nearly $900 per month.

Next year, those monthly fees will rise by $200 — a significant enough increase that the program manager in Aldie, Virginia, has resigned himself to finding cheaper coverage.

“I won't be able to pay it, because I really drained out any savings that I have right now,” he said. “Emergency fund is still draining out — that's the scary part.”

Bigny is among the many Americans dependent on Affordable Care Act marketplace health insurance plans who are already struggling with the high cost of health care, according to a new survey from the health care research nonprofit KFF.

Most of the more than 1,300 enrollees surveyed in early November say they anticipate that their health costs will be impacted next year if Congress doesn't extend expiring COVID-era tax credits that help more than 90% of enrollees pay for health insurance premiums, per KFF. The possibility of an extension looks increasingly unlikely.

The enhanced premium tax credits set to expire at the end of this year have been at the center of recent tensions in Congress, with Democrats calling for a straight extension and several Republican lawmakers vehemently opposed to the idea. Their inability to agree on a path forward fueled a record 43-day government shutdown earlier this fall.

President Donald Trump and some Republicans in Congress have circulated proposals in recent weeks to offer a short-term extension or reform the Affordable Care Act, but no plan has emerged as a clear winner. Meanwhile, the window for Americans to shop for next year's plans is well underway with less than a month to go until the subsidies expire.




KFF's poll reveals that marketplace enrollees — most of whom say they would be directly impacted by the subsidies expiring — overwhelmingly support an extension. The survey found this group is more likely to blame Trump and Republicans in Congress than Democrats if the tax credits are left to expire.

The expiration of the tax credits — which a separate KFF analysis found will more than double monthly payments for the average subsidized enrollee — comes as Americans are already overwhelmed by high health expenses, the poll shows.

About 6 in 10 Affordable Care Act enrollees find it “somewhat” or “very” difficult to afford out-of-pocket costs for medical care, such as deductibles and copays. That exceeds the roughly half of enrollees who find it challenging to afford health insurance premiums. Most also say they could not afford a $300 per year increase in their health insurance costs without significantly disrupting their household finances.

Cynthia Cox, a vice president of KFF who leads the organization's ACA research, said the population of Americans on Affordable Care Act health insurance includes some high-earning entrepreneurs and small business owners, but the bulk of enrollees are lower-income and therefore vulnerable to even small increases in health costs.

“These are often going to be people who are living paycheck to paycheck, who have volatile or unpredictable incomes as well,” she said. “Increases that many of them are facing are going to be some sort of financial hardship for them.”

Slightly more than half of Affordable Care Act marketplace enrollees believe their health insurance costs will increase “a lot more than usual” next year, according to the poll. About another 4 in 10 anticipate increases that will be “a little more than usual” or “about the same as usual.”

Larry Griffin, a 56-year-old investment banker and financial adviser in Paso Robles, California, already pays $920 a month for his gold-level health plan through the state's insurance marketplace. He says that price will go up to about $1,400 a month next year — alongside jumps in copays and his annual out-of-pocket maximum.

He's concerned the increases will affect his ability to save money for his upcoming retirement, but with the recent amputation of his left leg below the knee, as well as other health issues, he said he can't risk going off health insurance or downgrading his plan.

Griffin is among the roughly three-quarters of marketplace enrollees who say health insurance is “very important” for their ability to access the health care they need.

“I'm not going to say that I can't manage it, I can, but it's just another one of those things,” he said. “Here's, you know, knock number 5,000 against me after all of the other things I've had to deal with.”

Patricia Roberts, 52, a full-time caregiver for her daughter in Auburn, Alabama, received a notice saying her monthly health insurance premiums would rise from around $800 a month to $1,100 a month next year — but she was later notified the monthly cost would actually be more than $1,400, prompting her to look for a downgraded plan.

She said her friends across the border in Georgia are staring down doubling monthly fees next year. 

“I don't know how people are going to live, with it already being a struggle just to pay for food and all the other things,” Roberts said.

The poll shows allowing the enhanced tax credits to expire would be overwhelmingly unpopular with current marketplace enrollees.

Support for continuing the tax credits extends across party lines. Nearly all Democrats and about 8 in 10 independents who are enrolled in marketplace plans say the credits should be extended, as do about 7 in 10 Republicans. Support is similarly high among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who support the MAGA movement, and those who don't.

Yvette Laugier, 56, a Republican in Chicago, said while her income is too high to qualify her for the enhanced premium tax credits, she supports extending them temporarily with additional fraud protections to give lower-income enrollees more time to consider their options.

Among those who think Congress should extend the credits, about 4 in 10 say Trump would deserve “most of the blame” if they were allowed to expire and roughly one-third say that about Republicans in Congress. Democrats in Congress are much less likely to receive blame: only 23% of enrollees say they would deserve the bulk of responsibility.

Bigny, in Virginia, said the blame should be split between both Democrats and Republicans. But he has hope they can come to a compromise and potentially a temporary extension in the coming weeks.

“They should just sit and really look for what's best for American people overall,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Navy admiral told lawmakers Thursday that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as Congress scrutinizes an attack that killed two survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters near Venezuela.

Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley “was very clear that he was given no such order, to give no quarter or to kill them all. He was given an order that, of course, was written down in great detail,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, as he exited a classified briefing.

Cotton defended the attack, but a Democrat who also was briefed said that while there was no “kill them all” order from Hegseth, he was still deeply concerned by video of the second strike.

“What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,” Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters. “You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel were killed by the United States.”

Bradley was joined at the Capitol by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for sessions that came at a potentially crucial moment in the unfolding congressional investigation into how Hegseth handled the military operation in international waters near Venezuela. There are mounting questions over whether the strike may have violated the law.

Lawmakers want a full accounting of the strikes after The Washington Post reported that Bradley on Sept. 2 ordered an attack on two survivors to comply with Hegseth's directive to “kill everybody.” Legal experts say the attack amounts to a crime if the survivors were targeted, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are demanding accountability. 




Among those briefed were the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees and the Intelligence Committee in each chamber. Most of the lawmakers in the briefings declined to comment as they exited.

Congress is seeking answers to questions such as what orders Hegseth gave regarding the operations and what the reasoning was for the second strike.

Democrats are also demanding that the Trump administration release the full video of the Sept. 2 attack, as well as written records of the orders and any directives from Hegseth. While Republicans, who control the national security committees, have not publicly called for those documents, they have pledged a thorough review.

“The investigation is going to be done by the numbers,” said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee. “We'll find out the ground truth.”

President Donald Trump has stood behind Hegseth as he defends his handling of the attack, but pressure is mounting on the defense secretary. 

Hegseth has said the aftermath of an initial strike on the boat was clouded in the “fog of war.” He has also said he “didn't stick around” for the second strike, but that Bradley “made the right call” and “had complete authority” to do it.

Also on Thursday, the Defense Department's inspector general released a partially redacted report into Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app in March to share sensitive information about a military strike against Yemen's Houthi militants. The report found that Hegseth endangered service members by doing that on his personal phone.

At the time of the attack, Bradley was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command, overseeing coordinated operations between the military's elite special operations units out of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About a month after the strike, he was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.

His military career, spanning more than three decades, was mostly spent serving in the elite Navy SEALs and commanding joint operations. He was among the first special forces officers to deploy to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks. His latest promotion to admiral was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate this year, and Democratic and Republican senators praised his record.

“I'm expecting Bradley to tell the truth and shed some light on what actually happened,” said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, adding that he had “great respect for his record.”

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., described Bradley as among those who are “rock solid” and “the most extraordinary people that have ever served in the military.”

But lawmakers like Tillis have also made it clear they expect a reckoning if it is found that survivors were targeted. “Anybody in the chain of command that was responsible for it, that had vision of it, needs to be held accountable,” he said.

The scope of the investigation is unclear, but there is other documentation of the strike that could fill in what happened. Obtaining that information, though, will largely depend on action from Republican lawmakers — a potentially painful prospect for them if it puts them at odds with the president.

Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said he and Wicker have formally requested the executive orders authorizing the operations and the complete videos from the strikes. They are also seeking the intelligence that identified the vessels as legitimate targets, the rules of engagement for the attacks and any criteria used to determine who was a combatant and who was a civilian.

Military officials were aware that there were survivors in the water after the initial strike but carried out the follow-on strike under the rationale that it needed to sink the vessel, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. What remains unclear — and what lawmakers hope to clarify in their briefing with Bradley — was who ordered the strikes and whether Hegseth was involved, one of the people said.

Republican lawmakers who are close to Trump have sought to defend Hegseth, standing behind the military campaign against drug cartels that the president deems “narco-terrorists.”

“I see nothing wrong with what took place,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., as he argued that the administration was justified in using war powers against drug cartels.

More than 80 people have been killed in the series of strikes that started in September. For critics of the campaign like Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the pressing questions about the legality of killing survivors are a natural outgrowth of military action that was always on shaky legal ground. He said it was clear that Hegseth is responsible, even if the defense secretary did not explicitly order a second attack.

“He may not have been in the room, but he was in the loop,” Blumenthal said. “And it was his order that was instrumental and foreseeably resulted in the deaths of these survivors.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Minutes after police approached Luigi Mangione in a Pennsylvania McDonald's, he told an officer he didn't want to talk, according to video and testimony at a court hearing Thursday for the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Although some video and accounts of police interactions with Mangione emerged earlier in this week's hearing, Thursday's session brought new glimpses of the lead-up to his Dec. 9, 2024, arrest in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

Police had been told that a customer at the McDonald's resembled the much-publicized suspect in Thompson's killing, but a pair of officers initially approached Mangione with a low-key tone, saying only that someone had said he looked “suspicious.” Asked for his ID, he gave a phony New Jersey driver's license with a fake name, according to prosecutors. 

Moments later, after frisking Mangione, Officer Joseph Detwiler stepped away to communicate with dispatchers about the license, leaving rookie Officer Tyler Frye by Mangione's table.

“So what's going on? What brings you up here from New Jersey,” Frye asked, according to his body-camera video. 

Mangione answered in a low voice. Asked what the suspect had said, Frye testified Thursday: “It was something along the lines of: He didn't want to talk to me at that time.” 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Mangione later added that “he was just trying to use the Wi-Fi,” according to Frye. 




Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law officers and items — including a gun and a notebook — they allegedly seized from his backpack.

The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.

Thursday's proceedings came on the anniversary of the killing. Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years.

The hearing, which started Monday and could extend to next week, applies only to the state case. But it is giving the public an extensive preview of some testimony, video, 911 audio and other records relevant to both cases. 

Police interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he'd been in New York recently and other questions, including: “Why are you nervous?” 

Officers tried to play it cool and buy time by intimating that they were simply responding to a loitering complaint and chatting about his steak sandwich. Still, they patted Mangione down and pushed his backpack away from him. About 15 minutes in, they warned him that he was being investigated and would be arrested if he repeated what they had determined was a fake name.

After he gave his real one, he was read his rights, handcuffed, frisked again and ultimately arrested on a forgery charge related to his fake ID.

The video also provided glimpses of officers searching his backpack, a matter that will likely be explored further as the hearing proceeds.

Mangione's lawyers argue that his statements shouldn't be allowed as trial evidence because officers started questioning him before reading his rights. They say the items from his backpack should be excluded because police didn't get a warrant before searching it.

Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet detailed their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Federal prosecutors have maintained that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there was nothing dangerous inside, and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.

Many criminal cases see disputes over evidence and the complicated legal standards governing police searches and interactions with potential suspects.

Massachusetts-based dietitian nutritionist Lauren Hubert recommends healthy, protein-packed carbs to help lose body fat and gain muscle.

Living well may have less to do with strict diets and more to do with choosing high-quality foods you enjoy, experts say.

New York-based registered dietitian Kelly Springer, founder of Kelly's Choice, said joyful eating can lower stress, improve digestion and support a healthier relationship with food. That doesn't mean ""indulging without intention,"" she told Fox News Digital — but ""it means choosing foods that make you feel good both physically and emotionally.""

Simon Feldhaus, a Swiss longevity specialist with 30 years of experience, recently told CNBC's ""Make It"" that he doesn't believe in a single ""healthy diet,"" but rather in eating foods that genuinely make people feel good. 

COMMON FOOD MAY BOOST HEART HEALTH WITHOUT CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE

""For me, nutrition, food and eating, it's not a chemical, scientific-based thing, but emotional,"" he said. 

""It's a little bit about science, but it also must be pleasurable for me to eat the fruit. Surely, there are some days where I don't follow these rules, but most of the days I do.""

Staying healthy isn't just about food — it's also about joy and community, said one longevity expert. (iStock)

Below are the foods that experts say can spark joy and support long-term wellness.

Feldhaus centers his meals around quality proteins and fats. While he skips milk, he embraces yogurt. 

""The most important thing is the quality of the food, not really what the food is,"" he said.

Dr. Amie Hornaman, a functional medicine doctor in Pennsylvania, agreed that ingredient quality is ""everything."" ""Your cells are literally built from the food you eat,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Springer recommends paying attention to foods that are minimally processed and to read nutrition labels carefully.

Feldhaus doesn't obsess over which protein is best. What matters most, he said, is the source. For him, that means Swiss beef and locally raised meats. 

Experts recommend buying seasonal, minimally processed foods. (iStock)

""This kind of quality is what I try to get for every food I eat,"" he said.

Springer added, ""High-quality cheeses or meats often contain fewer additives and provide higher nutrient density per serving, which may help with portion control while also providing better fuel for our bodies.""

If it doesn't grow in Switzerland at that time of year, Feldhaus said he leaves it off his plate.

Springer noted that seasonal produce is typically richer in nutrients because it's harvested at peak ripeness. 

""It also tastes better when in season, which may encourage people to eat more vegetables,"" she said. ""Eating seasonally provides greater variety as seasons change, offering a wider range of vitamins and minerals.""

Eating with the seasons helps keep your body's natural rhythm on track, Hornaman added, and that rhythm plays a major role in metabolism and healthy aging.

Feldhaus doesn't ban carbohydrates. Instead, he chooses the ones he genuinely enjoys, such as hearty wheat and dark breads.

Hornaman noted that this kind of approach can make nutritional sense.

""Fast-acting carbohydrates are the No. 1 driver of insulin spikes, and insulin spikes are one of the fastest ways to sabotage metabolism, mood and longevity,"" Hornaman said. 

Most people function better when they anchor meals around protein and fat and incorporate slower-digesting carbs such as whole grains, oats and sweet potatoes as needed for activity and hormonal balance, she added.

Eggs, oily fish and other sources of omega-3s are staples in Feldhaus' diet. He calls egg yolks — rich in lecithin — essential for brain health and longevity. 

Omega-3-rich foods like eggs and oily fish may lift mood and cognitive clarity, according to nutrition experts. (iStock)

""I eat a huge amount of eggs,"" he said.

Omega-3s help reduce inflammation, support brain function and strengthen cell membranes, Springer added.

""This aids in improved mood, cognitive health and overall healthy aging,"" she said.

Hornaman agreed, saying, ""When patients increase omega-3 intake, mood improves, anxiety drops and cognitive clarity comes back online.""

This unusual carbohydrate gives Feldhaus energy without spiking insulin — and he believes it fuels his brain as well.

Joyful eating could support everything from digestion to emotional well-being, according to dietitians. (iStock)

Some small studies suggest galactose may offer a low-glycemic energy source, while other research — particularly in animals — links high doses of D-galactose to oxidative stress and accelerated aging, prompting experts like Hornaman to warn that it's not a ""magic bullet.""

""This may be something that is approached with caution,"" Springer agreed. ""Galactose will be metabolized differently than glucose, with a smaller insulin spike initially, but it still converts to glucose in the liver.""

She added that people naturally consume galactose through high-quality dairy and seasonal produce.

""Longevity relies on consistency,"" she said. ""Choosing high-quality, minimally processed foods, enjoying what you eat and nourishing your body and your mind creates the foundation for lifelong health.""

London researchers have reconstructed a large Roman wall plaster collection, revealing 1,800-year-old frescoes that decorated a high-status building. (Source: MOLA) 

Archaeologists in Northern Ireland went out seeking a 400-year-old castle — and ended up finding things that are much older, thanks to the little kids working with them.

In an October statement, Queen's University Belfast (QUB) said that its archaeologists conducted a two-week excavation to uncover Derrygonnelly Castle in Fermanagh. 

Nearly 250 schoolchildren — some from a girls' Lego construction team — and 35 adult volunteers helped search for the once-magnificent structure that has eluded archaeologists so far.

WARRIORS FOUND STACKED IN ANCIENT WELL REVEAL VIOLENT TALE OF BATTLEFIELD DEFEAT: ARCHAEOLOGISTS

Built in the 17th century, Derrygonnelly Castle was abandoned by the 1800s. QUB professor Eileen Murphy told Fox News Digital the structure ""was erased from the landscape"" and largely forgotten.

During the dig, students found numerous artifacts from the 19th century, including clay pipe fragments, a possible half-penny from the Glorious Revolution and a 17th-century ditch built to protect the castle while it was being built.

Both volunteers and schoolchildren joined archaeologists in a two-week effort to uncover Derrygonnelly Castle's long-lost traces. (Community Archaeology Programme Northern Ireland)

But the most surprising findings were the oldest. These were flint and chert tools from the Early Mesolithic era, over 9,000 years ago.

""The nature of these tells us that these hunter-gatherer people were actually living at this location and probably had a seasonal camp there,"" the professor said.

Murphy described the finds as ""hugely exciting and unexpected.""

She added, ""These are the first Early Mesolithic remains to have been found in County Fermanagh to date.""

The excavation revealed flint and chert tools more than 9,000 years old, such as the one above — surprising even veteran archaeologists on site. (Community Archaeology Programme Northern Ireland)

""To add to the excitement, we also found evidence of a prehistoric round house,"" she added.

""We can date this to the Early Bronze Age period, around 4,000 years ago, because we found a large fragment of diagnostic pottery at the base of one of the post-holes of the house.""

Given that the 17th-century artifacts appear to be high-status items — including the stem of a wine goblet and imported pottery from England — Murphy believes many of them were associated with the castle.

Historical accounts of the castle show that it had a ""pretty garden,"" an orchard filled with fruit trees and a grand three-story tower.

The discovery of a defensive 17th-century ditch offered fresh insight into how the original builders protected the castle. (Community Archaeology Programme Northern Ireland)

""It was fantastic that the volunteers found so many artifacts,"" said Murphy.

""This is an indication that the castle complex would have been a bustling place in its heyday, since it left so many material remains for us to discover.""

Murphy also credited the Community Archaeology Programme Northern Ireland (CAPNI), a National Lottery Heritage Fund initiative, for making the excavation possible.

""It was fantastic that the volunteers found so many artifacts,"" said a professor. (Community Archaeology Programme Northern Ireland)

""It helped give the local people a sense of pride in their landscape.""

She added that she hoped the children involved ""will remember this feeling, and appreciate and care for the monuments they encounter, potentially on their own land, in the future.""

""There was a great sense of camaraderie [during] the excavation, and it seems to have been a positive experience that will have enhanced the overall well-being of those involved.""

""A sudden, senseless loss carries a kind of pain that defies understanding,"" Siena University president Chuck Seifert said in a statement. ""It's hard to imagine anyone more universally loved and admired than Liam. Our community was blessed by Coach Gleason's life.""

Gleason's family started a GoFundMe to help ""ease the burden"" on his wife and three children as they navigated the tragedy.

""The Gleason family has suffered the most unimaginable tragedy with Liam suffering a traumatic brain injury,"" the GoFundMe read. ""Anyone who knows him knows what a light he is in this world. Liam is the best father, husband, brother, son, brother-in-law, uncle, coach, and friend. His heart is as big as his 6'5 frame, and the love he gives to those around him is immeasurable.

""Liam's wife, Jaclyn, and their three beautiful children — Kennedy, Penn, and Tate — who now face a long road of emotional and financial challenges in the weeks, months, and years ahead.""

Gleason coached at Siena for the last seven seasons and was named the conference Coach of the Year in the MAAC and the Eastern College Athletic Conference this past season. Siena was 11-5 overall and earned its first national ranking in 14 years.

Chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram breaks down Republican Matt Van Epps' special election win in Tennessee and what this could signal about 2026 races.

After Republican candidate Matt Van Epps defeated Democrat candidate Aftyn Behn in Tuesday's special election race for Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, both parties cheered the results.

Republicans touted a rejection of far-left radical policies and their ability to retain the GOP-held seat vacated by retired GOP Congressman Mark Green. Democrats, on the other hand, cheered the slim nature of Van Epps' victory in a district President Donald Trump won by more than 20 points last year, as Green did in his last two elections. 

Van Epps won Tuesday night by a nine-point margin.  

DEMOCRATS' SURGE IN TENNESSEE THROWS NEW UNCERTAINTY ONTO GOP'S 2026 HOUSE MAP

""Last night was the latest flashing red light, indicating that Americans are fed up with Republican policies, particularly how much they have to pay for the things they really need,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the race was called. 

""A deep red Tennessee district that Trump won by 22 points, swung by double digits in Democrats' direction.""  

Progressive strategists and organizations described Behn's campaign, despite her loss, as ""amazing,"" ""well run"" and ""great,"" noting she ""gave Democrats in the South and across the country a reason to believe.""

After the results were called, President Trump touted Van Epps as a ""fantastic"" addition to Tennessee's congressional delegation and called the win ""BIG"" for the GOP. The president pointed out that ""Radical Left Democrats threw everything at him, including Millions of Dollars,"" but Van Epps was still able to pull out a victory. 

""Millions of dollars of dark money wasted,"" longtime attorney and legal commentator Mark Pulliam noted. ""Aftyn Behn discovered that Middle Tennessee will not elect lunatic leftists to Congress.""

Behn's campaign was riddled with criticism about her history of radical activism, such as pushing to ""dissolve"" the Nashville police department and defending rioters and looters who took to the streets during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.

""I'm currently involved in a transformative justice seminar, and so it's how to imagine a world without police and what that looks like and what community mechanisms look like,"" Behn said during an interview with a local activist group prior to entering elected office. 

A video of Behn being dragged out of Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee's office by police during an attempted sit-in and comments about how she ""hate[s]"" the city she hoped to represent in D.C., citing her distaste for Nashville's country music scene and other elements that make Nashville a popular city, also haunted Behn during her run.

DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST SAYS TENNESSEE NOMINEE WAS ‘FRINGE OF A FRINGE,' DOMED PARTY'S CHANCES 

CNN's Manu Raju noted in an interview ahead of Tuesday's election how, during her campaign, Behn was dubbed the ""AOC of Tennessee.""

""Aftyn Behn (D) lost tonight's special election in TN, but make no mistake: She's the median Democrat, a lunatic radical progressive,"" CNN conservative political commentator Scott Jennings said of Tuesday night's election results. ""I wouldn't be surprised if Dems continue to run the most Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs candidates they can find.""

Former Congressman David McIntosh, the co-founder of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy and a member of FedSoc's Board of Directors, said Jennings ""nails it"" in his post-election analysis.

""It wasn't exactly a nail-biter, but 9 points is not a landslide,"" The Daily Wire's Matt Walsh pointed out. ""It should have gone Republican by like 40 points yesterday. Looking at it objectively, that's what should have happened when you consider who [Behn] is.""

However, despite the reservations permeating throughout the GOP following Tuesday's election, Trump and other Republican leaders praised the victory.

Republican National Committee Co-Chair KC Crosbie, said Behn ""way underperformed"" Tuesday and said she is hopeful heading into the midterms.

""I've seen a lot of the spin that the Democrats have been trying to put on it today, but if you look at the 2025 special elections, I mean Democrats in 2025 overperformed by 18 points. [Behn] way underperformed last night, and it's because their message is so far off,"" Crosbie said. 

""They are just bowing to the far-left, woke side of their party and people just aren't buying into their message. … So, we feel really good going into the midterms.""     

""Tennesseans voted in this resounding win to reject socialism, to reject the far-left radical ideology and to support common-sense conservatism,"" Van Epps told Fox News following his election victory Tuesday. ""We are so happy with our margin of victory, and I think it's setting the tone for 2026. And we are going to win decisively there and hold the House."" 

""Common sense prevails,"" Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., added. ""We had a great candidate in Matt Van Epps, and you can't deny the Donald Trump effect.""

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has indicated he hopes to swear in Van Epps as soon as this week after his special election win.

Fox News Digital spoke with Sandra Awodele, the creator behind COI Traveler, about what Americans should be wary of ahead of their summer travels to Mexico.

The State Department renewed its ""do not travel"" advisory for Venezuela.

Without edits, the travel advisory was reissued Wednesday, with the State Department citing a myriad of high risks related to crime, terrorism, detention and poor health infrastructure.

""All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately,"" the advisory says.

In 2019, the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Venezuela, closing its embassy. It says it no longer has the ability to provide emergency services or consular assistance to U.S. citizens in the country.

""There is no safe way to travel to Venezuela,"" the advisory states, adding that people should avoid traveling to the country by any means.

Officials state that tourists have a very high risk of being detained if they even accidentally step a few feet over the border.

""Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, are common in Venezuela,"" the advisory reads.

If tourists are detained, the U.S. is generally not informed about the detainee. 

""Travelers face [an] increased risk [if] using unregulated taxis from the Maiquetia Simón Bolívar International Airport and using ATMs in the area,"" it also notes.

Rachel Hoff of the Reagan Institute explains why public support for global engagement, aiding Ukraine and defending Taiwan is rising even as confidence in the U.S. military falls.

A new national defense survey shows Americans are increasingly alarmed by global threats and more willing to see the United States assert leadership on the world stage even as doubts grow about the military's readiness to deter adversaries and win wars overseas.

The 2025 Reagan National Defense Survey, released Wednesday by the Ronald Reagan Institute, found 64% of Americans want the U.S. to be more engaged and take the lead internationally, a clear majority that cuts across political lines.

But that desire for greater U.S. leadership comes alongside a darker view of the Pentagon's capabilities. Just 49% believe the U.S. military can win a war overseas, and only 45% say it can effectively deter foreign aggression.

TAIWAN FM HAILS IMPORTANCE OF US RELATIONSHIP, SAYS GROUP VISITS 'CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE AND STABILITY'

In an interview, Rachel Hoff, policy director at the Reagan Institute and one of the survey's authors, said the public's desire for U.S. global involvement has held steady over the years, but its expectations shift as questions become more specific.

""The American people really do support an engaged American presence on the international stage,"" Hoff said. At the same time, she noted, the public believes the U.S. ""[has] the most powerful military in the world"" and that American superiority ""ultimately leads to a more peaceful and secure world.""

A survey found the U.S. public does not believe U.S. military capabilities are suited to win war.  (U.S. Navy/MC3 Gray Gibson)

The survey's findings underscore an ongoing tension in public opinion. Americans want the U.S. to lead, but they also see a military struggling to maintain an edge over rising authoritarian adversaries.

One of the most notable long-term trends in the survey is the decline in trust in the armed forces. Only 49% of Americans now say they have ""a great deal"" of confidence in the military, down 21 points since 2018.

SENATE MOVES TO REIN IN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S FLUCTUATING UKRAINE POLICY

Hoff said the downturn is broad-based.

""It's happened among Americans of all political stripes, both men and women, people of different age demographics,"" she said. Though the numbers appear to have stabilized in the last two years, the shift marks one of the most significant drops in confidence for any major public institution.

When asked what Americans attribute this erosion to, Hoff said the survey consistently highlights one theme.

""It all has to do with something around kind of the politicization of the military,"" she said. ""The American people really want to keep politics out of the military and keep the military focused on its core warfighting mission.""

Another major finding was support for sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine has risen to 64%, up nine points since last year. Roughly two-thirds of Americans also say they want Ukraine to win the war. And 45% support backing Kyiv until it regains all Russian-occupied territory.

Hoff said the shift reflects a renewed focus on Ukraine's fate and a notable change among Republican voters.

""There's been a real increase in support for sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine,"" she said, adding that it has been ""particularly notable among Republicans.""

She pointed to the political environment under President Donald Trump.

""With Donald Trump back in the White House with his administration leading on peace talks between the Russians and the Ukrainians, we're seeing not just a desire for America to be in a peace-building role, but, in fact, for Ukraine to emerge as victorious,"" she said.

While fewer Americans support fighting until full territorial sovereignty is restored at 45%, Hoff said that nuance doesn't alter the core view that the public sees Ukraine as a friend and Russia as an adversary.

""They want to see peace in the region. … They perceive Ukraine as an ally, they perceive Russia as an adversary,"" she said.

The survey shows a dramatic surge in public backing for defending Taiwan. Sixty percent of Americans now say they would support committing U.S. forces to Taiwan's defense if China invaded, up from 48% last year. (I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty Images)

The survey shows a dramatic surge in public backing for defending Taiwan. Sixty percent of Americans now say they would support committing U.S. forces to Taiwan's defense if China invaded, up from 48% last year.

Nearly every potential U.S. response the survey tested — including sanctions, moving military assets, sending equipment and establishing a no-fly zone — rose by around ten points.

Hoff said the reason is clear: Americans increasingly view China as the United States' primary strategic threat.

""Almost every response to a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan that we poll test … has gone up around 10 points just in the last year,"" she said. ""The American people are really clear-eyed about who our friends are and who our adversaries are.""

This year's survey again shows China as the top perceived threat to the U.S., far ahead of Russia, Iran or North Korea. Rising concern about Beijing's military power, cyber capabilities and global influence appears to be driving the growing support for defending Taiwan.

The study also found support for sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine has risen to 64%, up nine points since last year. Roughly two-thirds of Americans also say they want Ukraine to win the war.

The survey comes as the Pentagon reevaluates its defense strategy and the resources required to counter China and Russia. Hoff said the data provide a straightforward message that the public expects leadership and credible strength.

""The American people see the threats around the world. They understand who our friends and adversaries are. They want the U.S. to lead globally and to stand up in defense of freedom,"" she said. ""They want an American military that's resourced and postured to do so.""

Asked what the Pentagon should take from the findings, Hoff said defense leaders can be confident that the public supports a robust American presence worldwide.

""Americans really want the U.S. to be engaged, to be supporting our allies and partners,"" she said. And they want a military ""poised to balance American interests and advance American interests across each of these regions … to restore deterrence and restore peace.""

Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) will introduce articles of impeachment against War Secretary Pete Hegseth over the follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean.

Thanedar will unveil the articles of impeachment during a press conference on Thursday morning at Union Station.

Hegseth, according to a Washington Post report, ordered personnel to “kill everybody” aboard the drug boat in the Sept. 2 strikes. However, the White House has said Navy Adm. Mitch Bradley delivered the order for a second strike on two survivors holding on to the boat's wreckage following a devastating initial blow.

Democrats have called Hegseth's alleged actions a “war crime” and have called for him to be punished.

Thanedar said on Monday that Hegseth should be impeached.

“Pete Hegseth is utterly incompetent, totally reckless, and a serious threat to US national security. He must be impeached!!” he wrote on X. A later comment in response to a Hegseth post about the boat strikes, which was seemingly intended by the secretary to be humorous, said, “Nothing funny about committing war crimes!”

President Donald Trump, even as others within the Republican Party express skepticism about Hegseth, has justified the secretary's actions as within a war context.

“I think you're going to find that this is war, that these people were killing our people by the millions, actually, if you look over a few years” Trump said. “I think last year we lost close to 300,000 people were killed. That's not mentioning all the families — have you seen what happens with the families?”

Hegseth said Tuesday that he did not “stick around” to see the second strike.

“I watched that first strike live,” Hegseth said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. “As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we've got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour and two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive sight exploitation digitally occurs, so I moved on to my next meeting.”

“A couple of hours later, I learned that the commander had made the decision, which he had the complete authority to do, and by the way, Adm. Bradley made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat,” Hegseth continued.

Once the articles of impeachment hit the House floor, the process will work similarly to how Congress impeaches a president. The House requires a majority vote to pass the articles to the Senate, which will have to vote in favor by a two-thirds majority to convict. If convicted, the person impeached is removed from office.

It is unclear what Thanedar is charging Hegseth with, but it is likely to be related to the strikes.

Immigration isn't breaking our society. We are.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

During a White House meeting on Tuesday, surrounded by his Cabinet, President Donald Trump referred to Somali immigrants as “garbage” and said, “We don't want them in our country.” No one in Trump's Cabinet stood up to this expression of gutter racism, although Vice President J. D. Vance enthusiastically banged on the table. The president's remarks were ostensibly in response to real events—in Minnesota, dozens of members of the Somali diaspora have been implicated in fraud related to social services—but the community does not bear responsibility for the actions of those individuals.

Similarly, white Americans as a whole are not responsible for Trump largely dismantling the federal government's capacity to fight white-collar crime and corruption, his doling out of pardons for people who donate money or commit crimes on his behalf, or his scandalous profiteering. I don't believe that there is something inherent in white culture that causes Trump to act this way; he is simply a particularly reprehensible human being.

The next day, at an Oval Office event, Trump again disparaged Somalis, claiming that Somali immigrants have “destroyed our country” and that the Somali American congresswoman Ilhan Omar “should be thrown the hell out of our country.” None of the people around him had the courage to ask whom “our” referred to. Given the president's plunging approval ratings, one wonders whether these slurs are yet another attempt to shore up his support through appeals to racism.

Watching Trump's repeated attacks on Somalians—the latest group of Black immigrants to be targeted by the president—I can't avoid the conclusion that the government of the United States of America is in the hands of people who believe that they can apply a genetic hierarchy to humanity, and that American laws and customs should recognize and serve that hierarchy.

This commitment is most visible in the Constitution-shredding program of mass deportation being carried out across the country by federal agents, who, in order to meet their quotas, are arresting and deporting immigrants who have been following the rules and showing up for their court dates, rather than those committing crimes. Gregory Bovino, a top Border Patrol commander, told a reporter outright that agents were arresting people based in part on “how they look.” This is racial profiling—a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection—and yet it has been condoned by the right-wing majority on the Supreme Court. In September, an emergency-docket decision effectively legalized racial profiling by lifting an order preventing it. Although “apparent ethnicity alone” isn't enough to detain someone, it can be “a “relevant factor,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a lone concurring opinion, calling that only “common sense.”

After the horrendous shooting of two members of the National Guard by an Afghan immigrant last week, Trump declared on Thanksgiving Day his intention to halt immigration from “Third World” countries, a neuron-thin euphemism for nonwhite immigrants. His remarks about Somalis being “garbage” are consistent with his referring to African nations and Haiti as “shithole” countries in his first term. Trump also announced an intention to strip U.S. citizenship from “migrants who undermine domestic tranquility,” and to “deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization”—arbitrary, subjective criteria that could serve as pretext for denaturalizing anyone for any reason.

The Trump adviser Stephen Miller, a fervent supporter of the racist and anti-Semitic immigration restrictions of the 1920s, declared on X that “migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” Miller's contention that one's supposed inferiority to and incompatibility with Americans are inherited and unalterable is consistent with Trump's past remarks about how immigrants with “bad genes” are “poisoning the blood” of the nation.

The logic of this racism is relatively simple—the individual bears the guilt of the whole, and the whole bears the imprint of some alleged crime that deserves collective punishment. Blaming the egregious behavior of men such as Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on their German or Norwegian backgrounds would sound comical to the same people who treat the president vomiting out similar generalizations about Somalis as sound observation.

That a crime by an Afghan former CIA recruit or Somali fraudsters can be laid at the feet of all “Third World” immigrants shows how arbitrarily such lines are drawn. What matters is not what individuals do, but who they are, and whether or not they fit Trump and Miller's narrow, racially defined view of who Americans can be. Whatever individualism used to mean to American conservatives, their movement is now led by adherents of the most foul collectivism humanity has ever known.

Among the original English settlers, of course, were not only religious refugees and indentured servants but criminals Britain did not want. Many German immigrants to the United States came after the failed liberal revolutions of 1848. Irish immigration was spurred by famine and British imperialism; Italian immigration was driven by the bloody post-unification chaos and, especially in the south and Sicily, by lawlessness, brigandage, and Piedmontese repression. Let us not forget the Eastern Europeans, among them Jewish families—including Miller's own—who fled the autocratic regimes and ethnic violence of their homelands.

Most Americans of European descent are the children of such “broken” societies, by one standard or another, and America would not have become wealthy and powerful without them. No reason beyond bigotry exists to apply different standards to immigrants because they came from Nigeria or Mexico instead of Ireland.

There is a difference between inheritance and action. I cannot help who my ancestors are, but I can make my own choices. That so many Americans chose to place in power a man who holds people in contempt on the basis of race, religion, and national origin; that so much of the mainstream media conveys this bigotry through tired, obfuscating euphemisms; that there is so low a political price for the president's racism that he and those around him see little risk in its expression—well, that does say something about America, and Americans. Immigration isn't breaking our society. That's a job Americans can do on their own.

Hamm v. Smith is a death penalty case, but it could have big implications for anyone accused of a crime.

Nearly a quarter century ago, in Atkins v. Virginia (2002), the Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional to execute offenders with an intellectual disability. Next Wednesday, however, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a new case, Hamm v. Smith, which tests whether the Court's current Republican majority wishes to retain this limit on capital punishment.

The most likely outcome in Hamm is probably a decision giving states more leeway to execute people with marginal claims that they are intellectually disabled — “borderline” cases where clinicians might disagree on whether the offender should be diagnosed with an intellectual disability. But at least some members of the Court have signalled that they would like to go much further.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

In Bucklew v. Precythe (2019), five Republican justices seemed to endorse a radical reshaping of the Court's approach to the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments.”

For about six decades, the Court has held that this amendment “must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Thus, as a particular punitive practice became less common and less accepted within modern American society, it stood on increasingly dubious constitutional ground. Atkins, for example, pointed to the “large number of States prohibiting the execution of [intellectually disabled] persons” to justify its conclusion that these individuals may not be killed by the state.

In Bucklew, however, Justice Neil Gorsuch's majority opinion ignored this “evolving standards of decency” framework, instead suggesting that courts must ask whether a particular punishment had fallen out of favor “by the time of the founding.” While that distinction might seem esoteric, the implications are breathtaking.

Among other things, this historical approach would likely lead the Court to overrule past decisions holding that the Constitution forbids excessive punishments for relatively minor crimes. So jaywalkers, small-time drug offenders, or a driver who does not come to a complete stop at a “STOP” sign could all be sentenced to life in prison.

Though it's not at all clear that a majority of the Court will go that far, it is very likely that the Eighth Amendment will emerge smaller from the Court's decision in Hamm, potentially diminishing the legal protections against bizarre or excessive punishments that all Americans enjoy.

The Court's right flank has criticized Atkins from the day it was decided, and that right flank now controls six seats on the nine-justice Court. It also doesn't help that the death row inmate at the heart of Hamm's claim that he is intellectually disabled is genuinely marginal.

So the Court won't even have to reach very far to decide that he should be executed.

Joseph Clifton Smith was sentenced to death for a 1997 robbery and murder. He claims that he cannot constitutionally be executed because he has an intellectual disability.

Courts hearing Atkins claims are supposed to apply the clinical definition of intellectual disability, and one of three factors that clinicians look at when diagnosing an intellectually disabled patient is their IQ score. Broadly speaking, clinicians look for an IQ of 70 or below when diagnosing such a disability. Although, because IQ tests have a margin of error, recent editions of the diagnostic manual for mental disorders indicate that “a score of 65–75 (70 ± 5)” is often consistent with intellectual disability.

Smith has taken five IQ tests, and he scored 75, 74, 72, 78, and 74 on those tests.

Under current law, the fact that Smith has never scored below 70 on an IQ test is not fatal to his claim that he has an intellectual disability. A recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders warns that someone “whose IQ score is somewhat above 65–75 may nevertheless have such substantial adaptive behavior problems…that the person's actual functioning is clinically comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score.”

Similarly, the Supreme Court held in Hall v. Florida (2014) that “intellectual disability is a condition, not a number,” and thus states that wish to determine if a particular individual may be executed “must afford these test scores the same studied skepticism that those who design and use the tests do, and understand that an IQ test score represents a range rather than a fixed number.”

Thus, despite Smith's IQ scores, the lower federal courts that heard Hamm determined that Smith is intellectually disabled based on his “significant deficits in social/interpersonal skills, self-direction, independent home living, and functional academics.”

But Hall was also a 5-4 decision, and the majority included retired Justice Anthony Kennedy and the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom were replaced by Trump appointees. So it is far from clear whether the Court's new majority will care what Hall had to say about the death penalty.

It's also safe to say that Smith's Atkins claim is far from a slam dunk. The tools that clinicians use to diagnose mental disorders are often imprecise, in part because they do not need to operate with mathematical precision. The actual differences between a child who has an IQ of 69 and a child with an IQ of 71 are quite small, and both children may be given nearly identical education plans while they are still in school — regardless of whether each is diagnosed with an intellectual disability.

But, because Atkins sets up a rigid binary between people who are intellectually disabled (and thus cannot be executed) and people who are not (and thus can be executed), Smith's life depends on very small distinctions. And the Supreme Court can doom him by reaching the entirely plausible conclusion that he just barely qualifies as not disabled.

To some extent, Hamm turns on a real tension within the Court's current decisions applying Atkins. On the one hand, while Atkins did hold that executing intellectually disabled offenders is unconstitutional, it gave the governments in states where the death penalty is still legal a fair amount of leeway in how they implement this holding. “[W]e leave to the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction” against executing the intellectually disabled, the Court said in Atkins.

More recent decisions, however, insist that states must follow clinical standards when determining which offenders are intellectually disabled. These rulings also warn that states must not be given too much control over this determination. “If the States were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished,” Hall warned, then “the Court's decision in Atkins could become a nullity.”

Before Gorsuch joined the Court in 2017, the Court's internal fights over Atkins frequently turned on this tension between deferring to states and ensuring that death penalty states use clinically rigorous standards. Dissenting in Hall, for example, Justice Samuel Alito accused the majority of striking “down a state law based on the evolving standards of professional societies, most notably the American Psychiatric Association (APA).”

He argued that courts should look at “laws enacted by state legislatures” in death penalty states to determine whether states may use a particular method to determine if someone is intellectually disabled. Under Alito's approach, each state should be allowed to decide how it determines who is intellectually disabled, unless a state uses a highly unusual method that is rejected by nearly every other state where the death penalty is legal.

In its brief to the justices in Hamm, Alabama, the state that sentenced Smith to death, similarly argues that courts should be more deferential to states in Atkins cases.

Yet, while Alito's approach would likely enable states to undermine Atkins, Alito at least attempts to fit his preferred rule within the broader “evolving standards of decency” framework that the Court has applied in Eighth Amendment cases since the mid-20th century. Alito's position is that courts should determine what these evolving standards are by looking at how pro-death penalty states actually apply the death penalty.

In Bucklew, however, Gorsuch took a much more radical approach.

Bucklew asked whether states may use a particular method of lethal injection that can cause inmates to feel a great deal of pain before they die. Gorsuch's opinion holding that states could use this method did not explicitly overrule the Court's previous decisions applying the “evolving standards” framework. Instead, it seems to exist in an entirely different legal universe — ignoring past decisions altogether to apply Gorsuch's preferred historical approach.

Though Gorsuch did name some execution methods, such as “disemboweling” or “burning alive” which he does think are unconstitutional, he wrote that these methods are not allowed because “by the time of the founding, these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become ‘unusual.'” Thus, the question was not whether a particular punishment is cruel and unusual today, but whether it was considered cruel and unusual nearly 250 years ago.

If the Court embraces this approach, it would likely mean the end of most modern-day restrictions on cruel or excessive punishments. Dissenting in Atkins, for example, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that only “severely or profoundly” intellectually disabled people are protected against execution. One of Scalia's sources suggests that only people with an IQ of 25 or below are protected by the Eighth Amendment from execution.

More broadly, Scalia argued that the Eighth Amendment only forbids “always-and-everywhere ‘cruel' punishments, such as the rack and the thumbscrew,” and does not prevent the government from imposing excessive punishments for minor crimes. If the Constitution permits the state to execute murderers, then it may also impose the death penalty for lesser offenses such as shoplifting or driving over the speed limit.

Hamm, in other words, does not simply threaten constitutional protections for people with intellectual disabilities. It could potentially revolutionize the Court's approach to the Eighth Amendment and permit very steep penalties for very small crimes.

It is unclear whether the Court actually has five votes to bring about such a revolution. While all five justices who formed the majority in Bucklew remain on the bench, the Court hasn't taken any systematic steps to dismantle the “evolving standards” framework since Bucklew was handed down in 2019. It's possible that at least some members of the Bucklew majority joined Gorsuch's opinion because they agreed with the result, while still harboring some qualms about his broader theory of the Eighth Amendment.

But, at the very least, it is unlikely that the justices took up Hamm because most of them are satisfied with the framework laid out in Hall.

How political does a political movie need to be?

One Battle After Another is, perhaps, too on the nose. Paul Thomas Anderson's epic depicts past and present revolutionaries fighting back against a heavily militarized, white-supremacist regime that seemed to mirror reality in the United States when the movie hit theaters in late 2025. Characters rescue immigrants from detention centers, bomb the office of an anti-abortion politician, and engage in explosive standoffs with the police.

But according to its auteur, One Battle After Another is not a manifesto. Nor was the script, which he started working on two decades ago, intended to challenge the particular moment. The film is loosely based on the 1990 Thomas Pynchon novel Vineland, a dark satire set just after Reagan's reelection. Anderson has said that the film depicts the timeless nature of fascism but that he was more focused on the journey of its characters. He hasn't credited Trump as an inspiration for the film.

“The biggest mistake I could make in a story like this is to put politics up in the front,” Anderson told the Los Angeles Times.

Still, questions over whether One Battle After Another is radical enough persist online. It's just another example of a growing tendency for audiences to pigeonhole films politically, regardless of their text or the filmmaker's intent. People expect a straightforward and instructive political message and then judge the work by that metric.

Art, of course, can be a powerful vehicle for politics, and audiences are free to extract political commentary from movies. However, these analyses have recently digressed into more reductive takes and, consequentially, misguided demands.

Many fans claimed that this year's Superman blockbuster is anti-Zionist with its warring countries representing Israel and Palestine, even though director James Gunn has denied this interpretation. Since being adapted to screen with a diverse cast, fans are narrowing the politics of Wicked, which has been on Broadway for over 20 years, down to a critique of white feminism. On the flipside, critics denounced After the Hunt, a film about a college student's sexual assault allegation against a professor, for supposedly not being direct enough in its commentary on the #MeToo movement and cancel culture.

As politics have become an inescapable part of daily culture, people are desperate for movies to telegraph their specific worldview.

“People have become obsessed with categorizing films as morally good or bad in order to neatly insert them into the wider political discourse,” says film critic and programmer Jourdain Searles. “Films aren't message delivery machines.”

But not every piece of culture intends to “take a side” or make a bold political statement. This myopic way of consuming films might be useful in a debate online, but it's not how you get the most out of a movie.

The second Trump administration has dedicated much of its authoritarian efforts to dissenting voices in the media and the arts. It's understandable that audiences would seek films that challenge the status quo, even if they politicize movies that didn't set out to be political statements.

After all, the idea that movies can speak to the current moment is “as old as Hollywood itself,” according to Montclair State University assistant professor Joel Penney. Look no further than propaganda films like D.W. Griffith's 1915 pro-Ku Klux Klan epic The Birth of a Nation or, later, Charlie Chaplin's 1940 comedy The Great Dictator.

For nearly 50 years, movies with overtly political themes weren't hard to find. In the 1960s and ‘70s, there was a surge in countercultural and independent movies, many of them made by Black independent filmmakers addressing systemic racism. The '70s, in particular, commented on the Nixon era with political thrillers, like All the President's Men, The Conversation, The Days of the Condor, and The Parallax View, all of which grappled with the weakness of political leaders and the disappointment of politics.

By the '80s and '90s, director of George Washington University's film studies department Elisabeth Anker says Hollywood saw a huge rise in movies “taking place in the walls of Congress” about political leaders and how power works, including The American President, Nixon, JFK, and Wag the Dog.

In the early 21st century, the extent to which movies took on political subject matter waxed and waned based on public consensus around certain issues and figures and what studios think will make the most money. For example, Kathryn Bigelow's 2008 Iraq war film The Hurt Locker and her controversial 2012 follow-up Zero Dark Thirty, about the CIA's hunt for Osama Bin Laden, were box-office successes and eventual Oscar winners.

“Hollywood appears to have largely stopped making political movies,” wrote Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz of the current landscape in a CBS News column, citing studio executives' aversion to risk and controversy. This is despite how much politics have dominated the culture in the wake of Trump's election in 2016. (Adam McKay's Dick Cheney biopic Vice, from 2018, and his 2022 climate satire Don't Look Up stick out as rare examples.)

Mankiewicz points to The Apprentice as an example of what can go wrong. The 2024 Donald Trump biopic had trouble finding distribution, particularly after Trump threatened legal action. The 2020 film The Hunt, which depicted elites hunting “deplorables” for sport, was also censored after backlash from Trump. After the president denounced the film on social media, Universal removed the movie from its release schedule, before sending it straight to streaming.

“The Trump era has definitely made studios more cowardly about direct political work that implicates the right for its escalating bigotry and politicians, in general, for being directly responsible for the poverty and strife in this country,” says Searles.

So it makes sense that, with fewer choices of films that directly tackle systems of power, moviegoers want to find messages that meet our historical moment — even if those messages aren't actually there.

To be clear, this isn't just a tendency of progressive moviegoers. This hunt for social and political messaging is far more extreme on the right. Regardless of the topic or genre, conservatives have been particularly aggressive about misreading films for political ends, launching outlandish attacks against mainstream movies as a way to insert themselves into pop culture. The past few years have seen pundits, like Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson, categorize anything from The Super Mario Bros. Movie to Disney's live-action The Little Mermaid as “woke” propaganda for casting people of color or containing female-empowerment storylines. It amounts to ragebait, but it seems to be having an influence on how movies are discussed on social media.

None of this means that critics or audiences aren't allowed to take issue with the content of films like One Battle After Another or After The Hunt and find them underwhelming. But we limit the possibilities of movies and filmmakers when we expect them to provide an answer to our current moment rather than tell their own stories in a way that's captivating and meaningful. One Battle After Another, “only falls short politically if you expect any fictional political story to bear the weight of this country's entire history,” says Searles.

“It isn't mainstream cinema's job to provide a clear or coherent political message to the audience,” says Searles. “These are stories about people, and we are watching them live their lives, just as we do.”

Bring back outdoor recess!

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

At about 10 am local time on school playgrounds across the United States, kids are climbing on jungle gyms and whooshing down slides. They're playing bandage tag or foursquare. They're walking around the track, quietly catching up with their friends.

Those are the lucky ones. Recess, experts agree, is one of the most crucial parts of a child's school day.

“When kids get to play, and especially outside, they get to feel joy, they get to feel connection, they get to feel like they belong at school,” Elizabeth Cushing, CEO of the nonprofit Playworks, told me. “That's the kind of experience we all want for them.”

But parents and advocates around the country say that, too often, kids are now spending recess in their classrooms, where they don't get the full benefits that outdoor play can provide.

In Western states, extreme heat is increasingly keeping kids indoors, said Allison Poulos, a professor at Arizona State University's College of Health Solutions. In one study conducted from July to September — the hottest months of the year in Arizona — her team found that kids were inside for recess about 40 percent of the time.

In colder areas, a variety of factors are at play. “We've heard a principal say he didn't want the kids messing up the playground,” said Shanée Garner, executive director of Lift Every Voice Philly, a parent organizing group. “We've heard some folks say there's no staffing. We've heard other folks say that the kids don't get along with each other.”

When kids have recess inside instead of on the playground, they're typically sedentary and often watching a movie, experts told me. In the Arizona study, kids who had recess in their classrooms were less ready to learn when lessons resumed than kids who actually got to play outside.

Now, families around the country are pushing for more outdoor time, and researchers are exploring ways that schools can get kids outside — or at least get them more active indoors — as the climate changes. These changes are necessary, advocates say, because without play, kids can't learn.

“Recess is a very important period and time for children's growth and development,” Poulos told me. “We have to be thinking of this and taking this seriously.”

Recess isn't just a break from class; it's also a time when kids practice the social and emotional skills they'll need throughout their lives. During play, kids learn “how to collaborate, how to communicate, how to resolve conflict,” said Rebecca London, a sociology professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who has worked on recess research. They also learn emotion regulation: “If I lose a game, can I keep it together and keep playing?”

Free play is critical to children's development, and for some kids, recess is “the only unstructured play they have any time in their day,” London said.

Recess in general suffered after the introduction of high-stakes testing with No Child Left Behind in 2001, as educators came to believe that kids needed as much instructional time as possible to increase test scores, London said. Average weekly recess time declined by 60 minutes between 2001 and 2019 to just 25 minutes a day.

A few states, like California, have passed laws setting a minimum amount of recess time for kids, but they don't necessarily require that time to be spent outside. Meanwhile, as extreme heat becomes ever more common as a result of climate change, kids around the country are routinely facing temperatures over 100 degrees at recess time. Moreover, many playgrounds are exceptionally bad places to be when it's very hot out; they often have minimal tree coverage and are made of materials like blacktop that can become dangerously hot to play on, Poulos said.

In many parts of the US, poor air quality from wildfires is also becoming an issue. In California, “there could be days or even weeks where kids cannot be outside because the air quality is so bad,” London said.

Unlike summer heat, winter temperatures are getting milder across much of the US. However, severe storms and unusual cold snaps are becoming more common, potentially disrupting kids' outdoor time.

Temperature thresholds for outdoor recess vary from district to district, and it's sometimes left up to individual school administrators to decide how cold is too cold. “I've been to places where the cutoff is 35 degrees, and I've been to places where the cutoff is 10 degrees,” London said.

Parents at some schools have complained that, even on mild winter days, kids aren't getting outside. “There are constant excuses, whether it is too wet or students don't have the right clothes,” one mom said during a school board meeting in Worcester, Massachusetts, last March.

Beyond the weather, schools sometimes struggle to recruit or train enough aides to supervise kids outside. Recess and lunch monitors “are some of the lowest paid folks in the entire school district,” Garner said.

Often, “the adults who are in charge of recess are not given any training, any support,” Cushing said. When recess monitors aren't trained in conflict resolution and facilitating play, fights become more common, and schools may keep kids inside to limit the chaos.

But the lack of training and attention for recess staff is a symptom of a larger deprioritization of children's fun and autonomy, some say. Schools have lost “an understanding that kids are going to play,” Garner said. Instead, “kids are expected to be managed.”

When kids are inside, that play is dramatically limited, experts say. Most elementary schools don't have a gym, Poulos told me. Instead, they're usually in their classrooms, where they miss out on movement, the chance to socialize with kids who aren't in their class, and the opportunity to choose where they go and what they do.

“Indoor recess is not the same as outdoor recess,” London said.

Around the country, children in lower-income areas, cities, and districts that serve a higher percentage of families of color have less access to outdoor recess than their counterparts in more affluent, suburban, or predominantly white areas, London said. One 2019 investigation of Seattle public schools by KUOW came to a stark conclusion: “White kids typically get more recess. Black kids get less.”

But, advocates and researchers are working to make outdoor recess — or at least a reasonably active alternative — available to all kids. Some schools in colder areas have large shelters on their playgrounds to protect kids from rain, London said. Such shelters could also be constructed in hotter climates to provide shade.

Arizona State University has partnered with the city of Tempe and other groups to plant trees in schoolyards. Meanwhile, some schools are removing blacktop and replacing it with native plants or other ground cover. And if recess has to be indoors, principals have given students a bit more flexibility by designating certain classrooms for certain activities and allowing students to move between them, Poulos said.

Beyond facilities improvements, simple training for recess monitors can help reduce fights, Cushing said. Even something like having monitors use rock, paper, scissors to resolve disputes can help cut down on conflict.

When school leaders see the benefits of a well-run recess, including students who transition more quickly back to class, “they're more likely to accept the drizzle,” Cushing said.

Others are pushing for policy change at the district level. In Philadelphia, Lift Every Voice has called for an end to 12 damaging practices in schools, including withholding recess.

For Garner, the issue is simple: “Kids are kids, and they should be treated like human beings, not like bots.”

Officials in Los Angeles say families' fear of ICE raids is discouraging them from enrolling their children in school, contributing to a significant enrollment drop in the district.

The first year of the Trump administration has been devastating for education research, Jill Barshay writes for the Hechinger Report: “Rebuilding confidence in federal data — and recovering the institutional knowledge lost in a single chaotic year — will take far longer than the dismantling.”

After more than 40 years of studying AI, UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell hasn't mellowed.

The man who co-authored ""Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach,"" the world's most authoritative textbook on AI, now spends up to 100 hours a week trying to avert what he sees as a historic crisis — one that could leave almost the entire global population without work.

Russell, one of the world's most influential AI researchers and a recipient of the OBE — a royal honor awarded by the UK — for his contributions to computer science, told British entrepreneur Steven Bartlett on the ""Diary of a CEO"" podcast posted on Thursday that the economic shock ahead is far bigger than governments realize.

Russell said political leaders are ""suddenly staring 80% unemployment in the face"" as AI systems accelerate toward replacing abilities once reserved for the highest-skilled humans.

""AI systems are doing pretty much everything we currently call work,"" he said. That includes fields once believed to be safe from automation.

""Anything you might aspire to — you want to become a surgeon — it takes the robot seven seconds to learn how to be a surgeon that's better than any human being,"" he added. 

He suggested that sectors once considered safe — from driving and logistics to accounting, software engineering, and even medicine — are likely to be swept up in the coming wave of automation.

Russell joins a growing chorus of AI experts and tech leaders in forecasting historic levels of job displacement.

While Andrew Yang has warned AI could wipe out 40 million US jobs in the next decade, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has predicted up to half of entry-level white-collar roles could disappear within five years.

Others, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun, Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist, believe AI will transform work rather than erase it.

The disruption won't stop at the top. Russell said even senior executives won't be spared.

""Pity the poor CEO whose board says, 'Unless you turn over your decision-making power to the AI system, we're going to have to fire you because all our competitors are using an AI-powered CEO and they're doing much better.'""

Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have both echoed these thoughts in recent interviews. 

""I think what a CEO does is maybe one of the easier things for an AI to do one day,"" Pichai told the BBC last month. 

Companies are already cutting jobs because of AI.

HP, IBM, Salesforce, and Klarna have also cited AI as a factor in sweeping layoffs or workforce reductions announced over the past year.

""Even the giant AI companies will have few human employees in the long run,"" Russell said.

Russell believes that even if AI advances safely, the bigger challenge may be psychological. Humans derive purpose from striving, problem-solving, and contributing to others, he said. 

A society where machines handle all productive tasks could drift toward a future in which humans become passive, sedentary consumers living for entertainment — a scenario he describes as ""not conducive to human flourishing.""

""We need to figure out what is the next phase going to be like,"" he said, and ""how in this world do we have the incentives to become fully human, which I think means at least a level of education that people have now and probably more.""

So far, he added, nobody — not AI researchers, not economists, not science fiction writers, not futurists — has convincingly described that world.

Melinda French Gates has a message for the ultrawealthy: Give more money away.

In a Tuesday interview with Wired, Gates spoke about the Giving Pledge, a movement she started in 2010 with her ex-husband, Microsoft's cofounder Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett, the chair of Berkshire Hathaway.

French Gates said that some of the people who signed the Giving Pledge, which encourages billionaires to donate a significant portion of their wealth, have been giving money at a ""massive scale.""

""But have they given enough? No,"" she said.

She said those who have amassed ""enormous amounts of wealth"" have benefited from the US's education system, regulatory environment, and venture capital system. French Gates is worth $17.2 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

""If you live in this country and started a business, you benefited from this country,"" French Gates said. ""And I believe to whom much is given, much is expected, and they should be giving back more, far more than they are.""

She did not name specific billionaires in the interview.

The Giving Pledge's website says that 250 individuals from 30 countries have taken the pledge. Its signatories include Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle's technology chief Larry Ellison, and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman.

The website spotlights billionaires' contributions to various charities, such as philanthropist MacKenzie Scott's $70 million donation to the UNCF in September.

French Gates cofounded and cochaired The Gates Foundation with Bill Gates before leaving in June 2024. She now runs Pivotal Ventures, a group of philanthropic organizations focusing on women's issues.

French Gates' comments in the Wired interview echo those of singer Billie Eilish during her acceptance speech at the WSJ Magazine Innovator Awards in October. The guest list at the awards included billionaires like Zuckerberg and filmmaker George Lucas.

""Love you all, but there's a few people in here that have a lot more money than me,"" Eilish said. ""If you are a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but yeah, give your money away, shorties.""

Russia's oil companies are still shipping nearly the same amount of oil after the US Treasury cracked down on its biggest producers recently — but the country's energy profits are falling fast, a Goldman Sachs analysis shows.

In late October, the US Treasury announced sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producers. The changes sent seaborne shipments from these companies down 42%, to about 1.7 million barrels a day.

However, Russia's total oil exports slipped by just 100,000 barrels per day after the sanctions came into effect. This means that Russia rapidly rerouted shipments through smaller, non-sanctioned producers.

""Russian oil trading networks are reorganizing quickly while Russia oil exports revenues dropped,"" analysts from Goldman wrote in a note published on Tuesday.

Even so, the steady flow of barrels masks a far deeper financial squeeze.

Russia's oil export revenues, measured in rubles, have plunged 50% this year, tumbling from the equivalent of 7.6% of GDP to just 3.7%, according to Goldman's analysis.

The bank's report landed just as the Russian Finance Ministry disclosed that oil and gas tax revenues fell 34% from a year ago, underscoring the fiscal strain.

The revenue collapse stems from a combination of a stronger ruble and sagging Brent prices, widening discounts on Russian crude as buyers demand steeper price cuts to offset the risk of sanctions.

The divergence between stable exports and collapsing revenue has major implications for Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine.

Oil and gas revenues have historically accounted for more than a third of Russia's federal budget, and energy remains one of the country's most significant sources of funding.

But even as Russia boosts weapons production and ramps up defense spending, the money flowing in to support that buildup is shrinking.

The timing is particularly sensitive. Ukraine has intensified its drone campaign against Russia's energy infrastructure, a trend Goldman highlights as a growing geopolitical risk.

Despite those attacks, Brent prices have barely moved, suggesting markets remain unconvinced that Russian supply is in immediate danger — a dynamic that keeps global prices low and Russia's revenues even lower.

An end to the war in Ukraine appears elusive nearly four years after Russia's full-scale invasion, despite renewed diplomatic attempts.

On Wednesday, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's top envoys did not reach a compromise on a possible peace deal after a five-hour meeting.

In this article

Beta Technologies posted its first quarterly results on Thursday since the stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.

The electric aircraft maker, which went public last month, reported revenue of $8.9 million, more than double the $3.1 million from a year ago.

""As a newly public company, we remain firmly grounded in what makes BETA unique—our simple, stepwise approach, our vertical integration and our focus on designing and manufacturing the complete electric aviation ecosystem to meet the needs of customers around the world,"" CEO Kyle Clark said in a statement.

Net loss widened to $452 million, a loss of $9.83 per share, from a loss of $82.1 million, a loss of $1.81 per share, in the year-ago period.

The company said the net loss took a hit from the issuance of convertible preferred stock.

Beta forecasted full-year revenue to reach between $29 million and $33 million and adjusted EBITDA to range between a loss of $295 million and a loss of $325 million.

The Amazon-backed company is establishing itself as another player alongside rivals Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation in the small but competitive electric vertical take-off and landing, or eVTOL, space.

Air taxi manufacturers are vying to gain approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which launched the eVTOL Integration Pilot Program, or eIPP, in September.

Clark told CNBC that the program is a ""massive testament"" to the Trump administration's efforts in accelerating the nascent industry. 

Beta is applying to the program with state partners, including North Carolina, Michigan and Ohio, to host its commercial aircraft operations as soon as next June.

""We have flown more than twice as many miles than anybody else in this industry,"" Clark said. ""That real-world flying gives us the ability to go into these eIPP opportunities with a mature type of certification product with a ton of reliability.""

The company is currently working on military and cargo operations before focusing on passenger applications. During the quarter, aircraft engine supplier GE Aerospace agreed to invest $300 million in Beta and co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for both defense and civil use.

""The eIPP program is meant to augment America's drone dominance and that is a military interest as well as a civil interest,"" Clark said. ""Partnership with dual-use aircraft like ours, with the military and civil applications, is a big part of this.""

The company also worked with Hartzell Propeller to land certification during the quarter, becoming the first FAA-certified propeller specifically designed for advanced air mobility aircraft. 

The achievement marks another step closer to obtaining Type Certification, or approval of aircraft design, for Beta's H500A electric engine.

""To take something as big and new as a primary propulsion electric motor that other people are buying, that we're using in our own aircraft — we're flying all over the world in — and be in the final steps to Type Certification is a huge validation point,"" Clark said. 

Beta announced earlier this week an up to supply deal with air taxi company Eve Air Mobility.

Eve agreed to purchase Beta's electric pusher motors, which could potentially equate to as much as $1 billion over 10 years. Clark said during an earnings call that the deal contributed to a component backlog of over $1 billion.

In this article

Meta Platforms shares popped about 4% higher on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was looking to make significant cuts to the company's metaverse resources.

Bloomberg said that executives have considered budget cuts as high as 30% for the unit, citing people familiar with the talks.

The move would be notable for the Facebook parent company, which changed its name to Meta in October 2021 to signal its pivot beyond social media.

Zuckerberg said at the time that ""the metaverse is the next frontier just like social networking was when we got started.""

The proposed cuts would likely include layoffs, according to Bloomberg, which said the cuts were part of budget planning for 2026. The cuts will likely hit the company's virtual reality group.

Meta declined to comment on the report.

Meta's Reality Labs unit, which develops the Quest family of VR headsets and Ray-Ban and Oakley AI smart glasses, reported a $4.4 billion loss in the company's most recent quarter.

The division had recorded over $70 billion in cumulative losses since late 2020 as of the third-quarter report.

The number of public companies has been shrinking, sending investors looking for diversification in the private markets. But as the lines become blurred between public and private markets, do the potential benefits outweigh the risks? 

CNBC's 15th annual Delivering Alpha investor summit last month brought together some of the biggest names in investing to answer some of the top questions surrounding the alternatives industry.  

Here are the highlights from our conversations with General Atlantic Chairman and CEO Bill Ford, Coatue Management founder and portfolio manager Philippe Laffont, Ares Management co-founder and CEO Michael Arougheti, and JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management CEO Mary Erdoes. The comments are edited for clarity and length. 

The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments.

Ford: I really believe right now that the people driving the change in AI are the large, public tech companies, and I think incumbents have that advantage. So, if you don't understand what Oracle is doing, what Google is doing, what Microsoft is doing, you really can't invest in the private market. You really can't make good decisions. So even if we're not making investment decisions on the public side, we have to be pretty fully aware of what they're doing and that's how we synthesize it into our decision-making. 

Laffont: We do everything from seed to privates to publics. On one hand, you could say, OK, maybe we're at an advantage, because we know both about publics and privates. But on the other hand, the mindset to invest in publics and privates is different. 

On the public side, it's not only [that] you have to believe in the future, but you have to think, is it already priced in or not? Like when Oracle goes from [$50 per share] to $350, at $350 it's like, maybe the idea is already priced [in] and on the private side, because usually things take longer, you have to be more right, you have to be more patient. You have to be active in your companies, you have to support the founders or the CEOs a lot.

So I would say that if you can do both, great, but they're definitely different skill sets. Sometimes I wish I was only in one or the other. Sometimes I'm happy to be involved in both.

Ford: The nice thing about private is ... I think this tech cycle plays out over a longer period of time. And I think there is a duration that you get from being a private investor — more of a 5-to-7-year horizon — that allows you to play the cycle a little bit longer.

Sometimes the public markets are more demanding for shorter-term performance.

Laffont: I personally think that the IPO market is totally broken – like beyond repair, as measured by the fact that 20 or 30 years ago, there were so many more IPOs than today. Today, there's very few IPOs. We were talking earlier this year, there's been almost none. And I think it's not a great trend, because at the end of the day, it's just easier for [the] retail investor to be involved in IPOs and then onwards than everything before the IPO. So I find it's a little bit unfair.

I do think that it's going to get fixed purely through competition more than through regulatory action, because when private assets get tokenized, the byproduct of being tokenized is you, in essence, become public, because now you could trade at a premium to the price of the token, you could trade at a discount to whatever the token price was issued. And so all these people that are tokenizing private assets, in essence, it's making them public. And so I think that one day, maybe all assets are going to be public and tradable.

Ford: I'm a little more optimistic about the IPO market. I think we've had an exit recession in private markets for the last three-plus years, and some of that was regulatory, some of it was just some of the trends that Philippe was talking about. But I think we started to see some green shoots around the IPO market this year, and it was just unfortunate that the wind was taken out of our sails a little bit when we had the government shutdown.

There were a lot of high-quality companies on file, ready to go, that would have gone public in Q4 [and] I think build some momentum going into '26. That got stunted.

I think it will come back in '26. I think ... while the balance may have shifted toward privates, I think there's a desire among public investors to have high-quality companies come public.

Arougheti: Whenever you talk about retail access to any investment product … you have to focus on fiduciary duty, and you have to make sure that they understand what they're buying. Now I also believe that sometimes we don't give the everyday investor enough credit for just how smart they are. … As a capital markets practitioner, I just think any time we can increase access to the individual investor to investment products that will help them through their wealth creation and retirement is a good thing.

There's no reason why the retail investor should not have access to institutional-quality product, as long as it's structured the right way and they're well advised. So a lot of what we partner on is not just the product, but the education of the advisors, the education of the end client, an understanding of the risk. But when you see what alternatives can do mixed in with a traditional 60/40 portfolio, it's a wonderful thing, and you're going to see a continued increase in retail buying of alts, because it delivers a better investment outcome in most portfolio constructions.

Erdoes: And that's exactly why the current administration is changing the rules on these things, so that you can think about having them in 401(k) accounts, that you can think about them in the Invest America accounts that will come for the children's future, so that they can participate in 99% of the companies out there in the United States of America that are not public. And so why should it be that just institutions get to invest in the things that are not public? And when you're not public you're not paying a public markets premium. And so there's great value to be found.

How do we give that access while properly risk-managing it? There just should be no such thing as a public markets-only portfolio for almost anyone in the world, if you can risk-manage it; it should be a public-to-private continuum. That's how you should think about it and how you invest that money is just right-sizing it, risk-managing it and making sure that everybody has access to these companies.

Arougheti: I think the unlock is when you go through cycles. ... What the semiliquid structures actually do is allow you to own these assets through a cycle, to capture all of the value creation. And ironically, when the market is going through volatility or a downturn, there is no liquidity at the price that you want it. And I think that institutional investors figured that out a long time ago.

The retail investor has been trained for generations: don't lever yourself and be liquid because when things get bad, you need to be able to sell. And inevitably, they go sell the things that they can, not the things that they should. And I think what we're now seeing, and I think it's why we're seeing the market smoothing the ownership of these assets – you're almost structuring out the bad behavior, because people are doing a better job understanding the liquidity and how much they can give up and get paid.

Erdoes: And the sophistication of evergreen funds, interval funds, things that can last through time, we were just talking about some assets that we share and own. And you think to yourself, 'Why should I have to sell that every five to seven years to somebody else to put it in their portfolio — if there's an end date to my private portfolio, and the thing isn't going public, so it's not going in the public markets, but I want to own it forever and it'll have an appreciation, and I don't want to necessarily have to deal with a mark-to-market at a particular time that the fund has a maturity date?'

So all of that leads to more of this stuff being put in portfolios. When done with the right bite size, [it] makes a terrific opportunity for the rest of America and everybody else around the world. But you know that those are the opportunities you can afford.

In this article

When Nvidia this week said it would take a $2 billion stake in chip design company Synopsys, it was just the latest in a string of massive investments announced by the chipmaker this year. 

Nvidia has also said it would take a $1 billion stake in Nokia, invest $5 billion in Intel and $10 billion in Anthropic — $18 billion in investment commitments from those four deals, not counting smaller venture capital investments.

That doesn't even include the biggest commitment of all: $100 billion to buy OpenAI shares over a number of years, although there is still no definitive agreement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said Tuesday at the UBS Global Technology and AI conference. 

It's a lot of money and a lot of deals, but Nvidia's got the cash to write big checks. 

At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. That's up from $13.3 billion in January 2023, just after OpenAI released ChatGPT. That launch three years ago was key to making Nvidia's chips the most valuable tech product.

As Nvidia has transformed from a maker of gaming technology into the most valuable U.S. company, its balance sheet has become a fortress, and investors are increasingly wondering what the company will do with its cash. 

""No company has grown at the scale that we're talking about,"" said CEO Jensen Huang, when asked what the chipmaker plans to do with all its cash, on Nvidia's earnings call last month.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to generate $96.85 billion in free cash flow this year alone and $576 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. 

Some analysts would like to see Nvidia spend more of its cash on share repurchases. 

""Nvidia is set to generate over $600B in free cash flow over the next few years and it should have a lot left over for opportunistic buybacks,"" wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes in a note on Monday.

The company's board increased its share repurchase authorization in August, adding $60 billion to its total. In the first three quarters of the year, it spent $37 billion on share repurchases and dividends.

""We're going to continue to do stock buybacks,"" Huang said. 

Nvidia is doing the buybacks, but it's not stopping there. 

Huang said that Nvidia's balance sheet strength gives its customers and suppliers confidence that orders in the future, which he called offtake, will be filled. 

""Our reputation and our credibility is incredible,"" Huang said. ""It takes a really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that.""

Kress, Nvidia's CFO, on Tuesday said the company's ""largest focus"" is making sure it has enough cash to deliver its next-generation products on time. Most of Nvidia's largest suppliers are equipment manufacturers like Foxconn and Dell, which can require that Nvidia provide working capital to manage inventory and build additional manufacturing capacity. 

Huang called his company's strategic investments ""really important work"" and said that if companies like OpenAI grow, it drives additional consumption of AI and Nvidia's chips. Nvidia has said that it does not require any of its investments to use its products, but they all do anyway. 

""All of the investments that we've done so far — all of it, period — is associated with expanding the reach of Cuda, expanding the ecosystem,"" Huang said, referring to the company's artificial intelligence software.

In an October filing, Nvidia said it had has already made $8.2 billion in investments in private companies. For Nvidia, those investments have replaced acquisitions. 

Nvidia's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 is the largest the company has ever made, and it laid the groundwork for its current AI products, which aren't single chips but entire server racks that sell for around an estimated $3 million.

But the company faced regulatory issues when it tried to buy chip technology firm Arm for $40 billion in 2020. 

Nvidia called off the deal before it could be completed after regulators in the U.S. and U.K. raised concerns about its effects on competition in the chip industry. Nvidia has purchased some smaller companies in recent years, to bolster its engineering teams, but it hasn't completed a multibillion acquisition since the Arm deal failed.

""It's hard to think about very significant, large types of M&A,"" Kress this week said, speaking at an investor conference. ""I wish one would come available, but it's not going to be very easy to do so.""

Bitcoin's more than 30% drop from its record high underscores the volatility that has come to  characterize the cryptocurrency.

Moves from previous cycles not only show how the current price swings are all part of bitcoin's normal operating pattern but also how they may often precede a rally, according to figures compiled by CoinDesk Data for CNBC.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped to a low of around $80,000 late last month before staging a rally and falling again this week. When bitcoin dropped to under $81,000, that represented an approximately 36% fall from its all-time high of around $126,000 hit earlier in October. As of Thursday, bitcoin was trading at over $93,000, according to Coinmetrics, a roughly 26% decline from its record high.

These price swings may seem large but they are normal in relation to bitcoin's history.

Bitcoin's price movement is often referred to in ""cycles."" Generally, the bitcoin cycle refers to a four-year pattern of price movement that revolves around a key event known as the halving, a change to mining rewards that is written in bitcoin's code. While there are signs that the typical timing and patterns of the cycles could be changing, the range of price movements appears to be consistent.

In the current cycle, bitcoin has already weathered a 32.7% pullback from March to August 2024 and a 31.7% decline between January and April 2025, according to CoinDesk Data. 

""Looking at previous cycles, volatility of this magnitude appears consistent with long-term trends,"" Jacob Joseph, senior research analyst at CoinDesk Data, told CNBC.

During the 2017 cycle, there were drawdowns of around 40% twice that year and then a 29% decline in November before bitcoin reached a new record high in December. 

Looking back at the 2021 cycle, bitcoin recorded declines of 31.2% in January that year and 26% in February. There was a more than 55% correction between April and June 2021 as China banned bitcoin mining. The asset then rallied to a new high in November that year.

""While deeper mid-cycle corrections have certainly occurred, nearly all of them — aside from the mining-ban-drop in 2021 —  took place within a broader bullish structure, often holding above key technical levels such as its 50-week moving average,"" Joseph said.

Beginning Oct. 10, more than 1.6 million traders suffered a combined $19.37 billion erasure of leveraged positions over a 24-hour period. Many traders were forced out of their positions and the impact of that cascaded across the industry.

That effect is still being felt, according to Lucy Gazmararian, founder of Token Bay Capital.

""[It was the] biggest liquidation event in crypto's history and that takes quite a few weeks to see the fallout from that and for the market to consolidate,"" Gazmararian told ""Access Middle East"" on Thursday.

""It also coincided at a time when there's a lot of concern that we are reaching the end of a bull market … so that has increased the levels of fear out there in the market.""

In the past, when the bull market ends and there is a period of depressed prices, often dubbed a ""crypto winter,"" bitcoin has tended to sit 70% to 80% below its all-time high. This has not yet happened. But concern about this coming to pass is weighing on investors' minds.

""Really the timing of the drop, where we are in the cycle, that's making investors cautious in case we do see that 80% drop,"" Gazmararian said.

In this article

Google Cloud announced Thursday a multi-year partnership with artificial intelligence coding startup Replit, giving the search giant fresh firepower against the coding products of rivals, including Anthropic and Cursor. 

Under the partnership, Replit will expand usage of Google Cloud services, add more of Google's models onto its platform, and support AI coding use cases for enterprise customers. 

Google will continue to be Replit's primary cloud provider. 

Replit, founded nearly a decade ago, is a leader in the fast-growing AI vibe-coding space. 

In September, the startup closed a $250 million funding round that almost tripled its valuation to $3 billion, and said it grew annualized revenue from $2.8 million to $150 million in less than a year. 

And new data from Ramp, a fintech company that also tracks enterprise spending on its platform, found that Replit had the fastest new customer growth among software vendors. Google, meanwhile, is adding new customers and spending faster than any other company on Ramp's platform. 

Put those together, and you get a clearer picture of why both companies see opportunity.

Vibe-coding emerged as a phenomenon earlier this year after AI models became more adept at generating code using only natural language prompts, allowing users with little experience in programming to use AI to create functioning code and potentially full applications. 

Anthropic announced on Tuesday that its product Claude Code hit $1 billion in run-rate revenue. The coding startup Cursor, in November, closed a funding round that valued it at $29.3 billion, while also announcing it reached $1 billion in annualized revenue. 

Replit, which bills itself as an easy-to-use product for non-developers, could help drive Google Cloud adoption among enterprises, and expand the reach of its AI efforts beyond traditional engineers. 

Google is riding on the momentum of its new top-scoring model, Gemini 3. Shares of Alphabet have risen more than 12% since its debut.

Discovery on 'fairness and adequacy' of sale process: Read the full letter","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/paramount-questions-warner-bros-discovery-sale-process-letter.html","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:43:39 GMT","



In this article

Paramount Skydance is calling foul on how Warner Bros. Discovery has conducted its sale process. 

In a letter reviewed by CNBC, Paramount attorneys told Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav that Paramount was questioning the ""fairness and adequacy"" of the process, which officially launched in October. This week, Paramount, Netflix and Comcast submitted second-round bids to acquire some or all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, CNBC previously reported. 

""It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,"" reads the letter from attorneys at Quinn Emanuel. ""We specifically request and expect this letter will be shared and discussed with the full board of directors of WBD.""

In particular, Paramount's letter calls out reports that WBD's management appears to favor Netflix's offer. 

Netflix has made an offer of mostly cash, while Paramount's latest bid was all cash, according to people close to the matter who declined to be named speaking about confidential dealings. All three companies submitted higher bids than their initial offers, the people told CNBC.

As of Thursday morning, Netflix was the leading bidder based on how WBD is valuing the offers, people familiar told CNBC. Comcast executives, for their part, continue to be disciplined in the company's offer as to not anger shareholders by taking on additional debt and risking its balance sheet, according to people familiar with that company's thinking. Comcast leadership has previously said that its bar for M&A is generally high.

Warner Bros. Discovery told CNBC it confirmed to Paramount that it had received the letter and would share it with members of the WBD board. 

""Please be assured that the WBD Board attends to its fiduciary obligations with the utmost care, and that they have fully and robustly complied with them and will continue to do so,"" the company said in its response to Paramount. 

WBD expects to announce a winner as early as next week, sources told CNBC.  

While first-round bids arrived in mid-November, Paramount has been vying to acquire the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery — which includes its streaming service HBO Max, film studio Warner Bros. and a portfolio of cable TV networks like TNT and TBS — since September, CNBC previously reported. 

Warner Bros. Discovery rebuffed three offers made by Paramount, the last of the those for $23.50 a share, before launching a formal sale process to beckon other buyers, CNBC previously reported. 

Netflix and Comcast are interested only in WBD's streaming and film studio business, CNBC has reported. Prior to the sale process Warner Bros. Discovery had begun the process of splitting its company into two — Warner Bros., the streaming and studio businesses which would be led by Zaslav, and Discovery Global, the cable TV networks division that would be run by current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. 

Paramount attorneys sent the letter as the company suspects that Zaslav has been biased against a merger with Paramount since the outset, and instead, would rather complete its path toward a separation, some of the people familiar told CNBC. Paramount and its advisors have viewed WBD's contact with them as more obstructionist rather than constructive, two of the people said. 

Before the sale process, Zaslav had been known to tell colleagues that Amazon's Prime Video or Netflix would likely be interested suitors in Warner Bros. Discovery, or specifically HBO Max and the film studio, the people said. In the letter, Paramount asks the WBD board if reporting that WBD management has ""chemistry"" with Netflix management is accurate. 

Paramount is seeking confirmation, according to the letter, of whether Warner Bros. Discovery appointed an independent special committee of disinterested members of its board to steer the sale process and consider offers. 

""If not, we strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders,"" the letter reads. ""This would seem to be an important step at this stage, to ensure the fairness and unimpeachability of the transaction process and to maximize the value of whatever outcome WBD determines to pursue.""

Dear Mr. Zaslav: We write on behalf of Paramount Skydance Corporation (""Paramount"", ""we"" or ""us"") to express our serious concerns about the fairness and adequacy of the bidding process for a potential combination with Warner Bros. Discovery (""WBD"" or ""you""). It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder. We specifically request and expect this letter will be shared and discussed with the full board of directors of WBD.

 

We have recently seen reporting in the U.S. and foreign media that gives serious cause for concern. The German newspaper Handelsblatt recently reported on a meeting that reportedly took place in Brussels between Gerhard Zieler, President of WBD's International Business and a direct report to WBD's Chief Executive Officer, who ""arrived with a three-person team,"" with the E.U. Commission Vice President Hena Virkkunen, to discuss the potential merger prospects for WBD. In that conversation, the article reports that ""concerns were raised that the Ellison family's planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery could lead to excessive media concentration,"" and that the E.U. Commission would consider intervening in a potential merger with Paramount for this reason. The article quotes ""sources close"" to Zeiler as saying ""that the talks with the Commission were important because both Warner and the EU wanted to preserve media diversity."" The implications of such a meeting, if it occurred, are clear and evince a tacit resistance to, if not active sabotage of, a Paramount offer.

 

While this report is concerning in itself, this is not an isolated report regarding purported WBD resistance to a combination with Paramount. Several U.S. media outlets have reported on the enthusiasm by WBD management for a transaction with Netflix, and on statements by management that a transaction between WBD and Netflix would be a ""slam dunk,"" while also referring to Paramount's bid in a negative light. Additional reporting since the submission of revised bids on December 1 has indicated that WBD's ""board has really warmed to"" a transaction with Netflix due to the ""chemistry between"" WBD management and Netflix management. We have come to you first to inquire whether this reporting is accurate, and to engage in a productive discussion with you around any actual or perceived issues that it may reflect.

 

Moreover, these media reports echo similar indications that we have been hearing throughout this process, despite what we viewed as otherwise productive conversations that we have had with WBD leadership. Paramount has a credible basis to believe that the sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management's potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation as a result of the economic incentives embedded in recent amendments to employment arrangements. These concerns are amplified by indications of director bias and beholdenness to others whose interests may not align with the stockholders', and the fact that alternatives involving only certain WBD assets are being prioritized notwithstanding their heightened regulatory risk and potential to deprive stockholders of consideration for the entirety of WBD's enterprise value.

 

Further, as you know, Paramount agreed to certain standstill arrangements in exchange for the opportunity to participate in a truly competitive and unbiased bidding process. Paramount did not bargain for WBD to foster, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a tilted and unfair process. We believe that all parties to this process should have a shared desire for, and will mutually benefit from, an unimpeachable transaction process. As we assume you agree, even discounting the accuracy of any media reports, just the appearance of a flawed process imperils any potential transaction that might result and may undermine the potential value maximization to WBD stockholders from any prospective transaction.

 

In light of our grave concerns regarding the integrity of WBD's process, we seek confirmation as to whether WBD has appointed an independent special committee of disinterested members of its board to consider the potential transaction opportunities and to make a final determination regarding a sale or break-up of all or part of the company. If not, we strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders. This would seem to be an important step at this stage, to ensure the fairness and unimpeachability of the transaction process and to maximize the value of whatever outcome WBD determines to pursue. Engaging with WBD throughout this process, we have been encouraged by the enormous potential from a combination of our entities. We remain confident that the Paramount offer would provide the maximum value to WBD stockholders and look forward to the opportunity to continue to engage with you productively in this process. But at this point we must insist on assurances and steps taken to ensure that a truly fair and independent process is being conducted, both for Paramount's benefit and in the interest of WBD's stockholders.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to change a longstanding recommendation that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. 

It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate that so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.

But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. 

Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. 

""We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,"" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. 

The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a ""remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing"" if the committee changes the recommendation. 

Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. 

The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. 

But the jab is ""an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,"" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. 

""I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,"" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. 

The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because ""it saves lives,"" he added. 

A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.

A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.

Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. 

But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. 

""They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,"" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. ""If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages."" 

Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. 

Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. 

""The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,"" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time.

Meta has been hit with an EU antitrust investigation over its use of AI features in WhatsApp, as the European bloc continues to ramp up challenges to US big tech giants.

The probe will examine whether Meta's new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp may breach EU competition rules, Brussels said in a statement Thursday morning.

A new policy announced by Meta in October prohibited AI providers from using a tool allowing businesses to contact customers via WhatsApp when AI is the main service offered, the European Commission said. 

While businesses may still use AI tools for functions like customer support, the bloc was concerned the new policy might ""prevent third party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (EEA),"" it added.

""The claims are baseless,"" a WhatsApp spokesperson told CNBC in a statement, adding that the app's application programming interface (API) was not designed to support AI chatbots and ""puts a strain on our systems.""

""The AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations and operating systems,"" the company added.

It comes months on from the Commission fining Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.45 billion) for breaching antitrust rules around online advertising. In April, Apple was fined 500 million euros after being found to have breached anti-steering obligations. The same month, Meta was hit with a 200 million euros fine for breaching obligations to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.

Fines for breaking the EU's antitrust rules can reach as much as 10% of a company's annual revenue. There are no dates set for the antitrust investigation to close, but previous cases have run on for years. 

""We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully of this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,"" said the bloc's Commissioner for Competition Teresa Ribera.

The investigation will cover the entire EEA apart from Italy, to avoid an overlap with its own ongoing proceedings for the possible imposition of interim measures concerning Meta's conduct.

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously threatened the EU with an investigation that could lead to tariffs for imposing fines and regulation on the country's tech giants.

""As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand,"" he said following the EU's Google fine in September.

Russia's security council chief warned on Thursday that should the European Union use its seized frozen assets to support Ukraine, that could be tantamount to justification for war.  

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has been looking at how to use frozen Russian assets held in Europe to further support Ukraine.

The move could be tantamount to an act justifying war, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said in a comment posted to Telegram and translated by Google. 

""If a frantic European Union attempts to steal Russian assets frozen in Belgium by issuing a so-called reparations loan, such actions could be classified under international law as a special kind of casus belli, with all the ensuing consequences for Brussels and individual EU countries,"" Medvedev said, referring to the Latin phrasing for an act that justifies war.

Russia has previously said it would retaliate if the EU went ahead with using frozen assets option. 

The Commission has argued that the move is not theft, given it would be a loan and Ukraine would only have to repay it if Russia pays reparations. 

Russia and the European Commission did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. 

On Wednesday the Commission proposed a ""Reparations Loan"" for Ukraine which would involve using cash from the balances of European financial institutions holding frozen Russian Central Bank assets. It also proposed borrowing the funds from international markets, offering member states an alternative to using Russian capital.

Under the proposal to use the frozen assets, it plans to unlock 90 billion euros ($105 billion) for the effort, which is around two-thirds of the International Monetary Fund's $136.5 billion estimation of Ukraine's financing gap for 2026 to 2029. 

""With Russia continuing to show no sign of willingness to commit to a just and sustainable peace, the strain on Ukraine's resources continues to grow, making sustained EU support all the more vital,"" the Commission said in a statement.  

So far, European countries have used the profits generated by such assets to financially aid Kyiv, but some European leaders have expressed concerns about further measures due to potential financial and legal issues. 

Belgium has been particularly tough on the subject, given that it hosts Euroclear — the financial institution that has the bulk of Russia's state assets which have been frozen in Europe since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belgium's leadership has expressed concerns about the legal implications once the war is over and wants EU countries to commit to burden-sharing the responsibilities. 

One EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic, told CNBC, ""If the EU chooses to borrow money to support Ukraine, this will need unanimity. If they choose to use the frozen assets then you can approve the plan by qualified majority.""

Hungary is against giving further cash to Ukraine, creating a barrier to achieving unanimity on the issue.

Another EU official, who also did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, told CNBC: ""By putting forward two solutions to fund Ukraine, ""the European Commission wants to show that the only alternative is much worse for many more member states.""

It comes as peace negotiations continue. Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine's national security council, will meet U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff for talks in Miami on Thursday. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is in Beijing on Thursday for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The French leader is expected to urge his Chinese counterpart to do more to cooperate on Ukraine resolution.

Discussions held between Russia and the U.S. failed to deliver a breakthrough on Tuesday, though U.S. President Donald Trump said that talks between his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Witkoff and Moscow were ""reasonably good,"" per reports.

It's unclear which peace plan was presented to the Russians after an initial 28-point plan, secretly devised by the U.S. and Russia, was presented to Ukraine a few weeks ago.

Speaking at the 2025 Investor Summit conference at the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, Kim Darroch, who served as the U.K.'s ambassador to the U.S. during Trump's first term, said: ""I don't think the Ukraine war is going to end anytime soon, unless the Ukrainians agree to capitulate and give up territory, plus to never join NATO, and this kind of stuff which I think is basically impossible to concede and survive politically."" 

""So, I think the war will drag on through the winter and beyond, which potentially is very dangerous for Europe because I think if Trump can't get a deal he may just walk away and stop weapons supplies to Ukraine and tell the Europeans, 'it's your problem, I tried to get a deal, so you do it.' And then I'm not sure we actually have the capacity to provide Ukraine with what it needs.""

Oops, something went wrong

TD Cowen analysts lowered their price target for Strategy shares on Wednesday, citing the volatility of the Bitcoin treasury leader's stock price and incremental shareholder dilution as key factors.

The investment bank now sees Strategy's shares hitting $500 next year, as opposed to its previous $535 per share estimate, according to a note shared with Decrypt. Strategy's shares recently changed hands around $188, per Yahoo Finance, down about 24% over the last month.

Earlier this week, Strategy signaled that it had raised $1.44 billion to maintain a cash reserve. The company indicated that the funds would go toward dividend payments on its preferred shares, as its traditional source of funding grows constrained, and framed the reserve as a way to avoid the potential fate of selling its Bitcoin holdings—but said it would do so if need be.

Historically, Strategy has issued common shares to add to its $60 billion Bitcoin stockpile. However, the company has issued $7.7 billion worth of preferred shares this year, as its go-to move has become a less effective way to grow its Bitcoin holdings per share.

“Shoring up liquidity during times of stress is always prudent, in our view, and we believe all Strategy stakeholders are materially better off,” they wrote. “Strategy has gone a long way toward putting to bed any lingering questions around its ongoing access to capital markets.”

Benchmark Is Bullish on Strategy Even as Stock Plunges Amid Possibility of Selling Bitcoin

The analysts noted that their adjusted model for Strategy's shares reflects the dilutive impact of raising cash to fund dividends on preferred shares, at a time when its stock price is hovering close to its lowest point in the past 13 months.

A lower stock price for Strategy has led to more dilution than the investment bank previously forecast. Along those lines, the analysts said Strategy's heightened volatility warrants a lower earnings multiple, which was reduced to 5x from 9x.

Although a $500 per share estimate may seem “out of context,” given recent shifts in sentiment, the analysts said it's reasonable, considering that the company has embedded leverage and Strategy's Bitcoin premium can shift quickly alongside the digital asset's price.

Is Bitcoin Treasury Giant Strategy 'Too Big To Fail'?

TD Cowen's latest estimate for Strategy's stock comes as some firms grow bullish. Earlier this week, investment bank Benchmark raised its 2026 price target to $705, for example.

In a note, Benchmark Analyst Mark Palmer argued that Strategy's stock remains “one of the most powerful asymmetric vehicles in global markets” because of its unmatched ability to raise capital and benefit from Bitcoin's potential upside.

Year-to-date, Strategy's stock price has fallen about 35%. Over the same period of time, Bitcoin's price has edged down 2.5% to just above $92,000, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

An unknown whale has just made a significant move on the Ethereum ETHUSD chain. On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain spotted the transaction and reported that the whale, simply identified by the wallet address ""0x97BD,"" moved 10,000 ETH.

Ethereum whale's long-term confidence

The whale withdrew this large volume of Ethereum valued at $31.91 million from the Bitget exchange. The whale action is significant as it implies strategic accumulation despite ETH shedding over 10% in the last 30 days due to price fluctuations.

Notably, after the whale's withdrawal, its total wallet holdings soared to 34,188 ETH, valued at about $108.8 million. The whale likely decided to withdraw from Bitget exchange into a private wallet because he intends to keep the asset long term.

Whale 0x97BD withdrew another 10,000 $ETH($31.91M) from #Bitget 2 hours ago, and currently holds 34,188 $ETH($108.8M).https://t.co/44wNrGrIeH pic.twitter.com/KQaPsaaDvf

Generally, when a holder is unwilling to sell their asset, they store it in a private wallet. The whale could have decided to store his assets in a self-custody wallet and build up the portfolio. The large volume of Ethereum in the wallet suggests that he has been building it over time.

Lookonchain data shows that the whale has staked the Ethereum through Lido staking. This further emphasizes that the whale has confidence in the future price outlook of Ethereum despite price volatility across major crypto assets on the market.

Ethereum has risen in the last 24 hours from a low of $3,059.98 to hit a high of $3,238.56 during the course of trading. 

As of press time, Ethereum exchanged hands at $3,164.88, which represented a 2.02% increase within the time frame.

However, trading volume remains down by 8.44% to $28.03 billion. This suggests that market participants are still cautious and possibly monitoring developments on the chain. It was likely triggered by the $135 million worth of ETH offloaded by BlackRock despite the resurgence of the asset in the previous trading session.

Network disruptions and Buterin's update roadmap

In the early hours of Thursday, some community members experienced network disruptions. 

According to the Ethereum Foundation update, there was a challenge with Prysm consensus clients on the mainnet. The bug caused about 23% of the network nodes to go offline.

Meanwhile, Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at three crucial updates that the blockchain will need to perform.

Buterin highlighted these to include a cap on the number of contract code bytes that are accessed per transaction and changes to memory pieces. The other is ZK-EVM prover cycle bounds.

Ethereum (ETH) price has broken past $3,100 again, just days after speculation spread that it could slide below $2,500.

This development happened after ETH registered a 5.37% increase over the last seven days, and the project completed the Fuska upgrade.

Additionally, the move appears to have transformed the previous resistance into support, with indicators suggesting that ETH could continue to rise higher.

A look at the charts shows that the last few weeks have been challenging for ETH.

On Nov. 21, the price slipped to $2,653, a level it had not touched in months.  However, market conditions now appear to be shifting.

At the time of writing, the 4-hour chart indicates that Ethereum's price has broken above a key resistance level, suggesting that buyers are regaining control.

Supporting this improvement, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has climbed above the zero signal line, confirming a return of buying pressure.

Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed a bullish crossover for the first time since Nov. 22, indicating that momentum is turning upward.

With these developments in place, ETH's price may soon retest the $3,394 resistance level.

If bulls continue to defend the $2,672 support, the broader trend could strengthen.

Under sustained buying pressure, ETH's price might advance toward $3,902, marking a significant recovery from recent lows, especially after the finalization of the Fusaka upgrade.

“Fusaka is live on Ethereum mainnet! – PeerDAS now unlocks 8x data throughput for rollups – UX improvements via the R1 curve & pre-confirmatons – Prep for scaling the L1 with gas limit increase & more,” The project revealed .

Outside of the technical setup, institutional activity is also turning favorable for Ethereum.

Just yesterday, BlackRock accumulated approximately $53 million worth of ETH. Data from Arkham shows that Tom Lee has also added  $150 million worth of ETH to his stash.

“Crypto prices have fallen relentlessly even as fundamentals, measured by wallets, onchain, fees or tokenizatio, have moved forward So risk/reward is attractive for $BTC and $ETH,” Lee stated  on Dec. 1.

Such accumulation reflects a long-term outlook rather than short-term speculation, lending weight to the growing bullish sentiment surrounding the asset.

At the same time, a look at the 30-day liquidation heatmaps reveals a notable concentration of liquidity around $3,678.

This cluster suggests that a significant number of leveraged positions are positioned near that level. When liquidity pools form in this manner, the price tends to gravitate toward them.

Therefore, if the cryptocurrency maintains this current structure, Ethereum's price could be drawn toward this zone in the coming sessions.

Looking at the daily chart, Ethereum's price has broken out above the upper trendline of a falling wedge.

At the same time, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) has turned positive, indicating that buyers are gaining control over market direction.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also crossed above the neutral line, confirming improving momentum and growing demand.

If this trend continues, ETH's price could breach the resistance at $3,541. A successful move above that level would open the door for a push toward $3,876, where the next significant resistance cluster sits.

Sustained bullish pressure and rising volume would increase the likelihood of this scenario unfolding.

However, the outlook changes if bearish pressure returns.

Failure to maintain the breakout could invalidate the bullish setup. In that case, ETH's price may retrace toward $2,403, revisiting lower support as the market resets.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

The Fear and Greed index advanced to 27/100, exiting the ""extreme fear"" zone as a degree of optimism begins to enter the market.

It's worth noting that bitcoin and the majority of other tokens remain in downtrends since early October, forming a series of lower highs and lower lows. To break the trend bitcoin needs to begin forming highs above $98,500, which would show signs of a meaningful bullish reversal.

The crypto market's spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin, whose sharp swings have overshadowed the rest of the ecosystem. Altcoins, meanwhile, have spent most of this cycle stuck in a holding pattern—traders facing weeks of frustration, muted price action, and erratic capital rotations. But beneath this apparent calm, something is shifting. While Bitcoin displays parabolic strength, altcoins are quietly coiling for a potential breakout. Fresh technical readings now indicate that the broader altcoin market has slipped into a clear “buy zone,” hinting that accumulation at current levels could be a well-timed opportunity ahead of the next major move.

Altcoin Volume Slips Under Yearly Average 

Altcoin trading volumes have dipped below their yearly average, a pattern that has often signalled attractive accumulation phases in previous cycles. While market sentiment remains cautious, this decline in activity suggests traders may be quietly positioning for a broader altcoin recovery as volatility starts to compress.

The chart shows a clear pattern: Whenever aggregated 30-day altcoin trading volume falls below the 365-day average, the market enters a cooling phase where traders reduce activity, sentiment turns cautious, and prices become compressed.

Historically, these low-volume compression phases have

The altcoins are currently in one such period again, suggesting that they may be closer to the beginning of their next expansion phase than the end of a decline. 

Top 5 Altcoins to Consider Before a Potential Breakout

Currently, the crypto markets are largely concentrated on Bitcoin as the traders look out for the price marking new highs in the future. Once the attention shifts back on altcoins, they are set to begin a strong rally. Below are the top altcoin picks that can be considered before the upcoming breakout. 

Ethereum ETHUSDT 

Ethereum is the anchor of the altcoin market and is approaching a major support retest with rising L2 activity. Historically, once the volume returns to Ethereum, altcoins see major recoveries, and a strong ETH price move triggers an Altseason. 

The ETH price has held well above key support zones around $3,800 to 4USDT,000, consolidating larger bases while staking and institutional interest increase. With major EMAs flattening and a base forming, Ethereum is poised for a breakout to new highs in the coming days. 

Solana SOLUSDT

Solana is one of the strongest large-cap narratives with high developer activity, and the consumer apps are outperforming. It has a very strong liquidity compared to the other altcoins and historically displayed faster recoveries after a volume compression. 

After earlier weakness near $120 to $150, the SOL price has begun stabilising and forming bullish chart patterns. If the crypto $220 to $240 zone opens up, higher targets with a moderate target close to $300 by the end of 2025. 

Chainlink LINKUSDT 

Chainlink often leads to mid-cap breakouts in bullish cycles. The demand for oracles has been constantly on the rise with RWAs and institutional players. It always shows relatively strong strength even during market corrections. 

LINK has shown strength in Oracle and data infrastructure demand, though somewhat muted compared to L1 tokens. The short-term target for Chainlink price is around $30 to $40, depending on the upcoming breakout, while the long-term target extends to $75 to $80. 

Avalanche AVAXUSDT 

Avalanche is positioned well for institutional adoption with subnet expansions and real-world asset integrations. It tends to rebound once the volume spikes, as it maintains its ecosystem momentum despite the muted market tone. 

The AVAX price has been consolidating above the support at around $9 to $12, with a potential breakout into higher ranges. The base target is around $25 to $30 by the year-end if the price manages to surge above the resistance, and in case of a bull run, a rise beyond $60 to $65 could be imminent. 

Polygon (MATIC) 

This crypto is known for strong fundamentals, and after Polygon 2.0, the ecosystem has revamped aggressively. With the growing demand for scaling, the POL price is expected to provide a long-term upside. 

If the POL price manages to break above $1.2 to $1.5 by the end of 2025, the bullish case for the token could elevate the levels beyond $2. 

Conclusion

Altcoin volumes dipping below their yearly average have historically signalled the start of an accumulation phase, not the end of a cycle. If the broader bullish structure remains intact—and many indicators still suggest it does—this period may present one of the cycle's more strategic windows to accumulate high-conviction altcoins.

While breakouts may not happen immediately, volume trends suggest the setup is building. For investors positioning for 2025, selective DCA into strong assets like ETH, SOL, LINK, AVAX, and MATIC could offer compelling long-term opportunities.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Moonie NFT USD Holds Steady at $2.687992e-06 Amid No Trading Volume","https://meyka.com/blog/moonie-nft-usd-holds-steady-at-2687992e-06-amid-no-trading-volume-0412/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:13:30 GMT","

Moonie NFT USD (MNYUSD) has remained unchanged at a price of $2.687992e-06. This flat performance occurs amidst non-existent trading volume and despite an impressive year high of $3e-06.

As of today, MNYUSD has not experienced any price movement, staying fixed at $2.687992e-06. With no trading volume reported, it's an unusual situation that raises questions about market interest in this NFT-backed digital asset. Forecasts can change due to macroeconomic shifts, regulations, or unexpected events affecting the crypto market.

Key technical indicators for MNYUSD reveal a stagnant picture. The RSI stands at 0.00, indicating extremely oversold conditions, while MACD and ADX also sit at 0.00, showing no momentum in either direction. Meyka AI, a cutting-edge financial platform, points out that such lack of activity can precede significant moves in either direction once liquidity returns.

Examining past performance, MNYUSD has seen a -10.4% change year-to-date and a dramatic drop of -99.99624% over ten years. Despite these declines, the current price has stabilized just below its 50-day and 200-day averages of $3e-06, suggesting a potential support level if volume were to rise.

Looking forward, the seven-year forecast predicts a price of $0.0005484566649282696. This long-term view indicates optimism if the asset can overcome its current challenges. However, forecasts are volatile and heavily reliant on return of interest and market dynamics.

Moonie NFT USD's current price of $2.687992e-06 reflects both a stagnation at the micro level and potential at the macro level. The absence of trading volume today doesn't detract from future possibilities, but it does highlight the need for renewed interest to drive significant movements.

MNYUSD's price stability at $2.687992e-06 is due to a lack of trading volume, indicating low market activity at present. This often occurs in niche digital assets.

Current technicals, such as RSI and MACD at 0.00, signal no movement, reflecting MNYUSD's static state. This can change if trading volume or investor interest increases.

Historically, MNYUSD has seen a -10.4% change year-to-date and -99.99624% over a decade, with its price stabilizing just below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

The seven-year forecast for MNYUSD suggests a potential price of $0.0005484566649282696, though this is subject to change with market dynamics and interest.

While MNYUSD remains stable, investment decisions should consider market dynamics, trading volume, and long-term forecasts. Meyka AI offers insights but not financial advice.

Monad, the parallelized EVM Layer 1 blockchain that launched its token last week, took investors on a wild ride, after the token nearly doubled from its ICO price, only to erase all its gains and dip below the $2.5 billion sale valuation this morning.

MON has recovered slightly this afternoon, trading back above its ICO price of $0.025 after falling as low as $0.0225.

While investors and airdrop recipients enjoyed the token's strong price action in its opening 72 hours, MON has fallen back in line with the rest of the crypto market, which continues to struggle.

Monad's mainnet has only been live for seven days, and is currently the 36th-largest blockchain by DeFi total value locked (TVL) with just $151 million according to DeFiLlama.

It is worth noting that Monad has been left with big shoes to fill, as the last major Layer 1 launch, Plasma, achieved more than $2 billion in TVL on its opening day. 

Most chains start off slower, with Hyperliquid's HyperEVM perhaps being a fairer comparison. HyperEVM took more than two months to break above the $500 million TVL mark, and reached as high as $2.7 billion in September, roughly 10 months after its launch.

DeFi protocols deployed on Monad are still rolling out incentives for the chain's bootstrapping period, with Euler Finance, currently the fifth largest protocol by TVL on Monad, announcing new borrow incentives today. 

Even though its DeFi TVL is lagging, overall activity on Monad remains strong. Over the last seven days, Monad was the seventh busiest chain by total transactions, with more than 19 million unique transactions, surpassing Arbitrum and Avalanche, which each recorded roughly 16 million transactions.

December 4, 2025 5:14 pm



The Information Commissioner's Office has provided an update on its action to tackle cookie compliance, which the regulator insists has brought the vast majority of the UK's most used websites into compliance with rules on the use of advertising trackers. 
The ICO reckons its action has given an estimated 80% of UK Internet users over the age of 14, equating to around 40 million people, greater control over how they are tracked for personalised advertising.
As a result of this work, 979 of the top 1,000 websites met the ICO's compliance checks at the time of their most recent test, with only 21 websites identified as still failing. 
Of the sites that were compliant with our testing criteria, 415 passed without any intervention. The remaining 564 improved their practices after initially failing, following direct engagement from the ICO. 
This involved sending letters to website operators highlighting their shortcomings in compliance and, where this did not lead to change, opening investigations and, in 17 cases, issuing preliminary enforcement notices (PENs). 
The regulator insists its action has seen “significant changes” that have improved user experiences online, including a greater prevalence of “reject” options on cookie banners and a lower prevalence of cookies being placed before consent has been given or after it has been refused. 
Alongside this work, it has also been encouraging better practices by engaging with trade bodies representing the majority of industries who appear in the top 1,000 websites and the consent management platforms (CMPs) that provide consent management solutions to nearly 80% of the top 500 websites. This has led to these CMPs making significant changes to ensure the cookie banner options they provide to their customers are compliant by default, the ICO claims.
ICO interim executive director of regulatory supervision Tim Capel said: “We set ourselves the goal of giving people more meaningful control over how they were tracked online by the end of 2025. I can confidently say that we have delivered on that promise.
“Our work does not stop here. We want to ensure that websites that we have brought into compliance with the cookie rules do not simply revert to their previously unlawful practices because they think it will go under the radar. We will continue to monitor compliance and engage with industry to ensure they uphold their legal obligations, while also supporting innovation that respects people's privacy.”

ICO Reprimands Post Office Over Postmaster Data Breach


                                                                                Elizabeth Greenberg

                                                04.16pm








“The people affected by this breach had already endured significant hardship and distress as a result of the Horizon IT scandal. They deserved much better than this,” Sally Anne Poole, head of investigations at the ICO, said.




                                                                                Elizabeth Greenberg                                                                                


04 December 2025,
                                                04.16pm


The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a reprimand to the Post Office following a data breach that exposed the personal information of hundreds of postmasters involved in the Horizon IT scandal.

The breach occurred when the Post Office's communications team mistakenly published an unredacted version of a legal settlement document on its corporate website. The document contained the names, home addresses and postmaster status of 502 people who were part of a group litigation against the organisation.

It remained publicly accessible from 25 April to 19 June 2024, before being removed following notification from an external law firm.

When investigating the circumstances of this data breach, the ICO found that the Post Office failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect people's information. The data regulator found there to be a lack of documented policies or quality assurance processes for publishing documents on the corporate website, as well as insufficient staff training, with no specific guidance on information sensitivity or publishing practices.

“The people affected by this breach had already endured significant hardship and distress as a result of the Horizon IT scandal. They deserved much better than this,” Sally Anne Poole, head of investigations at the ICO, said.

“The postmasters have once again been let down by the Post Office. Our investigation highlighted that this data breach was entirely preventable and stemmed from a mistake that could have been avoided had the correct procedures been in place.

“Other organisations should take notice of this reprimand and apply its learnings, so they don't find themselves making the same mistake. Data protection by design must be embedded into everyday operations so people's information is handled appropriately.”

The ICO nearly issued the Post Office a fine of up to £1.094 million, but reconsidered, as it did not find the infringements to be so egregious under its public sector approach, which aims to mitigate fines in favour of engagement and reprimands.

Upon discovering the breach, the Post Office did offer compensation to affected individuals, as well as providing identity protection services. It also established an emergency working group to review the incident, and ensured that cached versions of the document were removed from archives.


                                                                                Elizabeth Greenberg

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a series of enforcement notices and practice recommendations to several public authorities after identifying significant failures to comply with the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000.

As part of our ongoing regulatory work, our FOI team has been closely monitoring compliance across the UK. This work has led to targeted interventions where organisations have not met their statutory duties. The ICO remains firmly committed to driving greater transparency and ensuring public authorities are held accountable for upholding the public's right to information. 

Recent actions include:

Phillip Angell, Head of FOI and Transparency, said:

“We remain committed to holding organisations publicly accountable when it comes to FOI compliance. If public authorities fail to deliver a transparent service, it questions their integrity and their ability to meet their legal obligations. 

“Those making FOI requests should do so, knowing that they will receive a response in a timely manner with adequate advice on any next steps that can be taken. And those failing to meet their basic duties, should and will be held accountable.  

“The recent action taken against these public authorities demonstrates our firm approach to FOI and accountability, particularly in tackling systemic transparency issues.

“In the new year, we will review the impact of this approach to assess whether it has driven improved compliance. But our commitment remains clear: to uphold the public's right to access information across the UK.” 

The ICO yesterday announced that they will be scrutinising how popular mobile games played by children in the UK protect their online privacy.

								A Journal of Analysis and News							



By CRS 

By Rebecca M. Nelson

Policymakers have debated whether the Federal Reserve (Fed) should create a central bank digital currency (CBDC)—a “digital dollar.” A CBDC would share some of the features of cryptocurrencies (crypto)—that is, private digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, which are unsupported by any government authority. This In Focus describes how foreign central banks, the Administration, Congress, and the Fed are approaching the issue and discusses policy issues. For more detail, see CRS Report R46850, Central Bank Digital Currencies: Policy Issues.

Contrary to some of its creators' expectations, crypto has not become widely adopted for payments—its value has been too volatile to serve as an effective means of payment, transaction costs are too high, and it is neither legal tender nor backed by the “full faith and credit” of a government. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency intended to keep a constant value, were introduced to overcome the volatility issue but have also not been widely adopted for retail payments. (P.L. 119-27 was recently enacted to encourage further adoption of stablecoins.) A CBDC, proponents believe, could overcome these barriers while taking advantage of the technology pioneered by crypto to create a more efficient, central-bank-backed digital payment system.

Within the mainstream financial system, digital payments are already widespread in the United States. At present, digital payments are not always as fast, inexpensive, or ubiquitous as some would desire. A CBDC would presumably allow for real-time payments (i.e., instant settlement). Real-time payments are growing rapidly but are not yet ubiquitous in the United States. Their growth has accelerated since the introduction of FedNow, the Fed's real-time settlement system, in 2023. By contrast, developing a CBDC would take several years of significant information technology investment and testing. 

In January 2022, the Fed released a report on CBDC, which it defined as “a digital liability of a central bank that is widely available to the general public.” In the Fed's view, “CBDC transactions would need to be final and completed in real time, allowing users to make payments to one another using a risk-free asset. Individuals, businesses, and governments could potentially use a CBDC to make basic purchases of goods and services or pay bills, and governments could use a CBDC to collect taxes or make benefit payments directly to citizens.”

The report identified four characteristics that it argued were necessary “to best serve the needs of the United States,” saying that a CBDC should be (1) privacy-protected to the extent compatible with deterring criminal use, (2) intermediated (i.e., retail services would be offered through financial institutions), (3) widely transferable among holders, and (4) identity-verified (i.e., not anonymous). The report took no position on several design features, such as whether the CBDC should pay interest, whether it should be available for use offline, and whether there should be size limits on transactions or holdings. The report stated that the Fed “does not intend to proceed with issuance of a CBDC without clear support from the executive branch and from Congress, ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law.” The report “is not intended to advance a specific policy outcome and takes no position on the ultimate desirability of a U.S. CBDC.” The Fed has also participated in pilot programs (Projects Hamilton, Cedar, and Agora) to build technical capacity pending a decision to adopt a CBDC.

In March 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14067 on digital assets, which stated that the U.S. government “should prioritize timely assessments of potential benefits and risks [of a U.S. CBDC] under various designs to ensure that the United States remains a leader in the international financial system.” Pursuant to that order, Treasury, in consultation with various agencies, issued a report on CBDC in September 2022. That report did not take a position on whether to pursue a CBDC. In January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14178 on digital financial technology. The order stated that agencies are prohibited from “undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote a CBDC” and should “terminate any plans or initiatives related to the creation of a CBDC.”

A CBDC would allow holders to store value and make payments digitally and would be backed by the Fed (as is the case for physical currency), but other features are unresolved. Crypto generally records transfers on public, decentralized (or distributed) ledgers stored using blockchain technology. Often individuals' accounts are cryptographically protected and pseudonymous. (For background, see CRS Report R47425, Cryptocurrency: Selected Policy Issues.) It is unclear which of these features would be desirable in a CBDC or whether a CBDC might be built upon existing payment systems instead.

From an end-user perspective, CBDC proposals range from a payment system similar to the status quo to one that is fundamentally different. At one end of the spectrum of proposals, a CBDC accessible only to banks may differ only slightly from the current system given that wholesale payment systems are already digital. At the other end, proposals for consumers to be able to hold CBDCs in accounts at the Fed would fundamentally change the role of the Fed and its relationship with consumers and banks. The Fed's report envisioned a middle ground where end users would access CBDC and related services through financial institutions. Thus, depending on its attributes, a domestic CBDC could potentially compete with crypto (notably stablecoins), foreign CBDCs, private payment platforms, or banks. CBDC proponents differ as to which of these they would like it to compete with. CBDCs are more likely to compete with crypto as a payment means for legal commerce than their other current uses (e.g., as speculative investments or as payment means for illicit activities).

According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions around the world were researching, piloting, or launching CBDCs as of July 2025. The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria have formally launched CBDCs. No major economy has formally launched a CBDC. China's CBDC (e-CNY), while still technically in the pilot stage, is the furthest advanced. Its consumers have collectively created 2.25 billion digital wallets to transact in the e-CNY. China also participates in a cross-border CBDC pilot (called mBridge). Several central banks in advanced economies are also researching and piloting CBDCs. For example, the European Central Bank is in a two-year preparation phase for a digital euro, the Bank of England is considering developing a digital pound, and the Swiss National Bank has launched a wholesale CBDC pilot project. The Bank for International Settlements (an international organization of central banks) is working with multiple countries on CBDC research projects and cross-border pilots.

Central banks around the world are interested in CBDCs for a variety of reasons, including greater control of the economy, stronger surveillance of financial transactions, consumer preferences for digital payments, increasing access to financial products for underbanked populations, and enhancing payments efficiency. Countries such as China, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela also view CBDCs as a way to reduce reliance on the dollar and vulnerability to U.S. sanctions.

In the United States, unlike some other countries that are considering CBDCs, the existing payment system features trusted methods for digitally delivering funds, with growing use of real-time payments. Whether a CBDC would achieve equivalent or better performance at lower cost remains unknowable until detailed proposals have been released. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has called CBDCs “a solution in search of a problem.” Using CBDCs for cross-border payments has been identified as offering greater potential gains in cost and speed, but it raises more legal and practical challenges than domestic use does. 

A major policy consideration is the extent to which a CBDC would displace private activity. If available to consumers, CBDCs might partially displace stablecoins and maintain government's central role in issuing money—whether this is desirable depends largely on an individual's view of those currencies. In the more expansive vision for CBDCs, anyone could hold CBDCs in a Fed account for, at a minimum, making payments or storing value. This would mark a fundamental shift in the Fed's role—the Fed does not provide retail services to the public currently—and would have the potential to displace private payment systems and banks, which could affect the availability of credit to households and businesses. From a typical economic perspective, government provision of private goods is desirable only if there is a market failure or the service has the characteristics of a public good. It is unclear whether the U.S. payment or banking systems suffer from market failures that a CBDC could address, although a CBDC could be viewed as an extension of public money (e.g., U.S. currency), which is a public good. 

Some proponents believe a CBDC could promote financial inclusion, but that would depend largely on whether the CBDC would be less expensive and easier to access than banking services. (Under current law, the Fed would have to provide the CBDC at cost.) However, a CBDC could also harm underserved populations if it led to reduced acceptance of less costly payment options, such as cash.

Some proponents claim that, because bank runs pose systemic risk, any shift from private bank accounts to CBDC would increase financial stability. In contrast, others assert CBDC could make bank runs more likely by offering an alternative to bank accounts that people could shift their savings to during times of bank distress. Stablecoins could also be prone to runs that pose systemic risk, unlike a CBDC. Cyberattacks also pose systemic risk, and it is unclear whether a CBDC would make the financial system more or less resilient to them.

A CBDC that provided complete anonymity would seemingly be incompatible with current policies designed to curb money laundering and other illicit activities. Thus, it may be necessary to store information about CBDC users and their transactions. This would reduce individuals' privacy but might be more effective at preventing illicit activity. Dealing with privacy implications and technical challenges in rolling out new technology would expose the Fed to reputational risk, which could harm its credibility. Proponents also argue that a CBDC would improve the effectiveness of monetary policy because it could transmit interest rate changes directly to consumers—including, potentially, negative interest rates if CBDCs displaced cash.

CBDC initiatives in other countries could have implications for the United States. For example, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns that, if a major central bank successfully develops a CBDC that can be used for cross-border transactions, the use of the U.S. dollar globally could decline, challenging the status of the U.S. dollar as the world's dominant reserve currency and potentially making it easier to skirt U.S. financial sanctions. 

If it desires, Congress could hasten or prohibit the adoption of a CBDC—or set parameters around adoption—through legislation. In the 119th Congress, the House passed legislation (on a standalone basis [H.R. 1919], as part of a broader crypto regulatory bill [H.R. 3633], and as part of the National Defense Authorization Act [Title LI of H.R. 3838]) that would prohibit the Fed from issuing a CBDC or offering products, services, or accounts to individuals.

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing policy and legal analysis to committees and Members of both the House and Senate, regardless of party affiliation. As a legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, CRS has been a valued and respected resource on Capitol Hill for nearly a century.

A state-owned bank in China has issued one of the country's first-ever commercial bonds on a blockchain. 

Huaxia Bank distributed the bonds to customers paying exclusively in China's central bank digital currency, or CBDC. 

The bank issued the bonds, worth over $637 million, via its commercial shipping subsidiary Huaxia Financial Leasing, the firm said on its official social media channel, the Chinese newspaper Caixin reported.

“The whole issuance process was recorded on the blockchain network in real-time,” Huaxia said. “This has ensured that all transactions are immutable. And it will allow investors to check all relevant information at any time.”

The bank claims that using blockchain and the digital yuan in its bond issuance means it can eliminate the need for intermediaries, paving the way for more Chinese firms to launch blockchain-powered loans.

CBDCs are a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and controlled by its central bank. The People's Bank of China began its digital yuan pilot in April 2021.

In October, the PBoC claimed that cumulative digital yuan transactions had reached $2 trillion, with 26 cities in China now in the official CBDC pilot zone. 

The central bank claims that 225 million people have opened personal digital wallets so far.

CBDCs are not without their critics, who argue that their issuance could spark the collapse of banking systems.

Huaxia did not disclose which blockchain network it had issued the bonds on. 

However, most Chinese companies use private blockchains, mainly due to Beijing's sweeping crackdown on crypto trading and Bitcoin mining.

The bank's blockchain bonds are set to mature in three years and have a coupon rate, or annual yield, of 1.84%.

The bank added that its “national-first” move had helped revolutionise its book-building operations.

Book-building in the bond markets typically refers to a process in which banks gauge investor demand at various price points to determine the final interest rate and terms of their eventual bond issuance.

The bank said it had hoped to raise a minimum of $425 million through the issuance, but was prepared to issue a further $212 million in bonds it had been holding back should the bonds become oversubscribed.

In the end, demand proved so high that the firm was obliged to issue all of its bonds.

Unlike most existing and in-development CBDCs, the digital yuan does not use blockchain technology.

Huaxia trades on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and has a market capitalisation of around $15.7 billion.

Crunchfish today announces the publication of a new whitepaper, Immediate vs. Deferred Offline Modes - A Comparative Analysis for CBDC and Digital Payment Ecosystems, offering a detailed assessment of the two leading approaches to offline digital payments. It is a timely contribution as central banks worldwide explore how to bring resilience and inclusivity to digital money systems.

 

As the world moves toward digital money, offline capability has become essential for resilience, inclusion, and payment continuity. But how offline payment is implemented makes all the difference. This whitepaper analyses the two dominant offline payment modes.

The whitepaper highlights why Deferred Offline Mode, where digitally signed payment instructions (IOUs) are exchanged and settled upon reconnection, delivers superior security, scalability, and interoperability compared to hardware-dependent Immediate Offline Mode. Deferred Offline Mode offers a much better path for CBDC and commercial payments networks to offline payments.

“As societies digitalize rapidly, offline payment capability is no longer optional, it is fundamental to national resilience. This whitepaper shows that Deferred Offline Mode offers a secure, scalable path for central banks and commercial payment networks to deliver cash-like reliability without the systemic risks of transferring hardware-bound value tokens in offline mode. Crunchfish's Digital Cash solution provides exactly this capability as a ready-to-implement Layer-2 solution for central banks and commercial payment networks” says Joachim Samuelsson, CEO, Crunchfish.

Got a Gen Z on your holiday shopping list?

Gen Z, born generally between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, are currently in their teens to late 20s. As ""digital natives,"" they readily embrace the technology that older generations may find puzzling. This year, crypto is on their holiday wish list.

Here's what a gift of crypto might look like and how to make that happen.

""From AI-powered gift discovery to cryptocurrency as a legitimate gift option, we're seeing Gen Z and younger millennials lead a fundamental reimagining of commerce,"" said Bruce Cundiff, vice president of consumer insights at Visa.

The report found more than 1 in 4 shoppers (28%) would be excited to receive cryptocurrency as a gift. However, for Gen Z, the ""excited to receive crypto"" tally soared to 45%.

The survey also found Gen Z blazing the path in other consumer behavior:

They are 44% more likely than other age groups to use crypto to pay for purchases.

More than half (55%) said they would purchase from social media platforms.

They are more likely (71%) to use biometric authentication such as fingerprints or face scans.

And 60% are more likely to purchase gifts from overseas. We're betting that includes Shein and Rakuten.

But what if Gen Z's stocking is filled with cryptocurrency? What should they do with it?

Read more: What is bitcoin, and how does it work?

So if you've received a bit of bitcoin (it's doubtful someone would buy you a ""whole"" bitcoin costing something around $90,000 — but who knows?) or other crypto, what do you do with it?

Remember, crypto is digital, so you won't receive a physical coin. What you will unwrap depends on how the digital currency was delivered. It could be:

From a crypto exchange or broker: In that case, you will receive a statement and instructions. Your bitcoin could be held by the broker or exchange, or in one of these ""wallets.""

In a hot wallet: You get online access, but the code to unlock your crypto, called a private key, should be stored in a secure location, such as a safe deposit box.

In a cold wallet: You'll get a piece of hardware (or even a piece of paper) that has no internet connection. There is no backup, so if you lose your cold wallet, you lose your crypto.

A gift of crypto could also come from:

A bitcoin ATM: You may have seen these; they look like typical cash ATMs. You'll have a receipt and instructions.

A crypto exchange-traded fund: You'll probably be looking at a paper statement from an investment firm.

Crypto gift cards were available a few years ago, but have been widely discontinued. However, Coinbase says that it will still honor any previously issued gift cards.

Read more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card? See the pros and cons.

Once you have your crypto, you'll want to decide:

If you want to buy more. When you get crypto as a gift, it's someone else's money that's in play. If you purchase more cryptocurrency, you'll want to be sure you're prepared for the crypto volatility.

Spend it. That will require finding an online or brick-and-mortar merchant that accepts crypto payments.

Hold it for the long term. Watch that crypto grow. Or not.

Sell it for fiat currency (old-style cash). How you accomplish this will depend on how your crypto is being stored.

Considering all the options above for how someone might receive a crypto gift, that's also how you would buy and gift crypto.

The easiest way to buy crypto as a gift is to use an exchange or one of the crypto-friendly trading platforms. Some of the most popular are Robinhood, Kraken, and Crypto.com.

For example, Kraken offers an app that enables you to buy and send cryptocurrencies.

""Essentially, think Venmo, but with 400 different currencies and 400 different crypto assets,"" Alex Cassells, communications manager at Kraken, told Yahoo Finance. Cassells says the app will let you purchase crypto, such as bitcoin, and send it to a recipient as a pay link.

""You can send it as a text message, and then all they would have to do is click through, verify their account, and then the money [crypto] would be in their account. If they don't do that, the money doesn't leave your account, so it just stays in yours,"" he added.

TORONTO, Dec. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - DeFi Technologies Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""DeFi Technologies"") (Nasdaq: DEFT) (CBOE CA: DEFI) (GR: R9B), a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance  (""DeFi""), is pleased to announce that its subsidiary, Valour Inc., and Valour Digital Securities Limited (together, ""Valour""), a leading issuer of exchange traded products (""ETPs"") has received approval from B3 S.A. – Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão (""B3"") to list four digital asset exchange traded products (""ETPs"") via BDR on ETP.







Valour's Brazilian ETPs – Valour Bitcoin (BTCV), Valour Ethereum (ETHV), Valour XRP (XRPV) and Valour SUI (VSUI) – are scheduled to begin trading on B3 on December 17, 2025. The new listings will be marked by a bell-ringing ceremony at market close on the floor of the B3 exchange in Sao Paulo Brazil on December 19. The products will provide Brazilian investors with locally listed, BRL-denominated exposure to Valour's leading digital asset ETPs via the same brokerage and custody rails they already use for equities and ETFs.

Valour's ETP Platform Expands into Brazil

Valour currently offers approximately 100 digital asset ETPs across Europe and continues to operate the largest selection of digital asset ETPs globally, listed on major venues including Spotlight Stock Market (Sweden), Börse Frankfurt (Germany), SIX Swiss Exchange (Switzerland), London Stock Exchange (England) and Euronext (Paris and Amsterdam). Its lineup spans:

This provides diversified digital asset exposure within regulated, exchange-traded market rails.

The approval to list BTCV, ETHV, XRPV and VSUI on B3 via BDR on ETP represents a key step in Valour's international expansion strategy, which includes Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and other developing regions globally. Brazil marks Valour's first major foothold outside of Europe, with B3 serving as a regional hub for equities, ETFs and an increasingly broad suite of digital asset-linked products and derivatives. 

Brazil: A Strategic Market

Brazil has emerged as Latin America's largest and most cohesive financial market, with more than 213 million people connected through a single language (Portuguese) and a unified regulatory and capital-markets infrastructure. It is also the region's largest crypto economy, with an estimated US$318.8–319 billion in crypto assets transacted between July 2024 and June 2025, accounting for roughly one-third of all crypto activity in Latin America. According to Chainalysis' 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index, Brazil now ranks 5th worldwide, reflecting rapid growth in both retail and institutional usage.

This surge in activity is taking place under a maturing regulatory framework. Brazil's Virtual Assets Act (Law No. 14,478/2022) and subsequent decrees have formally recognised crypto assets, appointed the Central Bank of Brazil as the primary regulator of virtual asset service providers, and introduced new rules in 2025 that extend financial-sector standards and AML/CTF requirements to crypto intermediaries. 

Against this backdrop, Valour's regulated, exchange-traded BDR on ETPs on B3 aim to provide Brazilian institutions with institutional-grade access to digital assets, combining transparent on-exchange pricing, local settlement and familiar governance standards.

Management Commentary

""Brazil is one of the most important and fastest-growing digital asset markets globally, and B3 is at the centre of that growth,"" said Johan Wattenström, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of DeFi Technologies and Co-Founder of Valour. Listing Valour's BTCV, ETHV, XRPV and VSUI products on B3 is a natural extension of our European franchise and a foundational step in our broader expansion into Latin America and other high-growth regions. We believe Brazilian institutional and retail investors want regulated, exchange-traded access to digital assets, and our ETP platform is designed precisely to meet that need.""

""Across Europe, Valour has built the world's largest shelf of digital asset ETPs, and we see similar demand patterns beginning to emerge in Brazil,"" said Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour. ""By providing local listings of our core ETPs, we offer Brazilian investors product exposure which over time, we expect to grow to support additional Brazilian listings, structured products, and solutions tailored to the region's rapidly developing investment market.""

Abu Dhabi-focused Solana infrastructure firm Solmate (SLMT) has signed a non-binding term sheet to acquire digital asset firm RockawayX in an all-stock deal that would create an institutional crypto group with more than $2 billion in assets and third-party stake.

The combined company would fold RockawayX's infrastructure, liquidity and asset management units into Solmate, which is shifting from a passive digital asset treasury to an operating crypto business, and keep on trading under the SLMT ticker.

The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2026, still requires definitive agreements, regulatory clearance and shareholder approval.

Solmate CEO Marco Santori would lead the group, while RockawayX chief Viktor Fischer would run the RockawayX subsidiary and serve as Solmate's executive chairman according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

RockawayX, the blockchain arm of venture capital firm Rockaway Capital, brings onchain market making, lending and ""solver"" services used by major cross-chain bridges like Wormhole and Debridge, plus venture and credit funds that together oversee about $1.04 billion, along with around $1.1 billion staked to its validators.

Solmate, which rebranded from Brera Holdings earlier this year, plans to use that stack to earn yield on its treasury and to back Solana-based markets that handle tokenized stocks, treasuries and futures.

The two firms unveiled Solana infrastructure in the U.A.E. in November allowing local investors can stake assets inside the region.

""As the combined entity's staked treasury grows, so would its ability to land transactions for high-frequency traders - all in addition to generating staking yield,"" the release said. ""Solmate's and RockawayX's infrastructure would provide these same services, not only for trading, but for everyday onchain transactions like consumer payments as well.""

SLMT shares traded almost 6% higher at $2.51 in pre-market trading on Thursday.

Malaysian authorities formed a joint task force using high-tech drones and police on the ground to find and shutdown nearly 14,000 illicit bitcoin BTC$93,325.36 mining rigs, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday.

Drones hover over buildings, searching for thermal heat signatures, while police on the ground scan areas with sensors that detect illicit electricity use. Neighbors often call in complaining of strange noises, only for police officials to find crypto mining rigs.

State-owned utility company Tenaga Nasional (TNB) recently reported that the illegal crypto miners have stolen $1.1 billion from the national grid since 2020.

""The risk of allowing such activities to happen is no longer about stealing,"" said Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, the deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, who chairs the panel. ""You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system.""

That $1.1 billion is enough to fund the basic food needs for over 567,000 people for a full year in Malaysia, based on U.S. Department of Agriculture's figures that the average Malaysian consumer spent approximately $1,940 annually on food in 2023. Alternatively, it is enough to supply electricity for a year to approximately 373,000 average-sized households in the Asian country, according to estimations by University Utara Malaysia.

This is not the first time Malaysian authorities announce a crackdown. In May, the number of electricity thefts soared by 300% between 2018 and end-2024, leading to the shutdown of nearly 2,400 illegal bitcoin mining operations.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is ushering in a new form of federally regulated crypto trading, having encouraged its regulated platforms to open up leveraged spot digital assets products, which is set to begin next week with Bitnomial.



The Bitnomial exchange is regulated by the U.S. derivatives watchdog as a designated contract market (DCM), meaning this new activity will be launching in a fully regulated space, following strong encouragement from the federal agency — including direct meetings with Acting Chairman Caroline Pham to help the process along when the federal government was shut down for a prolonged period.



""Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets,"" Pham said in a statement. ""Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.""



The move, which Pham called a ""historic milestone,"" tracks recommendations from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which had issued a report this year setting out a crypto agenda for U.S. regulators. Pham said the CFTC is ""finally using our decades-long existing authority"" to initiate this trading.



Chicago-based Bitnomial set the launch for next week. It's one of several regulated DCMs at the CFTC, also including Coinbase, Kalshi and Polymarket.

""Leveraged spot crypto trading is now available under the same regulatory framework as U.S. perpetuals, futures, and options,"" said Luke Hoersten, Founder and CEO of Bitnomial. 

The company said that such trading on a DCM ""means all orders, retail and institutional, receive equal and fair treatment with no preferential routing, no information advantage, and equal access to liquidity.""

This was one of the first agenda items of the CFTC's so-called ""crypto sprint"" to implement the administration's pro-crypto policy goals. It was among Pham's priorities as she waited for her permanent replacement as chairman, which could be coming soon as the Senate advances the confirmation process for Trump nominee Mike Selig.



Pham has been planning to leave the agency when the new chairman comes in, leaving that person alone in what's meant to be a five-member commission. The White House hasn't yet provided any other nominees to fill out the leadership, so the next chairman will take over the crypto policy surge solo.



Among the other initiatives include a push for tokenized collateral that will include stablecoins, which is expected to happen early next year, and a broad rulemaking that inserts blockchain technology into a range of CFTC regulations.

One of the gaping holes in U.S. federal regulation of crypto is that bitcoin and other major digital assets are considered commodities, but the CFTC doesn't have broad authority over spot market manipulation. So, the bulk of crypto trading is outside the  authority of any federal regulator, except in matters of fraud and market manipulation. 

Congress had set out to give the CFTC its spot-market powers in legislation that aims to fully regulate the crypto markets. But Pham had argued that the CFTC already had some limited authority to allow for leveraged activity on its futures exchanges.

Can We Image Alien Earths? This Newfound Object Could Show the Way

Using direct imaging, astronomers have found a brown dwarf that could help test technology for taking snapshots of Earth-like exoplanets

Astronomers have found what could become the first target for a crucial test of NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a soon-to-launch observatory that serves as a pathfinder mission for discovering Earth-like worlds around other stars.

In a pair of new studies, an international research team has revealed two newfound objects around nearby stars: a gas-giant exoplanet orbiting the star HIP 54515 and a brown dwarf around the star HIP 71618. It is the latter of these, the brown dwarf, that could prove the perfect test bed for Roman, says Thayne Currie, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas at San Antonio and co-author of the studies. Both discoveries relied on fresh observations from a planet-imaging instrument at Japan's Subaru Telescope in Hawaii, as well as archival data from the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft.

When it soars into orbit as early as next year, Roman will carry an instrument called a coronagraph, which is designed to blot out most of a star's bright glare so that the far fainter light from accompanying planets can be seen. Roman's coronagraph is a critical precursor for more ambitious starlight-blocking hardware planned to fly on another future NASA mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, which could launch in the late 2030s to discover, image and study potential Earth twins around dozens of sunlike stars.

To test Roman's coronagraph—and thus the feasibility of its planned follow-up—scientists need to show it can spot objects in close proximity to (but 10 million times fainter than) their host stars. The brown dwarf, Currie explains, is essentially a dim “failed star” that's neither too close nor too far from its stellar host, putting it at exactly the right distance and brightness for Roman to show its stuff.

“It's going to test technologies that we will need to be able to image an Earth,” Currie says.

The discoveries show just how far the search for worlds beyond our solar system has progressed, says Rebecca Charbonneau, a historian of science at the American Institute of Physics. In particular, the direct-imaging techniques used to discover these two objects mark a major step forward for the field, which still mostly relies on other, indirect methods, such as tracing wobbles in a star's celestial motion to find exoplanets.

“Direct imaging allows us to see these worlds themselves, which is historically significant not just as a technical milestone but as a shift in how we study distant planetary systems,” she says.

Have the canines acquired strange mutations living near the power plant?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor in northern Ukraine—then part of the Soviet Union—exploded, sending a massive plume of radiation into the sky. Nearly four decades later, the Chernobyl Power Plant and many parts of the surrounding area remain uninhabited—by humans, at least.

Animals of all kinds have thrived in humanity's absence. Living among radiation-resistant fauna are thousands of feral dogs, many of whom are descendants of pets left behind in the speedy evacuation of the area so many years ago. As the world's greatest nuclear disaster approaches its 40th anniversary, biologists are now taking a closer look at the animals located inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), which is about the size of Yosemite National Park, and investigating how decades of radiation exposure may have altered animals' genomes—and even, possibly, sped up evolution.

Scientists from the University of South Carolina and the National Human Genome Research Institute have begun examining the DNA of 302 feral dogs found in or around the CEZ to better understand how radiation may have altered their genomes. Their results were published in the journal Science Advances in 2023.

“Do they have mutations that they've acquired that allow them to live and breed successfully in this region?” co-author Elaine Ostrander, a dog genomics expert at the National Human Genome Research Institute, told The New York Times. “What challenges do they face and how have they coped genetically?”

The idea of radiation speeding up natural evolution isn't a new one. The practice of purposefully irradiating seeds in outer space to induce advantageous mutations, for example, is now a well-worn method for developing crops that are well-suited for a warming world.

Scientists have been analyzing certain animals living within the CEZ for years, including bacteria, rodents, and even birds. One study back in 2016 found that Eastern tree frogs (Hyla orientalis), which are usually a green color, were more commonly black within the CEZ. The biologists theorize that the frogs experienced a beneficial mutation in melanin—pigments responsible for skin color—that helped dissipate and neutralize some of the surrounding radiation.

This made scientists ponder: could something similar be happening to Chernobyl's wild dogs?

The study uncovered that the feral dogs living near the Chernobyl Power Plant showed distinct genetic differences from dogs living only some 10 miles away in nearby Chernobyl City. While this may seem to heavily imply that these dogs have undergone some type of rapid mutation or evolution due to radiation exposure, this study is only a first step in proving that hypothesis. 

However, one environmental scientist, speaking with Science News, says that these studies can be tricky business, largely due to the fact that sussing out radiation-induced mutations from other effects, like inbreeding, is incredibly difficult.

And in the time since the original study was published, other researchers have dug into this question and come up with competing results. In fact, a study published nearly two years later confidently asserts that we can cross radiation off the list of explanations for the current state of the Chernobyl canine population. Published in the journal PLOS One by scientists from North Carolina State University and Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York, this new genetic analysis looked at the chromosomal level, the genome level, and even the nucleotides of the Chernobyl dogs, and found no abnormalities indicative of radiation-induced mutation. 

To establish a baseline for comparison, the team compared the genome of Chernobyl City dogs located 10 miles from the CEZ to dogs found in regions of Russia, Poland, and other nearby countries. Once they determined that the populations were genetically similar, they then used the Chernobyl City dogs as a representative control for their study. Of course, the task wasn't simple, as more than a couple dozen dog generations have past since the original pups that witnessed to the Chernobyl meltdown in 1986. 

“We know that, for example, exposure to high doses of radiation can introduce instability from the chromosomal level on down,” Matthew Breen, senior author of the study from North Carolina State University, said in a press statement. “While this dog population is 30 or more generations removed from the one present during the 1986 disaster, mutations would likely still be detectable if they conferred a survival advantage to those original dogs. But we didn't find any such evidence in these dogs.”

That said, the 2023 study still provides a template for further investigation into the effects of radiation on larger mammals, as the DNA of dogs roaming the Chernobyl Power Plant and nearby Chernobyl City can be compared to dogs living in non-irradiated areas. Despite a current lack of firm conclusions, the study has shown once again that an area that—by all rights—should be a wasteland has become an unparalleled scientific opportunity to understand radiation and its impact on natural evolution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Discovered the Bizarre Skull of an Ancient Christian Knight","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69561987/knight-elongated-skull/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

The elongated skull was likely caused by a genetic condition, but it evidently didn't get in the way of the individual's career as a knight—he died in battle.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Sometime between the 13th and 15th centuries, a knight suffered defeat in combat. That nameless knight had a genetic condition that affected his head and brain—but that didn't stop him from riding out to battle. It would be centuries before archaeologists unearthed what was left of his remains, including fragments of a coffin, scattered bones, and a skull that was unexpectedly elongated.

The Spanish town of Zorita de los Canes was the stronghold of the Knights of Calatrava—who believed themselves to be sons of Christ and successors of Saint Peter, dedicated to keeping Christendom from collapsing—during the age of the Crusades. Founded in 1158, the Order of Calatrava was tasked with defending the borders of their home turf of Castille, and later Aragon, against Muslim forces from North Africa who were constantly waging attacks against them. Warrior monks in white robes joined forces with nobles and laypeople to drive out invaders. 

Among the ruins of what was once a fortified castle now rests a medieval archaeological site, including a cemetery of knights who served their king. Biological anthropologist Carme Rissech from the University of Rovira i Virgili in Reus, Spain, had been excavating the Counts' Courtyard cemetery with her research team when she unearthed the bizarrely shaped skull—it was found to be ultradolichocephalic, meaning that it was especially long, narrow and flat—prompting an investigation. There was some doubt about how this individual was able to rise to knighthood, but he was still buried besides other fallen knights who had no cranial deformations. Lesions to his head suggest that he succumbed to battle wounds like the most of the others buried with him.

“Despite the craniofacial abnormalities, there is no skeletal evidence of severe cognitive impairment,” Rissech said in a study recently published in the journal Heritage. “The individual's postcranial remains exhibit signs of an active lifestyle, which could be consistent with that of a warrior. Unhealed perimortem trauma caused by a bladed weapon (penetrating the left temple and occipital region) and a blunt force injury to the left tibia suggest that he could have died in battle.”

Rissech ruled out several conditions before tentatively diagnosing this individual with Crouzon syndrome, which causes the sutures in a baby's skull to fuse too soon (the skulls of newborns have open sutures that help them through the birth canal, and in the average human, these sutures gradually close until they completely fuse around age 3). Three of the sutures in the skull of this knight had fused prematurely, causing a phenomenon called craniosynostosis (a deformity of the skull caused by this early cosure). Other symptoms of Crouzon syndrome include hypertelorism (in which the eyes are especially far apart), a narrow back of the nasal cavity that can impede breathing, inverted teeth from a receding upper jaw, a sunken palette, and hearing loss. Despite such difficulties, Crouzon Syndrome does not typically affect cognitive ability, so the deceased individual wouldn't have encountered any mental impediment to knighthood.

Without treatment, Crouzon Syndrome can be fatal in childhood, but this newfound skull is evidence that even in an era with only rudimentary medicine, some individuals with this condition did survive to adulthood and beyond. So, even though surgery for this condition would not exist for hundreds of years, the unnamed knight defied the odds and was estimated to have been between 45 and 47 years old at his time of death.

More proof that this individual was involved in the military surfaced in a mark left in the collarbone by a ligament that had long since deteriorated. This is known to be common in people who carry shoulder bags, but in the bones of the knight, might instead indicate the carrying of a heavy shield and weapons slung over one shoulder. While his lower legs were apparently not used much, marks on the femur indicated muscular thighs often seen in those who ride horses.

“This case stands out for its rarity and significance,” said Rissech. “It documents a possible adult case of Crouzon syndrome in a possible medieval knight, who not only survived into middle age but also could have served actively in warfare.”

Turning off the genetic switch to its respiratory system might finally eliminate the bacteria behind tuberculosis.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Before COVID-19, there was tuberculosis. The often fatal respiratory infection that goes back at least 9,000 years ravaged Europe during the 18th and 19th century, claiming thousands of lives every year, and despite its decline in some regions (and despite it being both treatable and curable), what the CDC considers the world's deadliest infectious disease remains an epidemic in other parts of the world. 

Tuberculosis has stealthily been on the rise even where it was thought to have been eliminated. Caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it has seen a resurgence in the U.S., emerging in California, Kansas, Maine, North Carolina, and New York. Deaths from what was once called “the king's evil” only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people avoided health care centers for fear of contracting the coronavirus. What was previously unknown is that M. tuberculosis has a genetic Achilles heel—one that scientists are now all too eager to take advantage of.

Shelley Haydel—an infectious disease microbiologist from Arizona State University—and her research team have now found that the deadly bacterium has a molecular system it literally cannot live without. Known as PrrAB, the system functions as the microbe's heart and lungs, and if it shuts down, so does tuberculosis. Haydel attacked it with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), which can repress certain genes, and when PrrAB was switched off, the bacterium's life was over. 

“The essentiality of the PrrAB two-component system (TCS) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis positions it as a promising therapeutic target, prompting investigation into its potential as a universal drug target across mycobacterial species,” she said in a study recently published in American Chemical Society: Infectious Diseases.

While not all mycobacteria cultured in Haydel's lab were taken down by the removal of PrrAB, it was effective against tuberculosis in vitro. PrrAB regulates genes necessary for respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, a process through which oxygen is reduced (gaining electrons and losing its oxidation state) to create bonds for the cell's primary energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Repressing PrrAB with CRISPRi turned out to be lethal, and reduced the amount of bacteria in a culture nearly a hundred times. (Considering how these bacteria infect the lungs, it's a bit ironic that eliminating them involves targeting their own respiratory system.)

There is another line of defense against tuberculosis. Diarylthiazole-48 (DAT-48)—previously known to be an experimental anti-tuberculosis compound—kills the bacteria by inhibiting PrrAB. Using it together with CRISPRi repression killed even more tuberculosis bacteria, since knocking out PrrAB makes the bacteria more sensitive to DAT-48. Even without PrrAB repression, the researchers found that using DAT-48 together with some tuberculosis drugs (such as bedaquiline or telacebec) made it more potent, showing that the bacteria's susceptibility to DAT-48 is somehow linked to how PrrAB regulates its respiratory system.

“DAT-48, an experimental anti-TB compound, acted within the PrrAB-regulated pathwayexhibiting potent activity against M. tuberculosis and synergy with respiratory inhibitors,” Haydel said. “Collectively, these results highlight PrrAB as a central regulatory hub and validate DAT-48 as a promising candidate for targeted antimycobacterial therapy.”

While these treatments have not been tested on humans yet, if they prove to be successful in vivo, tuberculosis might just go the way of smallpox and vanish.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists capture flu viruses surfing into human cells in real time","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251204024226.htm","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 08:48:02 GMT","

Fever, aching limbs and a runny nose -- as winter returns, so too does the flu. The disease is triggered by influenza viruses, which enter our body through droplets and then infect vulnerable cells.

A research team from Switzerland and Japan has taken an exceptionally close look at how this virus behaves. Using a microscopy approach they created themselves, the scientists can zoom in on the outer surface of human cells in a Petri dish. This setup has enabled them to watch, live and in sharp detail, the moment an influenza virus penetrates a living cell.

Under the direction of Yohei Yamauchi, Professor of Molecular Medicine at ETH Zurich, the group discovered something unexpected. The cells do not simply sit idle while the influenza virus approaches. Instead, they appear to make an effort to seize it. ""The infection of our body cells is like a dance between virus and cell,"" says Yamauchi.

Viral Surfing on the Cell Surface

Although cells gain nothing from being infected, the interaction looks active because the virus exploits a routine cellular uptake system that the cells cannot do without. This system normally brings essential substances such as hormones, cholesterol or iron into the cell.

To begin infection, an influenza virus attaches to specific molecules on the cell surface. The process resembles surfing on the membrane. The virus moves along the surface, latching onto one molecule after another, until it arrives at a site rich in these receptors. A spot with many receptors side by side provides the most efficient entry route.

When the cell's receptors detect that the virus has attached, the membrane begins forming a small indentation at that spot. A structural protein named clathrin shapes and supports this deepening pocket. As the pocket expands, it wraps around the virus and forms a vesicle. The cell then pulls this vesicle inward, where the coat dissolves and releases the virus.

Why Earlier Microscopy Fell Short

Previous attempts to study this crucial moment in infection relied on methods like electron microscopy, which require destroying the cells to obtain an image. As a result, they captured only single moments in time. Fluorescence microscopy, another common tool, offers live imaging but at low spatial resolution.

ViViD-AFM Sheds Light on Viral Entry

The new method, which merges atomic force microscopy (AFM) with fluorescence microscopy, is called virus-view dual confocal and AFM (ViViD-AFM). This combined approach makes it possible to track the fine-scale movements involved as the virus enters the cell.

With this tool, the researchers demonstrated that cells assist the virus at several stages of entry. They summon important clathrin proteins to the site where the virus is attached. The membrane at that point also pushes upward, almost as if trying to seize the virus. These wave-like motions intensify if the virus tries to drift away from the surface.

Implications for Antiviral Research

Because ViViD-AFM allows scientists to observe infection while it is happening, it offers a valuable way to test antiviral drug candidates directly in cell cultures. The team notes that the technique may also be applied to studying other viruses or even vaccines, giving researchers a real-time view of how these particles interact with cells.

Gravitational-wave detectors may soon get a major performance boost, thanks to a new instrumentation advance led by physicist Jonathan Richardson of the University of California, Riverside. In a paper published in the journal Optica, Richardson and his colleagues describe FROSTI, a full-scale prototype that successfully controls laser wavefronts at extremely high power inside the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO.

LIGO is an observatory that measures gravitational waves -- tiny ripples in spacetime created by massive accelerating objects such as colliding black holes. It was the first facility to directly detect these waves, providing strong support for Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Using two 4-km-long laser interferometers located in Washington and Louisiana, LIGO senses incredibly small disturbances, giving scientists a new way to study black holes, cosmology, and matter under extreme conditions.

LIGO relies on mirrors that are among the most carefully engineered components in modern science. Each mirror is 34 cm across, 20 cm thick, and weighs about 40 kg. To detect distortions in spacetime that are smaller than 1/1,000th the diameter of a proton, these mirrors must be held almost perfectly still. Even tiny vibrations or environmental noise can drown out the faint gravitational-wave signals that LIGO is trying to detect.

""At the heart of our innovation is a novel adaptive optics device designed to precisely reshape the surfaces of LIGO's main mirrors under laser powers exceeding 1 megawatt -- more than a billion times stronger than a typical laser pointer and nearly five times the power LIGO uses today,"" said Richardson, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy. ""This technology opens a new pathway for the future of gravitational-wave astronomy. It's a crucial step toward enabling the next generation of detectors like Cosmic Explorer, which will see deeper into the universe than ever before.""

FROSTI: precision thermal control for LIGO mirrors

FROSTI, short for FROnt Surface Type Irradiator, is a precision wavefront control system designed to cancel out distortions produced when intense laser light heats LIGO's optics. Existing systems can only make relatively coarse corrections, but FROSTI uses a more advanced thermal projection method to apply fine, higher-order adjustments to the mirror surfaces. This level of control is essential for the more demanding performance requirements of future detectors.

Despite its icy name, FROSTI operates by warming the surface of the mirror in a very controlled way that returns it to its ideal optical shape. By using thermal radiation, the system projects a carefully tailored heat pattern onto the mirror. This smooths out optical distortions while avoiding extra noise that could be mistaken for real gravitational-wave signals.

Why better optics matter for gravitational-wave astronomy

Gravitational waves were first detected by LIGO in 2015, marking the beginning of a new era in astronomy. To fully exploit this new way of observing the universe, however, upcoming detectors need to see more distant events and measure them with greater clarity.

""That means pushing the limits on both laser power and quantum-level precision,"" Richardson said. ""The problem is, increasing laser power tends to destroy the delicate quantum states we rely on to improve signal clarity. Our new technology solves this tension by making sure the optics remain undistorted, even at megawatt power levels.""

With this approach, the new technology is expected to expand the observable gravitational-wave universe by a factor of 10. That increase in reach could allow astronomers to detect millions of black hole and neutron star mergers across cosmic history, and to study them with unprecedented detail.

Looking Ahead: LIGO A# and Cosmic Explorer

FROSTI is expected to be a key component of LIGO A#, a planned upgrade that will act as a testbed for the next-generation observatory known as Cosmic Explorer. The current prototype has been demonstrated on a 40-kg LIGO mirror, but the same principles can be scaled up and adapted to the much larger 440-kg mirrors proposed for Cosmic Explorer.

""The current prototype is just the beginning,"" Richardson said. ""We're already designing new versions capable of correcting even more complex optical distortions. This is the R&D foundation for the next 20 years of gravitational-wave astronomy.""

Richardson conducted the research in collaboration with scientists at UCR, MIT, and Caltech.

The work was supported by a grant to Richardson from the National Science Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Gas stoves are filling millions of homes with hidden toxic air","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251203004724.htm","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 02:09:26 GMT","

For many people in the United States, spending time indoors does not guarantee protection from harmful air pollution. A new study led by Stanford University and published Dec. 2 in PNAS Nexus reports that gas and propane stoves release significant amounts of nitrogen dioxide. This pollutant has been associated with asthma, obstructive pulmonary disease, preterm birth, diabetes, and lung cancer. According to the research, switching from gas to electric stoves lowers nitrogen dioxide exposure by more than one quarter nationwide and by about half for people who use their stoves most frequently. Earlier studies documented nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but this work is the first to examine both indoor and outdoor exposure across the entire country.

""We know that outdoor air pollution harms our health, but we assume our indoor air is safe."" said study senior author Rob Jackson, the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor in Earth System Science at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. ""Our research shows that if you use a gas stove, you're often breathing as much nitrogen dioxide pollution indoors from your stove as you are from all outdoor sources combined.""

Indoor pollution can be as dangerous as outdoor emissions

Outdoor air pollution contributes to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. each year and leads to millions of new cases of childhood asthma worldwide. Laws such as the U.S. Clean Air Act have helped reduce outdoor pollution, but indoor air remains largely unregulated even though it can pose similar risks. This new analysis is the first nationwide evaluation of how much nitrogen dioxide people encounter from both indoor and outdoor sources, including gas stoves, vehicle traffic, and electricity generation.

A 2024 investigation by the same research team found that gas stoves release nitrogen dioxide at unsafe levels that persist for hours after cooking ends.

Additional studies from several of the same authors have identified gas stoves as a source of benzene, a known carcinogen linked to leukemia and other blood disorders.

""It's time to redirect our focus to what's happening inside our homes, especially as families spend more time indoors,"" said study lead author Yannai Kashtan, an air quality scientist at PSE Healthy Energy who was a graduate student in Jackson's lab while conducting the research.

Mapping indoor and outdoor nitrogen dioxide exposure

To understand how people are exposed to nitrogen dioxide, the team combined indoor air measurements with outdoor pollution data, information on 133 million residential buildings, and statistics on household behavior. These data allowed researchers to determine where pollution originates and how it affects human health. The team also created national maps that show long-term and short-term nitrogen dioxide exposure by zip code for both indoor and outdoor environments.

For most people in the U.S., outdoor sources such as cars and trucks still account for the majority of nitrogen dioxide exposure. However, the maps showed that 22 million Americans, particularly those in smaller homes and in rural areas, experience nitrogen dioxide levels above recommended long-term limits from cooking with gas. In rural regions, stoves play a proportionally larger role in overall nitrogen dioxide exposure. Meanwhile, total exposure is highest in major cities, where outdoor nitrogen dioxide levels are already elevated and smaller living spaces allow stove emissions to accumulate more easily.

The study also found that the greatest short-term nitrogen dioxide spikes occur indoors and are directly caused by gas stove use. These sharp increases do not come from outdoor pollution but from concentrated bursts produced during cooking.

Who benefits most from cleaner cooking options

Efforts such as rebates and tax credits that promote electric stoves and other clean cooking technologies could significantly reduce harmful indoor pollution. These measures may have the greatest impact in smaller homes, rental properties where tenants cannot choose their appliances, and communities facing financial barriers to adopting electric stoves. Previous Stanford-led research showed that long-term NO2 exposure is 60 percent higher in American Indian and Alaska Native households and 20 percent higher in Black and Hispanic or Latino households compared to the national average. Many of these groups already face high outdoor nitrogen dioxide levels from vehicle exhaust and industrial activity.

""As we strive for cleaner air and healthier living, we should prioritize indoor air quality,"" Jackson said. ""Switching to electric stoves is a positive step towards cleaner cooking and better health.""

Jackson is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and the Precourt Institute for Energy. 

Other coauthors of the study include Chenghao Wang of the University of Oklahoma; and Kari Nadeau of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The study was funded by the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and its Department of Earth System Science, and Stanford's Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program.

Researchers led by Tzyy-Nan Huang and Ming-Hui Lin at Academia Sinica in Taiwan have found that a low-dose combination of zinc, serine, and branched-chain amino acids may ease behavioral difficulties in three mouse models of autism. The study, published December 2nd in the open-access journal PLOS Biology, reports that these supplements work together to strengthen communication between neurons and lead to better social interactions in the animals.

Exploring How Nutrition Influences ASD

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with atypical neural development that disrupts how neurons form connections. Nutrition is also recognized as a factor that can influence ASD. Zinc, serine, and branched-chain amino acids have each been linked to potential improvements in neural connectivity. The researchers proposed that combining the three could produce a stronger effect than any single nutrient and might reduce the amount of each needed. To test this, they worked with three mouse models of ASD and examined synapse-related protein levels, tracked amygdala activity using calcium imaging, and evaluated social behavior.

In their experiments, the combined supplements shifted synaptic protein expression in autistic mice so that it more closely resembled that of typical mice. The mixture also reduced the abnormal overactivity of neurons in the amygdala. Social behaviors improved as well, but only when the nutrients were given as a mixture; the same doses of individual supplements produced no measurable change. Two additional autism mouse models showed the same pattern, indicating that the three nutrients must work together to be effective at low doses.

Researchers Highlight Broader Potential of Multi-Nutrient Approaches

Yi-Ping Hsueh explained, ""As hundreds of genes are implicated in autism, each with distinct molecular functions, a 'one gene-one therapy' approach is impractical for addressing the complexity of ASD. Our findings show that a low-dose nutrient mixture containing zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and serine -- working synergistically to improve synaptic function and social behaviors across three ASD mouse models -- offers a safer and more practical strategy for long-term, broad application, even beginning in childhood.""

Tzyy-Nan Huang, a first author of the study, added, ""High doses of individual nutrient supplements such as zinc, branched-chain amino acids, and serine can improve synaptic function through different mechanisms, but low doses of any single nutrient alone are ineffective. It is exciting to see that combining these nutrients at low doses successfully restores synaptic proteomes and enhances social behaviors in three different mouse models of autism.""

Rapid Neural Circuit Changes Observed

Co-first author Ming-Hui Lin said, ""I was thrilled to observe that just seven days of treatment with the nutrient mixture significantly modulated neuronal circuit activity and connectivity in real time. These results provide strong support for the beneficial effects of low-dose nutrient supplement combinations.""

This work was supported by grants from Academia Sinica, Taiwan (AS-IA-111-L01 to Y.-P.H.) and the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (NSTC 113-2326-B-001-008 and 114-2326-B-001-005 to Y.-P.H.). The funding organizations did not influence the study design, data collection and analysis, the decision to publish, or the preparation of the manuscript.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A simple oxygen hack creates 7 new ceramic materials","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251204024238.htm","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:13:34 GMT","

Sometimes, having less oxygen truly makes a difference. By lowering oxygen levels during synthesis, a group of materials scientists at Penn State succeeded in creating seven previously unknown high-entropy oxides, or HEOs. These ceramics contain five or more metals and are being explored for uses in energy storage, electronic devices and protective coatings.

During the development of these materials, the team also outlined a broader framework for designing future materials. Their findings were published in Nature Communications.

""By carefully removing oxygen from the atmosphere of the tube furnace during synthesis, we stabilized two metals, iron and manganese, into the ceramics that would not otherwise stabilize in the ambient atmosphere,"" said corresponding and first author Saeed Almishal, a research professor at Penn State working with Jon-Paul Maria, the Dorothy Pate Enright Professor of Materials Science.

Early Breakthroughs and Machine Learning Discovery

Almishal first achieved stability in a material containing manganese and iron by adjusting oxygen levels in a composition he designated as J52. That sample included magnesium, cobalt, nickel, manganese and iron. After that initial success, he used newly developed machine learning capabilities that can rapidly evaluate thousands of possible formulations. With those tools, he identified six additional metal combinations capable of forming HEOs.

Working alongside undergraduate researchers who helped process, fabricate and characterize samples, Almishal produced solid ceramic pellets representing all seven new HEO compositions. These students were supported by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Penn State's Center for Nanoscale Science, a U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center.

""In a single step, we stabilized all seven compositions that are possible given our current framework,"" Almishal said. ""Although this was previously treated this as a complex problem in the field of HEOs, the solution was simple in the end. With a careful understanding of the fundamentals of material and ceramic synthesis science, and particularly the principles of thermodynamics, we found the answer.""

How Oxygen Levels Shape the Materials

To stabilize these ceramics, manganese and iron atoms must remain in the 2+ oxidation state, forming what is known as a rock salt structure where each atom bonds with only two oxygen atoms. According to Almishal, this does not happen under typical oxygen-rich conditions. If synthesized in a normal atmosphere, manganese and iron would continue binding with oxygen and shift to a higher oxidation state, preventing the material from forming correctly. Reducing the oxygen in the tube furnace limits how many oxygen atoms are available, allowing the desired rock salt structure to form.

""The main rule we followed in synthesizing these materials is the role that oxygen plays in stabilizing such ceramic materials,"" Almishal said.

Confirming Structure and Planning Future Experiments

To verify that manganese and iron truly remained in the intended oxidation state, Almishal collaborated with researchers at Virginia Tech. Their team used an advanced imaging approach that examines how atoms absorb X-rays. By studying the resulting data, they could confirm the oxidation states of individual elements and demonstrate that the materials were stable.

The next stage of work will involve testing the magnetic properties of all seven new HEOs. The researchers also hope to use the same thermodynamic principles for oxygen control to stabilize other types of materials that are currently difficult to synthesize.

""This paper, which has already been accessed online thousands of times, seems to resonate with researchers because of its simplicity,"" Almishal said. ""Although we focus on rock salt HEOs, our methods provide a broad adaptable framework for enabling uncharted, promising chemically disordered complex oxides.""

Undergraduate Recognition and Research Collaboration

Because of his significant contributions in the lab, co-author and undergraduate materials science and engineering major Matthew Furst was invited to present the findings at the American Ceramic Society's (ACerS) Annual Meeting with Materials Science and Technology 2025, which took place Sept. 28 through Oct. 1 in Columbus, Ohio. This invitation is typically extended to faculty or senior graduate students.

""I am so grateful for the opportunities that I have had on this project and to be involved in every step of the research and publication process,"" Furst said. ""Being able to present this material to a broad audience as an invited talk reflects my involvement and the excellent guidance I have received from my mentors. It means a lot to me to develop important communication skills as an undergraduate student, and I look forward to pushing myself further in the future!""

Team Members and Support

In addition to Almishal, Maria and Furst, the Penn State research team included undergraduate students Joseph Petruska and Dhiya Srikanth; graduate students Yueze Tan and Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari; and Jacob Sivak, who recently earned a doctorate in chemistry with a materials science focus. Faculty collaborators included Nasim Alem, professor of materials science and engineering; Susan Sinnott, professor of materials science and engineering and of chemistry; and Long-Qing Chen, the Hamer Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, professor of engineering science and mechanics and of mathematics.

From Virginia Tech, the co-authors were Christina Rost, assistant professor of materials science and engineering, and graduate student Gerald Bejger.

The Penn State Center for Nanoscale Science, an U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, provided support for this research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hornet-eating frog shows remarkable venom resistance","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251204024228.htm","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 11:13:33 GMT","

A frog with an unexpectedly strong resistance to venom has been identified, and it routinely eats hornets despite the insects' dangerous stingers. Researchers believe this species may become a useful model organism for exploring how animals develop tolerance to venom.

For many people, even glimpsing a hornet's stinger is enough to cause alarm. Yet certain animals, including some birds, spiders, and frogs, regularly prey on adult hornets. A hornet sting can trigger sharp pain, tissue damage, and serious systemic problems such as the destruction of red blood cells and cardiac dysfunction, any of which can be fatal. What has remained uncertain is whether hornet-eating animals actually withstand the venom or simply avoid being stung. According to Kobe University ecologist Shinji Sugiura, ""Although stomach-content studies had shown that pond frogs sometimes eat hornets, no experimental work had ever examined how this occurs.""

Testing Whether Frogs Endure Hornet Stings

To investigate whether pond frogs evade or tolerate these potentially lethal stings, Sugiura presented individual adult frogs with workers of three hornet species, Vespa simillima, V. analis, and V. mandarinia, in controlled laboratory trials. Each frog was tested only once and paired with hornets that matched its size, with larger frogs being paired with Asian giant hornet (V. mandarinia) workers.

As reported in the journal Ecosphere, Sugiura found clear evidence that adult pond frogs actively launched attacks on workers of all three hornet species. Even more striking, 93%, 87%, and 79% of the frogs succeeded in consuming V. simillima, V. analis, and V. mandarinia, respectively, despite being stung inside the mouth or even in the eyes. Sugiura notes that ""While a mouse of similar size can die from a single sting, the frogs showed no noticeable harm even after being stung repeatedly. This extraordinary level of resistance to powerful venom makes the discovery both unique and exciting.""

What Makes a Sting Painful or Lethal

Earlier research has shown that the pain caused by stinging insects does not always match the lethality of their venom. Some bees, wasps, and ants deliver extremely painful but non-lethal stings, while others inflict minimal pain despite possessing highly toxic venom. This suggests that the frogs in the study may have developed a dual resistance to both the painful and harmful effects of hornet venom, allowing them to successfully hunt and consume hornet workers.

Future Questions About Venom Tolerance

Sugiura explains that this finding raises major questions for future research. Scientists now hope to determine whether pond frogs possess physiological traits, such as physical barriers or specific proteins, that reduce the pain and toxicity of hornet venom, or whether hornet toxins are simply ineffective in amphibians that rarely attack hornet colonies. These frogs may therefore become important model organisms for studying how vertebrates develop resistance to venom and pain.

This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (grants JP23K18027 and JP24K02099).

Here we established an in vivo CRISPR screening pipeline using genetically editable progenitor cells to dissect macrophage regulation in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS). Screening over 100 cytokine receptors and signaling molecules identified interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and transforming growth factor-β as essential regulators of macrophage polarization in vivo. Single-cell transcriptomics confirmed that transferred progenitor cells generate all blood-derived CNS myeloid cell populations, enabling Perturb-seq analysis of cytokine actions in neuroinflammation. Combined with biosensor expression, our approach allows monitoring cytokine effects on myeloid cell migration, debris phagocytosis and oxidative activity in vivo. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed conserved neuroinflammatory cytokine signatures across myeloid populations, CNS compartments and species, elucidating cytokine cues shaping myeloid function in the cerebrospinal fluid and parenchyma of individuals with MS. This versatile pipeline thus provides a scalable framework for high-resolution analysis of macrophage states and uncovers the cytokine signals that underlie their regulation in MS and MS models.

MS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of adaptive and innate immune cells into the CNS, resulting in demyelination and axonal loss1. Among the infiltrating immune cells, macrophages are the most abundant2, and their numbers correlate with the extent of tissue damage3,4. In experimental models, monocyte-derived macrophages are critical for disease manifestation and progression5,6,7 as they secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, proteolytic enzymes, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that exacerbate tissue damage8,9. Conversely, macrophages also contribute to repair by clearing myelin debris, remodeling tissue and releasing trophic factors10,11. These divergent roles illustrate the remarkable plasticity of macrophages, which adopt context-dependent polarization states shaped by their microenvironment and cellular condition12,13,14. In MS models, macrophages transition from an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-positive, lesion-promoting phenotype to a lesion-resolving state characterized by arginase-1 (Arg1) expression8,15. However, the molecular cues that instruct these transitions in vivo remain incompletely defined, particularly within the inflamed CNS.

Recently, pooled CRISPR screens have shown to be capable of identifying the essential signaling components that underlie complex cellular phenotypes16,17. In vitro, such pooled CRISPR screens have helped to comprehensively dissect important macrophage functions including regulation of their survival and phagocytic capabilities18,19; yet, these techniques have not enabled CRISPR screening of macrophages in an inflamed tissue environment. Here, we established a rapid, versatile and scalable in vivo CRISPR screening approach that allows functional analysis of more than 100 genes in myeloid cells in a single experiment. We used this approach to deconstruct the regulation of macrophage states in MS models and identified four essential cytokines that instruct macrophage polarization in neuroinflammation.

To dissect the cytokine signals that drive macrophage states in neuroinflammatory lesions, we established a new approach to perform pooled CRISPR knockout (KO) screens in monocyte-derived macrophages in vivo using Hoxb8FL cells, a hematopoietic progenitor line20 that can be easily expanded and gene edited in culture. We incubated hBCL2-overexpressing Hoxb8FL Cas9 cells transduced with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) retrovirus (Hoxb8FL cells) in vitro with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) for 48 h to initiate myeloid differentiation, and then injected them intravenously (i.v.) into mice 8–9 days after immunization with MOG1–125 (Fig. 1a). This allowed the primed Hoxb8FL-derived cells to differentiate into CD45+CD11b+ myeloid cells in vivo before CNS lesions form and first experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) symptoms become apparent around 12 days after immunization. Indeed, Hoxb8FL-derived cells were detectable based on their eGFP expression in blood, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and exhibited similar expression of monocyte genes in the blood, and of macrophage surface markers including F4/80 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II in peripheral lymphoid tissues, as endogenous myeloid cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c–h). Notably, Hoxb8FL-derived CD11b+ cells also readily entered spinal EAE lesions in a CCR2-dependent manner where they made up about 15% of the CD11b+ cells and showed comparable distribution in the lesion to endogenous CD11b+ cells. The cell transfer did not affect the overall disease course (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1i,l–o), and Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells did not contribute to the pool of resident meningeal and perivascular macrophages of the spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 1j,k). In the EAE lesions, Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells polarized into iNOS+ and Arg1+ expressing cell populations, the transcriptomes of which closely correlated to the corresponding endogenous macrophage populations (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1p,q).

To resolve the cytokine regulation of macrophage phenotypes in neuroinflammatory lesions, we performed a pooled CRISPR screen based on the transfer of Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells. We first constructed a CRISPR library of 343 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), with three sgRNAs per gene and 15 non-targeting controls, to target 64 cytokine receptors and 45 of their downstream signaling mediators. We then transduced Hoxb8FL cells in vitro at a multiplicity of infection < 0.3, to ensure a single sgRNA transduced each cell. We selected infected cells, keeping the library coverage at a minimum of 100 cells containing each sgRNA (100× coverage). After in vitro pre-differentiation, we injected the cells into mice with EAE and about 6 days later, around the peak of EAE symptoms, we isolated Hoxb8FL-derived CD45 + CD11b+ myeloid cells from the bone marrow, and iNOS− Arg1−, iNOS+ and Arg1+ Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells from the spinal cord by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Fig. 1e). We then compared the relative distribution of sgRNAs across these cell populations as depletion of sgRNAs in a given population indicates an essential role for the respective targeted genes in the induction of the corresponding cell state. Indeed our results showed that: signaling through CCR2 alone was required for CNS entry of phagocytes (Fig. 1f); the interferon gamma (IFNγ) receptor (IFNGR) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors (TNFR) were required for iNOS+ polarization, which was decreased by signaling through the TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFBR1; Fig. 1g); while Arg1+ polarization was promoted by the TGFBR1 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor (CSF2R), and inhibited by the IFNGR1 (Fig. 1h).

We confirmed these results by performing single-gene knockouts in Hoxb8FL cells and compared the polarization of Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells deficient for a given cytokine receptor with co-transferred control-edited Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells (Fig. 2a). These experiments confirmed that signaling via the IFNGR1 and the TNFR1 was required for iNOS+ polarization, while signaling through the TGFBR1 and the CSF2RA promoted Arg1+ polarization (Fig. 2b–i and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Single-gene knockouts further confirmed that cytokines including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, which induce Arg1+ polarization in vitro21, are not required for Arg1+ polarization in vivo, at least in this model at this disease time point (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f). Next, we leveraged our CRISPR screen to define the downstream signaling pathway components that are essential for transducing cytokine effects on macrophage polarization. We found that JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 are required to mediate the effects of IFNGR, while IKK2 (Ikbkb), the key kinase mediating canonical nuclear factor-κB activation, is the only essential component of TNFR1 downstream signaling; moreover, only the transcription factor SMAD4 is essential for mediating the effects of TGFBR1 on both iNOS+ and Arg1+ polarization (Fig. 2b–i). Taken together, four cytokine receptors, IFNGR1, TNFR1, TGFBR1 and CSF2RA, and defined components of their downstream signaling pathways, are essential for establishing iNOS+ and Arg1+ macrophage polarization in neuroinflammatory lesions in the active MOG EAE model.

To determine which of these cytokine regulation pathways were unique to this particular MS model and which might be more universal, we repeated the screen in a passive EAE model induced by the transfer of MOG-reactive IL-17-producing helper T (TH17) cells. We transferred CRISPR-edited Hoxb8FL cells at the onset of disease symptoms and isolated Arg1+ and Arg1− Hoxb8FL-derived macrophages 6 days later as at this time point during lesion resolution most macrophages were Arg1+ (Extended Data Fig. 3a).

Our results showed that—as in the active MOG EAE model—TGFBR supported Arg1+ polarization, while IFNGR1 reduced Arg1+ polarization; similarly, the effects of TGFBR were mediated by the transcription factor SMAD4, while the effects of IFNGR1 relied on STAT1. However, in contrast to the MOG EAE model, Arg1+ polarization in the TH17 transfer model was not affected by CSF2R deletion but instead was limited by interfering with IL-4/IL-13 signaling, at the level of either IL13RA or the transcription factor STAT6. Furthermore, in the TH17 transfer EAE model, Arg1+ polarization was also inhibited by type I interferon signaling mediated by IFNAR1 (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Taken together, our findings indicate that IFNγ and TGFβ reciprocally regulate macrophage polarization across MS models while the regulatory effects of other cytokines—among them GM-CSF and IL-4/IL-13–depend on the inflammatory context and thus might differ between lesion types and/or disease stages.

To obtain a higher resolved understanding of these essential cytokine regulators, we first generated bone-marrow-derived macrophages, exposed them to different combinations of cytokines in vitro, and subjected them to transcriptional analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4). As predicted by our screen results, IFNγ and TNF acted synergistically to induce iNOS+ polarization, while TGFβ and GM-CSF collaborated during the induction of Arg1+ polarization: however, these cytokines did so by inducing distinct, cytokine-specific transcriptional modules (Extended Data Fig. 4). Notably, the highest proportion of Arg1+ cells was induced by the combination of all four cytokines, which may be related to the observation that myeloid cells can transition between MiNOS and MArg1 states in vivo and in vitro8.

Therefore, we next aimed to uncover the effect of these cytokines on macrophage differentiation and molecular specification in vivo. To do so, we conducted three separate single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments on CD11b+Ly6G− monocytes/macrophages isolated at the peak of disease from mice with active MOG EAE: (i) a wild-type (WT) EAE experiment as reference; (ii) Hoxb8FL-derived CRISPR KO experiments targeting the IFNGR1, TNFR1, TGFBR1 and CSF2RA; and (iii) bone-marrow chimera experiments having reconstituted the bone marrow with individual CRISPR KOs of the same receptors (Fig. 3a and Methods). When we integrated the transcriptional data from the three sets of experiments, we found that the same myeloid cell clusters were present in all of them; moreover, cells in the same clusters exhibited high transcriptional similarity independent of their origin (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Through analysis of marker gene expression and pseudotime analysis of the integrated object (Fig. 3c), we assigned the myeloid cell populations from monocyte-like cells to three clusters of CXCL10+ macrophages22 (‘macrophages CXCL10 1–3') and eight clusters of other macrophages (‘macrophages 1–8'). To relate the single-cell analysis to our CRISPR screen, we mapped the expression of our screen markers Nos2 and Arg1 in the scRNA-seq data and found that the populations expressing these genes were consistent across experiments and remained mostly distinct from each other: Nos2 expression was more restricted and primarily found in early-to-intermediate phenotypes (based on pseudotime), most prominently in the cluster ‘macrophages CXCL10 3'; while Arg1 was broadly expressed in intermediate and later macrophage populations (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Furthermore, both Hoxb8FL-transfer and bone-marrow chimera-based CRISPR editing experiments confirmed the effects of cytokine receptor deletion on iNOS+ and Arg1+ polarization on the transcriptomic level as predicted by our initial CRISPR screen results (Extended Data Fig. 5e).

a, Scheme of the experimental design for the Hoxb8FL-derived macrophage and the bone-marrow chimera Perturb-seq experiments. Hoxb8FL (top) or LSK (bottom) cells deficient for the receptors of the four essential cytokines driving macrophage polarization in EAE as well as control-edited cells were either transferred as a Hoxb8FL cell pool, as previously described (top), or used to reconstitute the immune system after irradiation in a bone-marrow chimera model (bottom). At the peak of disease, endogenous (not shown on scheme), Hoxb8FL-derived or chimeric macrophages were harvested from the spinal cord and subjected to single-cell transcriptional sequencing. b, UMAP plots of the three EAE macrophage single-cell sequencing datasets after integration. Left, endogenous macrophages from WT EAE; middle, Hoxb8FL-derived macrophages; right, chimeric macrophages. c, Pseudotime across the different monocyte and macrophage clusters in the integrated dataset. Clusters are color coded according to the scale on the right. d, Feature plot of Nos2 and Arg1 expression in the three datasets; expression levels are color coded according to the scales on the right of the plot. e, Density difference plot showing differences in the distribution of myeloid cell subpopulations in the KOs compared to the control cells; density differences are color coded according to the scale on the right.

Next, we investigated how the lack of IFNγ, TNF, GM-CSF or TGFβ signaling in neuroinflammatory lesions affects the differentiation of myeloid cell subpopulations. We compared the distribution of monocyte/macrophage cell clusters in the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) between the individual KOs and the control-edited cells in both Hoxb8FL-transfer and bone-marrow chimera experiments. Among them only the deletion of IFNGR1 affected the monocyte-like cell phenotypes and resulted in a relative increase in the proportion of the monocyte population, as previously observed23. Among the macrophage clusters, deletion of IFNGR1 and TNFR1 showed opposite phenotypes, with IFNγ signaling needed for maintaining earlier—presumably more pro-inflammatory—macrophage clusters, and TNF signaling being required for progression to later macrophage cell phenotypes (Fig. 3e). In contrast, deletion of TGFBR1 and CSF2RA showed overlapping effects on the distribution of macrophage subpopulations, with both cytokines blocking the induction of CXCL10+ macrophages and promoting the differentiation of macrophages to the later macrophage cell phenotypes (Fig. 3e).

To further characterize the effects of the essential cytokine regulators on the molecular specification of macrophages, we next manually curated gene signatures that represent distinct lesion-promoting and lesion-resolving properties of macrophages (Methods). In line with the transcriptional similarity of macrophage clusters across experimental settings, these signatures were highly conserved between endogenous macrophages and macrophages derived from bone-marrow chimera or Hoxb8FL-progenitor cells (Extended Data Figs. 6a and 7a). When we investigated the expression of these signatures in our single-cell transcriptomic data, we found that the expression of signatures related to lesion-promoting functions across macrophage clusters was highly correlated, and decreased from early to later macrophage populations in neuroinflammatory lesions (Extended Data Fig. 6b). We next assessed how each cytokine receptor deletion affected the expression of the gene signatures in each of the individual macrophage clusters. Our results showed that overall lesion-promoting actions of macrophages are underpinned by IFNGR1, TNFR1 and CSF2RA signaling, and inhibited by TGFBR1 signaling—with the exception of ‘antigen presentation', which primarily depends on IFNGR1 signaling (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6c–i). To further investigate the effect of these cytokine regulators on a defined lesion-promoting function of myeloid cells, we focused on the regulation of oxidative bursting, a key contributor to tissue damage in experimental and human neuroinflammatory lesions9,24,25,26. To directly read out the redox state of myeloid cells, we expressed the Grx1-roGFP2 sensor27 in CRISPR-edited Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells. Our results showed that in neuroinflammatory lesions in vivo IFNγ signaling appears to be a primary driver of oxidative bursting (Fig. 4b–f).

In line with these results and the antagonistic actions of IFNγ and TGFβ signaling observed in the CRISPR screens across MS models, transcriptional signatures related to lesion-resolving actions of macrophages were primarily induced by TGFBR1 signaling and often inhibited by IFNGR1 signaling. Notably, both TGFBR1 signaling and CSF2RA signaling appear to drive the expression of genes associated with ‘tissue remodeling', indicating that—as observed in the CRISPR screens and for macrophage polarization in vitro—CSF2RA receptor signaling can synergize with TGFBR1 signaling in distinct functional domains (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7b–f). Furthermore, we observed prominent effects of TGFBR1 ablation on transcriptional signatures related to lipid signaling and lipid processing. As clearing the lipid-rich myelin debris is an important prerequisite for the resolution of neuroinflammatory lesions, we further investigated how essential cytokine regulators affect lipid uptake and digestion. In line with the regulation of related transcriptional signatures, we observed that specifically Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells lacking TGFBR1 but not those lacking IFNGR1, TNFR or CSF2RA showed an increase in cell size, lipid content and lysosomal marker expression (Fig. 5b–f). Notably, our subsequent analysis revealed that this lipid accumulation is not related to an impairment of phagocytosis or lysosomal acidification but rather due to an alteration of the lipid efflux capacity of myeloid cells that appear to depend on TGFβ signaling (Fig. 5g–m and Extended Data Fig. 7h,i). In line with these results, TGFBR1-deficient Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells showed an increased content of lipid droplets (Fig. 5n) and cholesterol crystals (Fig. 5o) that can drive a pro-inflammatory foamy cell phenotype28. Indeed, myeloid cells lacking TGFBR1 showed an increased expression of the foamy cell marker GPNMB29,30 in the inflamed spinal cord (Fig. 5p).

Taken together, these analyses demonstrate how combining CRISPR gene editing with single transcriptomics and in situ and in vivo imaging can be applied to comprehensively reveal the regulation of macrophage states, their differentiation and molecular specification in vivo. In this context, it is interesting to note that similar regulatory patterns with regard to both the temporal evolution of gene signatures and their regulation by individual cytokine receptor KOs were observed between Hoxb8FL-derived and bone-marrow chimeric macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 8), supporting the view that Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells are a valid tool to dissect the molecular regulation of macrophages in vivo.

To reveal additional regulatory aspects of cytokine signaling beyond the curated signatures, we performed an unbiased analysis of the differentially regulated genes in the cytokine receptor-deficient compared to the control-edited macrophage populations (Methods). We observed that most of the regulated genes in any of the cytokine receptor deletion experiments were similarly altered in multiple macrophage clusters, suggesting that the cytokine regulators induce common transcriptional responses across macrophage subpopulations (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Notably, we again saw a sizable overlap in the genes differentially regulated by TGFβ and GM-CSF, while IFNγ induced expression of a distinct gene set (Extended Data Fig. 9b). An unbiased biological processes Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of the differentially regulated genes revealed that GO terms related to cell adhesion and migration were among the top biological processes regulated by CSF2RA and TGFBR1 (Fig. 6a). Indeed, a curated signature including genes related to macrophage adhesion and migration identified TGFBR1 as a putative regulator of these functions (Fig. 6b). To further investigate how the migration pattern of myeloid cells in neuroinflammation might be modulated by the essential cytokine regulators, we co-transferred Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells deficient for IFNGR1, TNFR1, CSF2RA or TGFBR1 with control-edited cells and characterized the distribution of transferred cells within neuroinflammatory lesions. Here we observed a striking difference in the distribution of TGFBR1-deficient macrophages between leptomeninges and CNS parenchyma with TGFBR1-deficient cells being basically absent from the pia and enriched in the CNS lesion parenchyma. This altered distribution appeared to be specific for TGFBR1-deficient macrophages as it was not observed for any of the other cytokine receptor-deficient cells (Fig. 6c–e). To assess whether the differential distribution of TGFBR1-deficient myeloid cells in the inflamed CNS results from an altered mobility of these cells, we used in vivo microscopy to track the movement pattern of control-edited and TGFBR1-deficient Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid cells in EAE lesions in the superficial dorsal spinal cord. Our results showed that neither the proportion of cells that move nor the speed at which they move are affected by the absence of TGFBR1 (Fig. 6f). Taken together, these experiments thus reveal that TGFBR1 signaling instructs the distribution of macrophages in the inflamed CNS without affecting their ability to move within neuroinflammatory lesions.

We next examined whether insights from experimental neuroinflammatory lesions could reveal cytokine-driven regulation of myeloid cells in individuals with MS. Using genes induced by a given cytokine across mouse myeloid populations, we defined ‘neuroinflammatory cytokine signatures' representing cytokine-regulated programs in inflammatory contexts (Fig. 7a and Methods). These signatures only partially overlapped with those from homeostatic conditions31 (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and were prominently expressed in myeloid clusters within MOG EAE white matter lesions, particularly in populations dependent on the respective cytokine (Figs. 3 and 7b). We further analyzed immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and gray matter of mice with MOG EAE and cortical MS-like pathology. In both compartments, IFNγ, TNF, GM-CSF and TGFβ signatures were strongly enriched in myeloid but not adaptive immune cells, with high expression of the signatures induced by IFNγ, GM-CSF and TGFβ also detected in microglia (Fig. 7c–h). These findings indicate that neuroinflammatory cytokine signatures are conserved across myeloid populations and CNS compartments, including gray matter and CSF.

We next investigated whether neuroinflammatory gene signatures could reveal cytokine actions on myeloid cells in individuals with MS. To this end, we analyzed induction of these signatures in CSF monocytes from people with multiple sclerosis. A published scRNA-seq dataset32 was integrated with our own dataset comprising untreated individuals early in the course of MS (Methods), together with a control set from individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD33; Fig. 8a and Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). Pseudobulk analysis across monocyte populations revealed that CSF monocytes from people with multiple sclerosis—unlike those from MCI/AD controls—showed clear induction of the IFNγ signature (Fig. 8b). This is consistent with the reported induction of IFNγ-dependent genes in neurons as previously observed, for example, in the cortex of people with multiple sclerosis34.

Source data

To investigate cytokine activity in MS lesions, we analyzed a large single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset from postmortem brain samples of people with multiple sclerosis35. Tissue myeloid cells, predominantly microglia, were grouped into five clusters based on established molecular markers (Fig. 8c and Extended Data Fig. 10d). We then examined the presence of neuroinflammatory cytokine signatures in microglia from gray matter lesions and normal-appearing gray matter and compared them with microglia from MCI/AD donors36. Pseudobulk analysis per individual revealed induction of IFNγ and GM-CSF signatures in MS gray matter—most prominently within lesions—whereas no such induction was observed in microglia from MCI/AD samples (Fig. 8d).

These results suggest that essential cytokine regulators are active in the MS brain, prompting us to examine whether distinct microglial subsets are differentially influenced by IFNγ, TNF, GM-CSF and TGFβ. In MS white matter lesions35, microglial cluster frequencies varied by pathology stage: homeostatic microglia dominated healthy tissue, whereas inflammatory/interferon-responsive (IRM), disease-associated (DAM), lipid-processing and MHC class II-high microglia were enriched in MS lesions (Fig. 8e). IRM cells were abundant in active lesions and surrounding white matter, DAM and lipid-processing microglia clustered in active and chronic active lesions, while MHC class II-high cells appeared in inactive and remyelinating areas, indicating a recovery-associated phenotype37. Differential expression of cytokine signatures (relative to homeostatic microglia) revealed strong induction of an IFNγ signature in IRM, broad GM-CSF activation across lesion-associated populations, absent enrichment of a TNF gene signature and robust induction of a TGFβ signature in DAM and MHC class II-high microglia (Fig. 8f).

Taken together, these observations highlight that the neuroinflammatory cytokine signatures we delineated and validated in MS models are selectively induced in myeloid cells in neuroinflammatory but not in neurodegenerative conditions and can be used to uncover the differential regulation of myeloid cell states in MS across disease locations and stages.

We developed a CRISPR-based screening platform enabling systematic dissection of molecular factors underlying macrophage state regulation in inflamed tissues. Compared to classical conditional gene deletion or bone-marrow chimera approaches38, our method expedites experimental timelines, reduces animal use and ensures uniform sgRNA distribution through consistent myeloid cell expansion, facilitating large-scale analysis of over 100 genes in a single screen. Applying this strategy to cytokine receptor screening identified IFNγ, TNF, GM-CSF and TGFβ as key in vivo drivers of macrophage polarization, whereas IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13, which modulate polarization in vitro21,39, do not direct macrophage polarization in vivo at least in the active MS model at the studied time point. Using naive C57BL/6 recipients and in vitro-edited precursors enhances experimental flexibility, enabling integration with biosensor technologies and avoiding confounds from irradiation or genetic drift40,41,42. As Hoxb8FL-derived myeloid populations were detected in all analyzed tissues, this methodology is broadly applicable for interrogating myeloid cell regulation across diverse tissues and disease settings.

Successful application of this approach relies on an understanding of its inherent limitations. The method targets monocyte-derived myeloid cells, as microglia and most CNS-resident macrophages largely persist independently of blood-derived monocytes43. It is optimally suited for probing acute, cell-autonomous phenotypes, since Hoxb8FL-derived cells replace only ∼15% of endogenous populations, minimizing capacity to affect overall tissue pathology or disease trajectory. Nevertheless, this framework enables direct analysis of myeloid cell phenotypes within largely unaltered lesion contexts, isolating cell-intrinsic signaling pathways. The efficiency of large-scale CRISPR screens remains contingent on the yield of genetically modified cells from tissue; given the short lifespan of monocyte-derived cells, rapid immune infiltration models are preferable. Additionally, our approach relies on a finite set of sortable phenotypes—here, iNOS+ for lesion-promoting and Arg1+ for lesion-resolving myeloid cells, reflecting established roles in MS models and MS tissue linking iNOS+ polarization to active lesion formation, with subsequent transition to Arg1+ during recovery in MS models8,15,25,44. While this binary scheme encapsulates extremes, macrophage phenotypes likely span a broader continuum influenced by disease context, cell development and analytical methodology13,14,45. Importantly, our screening strategy can be extended to alternative markers, and cytokine-based regulation provides a foundation for dissecting additional regulatory pathways influencing myeloid states.

To delineate cytokine-induced macrophage states in neuroinflammation with single-cell resolution, we implemented Perturb-seq using scRNA-seq for CRISPR perturbation readout46,47. To validate the utility of the Hoxb8FL transfer approach for single-cell analyses, we performed parallel Perturb-seq in bone-marrow chimeras optimized for CRISPR editing of myeloid cells. Both methods demonstrated that cytokine receptor deletion induces similar shifts in macrophage subpopulation composition and transcriptional profiles (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs. 5–8), confirming the broad utility of CRISPR-edited progenitors for comprehensive, unbiased analysis of macrophage state regulation.

A key insight from our Perturb-seq analysis is that macrophage polarization is chiefly governed by the balance of IFNγ and TGFβ signaling. Both pathways not only promote distinct polarization states but also reciprocally inhibit the alternative phenotype, a phenomenon consistent across MS models. These findings implicate IFNγ as a central mediator of pro-inflammatory signatures, tissue damage and oxidative burst in myeloid cells, aligning with previous studies in MS models and people with MS48,49,50. Nonetheless, IFNγ actions are highly context dependent, potentially varying with EAE model, lesion stage, cofactors and responding cell type48,51,52,53.

Similarly to IFNγ, TNF signaling promoted pro-inflammatory, tissue-damaging macrophage signatures, corroborating studies where TNF blockade improved outcomes in MS models54,55 and TNFR1-deficient mice were protected from EAE56. However, neuroinflammatory TNF signatures were not prominently detected in lesion-associated microglia in MS. Clinically, anti-TNF therapies, effective in other autoimmune diseases57,58, have exacerbated MS pathology, a dichotomy partially explained by an MS-risk single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1800693) in TNFRSF1A that yields a soluble TNFR1 antagonizing TNF59. These converging findings suggest that TNF's protective effects in MS may be mediated through non-macrophage populations, such as its known support for myelin repair via TNFR2 on oligodendrocyte precursor cells60.

Our CRISPR screen revealed that both GM-CSF and TGFβ are essential for Arg1+ macrophage polarization in EAE. This was unexpected given GM-CSF's established pro-inflammatory role in neuroinflammation: mice lacking CSF2R in monocytes are resistant to EAE due to impaired induction of inflammatory and oxidative stress-related genes23,61. Perturb-seq confirmed these pro-inflammatory effects yet uncovered an unanticipated contribution of GM-CSF to tissue remodeling, resembling TGFβ activity. The considerable overlap between GM-CSF-regulated and TGFβ-regulated gene sets (Extended Data Fig. 9c) mirrors their reported synergy in promoting scar-associated macrophages62, highlighting the complexity of GM-CSF as both a pro-inflammatory and reparative cytokine—an important consideration given its candidacy as a therapeutic target in MS and other inflammatory conditions63,64,65.

Consistent with earlier studies, TGFβ induced transcriptional programs of homeostasis, debris clearance and tissue repair. Loss of TGFBR1 impaired lipid efflux, resulting in foamy macrophages expressing GPNMB and accumulating lipids and cholesterol crystals, a phenotype linked to progressive MS pathology66,67,68. An intriguing aspect of this regulation is that it appears to be distinct in monocyte-derived macrophages69 compared to microglia in which TGFβ was shown to limit effective lipid clearance at least in a model of toxic myelin damage70. Beyond its established homeostatic functions, we identified a critical role for TGFβ signaling in regulating myeloid cell infiltration during neuroinflammation. Although TGFβ has long been associated with cell motility and epithelial–mesenchymal transition in cancer71,72,73, our data indicate a distinct mechanism in the CNS: TGFβ does not affect macrophage movement within lesions but instead governs their progression from meninges into the parenchyma, an effect that might well contribute to the worsening of CNS inflammation observed in the absence of TGFβ signaling in myeloid cells74.

Single-cell analysis of cytokine actions revealed broadly consistent effects of individual cytokines on myeloid cell specification across macrophage clusters, indicating that response intensity rather than direction depends on the differentiation state of the cell. However, cytokine-induced gene programs were partially shaped by the local inflammatory milieu, as transcriptional responses in neuroinflammatory lesions only partly overlapped with those observed after cytokine stimulation in lymph nodes31 (Extended Data Fig. 10a). The uniform cytokine responsiveness within lesions suggests that core signaling mechanisms are conserved across myeloid cell types and possibly species, providing a framework for cross-species comparison of myeloid activation in disease. From our Perturb-seq data, we defined neuroinflammatory cytokine signatures for IFNγ, TNF, GM-CSF and TGFβ, and confirmed their enrichment across murine myeloid populations not only in inflamed white matter, but also in gray matter lesions and the CSF compartment.

Analysis of human CSF monocytes revealed selective upregulation of IFNγ-responsive genes in people with MS, paralleling IFNγ presence in CSF75 and its induced transcriptional signatures in MS neurons34 and gray matter microglia as we observe here. In white matter, IFNγ signatures predominated in inflammatory microglia, while GM-CSF—but not TNF—signatures extended across lesion-associated clusters, implicating GM-CSF in sustained microglial activation76,77. In contrast, TGFβ signatures were enriched in MHC class II+ microglia from inactive and remyelinating lesions. This indicates that TGFβ not only maintains the homeostatic phenotype of microglia78, but also provides an important signal that drives a distinct microglial phenotype associated with tissue recovery37. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that neuroinflammatory cytokine signatures can delineate which cytokines influence specific myeloid cell populations across CNS compartments and neurological conditions. This analytical approach is adaptable to diverse mediators and transcriptomic datasets, offering a powerful tool for uncovering molecular drivers of myeloid cell heterogeneity in humans.

In conclusion, we established a rapid, scalable and versatile in vivo CRISPR screening approach to dissect the signals driving myeloid cell states across tissue compartments and models, providing insights into myeloid cell regulation in human disease, an important step toward the rational design of therapies targeting innate immune cells.

C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River or Janvier and bred in the Core Facility for Animal Models of the Biomedical Center, LMU. R26-Cas9-eGFP animals were ordered from The Jackson Laboratory (024858) and backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background several times. BiozziABH mice, F1 C57BL/6J mice crossed with BiozziABH mice, and 2D2 mice were bred in house. Animal care and experiments were carried out in accordance with the regulations of the applicable animal welfare acts and using protocols approved by the responsible regulatory authority (Regierung von Oberbayern, commission number 15). All animals had free access to food and water. Animals were kept at a room temperature of 22 °C ± 2 °C and humidity of 55% ± 10%, with a 12-h/12-h light–dark cycle (6:30–18:30). Male and female mice between 2 and 8 months old at the start of the experiment were used.

All cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in air. All media were supplemented with 10% FBS (Bio&SELL) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Colllection) were kept in DMEM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher). Primary bone marrow cells and Hoxb8FL cells were kept in RPMI GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher). Hoxb8FL cells were additionally supplemented with 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Thermo Fisher), 1 μM β-estradiol (Sigma) and supernatant from a Flt3L-producing B16 melanoma cell line, to a final concentration of 35 ng ml−1. During macrophage differentiation the RPMI medium was additionally supplemented with M-CSF (10–20 ng ml−1; PeproTech). T cells were kept in RMPI 1640 (Sigma) and additionally supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol. For freezing cells, a 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma) and 90% FBS (Bio&SELL) mixture was used, and cryovials were kept in a freezing box for several days at −80 °C before transferring to liquid nitrogen. Cell lines were tested for the absence of mycoplasma. HEK239T cells were detached by using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher). Macrophages were detached with Accutase solution (Sigma).

hBCL2-overexpressing Hoxb8FL Cas9 (Hoxb8FL) lines were generated as follows. Bone marrow cells were harvested from femurs and tibias of 6–10-week-old animals and cultured in RPMI supplemented with recombinant mouse IL-3 (5 ng ml−1), IL-6 (20 ng ml−1) and 1% cell culture supernatant from SCF-producing B16 melanoma cells. After 2 days, the cells were spin infected with MSCV-ERHBD-Hoxb8FL-carrying retrovirus. A day after spin-infection, the cells were cultured in Hoxb8FL medium until infected cells were enriched in the culture in the presence of β-estradiol20. The medium was replaced every 2–3 days. The hBCL2 overexpression improved the survival of these cells both during in vitro differentiation experiments and in vivo.

All sgRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

For individual sgRNA cloning, 20-nucleotide-long sgRNAs were picked from the GPP sgRNA designer tool from the Functional Genomics Consortium of The Broad Institute, Massachusetts, USA. sgRNA sequence and reverse complemented sequence were ordered as two separate oligonucleotides from Metabion with overhangs on the 5′ side of CAAC for forward and AAAC for reverse. The nucleotide ‘G' was added as a first nucleotide to increase the efficiency of the gRNA expression by the hU6 promoter79. Complementary oligonucleotides with overhangs were phosphorylated and annealed in the presence of 10x T4 Ligation Buffer (NEB) and T4 PNK (NEB) by increasing the temperature to 95 °C and ramping down to 25 °C at 5 °C min−1. Annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into Bpil- or BsmbI-digested (Thermo Fisher) gRNA cargo plasmid by Quick Ligase (NEB) for 6 min at room temperature. Ligated plasmids were then transformed into Stellar competent cells (Takara Clontech) with heat shock at 42 °C for 55 s. Bacterial plates were incubated overnight, and single clones were picked and prepped with the Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit. The correct ligation product was confirmed with Sanger sequencing (Sequencing service, LMU Biozentrum) using the hU6 primer.

sgRNAs were picked from the GPP sgRNA designer tool from Functional Genomics Consortium of The Broad Institute. All sgRNA sequences that were selected, and the library cloning primers, as well as protocols, are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

sgRNAs for the mouse Cytokine Receptor library were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies as custom oPools (50 pmol per oligonucleotide) as a 79-mer with a sequence of 5'-GCAGATGGCTCTTTGTCCTAGACATCGAAGACAACACCGN20GTTTTAGTCTTCTCGTCGCC-3', with N20 indicating the sgRNA sequence. Each gene was targeted with three different sgRNAs (Stat6 with 4 sgRNAs), and 15 non-targeted (from here onward, control) control gRNAs were also included (343 oligonucleotides in total). The oligonucleotide pool was dissolved in Qiagen TE buffer to get a 100 μM stock concentration, and then the single-stranded oligonucleotides (100 ng) were PCR amplified for two cycles with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) using Oligo_Amp_F and Oligo_Amp_R primers to generate double-stranded DNAs. The PCR products were purified with the Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). Amplified double-stranded DNAs were digested with FastDigest BpiI (BbsI, Thermo Fisher) for 2 h at 37 °C in a total of two reactions, and then purified with the Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). Ligation was performed with a T4 DNA Ligase (NEB) using a 3 ng insert and 40 ng BpiI-digested MSCV-v2-U6-(BbsI)-Pgk-Puro-T2A-eGFP for 16 h at 16 °C per reaction in a total of two reactions. The ligated product was cleaned with a PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and the concentration was measured with Qubit 4 (Thermo Fisher). Ten nanograms of the ligated product was transformed into 50 μl of NEB Stable Competent cells in a total of eight reactions and incubated at 30 °C overnight. A library representation above 100× was confirmed by plating transformed competent cells in serial dilutions. The plasmid DNA was prepared with an Endofree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen).

For viral transduction of Hoxb8FL cells, HEK293T cells were plated into a six-well plate 18–24 h before transfection. For the transfection per well of six-well plate, 1.5 µg pMSCV retroviral plasmid and 1.5 µg pCL-Eco packaging vector were added in 400 µl of RPMI medium without serum and antibiotics. Then 7.5 μl of the transfection reagent TransIT-LT1 were added into the mix, vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After 30 min, the solution was added dropwise to HEK293T cells. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with Hoxb8FL medium. Retrovirus-containing supernatant was collected at 48–72 h after transfection. Hoxb8FL cells were spin infected with freshly harvested virus at 1,200g for 30 min at room temperature. For individual KO cell line generation, individual sgRNA viruses were produced and transduced. For the CRISPR screen experiments, the library oligonucleotide pool was used to generate a virus mix containing all the library sgRNAs, which was then transduced at a maximum multiplicity of infection of 0.3 or below (< 30% transduction efficiency) to prevent multiple integrations of sgRNAs into a single cell, and enough cell numbers were always kept ensuring a minimum 1,000× coverage (1,000 cells having the same sgRNA). For the Perturb-seq experiment, viruses for six individual non-targeted sgRNAs and two different sgRNAs per gene targeted were produced individually, and single KO or control cell lines were generated in parallel and mixed in equal proportions before expansion before i.v. injection. On the next day, puromycin (Thermo Fisher) was added at a final concentration of 5 µg ml−1 to select for transduced cells. After 4 days of puromycin selection, cells expressing fluorescent markers (for example, eGFP) were sorted to purity to ensure high expression of the fluorescent marker by using a FACS Aria III (BD) or FACS Fusion (BD) at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the Biomedical Center, LMU. The combination of positive selection of the infected cells by puromycin with sorting of the pure fluorescent population ensured all the Hoxb8FL transferred cells in the in vivo experiments were gene edited.

All single KO lines used in validation experiments were assessed for KO efficiency before the experiment with the TIDE assay. This assay works as follows: to assess the extent of genetic editing at DNA level for single sgRNAs, genomic DNA from sgRNA transduced (see above) Hoxb8FL cells was isolated with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and the DNA region targeted by the sgRNA was amplified with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) and specific PCR primers for each different sgRNA. All TIDE primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The samples from KO and control cells were submitted to Sanger Sequencing with either the forward or the reverse PCR primer (Sequencing service, LMU Biozentrum). The Cas9-dependent generation of insertion–deletion repair errors and the subsequent KO efficiency (frame shifts that are not a multiple of 3 are considered to generate a protein KO) were assessed by the ICE v2 software tool80.

In vitro-expanded Hoxb8FL cells were washed twice with PBS to remove β-estradiol and cultured in RPMI medium (with 10 ng ml−1 M-CSF) for 2 days to initiate myeloid differentiation. On day 8–9 after active EAE induction, or at disease onset in TH17 adoptive transfer EAE (onset of clinical symptoms or >1 g of weight loss, or else the Hoxb8FL transfer stopped disease development), cells were washed twice with PBS and 10–15 × 106 cells in 200 μl of PBS were injected i.v. into the tail vein of the mice.

For the intravital imaging experiments, Hoxb8FL cells were labeled before transfer with CellTrace Far Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34564), CellTrace Yellow (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34567) or CellTrace Violet (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34571) for in vivo detection. After reconstituting the CellTrace according to the manufacturer's instructions, cells were collected and the residual medium was washed once with PBS. Then, the cells were incubated 30 min at 37 °C in the dark in a 1:500 dilution of CellTrace solution in PBS at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells per ml. Staining was stopped by adding five times the volume of cell medium and incubating for 5 min at 37 °C in the dark, followed by two PBS washes before injection.

Animals with EAE clinical signs were euthanized by isoflurane overdose. When CSF was collected, it was collected immediately after euthanasia from the cisterna magna. Briefly, the animal was head-fixed in a stereotactic frame, and the cisterna magna was exposed by keeping the head bent down at a 45° angle and removing skin and muscle from the neck. Then, a pulled glass pipette was used to carefully penetrate the cisterna magna and suction the CSF. Between 10 μl and 25 μl of CSF was collected per animal and immediately resuspended on FACS buffer (0.5% BSA, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES on calcium and magnesium-free PBS) on ice. Blood samples were collected immediately after euthanasia or after CSF extraction by cardiac puncture, and the animal's body was perfused with PBS-heparin before collecting the spleen, inguinal lymph nodes, bone marrow (femur and vertebra), spinal cord and brain cortex through microdissection. Cells from bone marrow were collected by flushing with ice-cold PBS, whereas cells from vertebrae were isolated after crushing with a pestle and mortar. Spleen, lymph nodes, spinal cord and brain tissues were homogenized with a glass dounce homogenizer (Wheaton) with a loose pestle, transferred into a PBS solution containing collagenase D (0.8 mg ml−1; Roche) and DNase I (10 ng ml−1; Roche) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with shaking (1,000 rpm) for dissociation of cells. For scRNA experiments, cells were incubated in digestion buffer for only 5 min to minimize changes to the transcriptome. Cells from spleen, lymph nodes (after digestion) and bone marrow were treated with ACK Lysing Buffer (Thermo Fisher) for 5 min, whereas cells from blood were incubated for 20 min on ice for red blood cell lysis. All cell suspensions were passed through a 100-μm-pore-diameter cell strainer (Corning). Cells from spinal cord and brain were isolated with Percoll (Sigma) gradient to remove the myelin. Cells were resuspended with 1 ml of 100% FBS and 9 ml of 33% Percoll (in PBS), and 1 ml of 10% FBS (in PBS) was added on the top slowly to form a layer. Samples were centrifuged without brakes at 800g for 15–30 min at 4 °C. The myelin layer was carefully sucked with a vacuum, and pelleted cells were washed with PBS to remove the Percoll solution.

For the cytokine library experiment, around ten animals were combined for one replicate to ensure sufficient cells (as, depending on the disease score, cell numbers found in the spinal cord vary). Before starting flow cytometry labeling, monocytes/macrophages from the spleen and bone marrow were enriched with MACS using anti-CD11b microbeads (Milteny) to reduce sorting time. All cells were blocked with TruStain fcX (anti-mouse CD16/CD32, BioLegend) and stained with Live/Dead Near-IR (Thermo Fisher) to exclude dead cells during blocking for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with antibodies recognizing extracellular markers for 30 min at 4 °C, with anti-CD11b-PerCP antibody to include monocytes/macrophages and anti-Ly6G-BV786 antibody to exclude granulocytes. Cells from the spinal cord were then fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at 4 °C, before intracellular labeling. Cells were incubated with anti-Arg1-APC and anti-iNOS-Pacific Blue antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C in Perm/Wash buffer solution. Hoxb8FL-derived cells were identified by their eGFP fluorophore expression. Populations of interest were isolated using a FACS Aria III (BD) or FACS Fusion (BD) at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the Biomedical Center. Enough cells were sorted for each population to ensure a library coverage of a minimum of 100× (100 cells containing each sgRNA). Genomic DNA from sorted cells was isolated by using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit. Cells were lysed in the presence of Proteinase K at 56 °C overnight (modified from the manufacturer's protocol) for more efficient de-crosslinking of fixed DNA before isolation of genomic DNA.

For in vitro macrophage polarization experiments, bone marrow-derived cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 10 ng ml−1 M-CSF for 5–7 days to allow differentiation. Differentiated cells were then re-seeded and the respective recombinant mouse cytokines were added at a concentration of 10–20 ng ml−1 as reported in the literature81 for 48 h before FACS: IL-4 (R&D Systems), TGFβ (BioLegend), GM-CSF (PeproTech), IFNγ (R&D Systems) or TNF (PeproTech) were used. Cells were detached with Accutase followed by two washing steps with PBS. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit for 15 min at 4 °C before incubation with anti-Arg1 and anti-iNOS antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C in Perm/Wash buffer solution. Cells were analyzed with a Fortessa (BD) or a Cytoflex S (Beckman Coulter).

For characterization experiments of Hoxb8FL-derived cells, nonspecific binding was blocked with TruStain fcX (anti-mouse CD16/32, BioLegend) and cells were stained with Live/Dead reagent (Thermo Fisher) to exclude dead cells, for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with antibodies recognizing extracellular markers for 30 min at 4 °C: anti-CD11b, anti-CD45, anti-Ly6G, anti-Ly6C, anti-MHC class II and anti-F4/80 were used. Cells then were incubated with anti-Arg1 and anti-iNOS antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C in Perm/Wash buffer solution. All antibodies—unless otherwise stated—were used at 1:100 dilution. Hoxb8FL-derived cells were identified by eGFP fluorophore expression, and eGFP-negative cells were assigned as the endogenous population. Cells then were analyzed using a FACS Aria III (BD) or FACS Fusion (BD) at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the Biomedical Center. Neutrophils were excluded from all analyses by expression of Ly6G.

For single KO validation experiments, before the transfer of Hoxb8FL cells into animals, Hoxb8FL cells expressing tdTomato and control sgRNA were mixed at a 1:1:1 ratio with Hoxb8FL cells expressing either BFP or eGFP and the gene targeting sgRNA to minimize the inter-animal experimental variation.

For the 10x scRNA-seq experiments, before euthanasia, 3 μg per mouse of anti-CD45 antibody was injected i.v. in the tail vein to permit exclusion of cells derived from blood. Cells from 7 mice were pooled from a single EAE round for the WT EAE experiment; cells from 6 (round 1) and 12 (round 2) mice were pooled from two independent Hoxb8FL cell generation and EAE rounds for the Hoxb8FL-derived cell experiment; for the chimera experiment, three mice each with control, Ifngr1-KO, Tnfrsf1a-KO and Csfr2ra-KO BM chimera, and two mice with Tgfbr1-KO BM chimera were pooled; for CSF sequencing, 11 (round 1) and 12 mice (round 2) were pooled; for cEAE, 3 healthy, 3 d3 cEAE and 3 d14 cEAE mice were pooled. All cells were incubated with TruStain fcX (anti-mouse CD16/32, BioLegend) and Live/Dead Near-IR (Thermo Fisher) to exclude dead cells for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-CD11b-PerCP antibody to include monocytes/macrophages and anti-Ly6G-BV786 antibody to exclude granulocytes, for 30 min at 4 °C. For the cEAE experiment, cells were additionally incubated with CD45-PE antibody to include all immune cells. Hoxb8FL-derived cells were identified by eGFP fluorophore expression, and eGFP-negative cells were assigned as the endogenous population. Chimeric cells were identified by Vex fluorophore expression. Populations of interest (WT, Hoxb8FL and chimeric EAE: CD11b+Ly6G−; CSF and cEAE CD45+Ly6G−) were sorted for purity using a FACS Aria III (BD) or FACS Fusion (BD) at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the Biomedical Center. Sorted cells were immediately prepared for 10x single-cell experiments according to the 10x protocol. The gating strategy to sort for Ly6G− cells resulted in minimal numbers of neutrophils in the spinal EAE scRNA-seq experiments: 310 cells, 2% of total, in the WT dataset, 31 cells, 0.28% of total, in the Hoxb8FL-transfer dataset and 174 cells, 0.53% of total, in the bone-marrow chimera dataset.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications8,82,83. For statistical analyses and plotting, GraphPad Prism versions 7 and 9 (GraphPad Software) and R84 (version 4.0.0+) were used. For next-generation sequencing sample demultiplexing, Je-Demultiplex85 was used in Galaxy86. For analysis of CRISPR screens, cutadapt87, trimmomatic88, the MAGeCK software89, Galaxy86 and R84 were used. For analysis of bulk Galaxy86, RNA STAR90 (version 2.7.2b in Galaxy), HTSeq-count91 (version 1.0.0 in galaxy), DESeq2 (ref. 92; version 2.11.40.7 + galaxy1) and R84 were used. For image analysis, Fiji/ImageJ93 and Imaris (Oxford Instruments) were used. For scRNA-seq data, Seurat94,95,96,97,98 (versions 4+) and R84 were used. Figures were made using the aforementioned software and Adobe Illustrator 2025. Data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated; box plots show the median and quartiles 1 and 3 for the box limits, and whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range. Sample sizes are reported in the figure legends. All replicates are biological unless otherwise stated, measurements were not repeated, and all tests are two tailed unless otherwise stated. The choice to do a one-tail or two-tailed test depended on whether there were prior data suggesting the expected effect would be in a specific direction. Asterisks indicate P value > 0.05 (NS), *P value < 0.05, **P value < 0.01, ***P value < 0.001 and ****P value < 0.0001, unless otherwise specified. Samples were tested for a normal distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk normality test, and the statistical test used were chosen so the data met the assumptions of the test. Animals were randomly assigned to experiments or, when not possible, the conditions were appropriately blocked such that there were animals of the same condition in all cages. Due to the experimental design and animal laws, no blinding was possible during FACS experiments and Hoxb8FL characterization histology. The analysis of all histological data was done blinded. scRNA-seq exclusion criteria for low quality control are detailed in the Supplementary Methods. No other data were excluded. For statistical testing of the cell distribution in the lesion (Fig. 1b), an ordinary two-way ANOVA with the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli for multiple comparisons was used. For the Hoxb8FL transfer experiments (Figs. 1, 2, 5 and 6 and Extended Data Figs. 1, 2 and 7), multiple paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests (when the sample was not normally distributed) with the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli for multiple comparisons with FDR (q) of 5% when needed were used. For comparison of EAE disease course in WT and Hoxb8FL transferred animals (Extended Data Fig. 1o), the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used. For the intravital imaging experiments (Figs. 4 and 5), for the proportion of cells in each ratio bin, an ordinary two-way ANOVA with a single pooled variance, for the interaction of genotype and bin was run; a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was run for cumulative distributions, and a one-tailed unpaired (Fig. 4) or two-tailed paired (Fig. 5) t-test for the proportion of cells above Q3 of the ratio. For the histological quantifications, paired t-test or Wilcoxon tests were run. For the cholesterol efflux assay, unpaired t-tests were run. For the pHrodo-myelin phagocytosis assay, an ordinary two-way ANOVA with a single pooled variance for the genotype differences was run. For the single KO phenotype differences in polarization between Hoxb8FL and chimera, unpaired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests were run. For the KO/control distribution phenotype (Fig. 6), paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests comparing KO and control were used, but data are plotted as the KO/control ratio for visualization purposes only. For the motility analysis, paired t-tests were run. For CRISPR screen results (Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3), the MAGeCK software was used as described above. Asterisks indicate P value and FDR < 0.05 and absolute log2(fold change) > 3 times the standard deviation of the noise distribution, as previously described. For comparison of in vitro bone marrow-derived macrophage polarization conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4), an ordinary one-way ANOVA with the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli for multiple comparisons was used. Bulk RNA-seq differentially expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 4) were defined as having an adjusted P value < 0.05 and log2(fold change) > 3 times the standard deviation of all log2(fold change) in the comparison. For individual gene KO-versus-control phenotypes in the scRNA-seq experiments (Extended Data Figs. 5, 6 and 7), the FindMarkers function of the Seurat package (version 5) was used with default parameters other than logfc.threshold = 0 and min.pct = 0.1, and differentially expressed genes were defined as adjusted P value < 0.05 and absolute log2(fold change) > 3 times the standard deviation of the log2(fold change) distribution of the cluster and as described above for Fig. 7. To evaluate the significance of the enrichment of the signatures in the KOs versus the controls (Figs. 4 and 5), the GSEA preranked function of the GSEA software99,100 (version 4.2.3) was used, with a custom-made database of the signatures, as described elsewhere. A signature was considered significantly enriched when the NOM P value < 0.05 or the FDR q value < 0.25 and absolute NES > 1.5. For unbiased pathway analysis (Fig. 6), the pathways depicted in the figure were filtered based on the output parameters of gprofiler101 as described above. For statistical analysis of human samples (Fig. 8), the Shapiro normality test was used to evaluate the normal distribution of the sample, and after, according to the results, a one-way ANOVA was performed for each cytokine signature for newly generated CSF samples followed by t-tests or Wilcoxon tests comparing disease conditions against controls. For datasets from Schafflick et al.32 and Piehl et al.33, t-tests or Wilcoxon tests comparing disease conditions against controls were used. For samples from Macnair et al.35 and Mathys et al.36, the Shapiro normality test was used to evaluate the normal distribution of the sample, and after, according to the results, a one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test per cytokine-induced signature per dataset was ran, followed by t-tests or Wilcoxon tests comparing all disease/lesion conditions to control (gray matter or healthy, respectively) and all clusters to the homeostatic cluster.

El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) profoundly affects Australian weather, climate, ecosystems and socio-economic sectors. In this Review, we summarize the advances in understanding the ENSO–Australian climate relationship, detailing the complexity beyond the traditional assumptions of El Niño-dry and La Niña-wet patterns, including mechanisms and impacts. The influence of ENSO is most coherent during austral spring, explaining about a quarter of rainfall variability over large parts of eastern Australia. La Niña typically exerts more robust rainfall changes than El Niño, and the Central Pacific El Niño has greater impacts than Eastern Pacific events. These effects are amplified by prolonged ENSO episodes and modulated by land–atmosphere feedback, surrounding sea surface temperatures, local processes and interactions with other climate modes, including multidecadal variability. El Niño-related drying generally worsens when co-occurring with positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and/or negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM), whereas La Niña rainfall intensifies with negative IOD and/or positive SAM. Although ENSO predictability has improved with advanced understanding of ocean processes and dynamical forecasting, predicting its impacts is challenging because of large internal atmospheric variability. Ongoing changes in ENSO underscore the need for strategic research, continuous in situ monitoring, reduced model biases and deeper understanding of the anthropogenically induced changes in Pacific temperatures to guide adaptation strategies.

El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the foremost climatic phenomenon impacting eastern Australia in terms of intensity and spatial coverage.

ENSO impacts large-scale atmospheric circulation to Australia directly via changes in sea level pressure related to the Southern Oscillation and indirectly through changes in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and associated wave trains to the Australian extra-tropics.

Local processes driven by the surrounding sea surface temperatures and winds crucially alter evaporation, humidity and moisture advection inland, modulating rainfall patterns during ENSO events.

The ENSO–Australian rainfall relationship is asymmetric and stronger for La Niña. This relationship varies over multidecadal cycles, peaking during the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation negative phase.

The influence of ENSO on Australian rainfall usually intensifies during multi-year events and is often modulated by other climate variability such as Indian Ocean Dipole, Southern Annular Mode and Madden–Julian Oscillation.

A.S.T. and S.McG. coordinated and led the writing of the manuscript. The study was conceived after a breakout session titled ‘40 Years of ENSO in Australia since McBride and Nicholls (1983)', held during the 2022 Annual Workshop of the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CLEX); the breakout session was proposed by A.G. and convened by A.S.T. and S.McG. A subsequent in-person workshop in 2023, supported by CLEX, brought together several co-authors who collaboratively drafted sections of the manuscript as follows: Introduction (N.N., J.McB, L.A., P.H., A.G., and A.S.T.); Dynamics (Z.E.G., W.C. and A.S.T, with contributions from G.W. and A.S.); Complexity (P.v.R., D.D. and S.McG, with input from C.C., G.B., H.H. and R.McK.); ENSO asymmetry (S.P.); Temporal complexity (H.H. and S.P.); Protracted ENSO events (J.G. and R.A.); ENSO–MJO interactions (T.L.D.); ENSO–SAM interactions (E.-P.L.); ENSO–IOD interactions (R.McK.); Terrestrial heatwaves and temperature extremes (S.P.-K.); Rainfall extremes (A.K.); Impacts and hydrology (D.V.-K. and K.A., with contributions from C.H., C.C.U., H.N. and A.S.T. on droughts and floods); Extra-tropical weather systems (A.P. and J.R.); Tropical cyclones (S.C.); South Pacific Convergence Zone (J.R.B.); Bushfires (N.A.); Land processes (S.S.); Agriculture (A.S.T.); Ocean extremes (N.H.); Sea level (X.Z.); Health and economic impacts (N.N.); Observed changes and future projections (D.D., with contributions from S.P., R.L. and S.McG.); Prediction (S.S., T.C., N.N., C.B.-D., E.-P.L. and J.R.); Pre-twentieth century climate and ENSO palaeo-reconstruction (M.F., J.R.B., L.A., J.G. and K.A.); Summary and future perspectives (A.S.T. and S.McG. with contribution from N.N., J.McB., S.P., P.H., A.G., R.A., J.G., L.A. and W.C.). A.S.T. created Figs. 1, 2 and 5; C.C. created Fig. 3; G.B. created Fig. 4; and R.L. created Fig. 6.

Antiferromagnets have gained a growing interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Among them, the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn stands out because of its electrical and magnetic properties driven by its non-collinear spin structure at room temperature. Despite research progress on the current-induced switching of the magnetic octupole in Mn3Sn, the ultrafast switching inherent to the antiferromagnet remains to be resolved, and the underlying mechanism is yet elusive. Here we measure the spatiotemporally resolved current-induced switching dynamics in polycrystalline Mn3Sn films using ultrafast magneto-optical Kerr effect imaging, with current pulses as short as 140 ps. Our results directly reveal two distinct switching regimes depending on the intensity and duration of the current pulse: a non-thermal process that does not require the transient melting of antiferromagnetic order, and a temperature-assisted process that relies on heating above the magnetic ordering temperature. Our work highlights the potential of Mn3Sn towards ultrafast magnetic recording devices.

Adjuvants are compounds that boost immune responses, improving the ability of vaccines to elicit long-lasting immunity against infectious diseases. At this week's meeting, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is expected to discuss aluminium, an adjuvant widely used in inoculations against diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B, among others. Over the past century, hundreds of millions of people have received vaccines containing small amounts of aluminium as an adjuvant.

But researchers are also racing to develop new adjuvants that can stimulate the immune responses needed to combat specific pathogens. Such adjuvants could prove crucial to the success of the next generation of vaccines against diseases including tuberculosis and malaria, and against viruses such as HIV, says Darrell Irvine, a vaccine immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.

“These are huge global health issues,” he says. “And adjuvants are likely going to be part of the solution.”

Adjuvants can work in different ways. Some adjuvants trigger low levels of inflammation at the injection site, thereby boosting recruitment of immune cells to where they are needed and encouraging the cells to linger there. Others are more specific, activating molecular signalling pathways in certain classes of immune cells.

Aluminium is in the first category, and its vaccine-boosting properties have been known for more than a century, says Irvine. Decades of use and scrutiny by regulators have clearly established that the benefits of using aluminium adjuvants outweigh any potential risks, says Marco Cavaleri, head of public-health threats at the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Even so, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has long campaigned against vaccines, has argued that aluminium adjuvants are linked to autism and food allergies. In July, researchers in Denmark published a study of more than one million children that found no such link1. Kennedy called for the study to be retracted; the journal declined.

The ACIP advisers, handpicked by Kennedy, will discuss the use of aluminium in vaccines this week, but they have not yet scheduled a vote. Any requirement to eliminate aluminium would be a shock to the system, says Cavaleri, and would render some crucial vaccines ineffective. “You cannot just get rid of an adjuvant that works and is safe before you have something else that you know will be a good replacement,” he says.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by fast progression, infiltrative growth pattern, and a high relapse rate. A defining feature of GBM is the existence of spatially and functionally distinct cellular niches, where malignant cells engage in paracrine crosstalk with cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment. Here, we identify pericytes as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma. Their depletion through genetic engineering results in accelerated tumor progression and shortened survival. Mechanistic studies reveal that pericyte deficiency remodels the endothelium and impacts the immune cell landscape, exacerbating tumor cell invasion and immune suppression. Specifically, the pericyte-deprived endothelium recruits perivascular, tumor-associated macrophages polarized towards an immune-suppressive phenotype. The recruited macrophages express Hepatocyte Growth Factor, which reinforces activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase MET on GBM cells harboring a pronounced mesenchymal subtype driven by the key phenotypic regulator Fosl1. Indeed, orthotopic implantation of MET-expressing GBM cells corroborates their superior tumor-initiating and invasive capabilities. Thus, pericytes represent critical modulators of GBM development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment, highlighting the importance of their preservation in therapy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","ByteDance and DeepSeek Are Placing Very Different AI Bets","https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-goes-high-while-bytedance-goes-wide/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:57:00 GMT","

Go high or go wide? DeepSeek and ByteDance, the two leaders of China's AI industry, are adopting vastly different strategies.

On Monday, DeepSeek released DeepSeek V3.2, another open-weight model that anyone can tinker with. The startup says it performs on par with the latest models from OpenAI and Google, and it even beats them on some key mathematics benchmarks.

That same day, ByteDance, whose dominance in AI applications we covered previously, introduced even more ways for people to use its chatbot, Doubao. ByteDance is now working with a Chinese smartphone manufacturer to embed Doubao into the operating system, giving it access to different apps and allowing it to conduct agentic tasks with them. In other words, it's coming for Apple's Siri.

Both ByteDance and DeepSeek have AI apps with over 140 million monthly users. But their latest announcements represent two diverging trends in China's AI industry. While some companies are still competing with their Western counterparts to build ever more capable models, others have quietly withdrawn from that game and are focusing on how they can integrate their AI tools into people's everyday lives.

DeepSeek's latest open-weight model may have disappointed some of its most loyal followers, who are still waiting for R2, a much-anticipated update to the initial model that rocked Silicon Valley in January. Instead, DeepSeek released V3.2 and V3.2-Speciale, which are better-optimized versions of its previous model V3.2-Exp, released in September.

Still, V3.2 caused a stir in the AI industry because DeepSeek claims it can solve the type of advanced math questions asked at the International Mathematical Olympiad, and its performance on other coding and reasoning tasks is supposedly on par with or above GPT 5 and Gemini 3. “It suddenly dawned on me why they call the company DeepSeek with the whale as a motif. Because just like a whale, it rarely surfaces, but every time it surfaces, it always makes a massive splash,” says Jen Zhu Scott, an AI investor and the cofounder and CEO of Power Dynamics, a modular data-center solutions firm.

However, I can't help but feel like this arms race of AI models is getting a little tiring, particularly because so many new ones have been released in the last month, each claiming to take humanity one step higher. In less than 20 days, we had OpenAI's GPT 5.1, Google's Gemini 3 Pro, Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5; throw in Chinese open source models like Moonshot's Kimi K2 and DeepSeek's V3.2, and it becomes a total mess. My attention span can be summarized by this perfect meme.

“At the end of the day, we can't keep up with all these hairline differences between different models, different releases,” Zhu says. “It actually doesn't make a huge difference, apart from some kind of stock market speculation on who's gonna win.”

DeepSeek, however, has differentiated itself in one important way: From the beginning, the company has focused on model efficiency, partly since it reportedly doesn't have access to an abundant supply of computer chips. As a result, its models often use fewer computing resources to train and cost developers less to run than those from Western labs. “Efficiency is very important if you are a startup. An open source model is superior both in terms of costs and because of customizability,” says Steve Hsu, a physics professor at Michigan State University and an AI startup founder.

Meanwhile, ByteDance is on a completely different trajectory. The social media giant is still not making smartphones, but it is turning its AI chatbot Doubao into something as close to a smartphone operating system as possible.

In late November, ByteDance released Doubao Input Method. Input apps (also called keyboard apps) are third-party tools that allow people to type Chinese characters quickly on QWERTY keyboards and are every Chinese person's portal into the digital world. Now, Doubao is offering a new keyboard app with what it claims is superior speech-to-text functionality, giving users another entry point into ByteDance's AI app ecosystem.

But ByteDance's most ambitious move recently came on Monday, when it released a Doubao AI agent that can be integrated into a smartphone's operating system, giving it control over any app. In a preview video, ByteDance shows how Doubao can access Tesla's app and open the trunk using voice inputs, search through different ecommerce platforms to find the lowest prices, and access photos in a user's camera roll and enhance them with AI.

ByteDance is working with the Chinese smartphone manufacturer ZTE to preinstall the Doubao agent on one of its phone models, the Nubia M153, which sells for 3,499 RMB (about $500). ByteDance says it's also talking to other smartphone makers about installing its agent, but it seems unlikely that many will take it up on the offer—the most popular Chinese smartphone brands, like Huawei or Xiaomi, are all developing their own proprietary AI agents.

Doubao's agent has already been blocked by the most popular app in China, Tencent's WeChat. With over 1.4 billion users and an expansive range of features, WeChat is as close to an operating system as you can get in China today. On Wednesday, users on Chinese social media reported that they were suspended from WeChat after they used Doubao's agent to access it, a punishment no one would be willing to risk receiving in China. Doubao quickly announced that it has disabled its agent from working with WeChat, and said that the suspended users will get their accounts back soon. On this latest episode of Chinese big-tech feuds, it's Tencent 1 vs. ByteDance 0.

DeepSeek and ByteDance's Doubao represent two ends of the spectrum of Chinese AI companies, while others fall somewhere in-between. Small but mighty startups like Zhipu, Minimax, and Moonshot are following in DeepSeek's footsteps, releasing capable open source models, while Baidu and Tencent are going the more application-focused route. Alibaba is still mostly on DeepSeek's side, constantly releasing new versions of its open source Qwen models, but lately, it seems eager to cross over to the other side: Last month, it put out a consumer-facing AI super-app.

ByteDance doesn't have to compete in the benchmark arms race because it already has a gigantic user base, and as a private company, Hsu says, it doesn't need to worry about stock market volatility. “They just have to ship quietly, integrate a really powerful AI model into their existing app, and I think that's what they are doing,” he explains. Alibaba and Google could go that route, too, but they seem more hung up on prestige and winning accolades than ByteDance.

What unites Chinese AI firms is the thing they're not doing. Unlike American tech giants, they're steering clear of the compute hoarding game, where companies keep building more data centers and brute-forcing their way to more powerful models. Partly, that's because of American chip sanctions, which block Chinese companies from accessing cutting-edge chips from Nvidia. But also, “they are just not as well capitalized. They don't have infinite amounts of money the way that American companies have,” Hsu says, so it makes sense for them to opt out from the beginning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Is Detaining People for ICE","https://www.wired.com/story/story/the-louisiana-department-of-wildlife-and-fisheries-is-detaining-people-for-ice/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

The Louisiana Department Of Wildlife And Fisheries (LDWF), typically responsible in part for overseeing wildlife reserves and enforcing local hunting rules, has assisted United States immigration authorities with bringing at least six people into federal custody this year, according to documents WIRED obtained via a public record request.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

According to the documents, LDWF signed a memorandum of agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in May, which gives the wildlife agency the authority to detain people suspected of immigration violations and to transfer them into ICE custody. Since then, at least six men entered ICE custody after coming into contact with or being detained by LDWF officers. None of the men were issued criminal charges at the time they came into contact with LDWF officers, the documents show. Two of the men were known by ICE to have been in the country legally at the time the agency took them into custody.

The documents also indicate that at least one “joint patrol” took place in a Louisiana wildlife management area in which LDWF agents were accompanied by officers with Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard. The memorandum of agreement between ICE and LDWF makes no mention of CBP or the possibility of working with the agency as part of the agreement. However, the documents indicate that a relationship with CBP may have been facilitated through LDWF's partnership with ICE.

LDWF partnered with ICE under the agency's 287(g) program, named after the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that enables officers and employees at the state or local level to perform some of the functions of US immigration officers, such as investigating, apprehending, detaining, or transporting people suspected of violating immigration law.

As of December 3, exactly 1,205 agencies have partnered with ICE through the 287(g) program. (An additional eight agencies are currently pending approval from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security.) Some 1,053 of these agreements were signed this year, meaning enrollment has increased by 693 percent compared to the end of 2024. The LDWF is one of just three state wildlife agencies—the others being the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources—that have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, according to public ICE records. All three agreements were signed this year.

The marked expansion of the 287(g) program this year has generated relatively little attention. However, the documents from the LDWF indicate that the state and local agencies enrolled are actively detaining people not guilty of any crimes, and facilitating their arrests and possible deportation.

CBP did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment. The LDWF answered questions about one particular incident, but did not respond to WIRED's complete request for comment. ICE spokesperson Angelina Vicknair—when given the men's full names, the dates and locations they were detained, all known circumstances of their detainment, and all other identifying information included in the documents—said that the agency did not have enough information to determine if the men were in custody, released, or deported. She also said that the number of men WIRED asked about, seven, constituted “too large a query,” adding, “We'll need you to narrow it down.”

Per a LDWF “After Action Report” obtained by WIRED, three men were taken into a federal custody after the agency conducted a joint patrol on August 11 with five US Coast Guard officers and an unknown number of CBP agents in Lake Borgne, which is in Louisiana's sprawling Biloxi Marsh Complex. According to the report, the officers were looking for people allegedly violating state statues for seed oyster harvesting.

The report claims that no one on the patrol witnessed any crimes or civil violations. Despite this, it says that “the federal partners were able to identify and detain 3 subjects for immigration issues,” adding that “all arrestees were transported by Federal agencies to detention centers.” It's unclear why these individuals were singled out, but all three appear to have Hispanic last names.

The report claims that two of the arrested individuals legally entered the US but overstayed the amount of time they were allowed to remain in the country. The third person, it claims, entered the country illegally and had an unspecified “criminal history.” Given the report's sparse information about the men, it's unclear if any of them have been deported or remain in federal custody.

Some time after the August 11 patrol, the report claims, a CBP lieutenant asked LDWF about organizing “future patrol opportunities and joint patrols” with the agency.

“After this operation, CBP has reason to believe that future patrols will be beneficial and productive,” the report reads. “They also expressed how much they learned traversing some of the more specific waterbodies with the local knowledge of our agents, they were able to learn new routes across the area that will allow them to extend the effectiveness of their independent patrols.”

In an August 22 email obtained by WIRED, LDWF regional captain Tim Fox says that CBP wanted to organize future patrols “on a less formal basis.” It's unclear whether a less formal patrol would still produce a paper trail.

According to a later LDWF incident report, the agency arrested three additional people in October, all of whom were taken into ICE custody. The men were issued civil citations for going to a wildlife management area and using their firearms without the proper permits, the report says, but none were issued any criminal charges.

The report claims that on October 23, two LDWF officers patrolling the Maurepas Swamp Wildlife Management Area heard several gunshots in an area where “people often illegally target shoot.” The suspects, three men in their twenties, all cooperated with LDWF at the scene. When asked to show their weapons, they showed the officers a pistol, an AR-15, several magazines, and a few dozen rounds of ammunition. The officers confirmed that none of the firearms were stolen. One of the men also showed the officers where they had been shooting.

The men showed identification—a Louisiana ID card, a Honduran ID card, and a Honduran passport, respectively—when asked, but did not have the appropriate permits for being in a Wildlife Management Area and firing a weapon. The two men who fired weapons were issued three civil citations, while the one who didn't was issued two. At some point during LDWF's interactions with the men, the agency called immigration authorities.

“Due to the unknown immigration status and them possessing firearms, we made contact with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI),” the report reads. A HSI agent reportedly told LDWF that one of the men had a final removal order, one had “pending” immigration proceedings, and one man had legal parole to be in the US. When LDWF contacted the local ICE field office, ICE sent two agents to the scene.

Upon arrival, the report claims, “The ICE Officers made several phone calls and they decided to take custody of all three subjects.” All three men were placed in handcuffs and escorted to the ICE officers' vehicles.

It's unclear if any of these men were deported, but based on information in the report, none of them appear to currently be in ICE custody, according to the agency's detainee locator.

In response to WIRED's public record request, LDWF also included an incident report filed on October 6. The report describes a man who allegedly littered “roofing shingles, nails and other assorted building materials” near Cypress Lake for which he was issued one civil citation for “gross littering.” It notes that the man didn't speak English, but “was cooperative during this investigation” with the help of a translator.

The incident report says that the man had “unverified citizenship,” but it does not specify whether he was taken into ICE custody. When asked about the incident and why it was included in the response to WIRED's public record request, a LWFD spokesperson clarified that the agency reported the man to ICE after he was issued the littering citation.

The spokesperson said that as a result of the man's “unverified citizenship,” the LDWF “forwarded the citation and report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (‘ICE').”

“LDWF has no further information regarding Mr. Garcia's current status or location,” the spokesperson said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Startup Says It Has Found a Hidden Source of Geothermal Energy","https://www.wired.com/story/startup-found-hidden-source-geothermal-energy/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

A geothermal startup said Thursday that it has hit gold in Nevada—metaphorically speaking. Zanskar, which uses AI to find hidden geothermal resources deep underground, says that it has identified a new commercially viable site for a potential power plant. The discovery, the company claims, is the first of its kind made by the industry in decades.

The find is the culmination of years of research on how to find these resources—and points to the growing promise of geothermal energy.

“When we started this company, I think the most common message we heard was that geothermal was dead—it was a history of bones, a graveyard of so many failures,” says Carl Hoiland, a cofounder of Zanskar. “To get to this point where, thanks to these new tools and these new capabilities, you can systematically find these sites and systematically derisk them—we just think this is the first full-scale signal that the tide has turned.”

In theory, geothermal power is one of the simplest methods of generating renewable energy. Reservoirs of hot water underground, heated by the Earth's core, produce steam that can then be used to power turbines at the surface, requiring no excessive mining or complex conversions of fuel. Geothermal resources are especially accessible in areas where tectonic plates meet and the Earth's crust is thinner, making the western US a great candidate for power plants. The world's largest developed geothermal field, in California, is built on the site of hot springs that humans have used for thousands of years; the first power plant was built there in the early 1920s.

But a big part of the geothermal puzzle is actually finding these resources. It's rare to find hot springs or vents at the surface that lead to a productive spot to put a power plant. Most geothermal systems that are hot enough to make electricity are deep underground, and there is no evidence at the surface. These are known as hidden or blind systems—and identifying where they are is surprisingly challenging. As a result, many geothermal power plants are built over systems that were found accidentally, while drilling for agricultural wells, minerals, or oil and gas exploration.

“It is sort of a needle-and-haystack problem,” says Joel Edwards, Zanskar's other cofounder. “A very small percentage of the land that you will look at will have a geothermal system associated with it.”

In the 1970s, during the oil crisis, the federal government decided to try to increase the US's output of geothermal energy. As part of that effort, they mapped out a grid in Nevada to try to methodically drill for blind systems.

“Today, we might think that's really stupid,” says James Faulds, a professor of geology at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the former director of the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology. “But back then they had so little data on the heat characteristics [of hidden systems]. It made sense at that time to do something like that.”

The government subsequently scaled back investment in research into geothermal, pouring money into other energy technologies like fracking, nuclear, and solar and wind. The industry, starved of funding, moved on to developing already-known systems; any profitable blind systems developed after the 1980s, Edwards says, were found by accident or via academic or government work. Today, geothermal energy accounts for less than 1 percent of the US energy supply.

But scientists in the field say there's a vast and mostly untapped potential in blind systems in the western US. And Zanskar says that its technology—which uses AI to wrangle massive reams of geological data—can help find those systems.

Zanskar's tech builds off the work of scientists like Faulds, who began researching and cataloging the attributes of known systems in the 2000s to try to create techniques to locate other blind systems. In the late 2010s, Faulds led a team of researchers, funded partly by a grant from the Department of Energy, to try to pinpoint blind systems in Nevada, using data on factors like fault patterns and electrical conductivity to triangulate where, exactly, a system might be located. The team successfully located a blind system that was hot enough to use for electricity with this technique in 2018.

Faulds says that they did not do further testing to see if this was a system that could be commercially viable, partly because it was enveloped by a wilderness study area and probably wouldn't be a good option for a power plant. Edwards says there's a “lot of overlap” between Faulds's research group and Zanskar—Faulds was Edwards's master's thesis adviser, as well as the adviser for a data scientist for the company. “That group showed that you could actually find these blind hot spots for lower costs than the 1970s and 1980s explorers paid,” says Edwards.

Zanskar's researchers have been collecting data on their sites in Nevada for the past few years, and Edwards and Hoiland say that their tech has been consistently identifying hot spots—potential blind systems—in areas not used before by the geothermal industry. What the company hadn't done until this year, however, was to confirm that these systems could actually produce electricity—something requiring tests that involve drilling deep underground to ensure the water is hot enough to power a plant. The discovery announced today, the company says, is proof that their tech can find these kinds of systems. (More tests are still needed to understand the size and shape of the reservoir, as well as the rate of flow of the water—crucial factors to determine how much power the site can provide.)

“There's a signal to the market with this announcement that there will be a power plug someday,” says Edwards.

In recent months, a spate of high-profile agreements and splashy headlines have trumpeted a new era for geothermal energy. Almost all of the public excitement centers around a technology known as enhanced geothermal systems, or EGS, which manually creates conditions for geothermal through a process similar to fracking, eliminating the need to find blind systems. The most high-profile player, Fervo, has inked agreements with major oil companies, oilfield service providers, and utilities; one of its power plants began supplying power to Google data centers in Nevada in 2023.

But it may be that the potential for harnessing blind systems is being overlooked in the craze to embrace new technologies like EGS. While it uses less water than traditional fracking, EGS does need to draw from outside water sources for the injection process to break the rock; it also can produce some low-level seismic activity. It's also simply more complex than traditional geothermal, introducing a new technological step of breaking rock versus simply drilling down to a system and then installing a power plant on top. “Engineering always comes with additional cost,” Hoiland says.

Ultimately, Zanskar's cofounders say, the energy potential for blind geothermal systems could be much greater than what has been estimated in the past. In 2008, the US government issued a report on the country's geothermal resources, estimating that undiscovered geothermal systems comprised a mean power potential of 30 gigawatts of electricity—enough to power more than 25 million homes.

But Faulds says that these estimates “might be underestimated by well over an order of magnitude,” saying that “tens to hundreds of gigawatts are likely from blind systems” in the US. He points to new technologies being developed that allow for deeper drilling involving hotter conditions. As that technology keeps advancing, “naturally our ability to harness that energy also keeps growing,” he says.

Nicholas Merrill has spent his career fighting government surveillance. But he would really rather you didn't call what he's selling now a “burner phone.”

Yes, he dreams of a future where anyone in the US can get a working smartphone—complete with cellular coverage and data—without revealing their identity, even to the phone company. But to call such anonymous phones “burners” suggests that they're for something illegal, shady, or at least subversive. The term calls to mind drug dealers or deep-throat confidential sources in parking garages.

With his new startup, Merrill says he instead wants to offer cellular service for your existing phone that makes near-total mobile privacy the permanent, boring default of daily life in the US. “We're not looking to cater to people doing bad things,” says Merrill. “We're trying to help people feel more comfortable living their normal lives, where they're not doing anything wrong, and not feel watched and exploited by giant surveillance and data mining operations. I think it's not controversial to say the vast majority of people want that.”

That's the thinking behind Phreeli, the phone carrier startup Merrill launched today, designed to be the most privacy-focused cellular provider available to Americans. Phreeli, as in, “speak freely,” aims to give its user a different sort of privacy from the kind that can be had with end-to-end encrypted texting and calling tools like Signal or WhatsApp. Those apps hide the content of conversations, or even, in Signal's case, metadata like the identities of who is talking to whom. Phreeli instead wants to offer actual anonymity. It can't help government agencies or data brokers obtain users' identifying information because it has almost none to share. The only piece of information the company records about its users when they sign up for a Phreeli phone number is, in fact, a mere ZIP code. That's the minimum personal data Merrill has determined his company is legally required to keep about its customers for tax purposes.

By asking users for almost no identifiable information, Merrill wants to protect them from one of the most intractable privacy problems in modern technology: Despite whatever surveillance-resistant communications apps you might use, phone carriers will always know which of their customers' phones are connecting to which cell towers and when. Carriers have frequently handed that information over to data brokers willing to pay for it—or any FBI or ICE agent that demands it with a court order

Merrill has some firsthand experience with those demands. Starting in 2004, he fought a landmark, decade-plus legal battle against the FBI and the Department of Justice. As the owner of an internet service provider in the post-9/11 era, Merrill had received a secret order from the bureau to hand over data on a particular user—and he refused. After that, he spent another 15 years building and managing the Calyx Institute, a nonprofit that offers privacy tools like a snooping-resistant version of Android and a free VPN that collects no logs of its users' activities. “Nick is somebody who is extremely principled and willing to take a stand for his principles,” says Cindy Cohn, who as executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has led the group's own decades-long fight against government surveillance. “He's careful and thoughtful, but also, at a certain level, kind of fearless.”

Nicholas Merrill with a copy of the National Security Letter he received from the FBI in 2004, ordering him to give up data on one of his customers. He refused, fought a decade-plus court battle—and won.

More recently, Merrill began to realize he had a chance to achieve a win against surveillance at a more fundamental level: by becoming the phone company. “I started to realize that if I controlled the mobile provider, there would be even more opportunities to create privacy for people,” Merrill says. “If we were able to set up our own network of cell towers globally, we can set the privacy policies of what those towers see and collect.”

Building or buying cell towers across the US for billions of dollars, of course, was not within the budget of Merrill's dozen-person startup. So he's created the next best thing: a so-called mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, a kind of virtual phone carrier that pays one of the big, established ones—in Phreeli's case, T-Mobile—to use its infrastructure.

The result is something like a cellular prophylactic. The towers are T-Mobile's, but the contracts with users—and the decisions about what private data to require from them—are Phreeli's. “You can't control the towers. But what can you do?” he says. “You can separate the personally identifiable information of a person from their activities on the phone system.”

Signing up a customer for phone service without knowing their name is, surprisingly, legal in all 50 states, Merrill says. Anonymously accepting money from users—with payment options other than envelopes of cash—presents more technical challenges. To that end, Phreeli has implemented a new encryption system it calls Double-Blind Armadillo, based on cutting-edge cryptographic protocols known as zero-knowledge proofs. Through a kind of mathematical sleight of hand, those crypto functions are capable of tasks like confirming that a certain phone has had its monthly service paid for, but without keeping any record that links a specific credit card number to that phone. Phreeli users can also pay their bills (or rather, prepay them, since Phreeli has no way to track down anonymous users who owe them money) with tough-to-trace cryptocurrency like Zcash or Monero.

Phreeli users can, however, choose to set their own dials for secrecy versus convenience. If they offer an email address at signup, they can more easily recover their account if their phone is lost. To get a SIM card, they can give their mailing address—which Merrill says Phreeli will promptly delete after the SIM ships—or they can download the digital equivalent known as an eSIM, even, if they choose, from a site Phreeli will host on the Tor anonymity network.

Phreeli's “armadillo” analogy—the animal also serves as the mascot in its logo—is meant to capture this sliding scale of privacy that Phreeli offers its users: Armadillos always have a layer of armor, but they can choose whether to expose their vulnerable underbelly or curl into a fully protected ball.

Even if users choose the less paranoid side of that spectrum of options, Merrill argues, his company will still be significantly less surveillance-friendly than existing phone companies, which have long represented one of the weakest links in the tech world's privacy protections. All major US cellular carriers comply, for instance, with law enforcement surveillance orders like “tower dumps” that hand over data to the government on every phone that connected to a particular cell tower during a certain time. They've also happily, repeatedly handed over your data to corporate interests: Last year the Federal Communications Commission fined AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile nearly $200 million for selling users' personal information, including their locations, to data brokers. (AT&T's fine was later overturned by an appeals court ruling intended to limit the FCC's enforcement powers.) Many data brokers in turn sell the information to federal agencies, including ICE and other parts of the DHS, offering an all-too-easy end run around restrictions on those agencies' domestic spying.

Phreeli doesn't promise to be a surveillance panacea. Even if your cellular carrier isn't tying your movements to your identity, the operating system of whatever phone you sign up with might be. Even your mobile apps can track you.

But for a startup seeking to be the country's most privacy-focused mobile carrier, the bar is low. “The goal of this phone company I'm starting is to be more private than the three biggest phone carriers in the US. That's the promise we're going to massively overdeliver on,” says Merrill. “I don't think there's any way we can mess that up.”

Merrill's not-entirely-voluntary decision to spend the last 20-plus years as a privacy diehard began with three pages of paper that arrived at his office on a February day in New York in 2004. An FBI agent knocked on the door of his small internet service provider firm called Calyx, headquartered in a warehouse space a block from the Holland Tunnel in Manhattan. When Merrill answered, he found an older man with parted white hair, dressed in a trench coat like a comic book G-man, who handed him an envelope.

Merrill opened it and read the letter while the agent waited. The first and second paragraphs told him he was hereby ordered to hand over virtually all information he possessed for one of his customers, identified by their email address, explaining that this demand was authorized by a law he'd later learn was part of the Patriot Act. The third paragraph informed him he couldn't tell anyone he'd even received this letter—a gag order.

Then the agent departed without answering any of Merrill's questions. He was left to decide what to do, entirely alone.

Merrill was struck immediately by the fact that the letter had no signature from a judge. He had in fact been handed a so-called National Security Letter, or NSL, a rarely seen and highly controversial tool of the Bush administration that allowed the FBI to demand information without a warrant, so long as it was related to “national security.”

Calyx's actual business, since he'd first launched the company in the early '90s with a bank of modems in the nonfunctional fireplace of a New York apartment, had evolved into hosting the websites of big corporate customers like Mitsubishi and Ikea. But Merrill used that revenue stream to give pro bono or subsidized web hosting to nonprofit clients he supported like the Marijuana Policy Project and Indymedia—and to offer fast internet connections to a few friends and acquaintances like the one named in this surveillance order.

Merrill has never publicly revealed the the identity of the NSL's target, and he declined to share it with WIRED. But he knew this particular customer, and he certainly didn't strike Merrill as a national security threat. If he were, Merrill thought, why not just get a warrant? The customer would later tell Merrill he had in fact been pressured by the FBI to become an informant—and had refused. The bureau, he told Merrill, had then retaliated by putting him on the no-fly list and pressuring employers not to hire him. (The FBI didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment on the case.)

Merrill immediately decided to risk disobeying the gag order—on pain of what consequences, he had no idea—and called his lawyer, who told him to go to the New York affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, which happened to be one of Calyx's web-hosting clients. After a few minutes in a cab, Merrill was talking to a young attorney named Jameel Jaffer in the ACLU's Financial District office. “I wish I could say that we reassured him with our expertise on the NSL statute, but that's not how it went down,” Jaffer says. “We had never seen one of these before.”

Merrill, meanwhile, knew that every lawyer he showed the letter to might represent another count in his impending prosecution. “I was terrified,” he says. “I kind of assumed someone could just come to my place that night, throw a hood over my head, and drag me away.”

Phreeli will use a novel encryption system called Double-Blind Armadillo—based on cutting edge crypto protocols known as zero-knowledge proofs—to pull of tricks like accepting credit card payments from customers without keeping any record that ties that payment information to their particular phone.

Despite his fears, Merrill never complied with the FBI's letter. Instead, he decided to fight its constitutionality in court, with the help of pro bono representation from the ACLU and later the Yale Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic. That fight would last 11 years and entirely commandeer his life.

Merrill and his lawyers argued that the NSL represented an unconstitutional search and a violation of his free-speech rights—and they won. But Congress only amended the NSL statute, leaving the provision about its gag order intact, and the legal battle dragged out for years longer. Even after the NSL was rescinded altogether, Merrill continued to fight for the right to talk about its existence. “This was a time when so many people in his position were essentially cowering under their desks. But he felt an obligation as a citizen to speak out about surveillance powers that he thought had gone too far,” says Jaffer, who represented Merrill for the first six years of that courtroom war. “He impressed me with his courage.”

Battling the FBI took over Merrill's life to the degree that he eventually shut down his ISP for lack of time or will to run the business and instead took a series of IT jobs. “I felt too much weight on my shoulders,” he says. “I was just constantly on the phone with lawyers, and I was scared all the time.”

By 2010, Merrill had won the right to publicly name himself as the NSL's recipient. By 2015 he'd beaten the gag order entirely and released the full letter with only the target's name redacted. But Merrill and the ACLU never got the Supreme Court precedent they wanted from the case. Instead, the Patriot Act itself was amended to reign in NSLs' unconstitutional powers.

In the meantime, those years of endless bureaucratic legal struggles had left Merrill disillusioned with judicial or even legislative action as a way to protect privacy. Instead, he decided to try a different approach. “The third way to fight surveillance is with technology,” he says. “That was my big realization.”

So, just after Merrill won the legal right to go public with his NSL battle in 2010, he founded the Calyx Institute, a nonprofit that shared a name with his old ISP but was instead focused on building free privacy tools and services. The privacy-focused version of Google's Android OS it would develop, designed to strip out data-tracking tools and use Signal by default for calls and texts, would eventually have close to 100,000 users. It ran servers for anonymous, encrypted instant messaging over the chat protocol XMPP with around 300,000 users. The institute also offered a VPN service and ran servers that comprised part of the volunteer-based Tor anonymity network, tools that Merrill estimates were used by millions.

As he became a cause célèbre and then a standout activist in the digital privacy world over those years, Merrill says he started to become aware of the growing problem of untrustworthy cellular providers in an increasingly phone-dependent world. He'd sometimes come across anti-surveillance hard-liners determined to avoid giving any personal information to cellular carriers, who bought SIM cards with cash and signed up for prepaid plans with false names. Some even avoided cell service altogether, using phones they connected only to Wi-Fi. “Eventually those people never got invites to any parties,” Merrill says.

All these schemes, he knew, were legal enough. So why not a phone company that only collects minimal personal information—or none—from its normal, non-extremist customers? As early as 2019, he had already consulted with lawyers and incorporated Phreeli as a company. He decided on the for-profit startup route after learning that the 501c3 statute can't apply to a telecom firm. Only last year, he finally raised $5 million, mostly from one angel investor. (Merrill declined to name the person. Naturally, they value their privacy.)

Building a system that could function like a normal phone company—and accept users' payments like one—without storing virtually any identifying information on those customers presented a distinct challenge. To solve it, Merrill consulted with Zooko Wilcox, one of the creators of Zcash, perhaps the closest thing in the world to actual anonymous cryptocurrency. The Z in Zcash stands for “zero-knowledge proofs,” a relatively new form of crypto system that has allowed Zcash's users to prove things (like who has paid whom) while keeping all information (like their identities, or even the amount of payments) fully encrypted.

For Phreeli, Wilcox suggested a related but slightly different system: so-called “zero-knowledge access passes.” Wilcox compares the system to people showing their driver's license at the door of a club. “You've got to give your home address to the bouncer,” Wilcox says incredulously. The magical properties of zero knowledge proofs, he says, would allow you to generate an unforgeable crypto credential that proves you're over 21 and then show that to the doorman without revealing your name, address, or even your age. “A process that previously required identification gets replaced by something that only requires authorization,” Wilcox says. “See the difference?”

The same trick will now let Phreeli users prove they've prepaid their phone bill without connecting their name, address, or any payment information to their phone records—even if they pay with a credit card. The result, Merrill says, will be a user experience for most customers that's not very different from their existing phone carrier, but with a radically different level of data collection.

As for Wilcox, he's long been one of that small group of privacy zealots who buys his SIM cards in cash with a fake name. But he hopes Phreeli will offer an easier path—not just for people like him, but for normies too.

“I don't know of anybody who's ever offered this credibly before,” says Wilcox. “Not the usual telecom-strip-mining-your-data phone, not a black-hoodie hacker phone, but a privacy-is-normal phone.”

Even so, enough tech companies have pitched privacy as a feature for their commercial product that jaded consumers may not buy into a for-profit telecom like Phreeli purporting to offer anonymity. But the EFF's Cohn says that Merrill's track record shows he's not just using the fight against surveillance as a marketing gimmick to sell something. “Having watched Nick for a long time, it's all a means to an end for him,” she says. “And the end is privacy for everyone.”

Merrill may not like the implications of describing Phreeli as a cellular carrier where every phone is a burner phone. But there's little doubt that some of the company's customers will use its privacy protections for crime—just as with every surveillance-resistant tool, from Signal to Tor to briefcases of cash.

Phreeli won't, at least, offer a platform for spammers and robocallers, Merrill says. Even without knowing users' identities, he says the company will block that kind of bad behavior by limiting how many calls and texts users are allowed, and banning users who appear to be gaming the system. “If people think this is going to be a safe haven for abusing the phone network, that's not going to work,” Merrill says.

But some customers of his phone company will, to Merrill's regret, do bad things, he says—just as they sometimes used to with pay phones, that anonymous, cash-based phone service that once existed on every block of American cities. “You put a quarter in, you didn't need to identify yourself, and you could call whoever you wanted,” he reminisces. “And 99.9 percent of the time, people weren't doing bad stuff.” The small minority who were, he argues, didn't justify the involuntary societal slide into the cellular panopticon we all live in today, where a phone call not tied to freely traded data on the caller's identity is a rare phenomenon.

“The pendulum has swung so far in favor of total information awareness,” says Merrill, using an intelligence term of the Bush administration whose surveillance order set him on this path 21 years ago. “Things that we used to be able to take for granted have slipped through our fingers.”

“Other phone companies are selling an apartment that comes with no curtains—where the windows are incompatible with curtains,” Merrill says. “We're trying to say, no, curtains are normal. Privacy is normal.”

Discarded electronic waste containing earth minerals is overtaking landfills globally at an alarming rate as much of the tech industry and enterprises kick the disposal problem to the curb. Meanwhile, the waste stream contains critical raw materials needed across global supply chains.

The latest edition of the Global E-Waste Monitor reported that global e-waste contained approximately 68 billion pounds of metals in 2022, including significant amounts of critical raw materials. The estimated value of these e-waste metals in 2022 was $91 billion, with copper, iron, gold, and nickel the most valuable components.

The report found that formal recycling captured only $28 billion in metal value in 2022, with informal recycling contributing an additional $12 billion. Yet the bigger story sits beneath those numbers. When the estimated $78 billion in yearly health and environmental damage is included, e-waste becomes a net global loss of about $37 billion — potentially climbing to $40 billion by 2030.

Thomas Witherell, president of Data Recycling of New England, noted that solving the e-waste problem is more complex than just recycling for metal value. He argued that reports often neglect hazardous materials, the actual low content of valuable material in each item, and manufacturers' trend toward using less gold in newer devices. Devices now yield the same scrap prices they did 15 years ago, while costs have risen, pushing many recyclers toward resale to remain viable.

“As a recycler, this sounds good on a macro level. But it's not that easy. There are multiple factors to consider,” Witherell told TechNewsWorld.

Trey Closson, CEO of Amplio, an industrial asset recovery firm, added that many enterprises lack the incentive to manage e-waste effectively, as procurement focuses on production, making it easier to send assets to a scrapper or landfill than to dispose of them responsibly.

“It's much easier to send a few truckloads of assets to a scrapper or a landfill than it is to ensure that every item is disposed of responsibly,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Inventory managers at plants don't have the resources or the mandate to handle e-waste and other disposal the right way, so they don't.”

The scale is significant. Every person generates about 18 pounds of e-waste per year. Larger, heavier equipment, like refrigerators, has a higher recycling rate than smaller electronics. Witherell said that referring to e-waste as a “gold mine” is a false narrative because most devices contain minimal recoverable value.

Amplio's Closson noted that scrap metal prices, while volatile, generally trend up, providing a base value for obsolete assets. Amplio's AI software compares resale profit projections with metal scrapping costs to choose the optimal strategy.

“Often, products and machines that aren't worth reselling whole can at least be scrapped for positive net value,” he said.

Ismael Velasco, founder of the Adora Foundation, sees innovation tackling e-waste, from reducing software-forced obsolescence to global hardware reuse. He noted that a few platforms aim to tackle this at the design stage. Companies lack generic, industry-specific software platforms to scale solutions.

“Some industry consortia and companies create marketplaces to collect and recycle electronics. That's as far as it goes today. But there are very few platforms that aim to do it at the design stage itself,” Velasco told TechNewsWorld.

Companies are on their own when it comes to recycling outdated equipment. Some work with consultants who are not necessarily electronics experts.

“It is essential to allow solutions to scale across use cases and companies and to ensure that measures taken balance correctly the form, fit, and functionality choices of the electronics device under question,” he said.

Francis D'Souza, CEO of Banyan.eco, developed a platform for scoring recyclability and reusability, aiming to provide specs to electronics designers before production.

He noted that resource scarcity and geopolitical stress are embedded in the industry, and that rising volumes of discarded electronics are intensifying both environmental and economic pressures.

The goal is getting the specs in front of electronics designers before their devices go into production.

“Growing e-waste means a lot of valuable resources ending up in a landfill,” he told TechNewsWorld, noting that discarding hardware creates an environmental challenge through contamination from toxic materials.

“The economic impact of making newer devices that need more expensive materials as they become rarer creates a model that drives up consumer costs over time,” he added.

Luke Crihfield, director of demand generation at Amplio, suggested that enterprises can reduce e-waste by implementing better procurement and recovery strategies. Planning for sustainability starts with procurement, which must build lifespan and redeployment planning into purchasing decisions across facilities.

Crihfield pointed to a market shift toward refurbished hardware driven by production necessity. If a refurbished part is the difference between a production line running or grinding to a halt, manufacturers will use refurbished and pre-owned parts.

He added that many organizations have decentralized purchasing among different sites, where buyers are usually incentivized to minimize purchase cost rather than minimize surplus down the road.

“Reduce e-waste by never buying items that you won't need,” Crihfield told TechNewsWorld. “Obviously, this is much easier said than done.”

Government regulation plays an important part. The adoption of the EU's recent Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) could accelerate market demand by making products more sustainable from the start, increasing the appetite for subsequent reuse. He noted that e-waste is also a visibility and knowledge problem among enterprises.

Meaghan Kennedy, founder of Orange Sparkle Ball, said regulators, customers, and investors are increasingly pushing companies to be more transparent about how they manage devices at the end of their life. That pressure is driving improvements in tracking, product longevity, and repair-friendly design, and the broader adoption of take-back programs.

“They are recognizing that discarded electronics are not just waste but valuable sources of components and critical minerals,” she told TechNewsWorld.

Kennedy's Penny Pickup program focuses on a persistent industry bottleneck: collecting devices before they become waste. The initiative uses zero-emission micrologistics — including autonomous robots and e-cargo bikes — to retrieve equipment directly from homes, labs, and offices.

“We solve the last-mile bottleneck. Most programs fail (early) at reaching homes, labs, and offices. That is our lane,” she said.

By moving recovered devices to nearby refurbishers and processors, the platform keeps value and jobs within the community while reducing the volume of electronics headed to landfills.

Govstream.ai, a Seattle-area startup building AI-native permitting tools for local governments, raised $3.6 million in funding, the company announced Thursday.

The seed round was led by Menlo Park, Calif.-based 47th Street Partners, with participation from Nellore Capital of Palo Alto, Calif., Seattle-based Ascend, and angel investors including Socrata founder Kevin Merritt and First Due co-founder and CEO Andreas Huber.

Govstream.ai's platform sits on top of the systems cities already use and acts as a conversational “copilot” for permit techs, planners, and reviewers. The company says the technology answers questions, checks documents, compares plan sets, and helps move applications through review faster.

The first public deployment is with the City of Bellevue, where Govstream.ai's smart assistant has been helping Development Services staff with internal permitting and zoning questions since this summer.

“Cities are under intense pressure to add housing, support small businesses, and keep development sustainable, all while working inside permitting systems that were never really rethought for this moment,” said Safouen Rabah, founder and CEO of Govstream.ai.

In Washington, for example, state projections show that roughly 1.1 million additional homes will be needed by 2044 to keep up with population growth, and about 650,000 of those will need to be affordable for low-income households.

Rabah said permitting has been digitized in pieces but not truly modernized end to end. AI can reason over hundreds of pages of plans and regulations and surface what matters.

“That's how cities move more homes and critical infrastructure from ‘submitted' to ‘approved' without burning people out on either side of the counter,” Rabah said. “Every month of delay we eliminate reduces costs of a new housing unit by about $5,000 on average and makes more projects economically pencil out.”

In July, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell issued an executive order intended to speed the permitting process for housing and small businesses in the city, using AI software from Boston- and Chicago-based CivCheck to aid permit applicants and city reviewers. Other cities, including Los Angeles, Austin and Honolulu are using AI to improve their processes.

In Bellevue, Govstream.ai is targeting and seeing signs of results including:

Beyond Bellevue, the startup is gearing up to deploy in additional U.S. cities. Rabah declined to share financial metrics, but said revenue is growing as Govstream.ai converts design partners into production deployments.

A veteran of government-tech companies including Socrata and Tyler Technologies, Rabah started Govstream.ai in July 2024. The company currently employs five people and the new funding will fuel growth to 10 to 12 people over the next 12 months with the addition of engineering and AI roles in the Seattle area.

Seattle-based startup Otto announced the wide release Thursday of its AI-powered travel assistant — Otto the Agent — in a bid to bring a concierge-level experience and personalization to business travelers.

The platform has been in closed beta for nine months. GeekWire first reported about its stealthy operations in August 2024.

Founded by longtime travel industry veterans, Otto was incubated and spun out of Seattle-based Madrona Venture Labs, the former startup studio associated with Madrona.

“The goal here is to mimic or create as good or better an experience than the best ever executive assistant, to help you book your business travel,” said founder and CEO Michael Gulmann, who spent nearly a decade at Expedia Group in various leadership roles, and also worked at business travel management giant Egencia.

Steve Singh, managing director at Madrona who co-founded business expense software giant Concur, is executive chairman of Otto.

Otto is built to learn and understand an individual's travel habits — airline and hotel preferences, seat choices, loyalty programs, and even nuanced needs like finding rooms that avoid train noise or finding hotels with rooftop bars. Gulmann said Otto uses that knowledge to instantly surface the best flights and hotels without the the typical endless-scroll experience. 

And unlike general-purpose AI tools that send users to external booking sites, Otto handles the entire transaction end-to-end, from booking to cancellations to rebooking and credit management, all within the same interface. 

Otto can also connect to a traveler's calendar and proactively detect upcoming trips and suggest itineraries before the traveler asks.

Barney Harford, former CEO of Orbitz Worldwide and former COO of Uber, called Otto “a glimpse into the future,” saying that after using it for several months it knows his business travel preferences “and has simplified the shop and book process down to just a couple of minutes.” Harford is an investor in Otto.

Beyond flights and hotels, a clear next step in Otto's development will be the addition of car rentals and dinner reservations — things an executive assistant “back home would be helping with when you're on the road,” Gulmann said.

“The reality is, most people don't have an EA,” he added. “A little bit of the genesis of the company was, I was fortunate enough to have an EA at Expedia for a long time, once I got to a certain level, and it was amazing.”

Otto is available for free to individual business travelers as well as small and mid-sized businesses for the next 12 months. The startup makes money on commissions. Through a partnership with travel management company Direct Travel, Otto is also launching upcoming pilot programs with two companies Gulmann could not yet name.

The company is competing with other startups, as well as incumbents that are developing their own AI-fueled tools.

Direct Travel, which was acquired by Madrona and others in April 2024, invested in Otto's seed round. 

Singh is also executive chairman at Direct Travel. Since departing Concur a few years after its $8.3 billion acquisition to SAP in 2014, Singh became executive chairman at Spotnana, a travel-as-a-service technology platform; at Center, a corporate card and expense management platform; and Troop, a group meetings and events company.

Gulmann said innovating around travel again was the “last thing he thought he'd get back into” but a lot has changed since Expedia and others came along to displace human travel agents in the 1990s. Otto is like going back to the personalization aspect of travel agents but with the tech twist added in. 

“It's insanely faster to develop and to build the product,” he said. “We're doing it with, including myself, a 10-person team. So, not tiny, but nowhere near the developer and engineer horsepower that Expedia or Booking.com have. But yet, I think we're going a lot faster than they are now.”

Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation are raising the alarm over the deadly impacts of international funding cuts in global health. Slashed budgets are projected to reverse decades of progress, causing the number of children dying before their fifth birthday to rise for the first time this century. An estimated 4.8 million children are expected to die this year, an increase of 200,000 deaths compared to last year.

“That is something that we hope never to report on, but it is a sad fact. And there are many causes, but clearly one of the key causes has been significant cuts in international development assistance from a number of high-income countries,” said Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, in a briefing with media this week. 

Suzman specifically called out the U.S., the United Kingdom, France and Germany for “making significant cuts” to their support. Internationally, funding plunged 26.9% below last year's levels, according to the philanthropy. 

The Gates Foundation today released its annual Goalkeepers Report, which tracks progress on measures including poverty, hunger, access to clean water and energy, environmental benchmarks and other metrics. 

The Seattle-based foundation worked with the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation to model the effects of reduced assistance. The researchers found that if the cuts to aid persist or worsen, an additional 12 million to 16 million children could die over the next 20 years. 

While offering dire projections, the document aims to be a call to action for governments and philanthropists large and small. 

“This report is a roadmap to progress,” Gates writes, “where smart spending meets innovation at scale.”

The billionaire Microsoft co-founder calls out some specific areas that could yield the most benefit, including primary healthcare, routine immunizations, the development of improved vaccines and new uses of data.

Modeling in the report predicts that by 2045, better vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia could save 3.4 million children, while new malaria tools could save an additional 5.7 million kids. Shots of lenacapavir could successfully prevent and treat HIV. 

The foundation calls attention to the life-saving benefits of vaccinations as the U.S. Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues to undercut public support of vaccines.

With the backdrop of reduced federal funding for global humanitarian causes and backpedaling on vaccinations, Gates earlier this year announced plans to give away $200 billion — including nearly all of his wealth — over the next two decades through the Gates Foundation.

The Seattle-based organization, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, will sunset its operations on Dec. 31, 2045. The philanthropy is the world's largest and has already disbursed $100 billion since its founding.

“If we do more with less now — and get back to a world where there's more resources to devote to children's health — then in 20 years, we'll be able to tell a different kind of story,” Gates writes in the report. “The story of how we helped more kids survive childbirth, and childhood.”

Washington state regulators ordered Seattle-based cryptocurrency company Coinme to stop transmitting money for customers in the state, alleging the startup improperly claimed more than $8 million in customer funds as its own income.

The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) announced Monday that it issued a temporary cease-and-desist order and statement of charges against Coinme, which lets people buy crypto with cash at kiosks nationwide and says it runs the largest crypto cash network in the world. 

DFI said Coinme improperly treated more than $8 million owed to customers on unredeemed crypto “vouchers” as company income. The agency said Coinme did not adequately disclose how and when it would recognize those unredeemed amounts as revenue and failed to turn unclaimed funds over to the state as required under Washington's unclaimed property laws.

DFI said those issues amount to unfair and deceptive practices and “unsafe and unsound” conduct that could lead to insolvency or loss of customer funds.

DFI also alleged that Coinme failed to maintain required financial reserves, filed inaccurate reports, and listed an inactive customer support phone number on vouchers for several months last year. The company had a negative tangible net worth at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024, according to the charges.

The agency is seeking to revoke the company's money transmitter license, impose a $300,000 fine, and ban CEO and co-founder Neil Bergquist from Washington's money transmitter and currency-exchange industry for 10 years.

“Washington's money transmission laws exist to protect consumers that rely on licensed companies to safely transmit funds,” DFI Director Charlie Clark said in a statement. “When our investigations reveal serious violations, we will take appropriate action.”

Coinme pushed back on the allegations, calling it an accounting dispute over a discontinued product. In a statement, the company said it eliminated the voucher system in August 2023 and now credits purchases instantly to customer accounts.

“Following professional guidance, we treated unredeemed voucher payments the same way major retailers treat unredeemed gift cards — a widely accepted accounting practice,” Ben Enea, Coinme's chief compliance officer, said in a statement.

The company said all vouchers can still be redeemed at any time with no expiration date, and customers can request refunds in U.S. dollars if they prefer. Coinme noted that the unredeemed vouchers represent less than 1% of the more than $1 billion in transactions the company has processed since its 2014 founding.

Coinme also expressed frustration with the regulatory process, claiming it wasn't contacted during the investigation and only learned of the concerns when the order was announced.

Under the temporary order, existing Washington customers can still withdraw their assets but no new business is permitted.

The company, which raised $10 million in 2021, was licensed by Washington state in April 2014 and soon after launched its first “Bitcoin ATM.” It now operates cryptocurrency kiosks through partnerships with MoneyGram and Coinstar. 

Coinme said it has requested an administrative hearing to contest the order.

— Jordan Arnold is the new director of the Washington State Broadband Office within the Department of Commerce, effective Jan. 2.

Under the Biden administration, Arnold served as a senior policy advisor on the Infrastructure Implementation Team within the Office of the Chief of Staff. Her work focused on helping lead the $65 billion broadband portfolio, which included implementation of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program and other initiatives. 

“Jordan has a deep understanding of what it takes to help communities succeed in a digital world,” said Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn in statement. “Her background working at the highest policy levels in the Biden White House will help power Washington forward in our efforts to connect everyone to the internet.”

— Rebecca Lovell has taken the role of interim president of Greater Seattle Partners (GSP), a regional public-private economic development organization. She has served as chief operating officer of the group for nearly three years.

Lovell's past roles include CEO of Denali Founder Consulting, executive director of Madrona Venture Group's Create33, and Seattle's interim director of Economic Development.

“Rebecca has been a key leader in our organization's success, and we are delighted to see her at the helm of GSP. She energizes the community, the GSP team and our investors,” said Shane Jones, chair of GSP's board of directors and a senior vice president at Alaska Airlines, in a statement.

Lovell is succeeding Brian Surratt, who took the presidency in 2022 and was recently appointed deputy mayor of the City of Seattle by Mayor-Elect Katie Wilson.

“We deeply appreciate Brian's service, commitment and transformational leadership and are excited to see him in this strategic role with the City of Seattle,” Jones said.

Prior to Greater Seattle Partners, Surratt led a community development group, was VP at Alexandria Real Estate and spent 13 years with Seattle's Economic Development agency, including as director.

— Jason Barnwell, a former Microsoft legal executive, is now chief legal officer for Agiloft, a California company providing software that helps businesses manage their contracts and legal agreements.

“Jason knows how to unlock the potential of legal teams, harness AI and data, and make contracting a true driver of business value,” said Agiloft CEO Eric Laughlin in a statement.  

Barnwell was with the tech giant for more 15 years in a variety of legal roles. He left the position of general manager and associate general counsel for Monetization and Business Planning. Barnwell will remain in the Seattle area. On LinkedIn, he thanked his Microsoft colleagues for their support and leadership opportunities, noting that he remains “a cheerleader for Microsoft and its people.”

— Elena Winters has joined Brazil's Elea Data Centers as vice president of international business. Seattle-based Winters was previously at Meta for more than eight years in infrastructure organization roles focused on data center and site selection. She will remain in Washington, leading Elea's U.S. and international expansion strategy.

“Now, I'm stepping into a new challenge — gaining experience on the other side of the business, partnering closely with hyperscalers (not working for them!) to help accelerate the growth of AI infrastructure in LATAM,” Winters said on LinkedIn. 

— Seattle startup Aarden AI named Michael Gleason as its staff data scientist. The company recently came out of stealth and offers an AI platform that helps landowners research and navigate deals with developers eager to build data centers, clean energy installations, housing and other uses. Gleason most recently worked as a geospatial data scientist at a national laboratory.

Amazon is considering ending its long-standing contract with the United States Postal Service and building out its own competing nationwide delivery network, according to The Washington Post.

The current agreement between the e-commerce giant and the USPS expires in October 2026. The two sides have spent months negotiating what the next version of the contract would look like, but those negotiations have been complicated by President Trump's push to privatize the USPS, the Post reports.

Under the current agreement, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency's revenue in 2025.

Amazon already operates a large transportation network that includes airplanes, Rivian electric vans, and a budding drone delivery service — though the drone program has faced a number of struggles this year, including most recently, a Federal Aviation Administration probe. It's also developing autonomous vehicles through its subsidiary Zoox.

Meta may be planning to make serious cuts to its Metaverse division, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.

Company executives are mulling slashing the virtual reality platform's budget by up to 30%, the report said, adding that any reductions would also include layoffs. 

If Meta does go ahead with such a plan, the move would reflect the overall lack of interest in products like Meta's social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware — both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.

Since Meta's rebrand in 2021, investors have been skeptical of the company's allocation of resources to Metaverse projects, which lose billions of dollars each quarter. The company's efforts in AI and smart glasses have been more successful, though investors still worry that its investment plans are too steep.

Meta's shares rose, however, following this report.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meta is launching a new centralized support hub for Facebook and Instagram users, the company announced on Thursday, adding that its prior support options haven't “always met expectations.” Within the hub, users will find tools to report an account issue, recover an account they've lost access to, and get answers via AI-powered search and an AI assistant.

The feature is rolling out now to global users on Facebook and Instagram on both the iOS and Android apps. 

The new AI assistant being tested is designed to offer more personalized help with things like account recovery, managing your profile, or updating your settings. This particular feature will first be available to Facebook users, but the company expects to roll it out to other apps in the future.

The company claims that its use of AI systems is helping protect users' accounts, noting that account hacks have decreased by over 30% globally across Facebook and Instagram. AI is also used to help identify and stop other threats, like phishing, suspicious logins, compromised accounts, and more.  

Additionally, Meta says that AI has helped it avoid disabling accounts by mistake more than ever before and has sped up the appeals process when mistakes occurred. 

However, that claim doesn't match up with the lived experience of thousands of users of Meta's apps, who complain that they've lost access to their accounts or Facebook Pages due to mistakes made by Meta's systems. Some even suspect that AI is to blame, as the mistakes and support requests don't seem to involve any human oversight. A portion of these users are threatening or engaged in legal action, particularly when losing their accounts has real-world impacts on their businesses or livelihoods. 

The situation has now gotten so bad that an entire Reddit forum was set up this year to help people who are suing Meta over their disabled accounts.

Meta believes the new hub could address these kinds of problems, saying that it will centralize account recovery options and offer a more streamlined account recovery experience with clearer guidelines and simpler verification. Plus, the system sends out improved SMS and email alerts about risky activity and will recognize users' devices better than before, Meta promises. And it will connect users with other tools to secure their account, like running a security checkup, setting up two-factor authentication, or adding a passkey.

Account recovery methods now also offer the option to take an optional selfie video to verify your identity.

While Meta claims the new hub will make things easier on its users, simply the act of moving around where settings and help are found can lead to confusion. Over the years, Meta has regularly relocated key areas like its account settings, data management tools, and privacy features, ostensibly to make things easier for users. But the constant changes also mean that users can't remember where to find things in the app, as they're often not where they were found before, and various menus and navigation have changed.

Apple on Thursday shared its annual list of App Store Award winners, continuing its tradition of celebrating the best apps and games of the past year. 

For 2025, the winning iPhone app was visual planner Tiimo, and the iPhone game of the year was the card game Pokémon TCG Pocket.

Although Apple has continued to avoid naming a dedicated AI app or AI chatbot as its app of the year, AI was showcased among this year's winners.

Apple's app of the year, Tiimo, for instance, is described as a visual AI planner that turns to-dos into plans with visual timelines. The app uses AI to break down your tasks into a realistic schedule by estimating how long each step of a task could take and helping you to create a plan.

Meanwhile, the iPad app of the year, Detail, simplifies video editing with an “Auto Edit” AI feature that handles things like silence removal, zoom cuts, and adding titles and captions.

A Cultural Impact winner, StoryGraph, uses a machine learning AI to make book recommendations based on your reading data, while another, Be My Eyes, offers an AI assistant that provides visual descriptions of real-world images for blind and low-vision users.

And the Apple Watch app of the year, Strava, includes an AI assistant that turns workout data into insights.

The company also announced winners for the iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and a standout within its own game subscription service, Apple Arcade.

Plus, Apple gave a handful of apps a “Cultural Impact” award. These apps, the company said, offered helpful tools, promoted understanding, or shaped a more inclusive world.

Apple first named 45 apps and games as finalists for its awards in November, and the list has now been narrowed down to 17 apps and games. The winners include:

Meta's decision to serve only its AI chatbot, Meta AI, to WhatsApp users isn't sitting well with the competition regulators in Europe. The European Commission on Thursday said it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta's move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp's business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app.

WhatsApp in October changed its business API policy to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn't designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.

Notably, this move doesn't affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won't be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API.

In its statement, the EU's executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA').”

“As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta's own AI service ‘Meta AI' would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote.

“AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. 

“This is why we are investigating if Meta's new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said.

If Meta is found guilty of breaching EU's antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company.

WhatsApp, for its part, called the EU's claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies' chatbots. 

“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.”

AI research lab Anthropic's not slowing down in its efforts to snap up enterprise clients. The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic's large language models to Snowflake's platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base.

“Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake's co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” 

This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers.  

Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company's enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents.  

“Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It's a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” 

Anthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.

Anthropic in October signed a deal with Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant's employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a partnership with IBM to bring some of its LLMs into the latter's software products.  

Anthropic's enterprise success isn't surprising as the company's models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises. A Menlo Ventures survey in July found that enterprises preferred Anthropic's AI products over models by other AI companies.

Topical minoxidil / finasteride has roughly zero side effects, and has something like a 90% efficacy rate. With 90%+ efficacy it's not a case of ""this might work for you"" it's ""this will almost certainly work for you."" It's cheap and it works.Even oral 1mg finasteride has basically the same side effect profile after 1 year as placebo, side effects always* stop whether you stop taking it or continue taking it. And as an added bonus it significantly reduces your risk of low-grade prostate cancer (30% ish) while not increasing your risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Many of the side effects reported are in people taking 5mg doses for prostate hypertrophy, and the incidence of side-effects is dose dependent.* the category of persistent side-effects has been defined primarily for data collection purposes, there's very little evidence for persistent side effects at all let alone a high incidence thereof. Many of the side effects people claim are related are things that would otherwise happen to you at the age you start to lose your hair regardless. It's good to collect more data though.> As someone with thinning hair, it's horrible how little study/research is being performed to understand how hair grows and treat hair loss.Given the size of the market I'd say there's a ton of research being done. It's just a tough nut to crack. There's some good data on PP405, for example.

The only reason men care so much is because long hair was often associated with nobility and power. Ancient gods or classical royalty were usually depicted with long luscious hair. Society has conditioned men to feel like less of a man if they lose their hair.But that's BS, bald is also a good look for men. Just embrace it. Isn't it crazy that even if we came up with a “cure” for baldness, some men would still choose to be bald anyway?

I thought it was nonsense. Shows what I know. I suppose folk wisdom is vindicated again.

Though, I would also somewhat expect pulling at it increases blood flow, which I would think to have some impact on growth?

As we've grown up, this writing was a source of inspiration that helped us discover ideas and opportunities we didn't even know we were looking for (ex. applying to YC because of PG's essays).But despite so many new creators and websites coming online, the best of the open Internet remains hard-to-find, scattered across personal sites (https://www.paulgraham.com/, https://www.eugenewei.com/), niche publications (https://www.noemamag.com/, https://worksinprogress.co/), and various independent publishing platforms (https://bearblog.dev/, https://substack.com/, https://medium.com/). Outside of ""social"" media platforms, there's very high friction to get into a new subject or stumble upon credible people who write about your interests.We feel there should be an easier (and mobile-friendly) way to find fantastic media and curate this intentional, interesting information diet for yourself.Browser Buddy is an iOS app that curates this interesting, thought-provoking writing for you from across the Internet.

Zanskar used AI tools to identify a site that could host a commercial power plant.

Sometimes geothermal hot spots are obvious, marked by geysers and hot springs on the planet's surface. But in other places, they're obscured thousands of feet underground. Now AI could help uncover these hidden pockets of potential power.

A startup company called Zanskar announced today that it's used AI and other advanced computational methods to uncover a blind geothermal system—meaning there aren't signs of it on the surface—in the western Nevada desert. The company says it's the first blind system that's been identified and confirmed to be a commercial prospect in over 30 years. 

Historically, finding new sites for geothermal power was a matter of brute force. Companies spent a lot of time and money drilling deep wells, looking for places where it made sense to build a plant.

Zanskar's approach is more precise. With advancements in AI, the company aims to “solve this problem that had been unsolvable for decades, and go and finally find those resources and prove that they're way bigger than previously thought,” says Carl Hoiland, the company's cofounder and CEO.  

To support a successful geothermal power plant, a site needs high temperatures at an accessible depth and space for fluid to move through the rock and deliver heat. In the case of the new site, which the company calls Big Blind, the prize is a reservoir that reaches 250 °F at about 2,700 feet below the surface.

As electricity demand rises around the world, geothermal systems like this one could provide a source of constant power without emitting the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. 

The company has used its technology to identify many potential hot spots. “We have dozens of sites that look just like this,” says Joel Edwards, Zanskar's cofounder and CTO. But for Big Blind, the team has done the fieldwork to confirm its model's predictions.

The first step to identifying a new site is to use regional AI models to search large areas. The team trains models on known hot spots and on simulations it creates. Then it feeds in geological, satellite, and other types of data, including information about fault lines. The models can then predict where potential hot spots might be.

One strength of using AI for this task is that it can handle the immense complexity of the information at hand. “If there's something learnable in the earth, even if it's a very complex phenomenon that's hard for us humans to understand, neural nets are capable of learning that, if given enough data,” Hoiland says. 

Once models identify a potential hot spot, a field crew heads to the site, which might be roughly 100 square miles or so, and collects additional information through techniques that include drilling shallow holes to look for elevated underground temperatures.

In the case of Big Blind, this prospecting information gave the company enough confidence to purchase a federal lease, allowing it to develop a geothermal plant. With that lease secured, the team returned with large drill rigs and drilled thousands of feet down in July and August. The workers found the hot, permeable rock they expected.

Next they must secure permits to build and connect to the grid and line up the investments needed to build the plant. The team will also continue testing at the site, including long-term testing to track heat and water flow.

“There's a tremendous need for methodology that can look for large-scale features,” says John McLennan, technical lead for resource management at Utah FORGE, a national lab field site for geothermal energy funded by the US Department of Energy. The new discovery is “promising,” McLennan adds.

Big Blind is Zanskar's first confirmed discovery that wasn't previously explored or developed, but the company has used its tools for other geothermal exploration projects. Earlier this year, it announced a discovery at a site that had previously been explored by the industry but not developed. The company also purchased and revived a geothermal power plant in New Mexico.

And this could be just the beginning for Zanskar. As Edwards puts it, “This is the start of a wave of new, naturally occurring geothermal systems that will have enough heat in place to support power plants.” 

A measure I call the Green Premium reveals where we can invest in climate progress for maximum impact. 

Lilac Solutions is pioneering a new type of lithium extraction that could double US production in two years and shake up the industry. 

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage can scale faster than other approaches. But some experts are dubious about the climate benefits.

Journalist Olivia Nuzzi's new book, American Canto, was released Tuesday and has been widely panned, even by Nuzzi's fans in the mainstream press. But if you're tempted to buy the book just to search for the juiciest gossip about national figures, we've got some bad news. That's going to be tough to accomplish in an efficient manner.

Nuzzi doesn't use the actual names of the most controversial figures in the book, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A search for “Kennedy” will get you just one hit: A reference to President John F. Kennedy. But Nuzzi's choice does create some hilarious moments of attempted obfuscation.

For example, Nuzzi repeatedly refers to a “South African tech billionaire.” There is indeed more than one of those in the proximity of American politics (Peter Thiel was born in Germany but raised in South Africa and Namibia before moving to the U.S., David Sacks was born in Cape Town), but it quickly becomes clear who Nuzzi is referring to.

See if you can guess which South African tech billionaire Nuzzi is talking about when she uses the phrase South African tech billionaire three times in a single paragraph:

The South African tech billionaire spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support the president, and on the day he was sworn back into office, the South African tech billionaire appeared at a rally in Washington to celebrate. He thanked the crowd for having made the same choice he had made, to stand behind the president at what he called “a fork in the road of human civilization.” He was all head, the South African tech billionaire, a roaming consciousness. The autonomous vehicle of his body looked soft and rubbery under his dark clothes. His physicality was rubbery, too. He moved with certain imprecision and on what appeared a delay. But now his motion seemed synced to the beat of his intentions: his fist pressed first to his chest, then his arm shot upward at a rigid angle. A salute, unmistakable, in the manner of the Third Reich. He had not meant it as such a salute, he said later. His assertion was echoed by many actors in our age of insincerity.

Gosh golly, who could this be about? It couldn't be Elon Musk, could it? If Nuzzi's description wasn't specific enough for you, maybe the next few lines will help:

His mother posted on the digital town square that he owns to praise the prototype of a fully self-driving electric vehicle called the Cybercab, her son's innovation. “The most insane thing is, you sit in a seat and there is no steering wheel nor foot pedals. It takes a while to enjoy just sitting as if you're in your lounge, while driving to your destination,” she said.

Cybercab? The name rings a bell. Not as something that anyone can actually buy, but still, it's a word we've heard before.

There are a few people who are named explicitly in the book. Donald J. Trump appears dozens of times, even if “South African tech billionaire” is put in brackets right beside Trump's name in a quote for some reason. It's unclear why Nuzzi bothers. If it's a stylistic choice, it feels like an obnoxious one to use with such repetition. Whatever the reason, it doesn't make the book any more enjoyable.

Even companies get weird nicknames, like when Nuzzi calls Amazon the “digital everything company.” Other characters get names like the MAGA General and The Politician. That last one is the one we all know about, of course. It's the reason you may have heard Nuzzi's name in the first place, since she became a big part of this country's political narrative after the 2024 presidential election.

The Politician is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the man Nuzzi reportedly had an emotional affair with, though she has denied that the relationship was ever physically consummated. After the existence of that relationship was made public, she was let go from New York magazine and spent the next year writing American Canto. She was also recently hired to be the West Coast editor of Vanity Fair.

Another reference to the South African tech billionaire was arguably more scandalous than the others, but it's still easy to figure out who she's talking about. Nuzzi writes that Kennedy (sorry, The Politician) had a vice presidential nominee who had “gone rogue.”

From the book:

He said he had been warned about her by the South African tech billionaire with whom she had reportedly had a drug-fueled sexual encounter while she was married to a different tech billionaire, but by the time he received the call that informed him she was “crazy,” it was too late.

That vice presidential candidate was Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Elon Musk denied having an affair with Shanahan while she was still married to Brin in tweets from 2022, though the part about it being a “drug-fueled” encounter wasn't mentioned in the press at the time.

The biggest problem with American Canto is that Nuzzi seems to be an unreliable narrator. At one point, she claims that she doesn't care about breaking news and considers it a burden. If that's the case, she chose not only an odd profession but a peculiar way of pursuing that profession. Nuzzi's skill has always been gaining proximity to people who are making news. People aren't reading her work to hear her describe Trump's hair in myriad ways, as she does in the book. They're reading because she has a knack for getting close to people who have real power. And it turns out that this proximity comes with a pretty heavy price tag.

If Nuzzi's former fiancé Ryan Lizza is to be believed, Kennedy wasn't the only politician she had an inappropriately personal relationship with. Lizza has been delivering a drip-drip of stories on his personal blog over recent weeks and alleges Nuzzi also became close with former congressman Mark Sanford, a Republican who briefly ran for president in 2020.

But Lizza is just as unreliable as Nuzzi. He was fired from the New Yorker in 2017 over sexual misconduct allegations, according to the New York Times. And Lizza is clearly trying to milk his association with Nuzzi for all it's worth. He ended “Part 3” of his serialized narrative by teasing the idea that he had special knowledge of something that had happened during the assassination attempt on President Trump in the summer of 2024. It was a cliffhanger that made sure folks would tune in for his paywalled article in Part 4. Readers would learn in Part 4 that whatever scandalous thing had been said about the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, was lost to history because some audio tape had been destroyed. That cheap stunt alone should make anyone skeptical of the claims Lizza is now pumping out.

So go ahead and grab a copy of American Canto if you're really that interested. But if you're only looking for quickly searchable gossip, just know it's going to be virtually impossible. You're going to have to read the whole thing.

If you're looking to avoid getting sick, chances are you'll steer clear from visiting a hospital or traveling by plane—environments packed with people and their germs. A new study, however, demonstrates that hospital and airplane air are cleaner than we typically imagine.

Researchers analyzed an aircraft air filter, along with face masks worn by travelers and healthcare workers, to investigate the air in airplanes and hospitals. A study published today in the journal Microbiome reveals that the air in both environments primarily hosts harmless microbes usually related to human skin.

“We realized that we could use face masks as a cheap, easy air-sampling device for personal exposures and general exposures,” Erica Hartmann, lead author of the study and an environmental microbiologist at Northwestern University, said in an emailed university statement. “We extracted DNA from those masks and examined the types of bacteria found there. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the bacteria were the types that we would typically associate with indoor air. Indoor air looks like indoor air, which also looks like human skin.”

Overall, Hartmann and her colleagues identified 407 microbial species, such as ordinary skin bacteria and environmental microbes. They also found very few possibly disease-causing microbes without evidence of active infection. Unsurprisingly, the idea for the study dates back to January 2022, at the heart of the covid pandemic. Hartmann received a grant to search for pathogens in airplanes' cabin filters but realized that investigating high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters might be complicated.

“At the time, there was a serious concern about Covid transmission on planes,” explained Hartmann, an expert on indoor microbiomes. Because HEPA filters are very efficient, “we thought it would be a great way to capture everything in the air. But these filters are not like the filters in our cars or homes.” They are very expensive, and “in order to remove them, workers have to pull the airplane out of service for maintenance. This obviously costs an incredible amount of money, and that was eye opening.”

That was when the team thought of a much cheaper and simpler tool that also captures microbes passively: face masks. As such, the team collected face masks from volunteers who wore them on domestic and international flights. The volunteers also sent face masks that accompanied them on flights but were never worn, for comparison. To investigate the difference between indoor environments, the researchers chose another busy, closed space with heavily filtered air: hospitals. And so they gathered face masks from hospital workers after they'd worn them during a work shift.

The researchers analyzed DNA from the exterior of each mask, finding that the air in both environments contains a diverse but mostly harmless blend of microbes, with little evidence of any that might be pathogenic. The samples from both spaces mostly consisted of common bacteria associated with humans, especially ones in indoor air and from our skin. What's more, the microbes from both environments were very similar, though the amount of each microbe differed slightly. Ultimately, the similarities indicate that microbes in both airplane and hospital air come from the people themselves—notably, their skin, not their sickness—and not the particular environment.

The researchers also found some antibiotic resistance genes associated with major categories of antibiotics. This doesn't mean there are dangerous microbes floating around, but it does point out the extent to which antibiotic resistance has spread.

Furthermore, “for this study, we solely looked at what's in the air,” Hartmann concluded. “Hand hygiene remains an effective way to prevent diseases transmission from surfaces. We were interested in what people are exposed to via air, even if they are washing their hands.”

The study should come as good news to everyone looking to fly during the upcoming holidays.

Here's something to remember next time you're grousing about the long line at your favorite sandwich shop: Some animals have to put up with a lot more to secure a tasty lunch. Case in point, a study out today shows the head-on strategy that certain frogs will take to wrap their tongues around a hornet-shaped meal.

Scientist Shinji Sugiura studied whether the black-spotted pond frog (Pelophylax nigromaculatus) would actively hunt various species of hornet wasps, including the so-called murder hornet. Not only did the frogs voraciously gulp down the insects, but they did so while easily surviving the hornets' venomous stings. The frogs' natural ability to endure venom lethal to plenty of mammals, humans included, could possibly teach us a thing or two, the researcher says.

“If pond frogs do possess physiological mechanisms that suppress pain or resist hornet venom, understanding them could one day help us develop new ways to reduce pain or inflammation in humans,” Sugiura, an ecologist at Kobe University in Japan, told Gizmodo in an email.

Sugiura wasn't initially planning to explore the venom-busting powers of pond frogs. But during an earlier study of how mason wasps defended themselves, he and his colleagues used frogs as one of the predators. They then noticed the frogs could handily prey on female wasps that possessed a venomous stinger (only female wasps have stingers that inject venom, but the team's research showed that male mason wasps can use their penises as a sort of non-venomous stinger).

That observation made Sugiura curious enough to dig deeper on his own. Adult hornets have been found inside the stomachs of various frogs, including P. nigromaculatus, indicating that frogs will sometimes eat them in the wild. But the question remained: Do frogs eat these hornets while desperately trying to avoid their stings, or in spite of them? To find out, Sugiura set up an experimental buffet.

He collected black-spotted pond frogs of various sizes and left them alone with female workers from three hornet species: Vespa simillima, V. analis, and V. mandarinia. That last species is called the northern giant hornet, aka the murder hornet. Though their nickname is mostly derived from how viciously the hornets hunt bees, their painful stings do occasionally kill humans. It's also the largest species of hornet and was briefly an invasive threat in North America several years ago.

Across the board, the frogs were plenty interested in munching down the hornets, and they weren't afraid to get stung for their trouble. They also usually managed to eat their prey; the lowest capture rate was seen with V. mandarinia, at 79%.

Venomous ‘Murder Hornets' Kill Two American Tourists on Vacation in Laos

“By using a large number of individual frogs, I quantitatively showed that many of them successfully captured and consumed hornets even while being stung,” Sugiura said. “Hornet stingers are powerful weapons that are generally thought to deter most predators, yet these results reveal that some animals can tolerate such venomous attacks and still prey on these insects.”

Sugiura's findings were published Thursday in the journal Ecosphere.

The frogs appeared to shake off the venomous stings with no apparent harm. That said, it's still unclear exactly how they're tanking them.

Hornet stings are known to be incredibly painful and sometimes lethal to mammals like us. But it's possible the complex mix of toxins naturally produced by these wasps doesn't affect an amphibian's biology all that much. Or perhaps frogs have evolved traits that make them less vulnerable to the venom or make them feel much less pain from a sting than a typical mammal would.

Whatever the case might be, understanding these frogs' antivenom defenses could certainly lead to important new discoveries. Next, Sugiura is planning to study whether pond frogs can easily withstand the venomous stingers of other arthropods (insects, arachnids, and other creepy-crawlies). And in the future, he'd like to experimentally test just how tolerant frogs are of a hornet's sting.

Sugiura also hopes his current work can demonstrate that even the ferocious murder hornet isn't exempt from being part of the food chain.

“I believe this finding offers a surprising insight for the general public, showing that even one of the most dangerous insects in the world is not entirely safe from predation,” he said.

My brother was visibly nervous at the thought of flying the buzzing, expensive, 360-degree drone hovering in front of him—especially once I told him my drone kit sent to me for review cost $2,000. (There are cheaper bundles, but I'll talk about pricing later.) His movements were slowed by winter cold as he took off his glove and gripped the Antigravity A1's single-hand controller. I gave him a short rundown of how to fly, what buttons to hit, and slipped the A1's bug-eyed headset over his eyes. I physically had to maneuver his fingers to the correct buttons. He couldn't see his own hands while his view was filled with a global, 360-degree image streaming from the drone.

Despite his initial fumbling, in mere minutes, he was flying at top speed, abandoning all pretenses and enjoying what is likely the most unique drone we've seen in years. “Oh,” he sighed with his eyes still concealed behind the goggles and the exterior screen showing the Manhattan skyline in his field of view. “This is way easier than I thought it would be.”

Antigravity A1

Designed by Insta360, the 360 camera drone is easy to fly even if you'll look goofy wearing the required headset. Professionals may get more or less use out of it depending on what they want.

Pros

Cons

What I'm talking about is a drone that's odd in every possible way. The Antigravity A1—designed by a company spun out from 360-degree camera maker Insta360—currently allows only one control option, a flight stick crossed with the sawed-off grip of a pistol. You don't have to use any buttons to control the A1 (there are a few physical toggles for turning and elevation), but flying requires pointing in a direction, pulling the trigger, and letting the drone follow your lead. You don't so much capture one image through the drone's sensor but everything surrounding the cameras thanks to its 360 lenses. And you don't so much see what the drone sees as much as you inhabit it through the goggles—like you're standing in the middle of a transparent globe hovering several hundred meters above the ground.

Drones never stopped being interesting. Recent examples like the DJI Neo 2 and Mini 5 Pro are smaller and more capable than previous versions. Despite that, 2025 is an awkward time for stateside drone operators, as the most popular drone maker, DJI, is on the edge of being yanked out of the U.S. market entirely come Dec. 23. If you've never taken to the air with a zippy, unmanned aircraft system, the skies are still a wonder to navigate. Not only is the A1 an incredibly accessible flyer that will inevitably upset traditional drone pilots, but it's also a whole new category for drones with its 360-degree cameras.

See Antigravity A1 at Best Buy

The A1 is not a cheap drone. It starts at $1,600 for the standard bundle, which includes the drone, headset, controller, and a single battery for flying. Opting for the $1,900 Explorer bundle will get you a case to hold all your various drone parts plus an extra three batteries and a charging hub. If you spend $2,000, you get access to the longer-lasting High Capacity Flight Battery. Antigravity also has a set of propeller guards and replacement drone lenses for sale. Either way, the A1 will demand an investment in time, money, and all your wayward charging cables.

Judging by the number of pieces that make the A1 drone work, it feels like the engineers were trying to fill out a consumer tech bingo card. I first got hands-on time with an early version of the drone back in August, and yet the company has made huge strides in controls, menus, and usability in the short time since then. Still, to use the A1 requires three peripherals: the Vision Goggles, the Grip Motion Controller, and the A1 itself.

To call this a first-gen product would be ignoring just how much batshit engineering has gone into this amalgamation of AR (augmented reality) headset and drone. The Vision Goggles is relatively light, but it comes with a snug fit. It has two knobs at the bottom to set the PPD, or pixels per degree, which each user will need to twist to fine-tune how clear the screen UI will appear. Inside, it uses two pancake lenses with 1-inch micro OLED displays, each at a 2,560 x 2,560 resolution. It's a combination of Meta Quest 3-like optics with updated visuals pushing it closer to an Apple Vision Pro or Samsung Galaxy XR.

Once inside the headset, when you move your head, you'll be able to look freely up, down, left, right, frontways, slantways, however you want. The drone stitches the images from the two lenses, and you won't ever see any drone parts in your view, save for rare scenes when taking off or touching down. Like the Apple Vision Pro, the A1's goggles use a separate battery that gets plugged into a port at the bottom. Instead of leaving a long leash in your pocket, the battery is meant to dangle like a necklace. There's no on or off button on the headset, either. You turn the Vision Goggles on and off again with the battery itself. If you lose the battery, you've lost access to the headset.

The visuals from inside the Vision Goggles are already of good quality, though the fact the drone is streaming video to the headset means you'll inevitably lose detail. We flew the drone well over 500 yards away on a clear day in Calvert Vaux Park in lower Brooklyn, and we didn't experience any lag or streaming disruptions. Antigravity says its low-latency OmniLink 360 transmission system is the secret to clear video, and in my own tests that proved mostly true. The live view is only ever viewed at a max of 2K resolution and 30 fps inside the headset. However, that doesn't mean you'll always have such clear visuals in areas with more interference. The A1 routinely warned there was some kind of magnetic disruption in the area, even though we stood in an empty field for more than two hours. It gave me the same warning at home and in Gizmodo's office, so I'm not quite sure what it was detecting.

If there's any one element that captures the ludicrous nature of the A1 experience, it's that the Vision Goggles have a special defogging function you can access from the main menu. This kicks in the internal fan system in case your eyes are getting extra sweaty in between the face cushion and surprisingly solid light seal. That round exterior screen will show any users looking at your face what you're currently seeing. Plus, when you flip up both the antennas, you'll look like the classic Japanese bug-faced superhero Kamen Rider. There are so many excessive things about this headset that don't actually need to be there. Still, if you were looking for a fun device, there are few things more entertaining than an evil eye that shows onlookers what your drone is currently spying on.

The entire concept behind a 360-degree camera is that users don't need to do anything but hit the record button for the sake of capturing all angles of your antics. The one complication is that users then need to manually pick out their best shots in the edit room. When you stick the same technology on a drone, it takes on a whole new life with its own share of considerations.

The A1 drone itself isn't that big or heavy. It weighs in at about 249 grams, or about 0.54 pounds with the regular battery, though it's closer to 291 grams, or 0.64 pounds, with the high-capacity battery. That's the scale of most drones and it's light enough you don't need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Its size reminds me first of the DJI Air 3S, which I spent some time with close to a year ago. The A1's four propeller arms fold up into a neat bundle that fits snugly into an included hardshell case. Sure, that may not sound that big, but consider you also need to have the controller and goggles with you to fly the A1, and you'll be weighed down a little more on any adventures.

Before you fly, you have to remember what your controller looks like. Once you have your headset on, you'll have nothing but memory to hit any of the necessary controls. The headset takes you through a set of hands-on tutorials for all the various button layouts, but even then I was often stuck taking off it off to see what I was doing. To reset and recenter the screen, you need to find the large scroll wheel—which also manipulates the horizontal orientation—and click it in. The controller's menu button is a tiny key on the controller's right side that's impossible to find inside the headset. Even if the controller had a better layout, it would still be constrained by the inherent drawback of this drone's design when there are no other control options, either with your phone or a traditional dual-stick controller.

You'll also need to register the A1 drone with Antigravity's services to get access to all of its flight features. Without registering, you'll be limited to flying 50 yards in the air and 30 yards away. However, after I installed everything, pushed through several firmware updates (which became a pain of desperately connecting and reconnecting the drone), registered my drone, and thumbed through all the lengthy tutorials, taking to the skies was a far easier exercise. The headset will show a crosshair of the direction where your controller is pointing. Holding down the trigger puts the drone into gear, and steering it merely requires pointing in a new direction.

This means you can be looking anywhere in the drone's field of view but be flying in a completely different direction. The headset's view will show with a picture-in-picture at the top of the screen showing a view of what's in front of the drone's sensors. This is why my brother took very little time to understand the drones controls. In the air, the only thing the pilot has to mind is the trigger. If you let off the gas, the A1 will simply hover in the air, spinning based on the direction of the controller. Flying it is a joy as well, which is only enhanced with its simplicity.

In addition to regular flying, there are preset flying patterns if you want to do a orbit shot or even set a predrawn flight path. While these features are more important on non-360 camera drones, the fact you have to use the headset and controller to select these options anyway makes them less useful than if there were other control options. However, the features do make it easier for non-flyers to experience the sights without having to figure out the A1's controls.

Like your typical DJI drone, you can set the A1 to Normal, Cinematic, and Sports flying. With the toggle in “S” mode, the drone can reach a top speed of 35.8 mph, or 16 m/s, though it slows to a crawl of 6.7 mph, or 3 m/s, in “C” mode. In my tests of the pre-production drone back in August, the A1 would slow down every time I attempted a sharp turn. In this new version, I didn't experience any of those same issues. Taking it through a small obstacle course made up of jersey barriers and threading the drone through a small copse of trees didn't require any fine manipulation. I pointed, and the drone did the rest.

At least the A1's object avoidance sensors did a good job at keeping me out of range of trees. The drone uses a binocular vision system supplemented with infrared sensors to avoid smacking into the ground. It will still struggle to detect thin branches, which may prove a hazard if you plan to shoot in the woods.

In the drone's menus, you can also enable an first-person view, or “FPV” mode, that is supposed to offer a more familiar experience to people who have flown other first-person drones. In this mode, you can also enable a “Virtual Cockpit” that will create a badly rendered 3D dragon underneath you. It's cute, but entirely unnecessary. The FPV mode is already more difficult to maneuver than the default setting.

There's really no comparison. The A1 isn't made to complete any fancy tricks like a barrel roll or somersault. Other FPV drones like the DJI Avata 2 rely on their gimbal-mounted sensor and zippy flying capabilities to help pilots line up the right shot, but the idea behind the 360-degree camera mounted on the A1 means it doesn't need any fancy flying to capture what it needs to.

The A1 tries to split the difference between a consumer-level “just for fun” drone and a more professional-minded quadcopter built for people who plan to do some proper filmmaking. It's easily one of the most fun drones you can buy today, one that you can effortlessly share with friends. For professionals, the choice gets more muddled.

Insta360's class-leading X5 360-degree camera is still one of the best around despite GoPro and DJI trying to knock it off its throne. If you thought that the Antigravity A1 would simply be an X5 strapped to a drone, it was never going to be that simple.

The A1 can shoot video at a maximum 8K resolution and 30 fps, with options down to 24 fps. While the number of people who use an 8K TV is infinitesimally small, you actually want to capture 360 footage at such a high resolution. The camera is essentially two sensors working in tandem, recording all the pixels in huge arc. Otherwise, you'll have options for capturing 5.2K footage at up to 60 fps. If you want to shoot at 100 fps or for any true slo-mo experience, you need to drop it down to 4K.

Both the headset and drone each have a slot for a microSD card, though the drone itself does have an extra 20GB of internal storage just in case. The A1 can accept cards as large as 1TB, which should be enough for all casual and most professional drone flyers.

The actual sensor on the drone is 1/1.28-inch in size with an f/2.2 aperture. That's a larger aperture than the f/2.0 on the X5, though it won't make too big a difference in terms of depth of field. The A1 has a slightly smaller max video bitrate (170Mbps versus 180) but the same ISO range. So it should be just as capable as the X5 360-degree camera, right? Well, in my testing, the one issue I came across was the video stitching. On a regular 360-degree camera, it has to close the gap between the two sensors to make the spherical video look seamless. The gulf between the two sensors on the A1 is much wider than on a stick camera. In my footage, I would see some strange artifacts and occasionally notice close-up objects distort when I finally had the chance to take a gander at the final footage.

The drones also include a small menu option to enable a feature for enhanced AI stitching, though that doesn't impact the final footage. You won't know if you've produced any visual artifacts until you watch the footage yourself, which thankfully can be done inside the Vision Goggles. That could still pose a problem for any amateur cinematographer. The entire point of this drone is to get the shot without needing to be at the right place at the right time. Any visual distortion could lead to messy post-production cleanup work. For an example, watch the family that came to visit me during one of my flights. Their faces start to flicker and distort to an annoying degree.

And if you plan to shoot in low light, the A1 may not be the best one for it. Even when outside with the sunset on the horizon, the 8K footage started to look grainy. Indoors, low-light shooting looked far worse.

Antigravity also offered me a look at its new Antigravity Studio editing software built specifically for 360-degree footage. It's essentially the same software as Insta360 Studio, which is to say it's simple enough to use even for a complete amateur. I edited several videos using simple keyframes to set the shots I wanted at the 9:16 aspect ratio. I also played around with some of the transitions, like one that creates a “tiny planet” effect by zooming out through the fisheye lens. I didn't do any post-processing work to make each video look better, but with a mix of 8K and 5.2K footage, you can see the difference in base quality. Any 8K footage will inevitably look better on a 360-degree camera.

Antigravity Studio crashed several times as I attempted to export footage. It may be a result of beta software on Windows, so I can't get too riled up about it. The app is also available on Mac. However, it does point to a common problem among 360-degree cameras. If you simply want to upload your cool drone shots to TikTok or Instagram, it will inevitably take more effort than a more traditional camera or drone. The Antigravity app supposedly allows users to share their footage right from the drone and complete some easy highlight reels akin to what you can do in the GoPro Quik app. However, I couldn't connect the A1 drone to my phone after many, many attempts.

The Antigravity A1 comes with a single battery in the basic bundle, though for review the company sent me the Infinity Bundle, which comes with three “high-capacity” flight batteries. The less expensive standard bundle only comes with three regular flight batteries. The regular battery clocks in at 2,360mAh, while the high-capacity version is almost double that at 4,345mAh. How much you spend on the drone will dictate how much flight time you get.

The regular batteries are rated for approximately 24 minutes of flight time, while the high-capacity versions will let you go for closer to 40 minutes. In reality, you'll get less flight time when you start recording, especially at 8K. I went out into my tests with four high-capacity batteries. Running the drone near-continuously and shooting at 5.2K, I blew through three whole batteries in a little less than two hours. When each battery reaches around 15%, the drone will initiate an automatic return-to-home landing.

Still, it was enough for a fun outing with friends, even if it required close to 30 minutes of charging with the included Charging Hub. The hub can charge three batteries at once, although strangely enough the middle battery requires exposing the charging pins on the rear side and cradling it in an exposed bracket. DJI's charging hub has three separate pockets for all three batteries at once. Antigravity likely wanted to make the hub fit inside the carrying case, which I'll add is a very handy inclusion since you'll need to carry the headset, controller, and drone with you everywhere.

I didn't have the opportunity to test the less-capable battery. Whether the promised 24 minutes of battery life (likely less when recording at 8K) is good enough for you depends on how you plan to use it. Hopefully, you'll get the necessary shots you want without having to do many reshoots. With the stitching problem, you may need to carry some extra batteries with you just in case.

The Antigravity A1 is desperate to split the difference between what's merely a fun drone and something any regular flyer will want to have on hand. For its $1,600 starting price, you get everything you need to fly the drone, though you'll end up spending more for extra batteries. I have a hard time recommending the standard bundle considering the lack of a carrying case and batteries, so most people who buy the A1 drone will end up spending more than the base price. Compare that to other FPV drones, and you have to justify the 360-degree camera for the extra cost. A DJI Avata 2 Fly More Combo that includes three batteries, a case, controller, and headset, retails anywhere between $1,500 to $1,800 on Amazon depending on how many accessories you want. (Of course, that's before all DJI drones are effectively banned in the U.S.)

This drone is not a simple commitment, despite how easy it is to use after you get used to its odd controls. Sure, it could be a toy you take out to impress your friends or family, but the A1 is better as a device you use to explore your environment. You can truly get a sense for the scale of a place through the ability to look everywhere around you. You can take that same footage home and spy on things you may have missed when you were staring off at the distant horizon.

And there's truly nothing else like it that I've personally experienced. Novelty may be enough for some, but others—including myself—are just looking for a usable drone. Even as a first attempt, the A1 manages to clear that bar, despite some occasional issues with the end footage. So if you're looking for the most unique drone you can get in the U.S. (especially considering DJI has effectively stopped launching drones stateside thanks to Uncle Sam's protectionist policies), you don't have to look further than this one.

I've written about a few Bluetooth speakers in my day, but this one—this one, dear readers—is more than meets the eye. It's my pleasure to introduce Robosen's newest addition to the Transformer robot lineup, Soundwave, which incorporates, well… actual soundwaves.

Like Robosen's previous Transformers (this sick Bumblebee one, for example), Soundwave fully auto-converts from ass-kicking robot to ordinary object and vice versa. Unlike the others, however, Soundwave adds an audio twist, doubling as two things you may actually want to use. The first fun and useful thing you can do is tap into Soundwave as a Bluetooth speaker. Robosen doesn't list any technical information about the actual speaker system but claims that it's “high quality,” so for now we'll have to trust that it doesn't sound like you're listening to tunes on speakerphone in 2004. Also, it's a f*cking robot transformer, so it'd be hard to get mad even if it did.

The other rad thing Soundwave does is that it doubles as an actual, functional cassette player, which is not only a nice nod to the prevailing audio format at the time Transformers was released (1984 for any trivia geeks out there), but also weirdly trendy given the resurgence of physical formats and nostalgia in modern audio hardware. Robosen says the front buttons are functional, too, meaning you can do fun tape stuff like record your voice in addition to fast forward, rewind, and play/pause by pushing real buttons.

Outside of all the neat audio stuff, Soundwave is (like Robosen's previous robots) also a dutiful and surprisingly complex homage to Transformers. In keeping with the whole sound thing, Robosen tapped one of the series' original actors, Frank Welker, who voiced lots of characters, including Soundwave. Robosen says Welker recorded more than 200 lines for the robot, including classic phrases like, “Destroy Autobots,” and “Soundwave superior, Autobots inferior.”

Robosen makes the impossible real again with the world's first fully auto-converting Soundwave.Standing at Megatron's side, the loyal communications lieutenant is officially back on duty! @transformers 

Officially on sale — starting today: https://t.co/SmUYrLYnGQ#robosen… pic.twitter.com/vFi2rJagBT

— Robosen Robotics (@robosenofficial) December 4, 2025



Another nice addition is the ability to recognize voice commands, which is great if you don't feel like getting up off the couch to turn your $1,000+ Transformer into a cassette player. Robosen says that altogether, Soundwave understands 48 voice commands, including “convert,” “hello,” and “attack,” which can all be activated by saying, “Hey, Soundwave.” No guarantee that these voice commands work any better than your Amazon or Google-powered smart speaker, but no worries if they don't; you can always use the included app to make Soundwave do your bidding instead.

Getting your own Transformer/Bluetooth speaker/tape deck won't come cheap. Robosen has rolled out preorders for Soundwave with an introductory price of $1,000. After Jan. 5, however, Soundwave will cost $1,400 going forward. If you do decide to pull the trigger on your own audio Decepticon, Robosen units will supposedly ship in April 2026.

If you're nervous about going to the dentist, you're not alone. In fact, dental anxiety has an official name, odontophobia, and it's a real problem, because it keeps people from maintaining their dental hygiene. One dentist is on a mission to ease people's odontophobia by addressing one of the triggers—the terrible sound of dental drills.

Tomomi Yamada, a dentist at the University of Osaka's graduate school of dentistry, and colleagues have investigated the aerodynamics of dental drills and how people of different ages perceive their high-pitched whining sound. The aim is to design a drill that lessens the noise while maintaining performance.

“Originally, I was doing research on dental materials, but I realized that almost no one—not even dentists—was tackling this sound problem scientifically,” Yamada said in a statement from the Acoustical Society of America. She presented their research yesterday during the Sixth Joint Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America and the Acoustical Society of Japan in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The team used a supercomputer to run large-scale aeroacoustics simulations. Aeroacoustics is the study of sound created by airflow and its influence. The simulations allowed the researchers to visualize and study the air movement through and around the drill to create noise—powered by compressed air and rotating at around 320,000 revolutions per minute.

“Our research showed that just making the drill quieter isn't enough to make the sound less unpleasant,” Yamada said. “What really matters is improving its sound quality.”

Yamada and her colleagues also investigated the psychological effect of the dental drill's sound with children and adults (imagine volunteering to listen to dental drills more than you already have to!). The drill's nightmarish sounds can reach almost 20 kilohertz, and they revealed that younger individuals felt the sound to be louder and more unpleasant than adults.

“This indicates that children's fear of dental sounds is not merely psychological but also physiological in nature,” Yamada explained. “Children truly hear these sounds differently, so their fear of dental treatment is a genuine sensory response, not just imagination.” In other words, your children are justified in pretending to be sick on the day of their dentist's visit.

Within this context, the team is trying to improve the blade geometry and exhaust port of the drill to lessen the noise while safeguarding performance. They'll have to strike the right balance between performance and safety to get the dental industry on board, because a drill that is simply quieter isn't necessarily an effective one.

“Moving forward, we hope to work with dental manufacturers through industry–academia partnerships, progressing toward commercialization after completing the necessary regulatory and durability testing,” Yamada said.

Here's to hopefully not having to wear earphones blasting rock music to the dentist anymore!

Update 12/4/25: Asus says that production and shipments for the ROG Matrix RTX 5090 are resuming and should reach partners ""soon."" The company confirmed a delay, citing ""product optimizations and enhancements."" 

Asus' ROG Matrix RTX 5090 card has been in the news quite often recently, almost universally due to its gigantic size, specs, and corresponding price tag at a clean $4,000. It's not a good day for Asus' halo graphics card, though, as a report has come in that the company is temporarily halting all sales of the Matrix 5090 due to a manufacturing quality issue.

The information comes from Swedish e-tailer Inet.se, who sent out an email to customers who preordered the card. The information provided by Asus offers no details on what the issue is, but it's worth keeping in mind that it might be serious enough to block the sale of a $4,000 card. Additionally, Asus is apparently outright replacing the cards, so it's unlikely that the problem is something cosmetic like mistakenly-stamped PCBs.

There's also no estimated date for delivery of the fixed cards, at least as far as Inet.se knows, though all of them remain sold out. It's not likely that buyers will have to wait a long time, considering how much of an egg-in-face moment this is for Asus. Nevertheless, standing by one's product is a good thing, and a buyer shelling out $4,000 for one of these will rightfully demand absolute perfection. The statement provided by Inet.se to its customers reads as follows:

""I am contacting you regarding your order for the ASUS GeForce RTX 5090 32GB ROG Matrix Platinum 30th Anniversary Edition. Unfortunately, we have been informed by ASUS that they have identified a quality issue with this particular model. Due to this, we are unable to deliver the card as planned. ASUS is currently working on a replacement version without these issues, but at this time there is no estimated date for when a new copy will be available. We fully understand that this is an unfortunate situation, but unfortunately it is completely beyond our control."" — Inet.se via Videocardz

It's hard to imagine what the actual problem might be. German overclocker der8auer remarked during his teardown that the liquid TIM application was sub-par for such an expensive card, as Asus didn't place an actual solid barrier holding the liquid metal in place, and instead opted for a ring made of thermal paste. Having said that, he tested the card without issues, and there have not been any reports of problems from other reviewers.

If the Matrix's design is based off the ROG Astral 5090 cards, however, then some distant hypothesis comes up. Back in February, a user had a blown capacitor on his Astral 5090 take out both the card and his motherboard. A little while later, another person reported fan vibration interfering with the anti-sag sensor on the card. And as recently as a few days ago, a third user claims to have pinned down a power delivery issue via the card's BTF connector, a feature that the Matrix 5090 also shares and is required to hit its full potential.

Regardless of what the problem might be, Asus is bound to follow up quickly, as to not let all the brand awareness garnered by this card go to waste.

Industry insiders have not heard or seen any indication of AMD wanting to raise Ryzen CPU pricing.

It appears that AMD's Ryzen 9000 (codenamed Granite Ridge) series, renowned for delivering some of the best CPU performance out there, currently remains unaffected by rumored price hikes. Two industry sources that wish to remain anonymous, one from one of the largest U.S. distributors, have informed Tom's Hardware that there have been no indications of impending price adjustments for Ryzen processors, and no evidence suggests such changes are imminent, contrary to recent rumors.

The computer hardware industry has been under significant scrutiny due to sustained demand for DRAM and NAND, driven by artificial intelligence, which has affected both availability and pricing of consumer hardware components. Memory prices have surged to unprecedented levels. Following recent price increases for Radeon graphics cards, AMD has been the subject of considerable attention amid rumors of an alleged price increase for Ryzen processors. According to our sources, the manufacturer has not implemented any Ryzen price hikes thus far.

Unlike SSDs, graphics cards, or memory, processors are less susceptible to price fluctuations caused by NAND shortages. AMD recently revised the prices of Radeon products; therefore, the chip manufacturer may be delaying adjustments on processor pricing to prevent further customer dissatisfaction, assuming there was any minimal credence to the rumor to start with.

It is increasingly difficult to find affordable memory in stock, whether for upgrades or building a new system. Therefore, it is reassuring to know that AMD's Ryzen processors, which are excellent for gaming and productivity, should remain available at reasonable prices, at least for now.

The current top three best-selling processors at retailers such as Newegg and Amazon are all Ryzen models. Specifically, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, recognized as the leading gaming processor, occupies the foremost position in both instances. The most recent Steam Hardware Survey indicates that the Red Team has attained a record-high market share of 42.61%, representing an increase of 0.52% from the previous month. It is merely a matter of time before AMD attains a 50% market share, provided that Intel persists in its current decline.

It is evident that AMD's Ryzen processors are progressively capturing a larger share of the gaming market, resulting in a challenging situation for Intel. The company's latest Core Ultra 200S (codenamed Arrow Lake) processors are unable to compete with AMD's Ryzen products effectively. Intel has recently elevated the pricing for previous generations of processors, likely attributable to the lackluster sales of Arrow Lake.

Ryzen currently maintains strong market momentum. AMD would be wise to uphold its existing pricing strategy for Ryzen processors, even if this results in a marginal decrease in profits, given the current uncertain landscape.

RTX 50 series users can now gain access to GPU-accelerated PhysX effects in supported titles.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia has taken a U-turn as it is bringing back support for 32-bit GPU-accelerated PhysX games on RTX 50 series GPUs, after it silently discontinued the tech earlier this year in February. In a recent press announcement for the latest GeForce Game Ready drivers, the company has confirmed that it is adding custom support for top-played PhysX-accelerated games, offering full performance on the latest RTX 50 series GPUs, in line with existing support on previous generation GPUs.

PhysX is one of Nvidia's oldest technologies, originating in 2004 when the company acquired Ageia. Designed as a physics simulation SDK, it handled ragdolls, cloth, particles, fluids, and other advanced physics effects. Its core promise was to simply offload physics work from the CPU to the GPU for better performance and more detailed effects. The supported games are:

After Nvidia adapted the tech to run on GeForce GPUs, PhysX found its way into popular AAA game titles, including the Batman Arkham trilogy, Borderlands 2, The Witcher 3, Metro: Last Light, Metro: Exodus, Metro 2033, Mirror's Edge, The Witcher 3, and several older Assassin's Creed releases.

By the late 2010s, PhysX adoption slowed significantly as more flexible, cross-platform physics solutions emerged. One of the biggest limitations was its reliance on CUDA, which tied it exclusively to Nvidia GPUs and restricted it from competing hardware, consoles, and mobile devices. Nvidia also gradually dropped support for certain features, leading some developers, such as Warframe's team in 2018, to move to custom frameworks built on or inspired by PhysX.

The latest Game Ready driver update also brings game optimizations for the upcoming Winter Offensive update on Battlefield 6 ahead of its December 9th release. Nvidia says that gamers can expect average frame rates to increase by 3.8 times, enabling up to 460 frames per second on desktops, and 310 frames per second on RTX 50 series laptops at 4K ultra settings with DLSS 4, Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution enabled. Additionally, the latest drivers bring improved fidelity of DLSS Ray Reconstruction on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

To download the latest drivers, visit the official Nvidia driver download page, select your product from the drop-down menus, choose your operating system, and click search. Alternatively, you can download and use the Nvidia app, which can automatically detect your hardware and install the latest driver for you.

Because Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and comms are cool and profitable.

Intel has decided to retain its networking and communications (NEX) unit rather than proceed with a sale after completing an internal evaluation of strategic options for the division. The move reverses earlier consideration of spinning out or selling the business, as the company believes it can extract more money selling actual products or platforms rather than as a business unit.

""After a thorough review of strategic options for NEX—including a potential standalone path—we determined the business is best positioned to succeed within Intel,"" an Intel spokesperson told Tom's Hardware in a statement. ""Keeping NEX in-house enables tighter integration between silicon, software and systems, strengthening customer offerings across AI, data center, and edge. We remain focused on delivering for customers and creating long-term value.""

Although NEX is certainly less known than Intel's CPUs for client or data center computers, as well as some other products that carry the five-letter badge, the unit is one of the crown jewels in Intel's portfolio.

Intel's NEX develops and builds processors for networking and edge, infrastructure processors (IPUs), Ethernet controllers, Wi-Fi controllers, switching gear, and programmable connectivity hardware used in a wide range of applications, starting from humble PCs and client systems all the way to telecom infrastructure and data centers. In addition to hardware, NEX has a significant software portfolio that runs on this equipment to handle traffic scheduling, security features, and remote administration.

When Intel sells a CPU for a PC, it can bundle it with an Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi controller, whereas a data center Xeon processor can be bundled with three Ethernet chips, an IPU, and accompanying software, maximizing Intel's content and earnings per system. Given Intel's woes in client and data center markets, NEX is barely growing, so selling it off could have potentially provided Intel with billions of much-needed cash.

However, after Intel secured a financing package that includes $8.9 billion from the U.S. government in exchange for an 8.9% take, plus $2 billion from SoftBank Group and $5 billion from Nvidia, Intel concluded that keeping the NEX unit delivers more value than a transaction at this stage.

Intel does not report NEX results separately: in Q1 2025, the company reorganized by integrating NEX into its Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center and AI (DCAI) segments, then updated its reporting structure accordingly. As a result, we do not know whether NEX remains a profitable unit. Yet, when Intel reported NEX results separately for the last time in Q4 2024, the unit generated $1.6 billion in sales and $300 million in operating income.

The gut microbiome refers to the ecosystem of microbes that live in the intestines and play an important role in overall health. For example, the gut microbiome supports digestive health and can also influence the immune system.

Previous research notes that an imbalance in the gut microbiome can impact the development of a variety of health issues, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and depression.

The food that people consume can have a profound effect on shaping their gut microbiome. Typically, an individual can make appropriate lifestyle and dietary changes to improve their gut health and support overall well-being. However, certain foods may offer more benefits than others.

Medical News Today looks at three recent studies we have covered to offer an overview on the role of the gut microbiome and how consuming certain food products may support health.

A majority of adults in the United States do not consume enough dietary fiber. This refers to the part of plant foods that humans cannot digest, which may help to lower the risk of developing various conditions.

However, not only can the gut microbiome digest dietary fiber, it can also produce beneficial metabolites.

Published in Nature Metabolism in January 2025, a study suggests that the beneficial byproducts of plant fiber digestion by gut bacteria could include two compounds that act on genes to help prevent the growth of cancers.

When the gut microbiome breaks down plant fiber it produces molecules known as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), notably proprionate and butyrate. Previous research suggests that these molecules may possess anticancer properties.

In the 2025 study, laboratory experiments on human colon cells (both healthy and cancerous) and in mice, propionate and butyrate were able to alter genes that regulate the differentiation and multiplication of cells, as well as genes controlling programmed cell death.

Şebnem Ünlüişler, genetic engineer and Chief Longevity Officer at the London Regenerative Institute, who was not involved in the study, explained to MNT:

“The research focuses on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like propionate and butyrate, which are produced when gut bacteria break down dietary fiber. These SCFAs can influence the activity of both cancer-promoting (proto-oncogenes) and cancer-suppressing (tumor-suppressor) genes by modifying histones, the proteins that help package DNA. By making the DNA more accessible, SCFAs can turn certain genes on or off, depending on the cell type and conditions.”

The research has shown that butyrate inhibits enzymes known as histone deacetylases (HDACs), which can result in changes that slow tumor cell growth or even trigger their death.

These findings could offer an explanation for the link between high-fiber diets and a lower risk of colorectal cancer.

However, while it is still advisable to eat plenty of fiber-rich foods, it is important to note that this was a cell-and animal-based study. More research is still necessary to determine if these results are reproducible in human trials.

Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are rich in nutrients and can help promote bone health. They can also influence gut health. However, not all dairy products may provide the same benefits.

A study published in the journal Nutrients provides evidence that different types of dairy products have varying effects on the gut microbiome.

The research suggests that drinking more milk correlates with an increase in two types of bacteria that may support gut health, while consuming more cheese is linked to lower amounts of a third beneficial type of bacteria.

Researchers analyzed colon tissue biopsies from 34 adult participants and compared these with self-reported dairy consumption questionnaires over the past year.

Using 16S ribosomal Ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing on 97 colonic mucosal biopsies, they found that those who consumed more total dairy and milk, and ate less cheese, appeared to have a higher alpha-microbial diversity.

Li Jiao, MD, MS, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Medicine-Gastroenterology at Baylor College of Medicine and senior author of the study, told MNT:

“The variety of species plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and stability of the ecosystem. Having higher alpha-diversity in the gut means a healthier and more balanced gut microbiota community.” 

In particular, milk drinkers displayed increased levels of Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia, which relate to gut barrier integrity, anti-inflammation, and a potentially lower risk of conditions such as IBD.

Conversely, participants who ate higher amounts of cheese had a lower diversity of gut bacteria and lower amount of the bacterium Bacteroides, which plays a complex role in digestion and health.

However, some species of Bacteroides can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Therefore, interpreting the results is not straightforward.

The findings suggest that milk may support a healthier, more diverse gut microbiome, while cheese might have the opposite effect. However, it is important to note the small sample size, self-reported data, and predominantly older male cohort in the study. More research is necessary before issuing broad dietary guidance.

Previous research has highlighted that the food people consume is one of the most significant influences on the gut microbiome.

A large-scale study of over 21,000 people in the U.S., U.K. and Italy, published in Nature Microbiology, suggests that the quality and diversity of the diet — rather than the dietary pattern itself — has the biggest impact on the structure of the gut microbiome.

For this study, researchers analyzed the gut microbiomes of individuals following vegan, vegetarian, or omnivorous diets.

Omnivore dietary patterns generally showed greater overall bacterial diversity, but also had higher abundances of bacteria associated with meat digestion and conditions like IBD and colorectal cancer. However, the presence of these bacteria does not necessarily mean a person will develop disease.

By contrast, vegan and vegetarian dietary patterns typically had higher levels of gut microbes linked with fiber fermentation, especially bacteria that produce SCFAs. 

However, the research notes that people following an omnivorous eating plan that consumed plenty of diverse, high-fiber plant foods, such as fiber-rich vegetables and whole grains, also had elevated levels of beneficial microbes, comparable to those seen in vegan and vegetarian dietary patterns. 

Nicola Segata, PhD, professor and principal investigator at the Department of Cellular, Computational, and Integrative Biology (CIBIO) at Università di Trento in Italy, is the senior author of the study.

Segata is also on the advisory board and a consultant for the personalized nutrition program company ZOE Limited, who partly funded the research.

He explained that:

“The greater the variety of plant-based foods we consume, the greater the diversity of beneficial microbes in our gut. This is because different plant-based foods contain different types of fiber, and each fiber can stimulate the growth of different types of health-promoting microbes. These microbes work together to improve our gut health, so the more diversity of health-associated microbes in our gut microbiome, the better our chances of good gut health.”

Overall, 20% of patients attending a vascular access clinic had an unsustainable treatment burden. Poor health literacy was associated with a nearly fourfold increase in the odds of experiencing overwhelming care demands. 

""Both treatment burden and health literacy are measurable and potentially modifiable factors that can help identify patients at increased risk of disengagement or nonadherence,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ben Edgar, School of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland. It was published online on November 25, 2025, in BMC Nephrology.

The cross-sectional design prevented causal inference between risk factors and treatment burden. The single-centre setting and use of English-only questionnaires may have limited generalisability. Additionally, the Treatment Burden Questionnaire, though validated in patients with CKD, was originally developed for multimorbidity and may not fully capture dialysis-specific burden.

This study received funding from Kidney Research UK. The authors declared having no competing interests.

A novel 4‑day outpatient Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy showed a favorable safety profile, with only 4.4% of systemic reactions requiring emergency intervention compared with 9.3% and 12.9% for traditional rush and ultra‑rush inpatient regimens, respectively.

“Our novel protocol effectively combines the benefits of both conventional outpatient schedules and accelerated inpatient regimens. It provides protection as quickly as inpatient protocols with a low rate of adverse events comparable to that of cost-effective outpatient approaches,” the authors of the study wrote. “Additionally, the use of minimal premedication, a lower total venom dose, and only two daily injections further enhance the practicality of our protocol,” they added.

Knut Schäkel, MD, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on November 23, 2025, in Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The retrospective, single-center design of the study and the lack of randomization may have limited its generalizability. Treatment groups were nonconcurrent — protocols ran at different times, including during the COVID pandemic. Buildup phase safety appeared favorable; however, long‑term outcome data for venom immunotherapy were limited.

Two authors reported receiving grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

In a study, 5.5% of patients developed demodicosis within 100 days of a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT); oral ivermectin was effective, with some reports of Mazzotti-like inflammatory reactions.

“In this post-HCT population, demodicosis was a cause of folliculocentric facial eruptions” and “should be considered in the differential diagnosis for post-HCT facial eruptions,” the authors of the study wrote. “While oral ivermectin is effective for demodicosis,” they added, “it may cause a Mazzotti-like reaction characterized by facial edema and systemic symptoms.”

The study was led by Jennifer Strong, MD, Dermatology Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, and was published online on December 3 in JAMA Dermatology.

The study is limited by its retrospective single-center design, small cohort size, and the lack of validated diagnostic tests for demodicosis.

Postoperative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positivity strongly predicts worse survival in stage III colon cancer, with ctDNA-positive patients showing sixfold higher recurrence risk. Among ctDNA-positive patients, celecoxib improves 3-year disease-free survival to 41.0% vs 22.6% with placebo.

“These findings underscore the prognostic value of ctDNA and suggest it may help identify a subset of patients who benefit most from adjuvant COX-inhibition alongside conventional chemotherapy and may offer opportunities for personalized approaches in CRC [colorectal cancer] treatment,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by George Q. Zhang, MD, MPH, Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and Jeffrey A. Meyerhardt, MD, MPH, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. It was published online on December 4 in JAMA Oncology.

According to the authors, this was a post hoc analysis of existing clinical trial data and may be confounded by lack of randomization within ctDNA subgroups. Additionally, ctDNA was only measured at one time point prior to therapy initiation, preventing assessment of ctDNA clearance with adjuvant therapy. The study population may not fully represent the broader disease population, with an overrepresentation of patients who self-reported as White race and non-Hispanic ethnicity.

This research was funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute of the US National Institutes of Health, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Foundation, Pfizer, and Natera.

What to do if you have a low exam score or a ""red flag"" on your application for medical school or residency? 

The first and most important thing that you can do is to be honest and upfront about this. You want to explain what actually happened and give a little bit more background to have them understand why that exam score might be lower than you had hoped. 

The second most important thing that you can do is to show reflection and growth. I want you to not only explain what happened, but also how you reflected on the experience and now are growing and going to be a better doctor for it.

A novel experimental anti-amyloid therapy lowered brain amyloid levels below the threshold of positivity in 92% of patients with early asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated at the highest test dose after just 28 weeks, interim results of a phase 1b/2a study suggest.

Trontinemab, which is under development by Roche, is a reengineered formulation of gantenerumab fused with Roche's proprietary Brainshuttle technology, which enables therapeutic molecules to cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to rapid uptake, substantially increased monoclonal antibody (mAb) concentrations at lower doses, and improved target engagement throughout brain tissue.

Although this mid-stage study was not designed to adequately assess clinical efficacy, trontinemab treatment was associated with numerically less decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) relative to placebo, with a low incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).

“We believe Brainshuttle technology holds immense potential to fundamentally change how we deliver therapeutics for neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease,” said lead author Luka Kulic, MD, PhD, vice president and head of early development in neuroscience and rare diseases at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd in Basel, Switzerland.

The findings were presented on December 1 at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference.

Crossing of the blood-brain barrier is a major challenge faced by large molecules such as amyloid-beta-lowering mAbs, with only 0.03%-0.2% penetration into brain tissue, investigators noted.

The Brainshuttle AD trial is a multipart, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept study assessing safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, including PET amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.

Kulic presented 28-week results from study cohort 3 (testing 1.8 mg/kg) and cohort 4 (testing 3.6 mg/kg) in a total of 151 participants with early symptomatic AD.

There was “rapid and robust” amyloid plaque clearance, especially at the higher 3.6 mg/kg dose, Kulic said.

At this dose, the adjusted mean change from baseline to week 28 was -99 centiloids; 92% of participants fell below the amyloid-positivity threshold (< 24 centiloids) and 71% were “deeply cleared,” reaching levels at or below 11 centiloids, Kulic reported.

“These effects were associated with early and pronounced effects across a range of downstream markers of AD pathophysiology, including pTau217, where we saw a remarkable more than 50% median reduction vs baseline at the 3.6 mg/kg within 6 months,” he said.

Although the study was not powered to detect clinical benefit, exploratory clinical efficacy outcomes at 28 weeks favored trontinemab, with less decline of the CDR-SB and MMSE scores, relative to placebo.

The overall safety profile was consistent with prior readouts with no new safety signals, Kulic said. The higher-dose cohort actually had fewer adverse events and fewer withdrawals than the lower-dose cohort.

Anemia was uncommon and mostly mild and transient. Infusion-related reactions were the most common side effect but were mild to moderate in severity and were significantly reduced with steroid premedication — “supporting a clear and effective mitigation strategy,” Kulic said.

There was a low incidence of ARIA with edema (< 5%), consistent with prior data.

Two large, identical global phase 3 trials (TRONTIER 1 and 2) have been initiated to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety in adults with early AD.

Reached for comment, Aaron Burstein, PharmD, head of search and evaluation at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation in New York City, told Medscape Medical News that the “excitement” around trontinemab and Brainshuttle technology is “understandable” and reflects “the continued evolution of how we administer and deliver anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies to optimize the efficacy while minimizing some of the risks of side effects, including ARIA.”

The data on trontinemab to date demonstrate that the drug is getting into the central nervous system “much better than the original gantenerumab formulation,” Burstein said.

Encouragingly, said Burstein, the rate of ARIA with trontinemab “is low — quite a bit lower than what we're seeing with the other anti-amyloid therapies. So the safety looks really good, and we're seeing effects on relevant biomarkers.”

Burstein added that this shuttle approach could have broad applications.

“One could envision that any molecule that is restricted in its ability to get across the blood-brain barrier could potentially be considered for this type of approach,” he said.

This study was funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Several authors have disclosed having relationships with the company. Burstein had no relevant disclosures.

Among pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with high fevers, pinpointing those at risk for developing sepsis “is akin to looking for a needle in the haystack,” said Elizabeth Alpern, MD, MSCE, Division Head of Emergency Medicine at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

“We see a lot of children who have fever, cold symptoms, or other infectious disease symptoms — tens or hundreds of thousands of cases nationally,” Alpern explained. “The question is: How do we identify that one child in that mass of otherwise well children who will progress to develop sepsis and have a life-threatening infection?” 

For suspect cases, the urgency with which ED clinicians must act, and the intensive workup that follows, can heighten anxiety for families. But a new artificial intelligence (AI) model may better specify which children are at high risk for sepsis before organ dysfunction develops, while also sparing lower-risk patients from unnecessary rapid intervention.

In a study led by Alpern, researchers used routine electronic health record (EHR) data collected during the first 4 hours of an ED visit to develop and validate machine-learning models that predicted sepsis within 48 hours with high accuracy. The study included more than 1.6 million ED visits across five health systems in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. Results are published in JAMA Pediatrics.

Sepsis is a leading cause of death in children worldwide, and although early recognition improves outcomes, existing predictive tools have not reliably identified children with evolving infection before clinical deterioration, Alpern said. The model represents the first application of AI-based prediction using the new Phoenix Sepsis Criteria, which were developed through an international consensus effort to standardize pediatric sepsis definitions. 

The team examined ED visits from January 2016 through February 2020 for model derivation and from 2021 through December 2022 for temporal validation. Eligible patients were aged 2 months to < 18 years and did not have sepsis during the initial 4-hour feature window. Data analysis followed the TRIPOD-AI reporting guidelines.

Researchers used logistic ridge regression and gradient tree boosting to predict sepsis as defined by suspected infection plus a Phoenix Sepsis Criteria score ≥ 2 or death within 48 hours. Predictive variables included

Model performance was high across cohorts. The gradient tree boosting model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.94) for predicting sepsis and demonstrated positive likelihood ratios ranging from 4.67 to 6.18. Performance for septic shock prediction was similarly strong, with AUROCs ≥ 0.92. Fairness assessments showed comparable results across demographic groups.

Because the models rely only on data already captured routinely in the ED, the researchers envision an alert-based system that integrates EHR inputs with clinician judgment. The models narrowed the number of children who would need evaluation to identify one case of sepsis; the data show approximately 45-68 cases for each one case of sepsis, she noted.

Future work will focus on refining risk thresholds, improving predictive value, and evaluating the model's performance when embedded in ED workflows, which will require thoughtful implementation, Alpern said.

“This is not an off-the-shelf tool that can simply plug into an EHR,” Alpern said. A provider-facing alert that integrates the model's output with clinical judgment “may help us move toward preemptively identifying children with sepsis.”

Alpern reported having no relevant financial relationships. The research was funded by the NIH.

Dr. Vadim Jucaud's lab at the Terasaki Institute has introduced a new organ-on-a-chip platform that recapitulates age-dependent immune responses, offering a more accurate testing bed for evaluating cancer vaccine performance in older adults, the population most affected by cancer and often overlooked in traditional preclinical testing.

Immunosenescence, the natural decline of the immune system with age, significantly reduces the effectiveness of cancer vaccines. Yet, despite its clinical importance, age-related immune decline is seldom incorporated into vaccine development pipelines. Current 2D culture systems are unable to capture these complex age-specific immune responses, thereby limiting their predictive value towards clinical translation.

To address this need, Dr. Vadim Jucaud's research team at the Terasaki Institute developed a lymph node paracortex-inspired organ-on-a-chip platform that models key steps in cancer vaccine immune responses, which are characterized by antigen presentation, antigen-specific T cell activation, and downstream tumor-specific cytotoxicity. By comparing immune responses from young and older lymphocytes, the lymph node on-a-chip platform captures functional differences that naturally emerge with age.

Using this platform, the team demonstrated that young antigen-presenting cells displayed significantly stronger peptide presentation compared to old cells. This increased activity led to higher activation of antigen-specific T cells and enhanced cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Notably, these age-dependent differences were detectable only with the lymph node on-a-chip system, underscoring its ability to reveal biologically relevant immune variations that traditional 2D cultures cannot.

This work introduces our lymph node on-a-chip platform for cancer vaccine testing. Unlike traditional 2D models, this advanced system replicates age-related immune responses, which is critical because older adults face the highest cancer risk and often have diminished immunity. By accurately modeling these conditions in vitro, our platform enables more reliable insights into cancer vaccine performance, therefore accelerating development and improving outcomes.""

Dr. Vadim Jucaud, Principal Investigator and Assistant Professor, Terasaki Institute

By more accurately reflecting the biology of aging, this novel platform offers a valuable tool for understanding how immunosenescence influences cancer vaccine efficacy. This technology may help guide the development of next-generation immunotherapies designed to meet the needs of older patients, ensuring that emerging cancer treatments support those who depend on them most.

Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is an inherited retinal disease leading to severe vision impairment from early infancy, affecting 2-3 out of every 100,000 newborns. LCA is caused by variants in certain genes from which proteins essential for retinal cell function and survival are made. Mutations in over 20 different genes can cause LCA and in each of those genes, hundreds of different changes, known as genetic variants, can occur. Importantly, while some of these genetic variants are benign and do not compromise function, other variants cause dysfunction or complete loss of function. Further, for some of these variants, which are called variants of uncertain significance (VUS), it is currently not known if they are disease causing or benign. 

The research team of Robyn Jamieson from Children's Medical Research Institute, University of Sydney, Australia have now set up a lab-based testing platform to classify VUS in retinal organoids, which are small 3D structures of retinal cells resembling the human retina. The work was published recently in Stem Cell Reports. The retinal organoids were grown from immature stem cells taken from a LCA patient with known pathogenic variants in the gene RPGRIP1, and from a second patient who carried a VUS in the same gene.

Organoids from both patients had distinct abnormalities such as less light-sensing photoreceptors and altered gene expression. Having identified these ""biomarkers"" of RPGRIP1-related LCA in the retinal organoids, Jamieson's team went one step further and inserted the RPGRIP1 VUS into healthy retinal organoids. Strikingly, the genetically engineered retinal organoids also developed the disease changes, confirming that the VUS in the RPGRIP1 gene was indeed pathogenic. Further, by reintroducing a healthy RPGRIP1 gene into the retinal organoids these disease-mediated changes were reversed. This new platform can be used to classify new VUS in RPGRIP1 and other LCA genes, enabling clinical genetic diagnosis.

Ultimately, the gained knowledge may help to develop targeted therapies for LCA patients and will inform decision-making and genetic counselling for at-risk populations.

The risk of sudden cardiac death is higher both for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, according to a large study published in the European Heart Journal today (Thursday). The increase in risk is especially noticeable among younger adults.

Sudden cardiac death is when someone dies suddenly and unexpectedly due to a problem with their heart. It is generally rare in young and seemingly healthy individuals.

The research also shows that people with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy on average, and that a proportion of this reduction is due to sudden cardiac death.

The research was led by Dr. Tobias Skjelbred from Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, and included data on the entire Danish population in 2010.

The researchers looked at all 54,028 deaths in the country over that year and used death certificates, hospital discharge summaries and autopsy reports to identify all sudden cardiac deaths. They found 6,862 cases.

By combining this with records of which people had type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes or neither, the researchers were able to compare rates of sudden cardiac death between the three groups.

They found that sudden cardiac death was 3.7 times more common among people with type 1 diabetes and 6.5 times more common for people with type 2 diabetes, compared with the general population. The difference in risk was greatest in younger adults, with people under 50 who have diabetes having a seven times higher risk of sudden cardiac death.

The research also showed that the average life expectancy was 14.2 years shorter for people with type 1 diabetes and 7.9 years shorter for people with type 2 diabetes. Sudden cardiac death was responsible for 3.4 of the years lost in people with type 1 diabetes and 2.7 in people with type 2 diabetes.

We found that sudden cardiac death occurs more frequently in people with diabetes across all age groups, and that sudden cardiac death has a substantial impact on the shortened life expectancy in individuals with diabetes. While sudden cardiac death risk increases with age for everyone, the relative difference is most pronounced when comparing younger people with diabetes to their peers in the general population.

This is an observational study, meaning that we can see a link between diabetes and sudden cardiac death, but we cannot prove that one causes the other. Sudden cardiac death is challenging to predict and prevent, but these findings reinforce the importance for people with diabetes to work with their clinicians to reduce cardiovascular risk.

There are probably several reasons behind this link, and these may differ by age. Having diabetes predisposes people to ischaemic heart disease, which is a key mechanism. In addition, diabetes-specific factors such as hypoglycaemia and cardiac autonomic neuropathy may increase the chances of an irregular heartbeat and sudden cardiac death.

A key limitation of this study is that it focuses on deaths in 2010, before widespread use of newer glucose-lowering therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. We therefore cannot assess how these treatments may have influenced sudden cardiac death in more recent years.""

Dr. Tobias Skjelbred from Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark

People who are known to have a very high risk of sudden cardiac death can be fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, so researchers say the next step could be to identify subgroups within the diabetes population who might benefit from preventive strategies, and to study how to lower the risk for people with diabetes.

In an accompanying editorial, Dr Hanno Tan from Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands and colleague said: ""Despite significant advances in cardiovascular medicine, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a challenge for prevention and treatment due to its unpredictable nature and high fatality rate.""Previous studies have indicated that the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in diabetics is elevated compared to the general population.

""In this issue of the European Heart Journal, Skjelbred et al expand upon these previous studies, furthering our understanding of the relationship between diabetes and SCD. For the first time, the extent of both loss in life expectancy due to diabetes and the contribution of SCD to this loss is quantified.

""Of particular interest is the finding that the diabetes-associated risk of SCD was higher among younger individuals than among older individuals. For example, the incidence rate was highest in the 30-40 year age group among type 1 diabetes patients (22.7), and in the 40-50 year age group among type 2 diabetes patients (6.0).

""[…] studies have been initiated to develop systems that may autonomously detect SCA and call the emergency number, e.g., through the use of wearables such as smartwatches. Such solutions may have particular relevance for type 1 diabetes patients, because the proportion of unwitnessed SCA events is higher in these patients than in the general population. Thus, type 1 diabetes patients may derive particular benefit from these solutions.

""[…] we may be able to reduce the burden of SCD in diabetes patients with the use of personalized treatment interventions that aim at preventing SCA and/or improving SCA treatment.""

Researchers engineered an injectable silica-based scaffold that trains the immune system to attack S. aureus on medical implants, cutting bacterial load dramatically and even clearing infection entirely in some animals.

Study: Scaffold vaccination for prevention of orthopedic device infection. Image credit: Connect Images - Curated/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers investigated whether scaffold vaccination can mitigate or prevent infections associated with orthopedic devices.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading global cause of bacterial mortality, responsible for over a million deaths every year. Medical implant devices elevate the risk of S. aureus infection, with orthopedic device infection being particularly devastating due to the need for extended antibiotic treatment and revision surgeries.

Vaccination could be an attractive strategy for individuals requiring device implantation. However, multiple vaccine trials have failed to prevent S. aureus infection after surgery.

The authors previously developed an alternative vaccine platform based on a biodegradable, injectable scaffold of mesoporous silica rods, which contain aligned nanopores for delivering granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to recruit dendritic cells (DCs). Scaffold vaccines with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from Escherichia coli provide mortality benefit upon Enterobacter infection, suggesting PAMPs may induce broad immunity.

In the present study, researchers investigated whether scaffold vaccination can prevent or mitigate staphylococcal infections associated with orthopedic devices. Mice received a subcutaneous injection of saline (naïve), scaffold containing chemokine and adjuvant (scaffold no-antigen), bolus vaccine (containing chemokine, antigen, and adjuvant in saline), or scaffold vaccine (containing chemokine, antigen, and adjuvant) on day 0. PAMPs derived from the S. aureus Xen29 strain were used as the vaccine antigen.

Mice were euthanized on day 7, and their spleens and injection site tissues were harvested. Spleens from the vaccine scaffold group were nearly three- and two-times as heavy as those from the naïve and scaffold no-antigen groups, respectively. There was a trend towards an increase in the number of cluster of differentiation 11c-positive (CD11c+) cells, typically representing DCs, at the injection site in the scaffold vaccine group.

Spleens from the scaffold vaccine group had significantly more CD11c+ cells, a majority of which (>72 %) co-expressed major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), a marker of DC activation. Furthermore, the scaffold vaccine group had significantly higher combined levels of serum cytokines associated with the T helper 1 cell (Th1) phenotype, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-1β, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), compared to the naïve group.

The bolus vaccine and scaffold vaccine groups had significantly higher Th17-associated cytokines than the naïve group. Next, vaccinated splenocytes were re-exposed to the bacterial antigen to assess cell-mediated immunity. IFN-γ expression was measured as a surrogate for antigen-specific Th1-mediated response. Only mice that received antigen-containing vaccines exhibited significantly elevated expression of IFN-γ compared to naïve mice.

Notably, the scaffold vaccine group showed significantly greater IFN-γ expression compared to the bolus vaccine group. Further, vaccinated animals were challenged with S. aureus orthopedic device infection on day 35. Naïve mice were uninfected following implantation (uninfected) or infected without vaccination (untreated). Other groups were challenged with 1,000 colony-forming units (CFUs) of S. aureus Xen29.

Two weeks later, only the untreated group exhibited persistent weight loss relative to uninfected controls. All infected groups showed higher anti-S. aureus total immunoglobulin G (IgG), with scaffold vaccination resulting in substantially higher anti-S. aureus titers than the scaffold no-antigen, untreated, and uninfected groups. Animals were euthanized on day 49 to harvest implants and collect biofilm-embedded microbes. No bacteria were recovered from the uninfected group.

Bacteria were recovered from other groups, with the scaffold vaccine group having the least bacterial burden. Notably, a subset of scaffold-vaccinated mice exhibited no detectable bacteria on the implant, suggesting potential sterilizing immunity in some cases. In addition, the reduction in bacterial load with scaffold vaccination represented an approximately 2.4-log (roughly 250-fold) decrease relative to untreated controls, indicating a large magnitude of protection.

The team investigated whether scaffold vaccination would protect against different strains of S. aureus. Sera from the scaffold vaccine group were tested against other methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (JE2 and NRS699lux) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains (UAMS-1 and RN4220). Sera from scaffold vaccine recipients had total IgG with significant binding against all tested strains.

Further, non-vaccinated mice and scaffold vaccine recipients were challenged with implants inoculated with the MRSA strain, NRS699lux, instead of Xen29. Implants of mice that received the scaffold vaccine had a significantly lower burden of NRS699lux at the end of the experiment.

Finally, iron-regulated surface determinant B (IsdB), the second most abundant protein within the PAMP pool used, was evaluated as the vaccine antigen. Mice were vaccinated with bolus IsdB, scaffold IsdB, or the PAMPs-based scaffold vaccine and challenged with Xen29 infection. Scaffold vaccination with either PAMPs or IsdB as the antigen was superior to bolus IsdB in reducing bacterial burden.

Scaffold vaccination with S. aureus Xen29 PAMPs as the antigen was well tolerated, successfully eliciting Th1-associated immunity and decreasing bacterial burden in mice with orthopedic device infection. Its protective effect was generalizable to another S. aureus strain.

Moreover, scaffold vaccination based on a protein antigen alleviated infection. Overall, scaffold vaccination may facilitate more robust immunity in cases where conventional bolus vaccines have been ineffective.

Overreliance on generative AI risks eroding new and future doctors' critical thinking skills, while potentially reinforcing existing data bias and inequity, warns an editorial published in the online journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine.

GenAI tools are already being widely used amid few institutional policies and regulatory guidance, point out the authors, who urge medical educators to exercise vigilance and adjust curricula and training to mitigate the technology's pitfalls.

The use of AI is now used in a vast array of different tasks, but along with its burgeoning potential comes an increasing risk of overreliance on it and a host of potential issues for medical students and trainee doctors, note the authors from the University of Missouri, Columbia, USA.

These include:

● automation bias-uncritical trust of automated information after extended use

● cognitive off-loading and outsourcing of reasoning-shifting information retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis to AI, so undermining critical thinking and memory retention

● Deskilling-blunting skills, which is especially important for medical students and newly qualified doctors who are learning the skill in the first place and who lack the experience to probe AI's advice

● reinforcing existing data biases and inequity

● hallucinations-fluent and plausible, but inaccurate, information

● breaches of privacy, security, and data governance-a particular issue for the sensitive nature of healthcare data

The authors suggest various changes to help minimize these risks, including grading the process, rather than only the end product in educational assessments, on the assumption that learners will have used AI.

Critical skills assessments that exclude AI need to be designed, using supervised stations or in-person examinations-especially important, for bedside communication, physical examination, teamwork, and professional judgement-suggest the authors.

And it may be prudent to evaluate AI itself as a competency, because ""data literacy and teaching AI design, development, and evaluation are more important now than ever, and this knowledge is no longer a luxury for medical learners and trainees,"" they add.

Medical trainees need to understand the principles and concepts underpinning Ai's strengths and weaknesses as well as where and how AI tools can be usefully incorporated into clinical workflows and care pathways. And trainees also need to know how to evaluate their intended performance and potential biases over time, they emphasize.

""Enhanced critical thinking teaching is especially needed, which can be achieved by building cases where the AI outputs are a mix of correct and intentionally flawed responses…. Learners would then accept, amend, or reject, and justify their decision with primary evidence- based sources,"" suggest the authors. 

Regulators, professional societies, and educational associations around the globe also need to play their part, by producing and regularly updating guidance on the impact of AI on medical education, urge the authors.

They conclude: ""Generative AI has documented and well-researched benefits, but it is not without pitfalls, particularly to medical education and novice learners. These tools can fabricate sources, encode bias, lead to over-reliance and have negatively disruptive effects on the educational journey.

""Medical programmes must be vigilant about these risks and adjust their curricula and training programmes to stay ahead of them and mitigate their likelihood.""

Cedars-Sinai scientists have developed an experimental drug that repairs DNA and serves as a prototype for a new class of medications that fix tissue damage caused by heart attack, inflammatory disease or other conditions.

Investigators describe the workings of the drug, called TY1, in a paper published in Science Translational Medicine.

By probing the mechanisms of stem cell therapy, we discovered a way to heal the body without using stem cells. TY1 is the first exomer-a new class of drugs that address tissue damage in unexpected ways.""

Eduardo Marbán, MD, PhD, executive director of the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai and study's senior author

TY1 is a laboratory-made version of an RNA molecule that naturally exists in the body. The research team was able to show that TY1 enhances the action of a gene called TREX1, which helps immune cells clear damaged DNA. In so doing, TY1 repairs damaged tissue.

The development of TY1 has been more than two decades in the making. It started when Marbán's previous laboratory at Johns Hopkins University developed a technique to isolate progenitor cells from the human heart. Like stem cells, progenitor cells can turn into new healthy tissue, but in a more focused manner than stem cells. Heart progenitor cells promote the regeneration of the heart, for example.

Later, at Marbán's lab at Cedars-Sinai, Ahmed Ibrahim, PhD, MPH, discovered that these heart progenitor cells send out tiny molecule-filled sacs called exosomes. These sacs are loaded with RNA molecules that help repair and regenerate injured tissue.

""Exosomes are like envelopes with important information,"" said Ibrahim, who is associate professor in the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute and first author of the paper. ""We wanted to take apart these coded messages and figure out which molecules were, themselves, therapeutic.""

Scientists genetically sequenced the RNA material inside the exosomes. They found that one RNA molecule was more abundant than the others, hinting it might be involved in tissue healing. The investigators found the natural RNA molecule to be effective in promoting healing after heart attacks in laboratory animals. TY1 is the synthetic, engineered version of that RNA molecule, designed to mimic the structure of approved RNA drugs already in the clinic. TY1 works by increasing the production of immune cells that reverse DNA damage, a process that minimizes the formation of scar tissue after a heart attack.

""By enhancing DNA repair, we can heal tissue damage that occurs during a heart attack,"" Ibrahim said. We are particularly excited because TY1 also works in other conditions, including autoimmune diseases that cause the body to mistakenly attack healthy tissue. This is an entirely new mechanism for tissue healing, opening up new options for a variety of disorders.""

The investigators next plan to study TY1 in clinical trials.

Quicker access to bleeding control interventions taught in the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Stop the Bleed program could have prevented the deaths of numerous homicide victims in Maryland, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons (JACS).

The analysis included data from more than 5,000 homicide victims in Maryland and showed that nearly half of the victims who died from gunshot or stabbing wounds sustained severe bleeding injuries affecting their arms or legs.

We know that the skills taught in Stop the Bleed can save lives, but we have very little population-level data telling us how often injuries that are treatable with techniques learned in Stop the Bleed occur. Maryland has a high burden of violent injury and a robust medical examiner system, providing us with a unique opportunity to study how many homicide victims sustained injuries that might have been survivable with rapid bleeding control.""

Joseph V. Sakran, MD, MPH, MPA, FACS, senior author of the study and executive vice chair of surgery, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland

The ACS Stop the Bleed program teaches bystanders how to use three techniques for severe bleeding emergencies while waiting for first responders: applying pressure, packing the wound, and using a tourniquet. Since the program's launch, more than 5 million people have been trained.

For the JACS study, researchers reviewed 5,765 autopsy reports from Maryland homicide victims killed by gunshot or stabbing wounds between 2005 and 2017. They categorized cases as isolated extremity injuries (arms or legs only) or non-isolated extremity injuries (involving other body parts, such as the head, neck, chest, or abdomen). They also reviewed reports for evidence of significant blood vessel damage, such as wounds to the femoral or brachial arteries.

Potentially preventable deaths were identified for victims who had isolated extremity injuries, which the researchers said represent the clearest scenarios where bystander intervention with bleeding control techniques is likely to be effective.

""This research tells us that while isolated extremity wounds are relatively uncommon, they are high-yield opportunities for bystander hemorrhage control - and that's the exact type of injuries that the ACS Stop the Bleed training targets,"" Dr. Sakran said. ""While 1% may sound small, in public health, every preventable death matters. Every one of these individuals was a brother, sister, family member, or friend, and we need to think about them in those terms, not just statistics.""

Dr. Sakran noted that because the study did not evaluate non-isolated injuries that may have been survivable with bleeding control, the number of potentially saved lives is likely higher. He added that while the results are specific to Maryland, which has a high density of Level 1 and 2 trauma centers, the findings highlight a critical gap between severe bleeding and first response that Stop the Bleed helps close across all communities. Future research will investigate the role of Stop the Bleed in preventing deaths from more complex, multi-site injuries.

""You don't have to be a doctor to save a life; you just need to know what to do in the first few minutes of a bleeding injury before first responders arrive,"" he said. ""And those first few minutes often belong to the community, not the hospital.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Understanding how adult brains adapt to challenge and change","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251204/Understanding-how-adult-brains-adapt-to-challenge-and-change.aspx","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 12:14:00 GMT","

In a revelatory Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, Dr. Paul Lucassen, full professor at the University of Amsterdam and leader of the Brain Plasticity group, shares his scientific journey that helped transform our understanding of how adult brains adapt to challenge and change. His research, spanning topics like apoptosis, neurogenesis, (early life) stress, rodent work, human brain tissue and diseases like depression and dementia, carries implications for those affected by these disorders globally.

The spark for Dr. Lucassen's career came from an unexpected source: watching an uncle gradually succumb to dementia. ""That unfortunate sequence of events piqued my interest in the brain,"" he recalls. What followed was doctoral research with Dick Swaab at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, investigating a deceptively simple hypothesis.

""I did my PhD with Dick Swaab on the hypothesis that, similar to muscle, activation and 'training' of brain cells is good for them and helps them withstand the deleterious consequences of aging and dementia, a concept paraphrased as 'use it or lose it',"" Dr. Lucassen explains. Those years proved formative, involving animal studies and work on human brain material including participation in the nightly autopsies of the Netherlands Brain Bank in Amsterdam. The question of whether neurons could be protected through activity would shape everything that followed.

A pivotal moment arrived during his postdoctoral work on stress and depression. The prevailing theory held that chronic stress could kill hippocampal neurons through glucocorticoid toxicity. But the evidence refused to cooperate. ""We could not find much support for it,"" Dr. Lucassen admits. The realization that hippocampal shrinkage after stress could normalize with recovery suggested something else entirely: perhaps also changes in cell birth, not just cell death, were involved.

Learning almost too late about a talk by Rusty Gage on adult neurogenesis, Dr. Lucassen booked a flight and found himself in London the next day. ""It completely blew me away,"" he recounts. 'The discovery that stem cells continue producing new neurons in adult brains represented a paradigm shift for me'. He returned to Amsterdam determined to abandon his cell death research and pursue (adult) cell birth instead.

With colleague Marian Joels and their then first PhD student Vivi Heine, who has since become a professor of stem cell biology, the team began investigating adult neurogenesis in relation to stress, depression, Alzheimer's disease and aging. This work eventually led to the Eurogenesis consortium, connecting researchers like Gerd Kempermann, Nora Abrous, Georg Kuhn, Henriette van Praag, Sebastian Jessberger, Alejandro Schinder, Nico Toni and others. With Liesbeth Reneman, Anouk Schrantee and Mirjana Maletic-Savetic, he works on detecting neurogenesis in vivo, and another topic, as discussed with Evgenia Salta in Cell Stem Cell in 2023, is whether factors that promote neurogenesis can offer protection against neurodegenerative conditions, like Alzheimer's.

This interview exemplifies the transformative scientific discourse found across Genomic Press's portfolio of open-access journals, enabling researchers worldwide to share discoveries that reshape how we understand brain health. More information is available at: https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/

Dr. Lucassen's current work focuses on understanding how adult plasticity is involved in human disease and how it is ""programmed"" during the period of early life. Both negative events, often stress-related, and positive experiences, like increased maternal care, interact to modify risk for later psychopathology. Intriguingly, early life programming may also extend to dementia resilience, a finding his team discussed in Biological Psychiatry in 2025.

""With an organ as complex as the brain, I have learned to be humble,"" Dr. Lucassen reflects. Nevertheless, he hopes to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain function and disease, testing whether brain plasticity can be leveraged for therapeutic or preventive approaches. In the MODEM consortium on dementia, and via collaborations through the Institute for Chemical Neuroscience, innovative molecular and multi-omic approaches are tested in rodent models and applied to human postmortem brain tissue where they will be combined with machine learning of the patient data, which he hopes will yield novel insights into the mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The interview reveals a scientist who finds balance through graphic novels and comic art, with treasured original pages by Lafebre, Franquin and Will Eisner. Cycling and running help clear his mind, providing space for reflection. His life philosophy crystallizes into four phrases: ""Lose the ego. Be kind. Stay curious."" And of course, the principle that launched his career: ""For the rest; use it or lose it.""

Dr. Lucassen voices concerns about challenges facing science: the glass ceiling for women in Dutch academia, bureaucracy surrounding animal experiments that drives talent away, the anti-science movement dismissing research as ""just another opinion,"" and funding systems that promote individuality over the team science necessary for tackling complex problems. ""Almost all major breakthroughs nowadays come from large groups and muti-disciplinary consortia,"" he observes.

What gives Dr. Lucassen greatest satisfaction? Working with his team and watching young scientists develop. In their successful master track on brain disorders, that he coordinates with Aniko Korosi for the past 15 years, many students went on to do a PhD, and also his own (PhD) students Mike Marlatt and Floor Stam, obtained leading roles in Daiichi Sankyo Pharma US, and the Belgian Alzheimer company Remynd, resp., while Ludo van der Pol, Vivi Heine and Maaike Kempes became full professors. ""It simply makes me happy and proud to see them do so well, working at the basis of implementing novel treatments for patients."" Currently, Lucassen his Brain Plasticity group has grown to six principal investigators, two technicians, and over 15 PhD students, and is embedded in major consortia including Urban Mental Health, ZonMW-ME/CFS and the Institute for Chemical Neuroscience.

Asked which living person he most admires, Dr. Lucassen names his mentors: Dick Swaab, Ron De Kloet, and Marian Joels, admiring ""their dedication and, each in their own way, their different approaches to life and to science, their humour, and the energy they maintain, career-long."" His real-life heroes? His wife Anne-Marie, daughters Sofie and Eva, and the principal investigators of his group.

Dr. Paul Lucassen's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Diabetes drugs linked to slower frailty progression in older adults","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251203/Diabetes-drugs-linked-to-slower-frailty-progression-in-older-adults.aspx","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 02:34:00 GMT","

A new study shows that older adults with type 2 diabetes who start treatment with sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors-such as empagliflozin (Jardiance) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga)-or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists-such as semaglutide (Ozempic) and liraglutide (Victoza)-experience slower progression of frailty over one year compared with those starting other diabetes medications. The findings suggest these therapies could help older adults maintain strength, mobility, and independence beyond their well-known effects on blood sugar and heart health.

The study, titled ""Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists, and Frailty Progression in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes,"" and published in Diabetes Care, looked at older adults who had just started different types of diabetes medications and followed them for one year. They found that people taking SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 drugs were less likely to show signs of frailty, such as weakness, slowed movement, or fatigue, compared with those starting other diabetes medications. In other words, these treatments appeared to help patients with diabetes maintain strength and function as they aged. The benefit could not be fully explained by heart benefits, suggesting the medications may directly help protect against frailty.

Analyzing a national 7% sample of U.S. Medicare claims, researchers tracked one-year changes in a validated claims-based frailty index (CFI; range 0–1, with higher scores indicating greater frailty). Compared with new users of DPP-4 inhibitors, those starting GLP-1 receptor agonists saw a mean CFI change of –0.007 (95% CI: –0.011 to –0.004) and those starting SGLT-2 inhibitors saw a mean change of –0.005 (95% CI: –0.008 to –0.002), indicating slower frailty progression. Users of sulfonylureas showed no significant difference. Additional analyses found that cardiovascular or other safety events accounted for only a small portion of the effect, suggesting a potential direct benefit of these medications on frailty itself.

According to prior research, roughly 10–15% of adults over age 65 experience frailty, with higher rates in those with type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes are particularly at risk due to chronic inflammation, muscle loss, cardiovascular disease, and the cumulative burden of managing a complex condition. Frailty is associated with falls, disability, hospitalization, and reduced lifespan. Because it is difficult to reverse once established, slowing frailty progression has emerged as an important goal in geriatric care, making the findings of this study especially significant for older adults with diabetes.

While SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are primarily prescribed for blood sugar control and heart protection, our findings show they may also help older adults with diabetes stay stronger and less vulnerable to health setbacks. Because frailty is common, serious, and hard to reverse, this could meaningfully change how clinicians think about medication choices for aging patients.""

An international research team led by the Medical University of Vienna has shown that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in women with gestational diabetes can reduce the risk of a newborn with above-average birth weight. The study, published in the leading journal The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the advantages of the digital method over conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose using finger pricks and opens up new perspectives for the targeted care of women with gestational diabetes.

The study included 375 women with gestational diabetes at four university centres: University Hospital Vienna, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Jena University Hospital and Basel University Hospital. The participants were randomly assigned to either the study group with continuous real-time glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) or the group with intermittent self-monitoring of blood glucose via finger pricks (SMBG) and were cared for according to guideline-compliant treatment standards until delivery. Gestational diabetes can lead to excessive growth of the child, which can contribute to birth problems, but also to an early childhood predisposition to obesity and metabolic diseases. Early diagnosis and consistent treatment can significantly reduce this risk.The evaluation of birth data in the study shows a clear advantage of continuous glucose monitoring: only four percent of women in the rt-CGM group gave birth to an above-average weight child (LGA = Large for Gestational Age), compared to ten percent in the control group. In addition, the average birth weight percentiles were lower in the rt-CGM group, indicating that the children of these women were less likely to grow excessively.

Continuous glucose monitoring via a sensor placed under the skin allows patients to check their blood sugar levels at any time. This enables them to make specific adjustments to their lifestyle or insulin therapy, which can have a positive impact on the course of their pregnancy.""

Christian Göbl, study leader, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, MedUni Vienna/University Hospital Vienna

However, it was noticeable that in both study groups there were more newborns with below-average birth weight (small for gestational age, SGA). This could indicate that very strict sugar management could also influence the risk of insufficient foetal growth - and requires further investigation, according to the researchers.In any case, our results suggest that real-time glucose monitoring systems can improve pregnancy care - especially for women who benefit from more intensive therapy,"" emphasizes first author Tina Linder (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, MedUni Vienna/University Hospital Vienna). ""At the same time, the optimal blood glucose target values still need to be precisely defined in order to avoid both overgrowth and undergrowth of the fetus.""

Researchers from Edith Cowan University (ECU) have developed a new tool to evaluate fear avoidance behavior following a concussion. 

The tool, aptly named the Fear Avoidance after Concussion Tool (FACT), consists of a questionnaire that can be completed within five minutes, under the supervision of a health care provider. 

ECU Masters by Research student Mr Liam Sherwood noted that if fear avoidant behaviour could be recognised early, following a concussion, it could enable targeted management for individuals who are at risk of persisting post-concussion symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating, low moods, headaches and sleep disorders. 

Mr Sherwood noted that early support and education can make a significant difference for people experiencing persisting post-concussion symptoms. These approaches focus on helping individuals understand their condition and build confidence in managing it themselves, reducing the impact that fear avoidance can have on their recovery. 

ECU Senior Research Fellow Dr Myles Murphy said existing tools used to assess fear avoidance after a concussion were originally designed for other types of injuries, meaning many of the questions asked of patients weren't relevant to their experience. 

""The FACT was designed with input from people who had concussions from an occupational injury, motor vehicle accident, fall, or from sports. All of these perspectives, as well as those from expert healthcare professionals, were used to design something that not only makes sense to the patient, but is also relevant to their injury and recovery."" 

Mr Sherwood noted that the questionnaire consists of 28 items, taking around five minutes to complete. The short nature of the questionnaire allows clinicians to use FACT during their consultation period, without concern that it would take up too much time. 

Work is now being done to use the FACT in larger, clinical populations before we can start the work on implementing this tool into clinical practice."" 

Mr. Liam Sherwood, ECU Masters by Research student 

The FACT is already making waves, having received the Best Clinical Research Poster Award at the Sports Medicine Australia Conference, in Hobart, earlier this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","'Origin Story: The 85ers' doc traces forgotten roots of first USWNT","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/national/2025/12/04/1985-uswnt-documentary-orgin-story/87596220007/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:22:00 GMT","

When Michelle Akers boarded a flight from New York to Italy for the USWNT's first international match in 1985 at 19, she didn't understand the gravity of the moment. 

""I literally was just there to play. No money, no fanfare, no audience, nothing. It was just because we loved it,"" Akers, a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame, told USA TODAY Sports. ""It took me a game to understand, holy s---, I'm playing for America.""

Akers and the 16 founding members of the USWNT embarked on a seismic journey armed with $10 a day, Adidas cleats and hand-me-down men's uniforms. What the original 85ers lacked in resources was made up by sacrifice, grit and belief in each other.

It's the DNA and mentality that laid the foundation for the USWNT dynasty to become the most dominant team in women's sports history. Yet, the 17 trailblazers that started it all rarely get that recognition.

Until now. Storied Sports partnered with Adidas to release a seven-part audio series, titled, “Origin Story: The 85ers,"" which premieres Dec. 10 in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the inaugural 1985 team. Akers, who served as co-producer on the project, said it's an ""emotional"" story she's been trying to tell for decades.

""You've spent and invested your blood, sweat, tears, your dreams, your identity into building change and building lasting, empowered opportunity and equality,"" said Akers, an Olympic gold medalist (1996) and two-time World Cup champion (1991, 1999).

""To look back 40 years later, from that first U.S. women's national team, and see that it's not only changed and elevated the USWNT, it's changed women's sports all around the world. And that, to me, is incredible.""

The origin of the USWNT dates back to the 1985 U.S. Olympic Sports Festival in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, more than a decade before the U.S. women won the first Olympic gold medal. The USWNT would be to be selected at the end of the tournament.

Players anxiously sat bleachers after the festival concluded, Akers recalled. And then USWNT head coach Mike Ryan read aloud a list of names that would form the first USWNT to compete overseas: Michelle Akers, Pam Baughman Cornell, Denise Bender, Denise Boyer-Merdich, Tara Buckley, Laurie Bylin, Stacey Enos, Linda Gancitano, Cindy Gordon, Ruth Harker, Tuca Healy, Lori Henry, Sharon McMurtry, Ann Orrison, Emily Pickering, Kathy Ridgewell and Kim Wyant.

""They read the list of names and we got on a plane and went to New York ... had a training camp, and the team was chosen and we left for Italy. So they made the team in three days,"" said Akers, who noted that their airfare was covered otherwise she ""never would've been able to go.""

Akers said Ryan reminded the team of the opportunity — ""He's yelling at us. You don't understand what it is the privilege and honor it is to play for your country!"" — and to a certain extent, she agreed. Akers didn't realize what the USWNT would become. Consider: there was no women's World Cup, it started in 1991, and Olympic women's soccer tournament, it began in 1996.

Akers, one of the youngest of the bunch, said her teammates saw the bigger picture. Little did Akers know she was ushering in a program that would transcend not only the sport and the country, but the world.

""Some of my other teammates, they had more vision I think, than I did. So for me, going there, I was so excited to play at the highest level in the world for the U.S.,"" she said. ""It took a minute to let that sink in and feel the privilege of that, but also the opportunity to wear that jersey.""

Akers said she and her teammates had to hand-sew Team USA patches on their jerseys, old men's uniforms that were given a second life by the women's team. And although they didn't have their last names on the back, Akers felt a tremendous amount of pride wearing it, an honor she feels to this day.

The USWNT lost to Italy 1-0 in its first international match on Aug. 18, 1985. They finished in a 2-2 draw against Denmark in their second match, before ending the tournament with losses to England (3-1) and Denmark (1-0).

""Playing against Italy, that first game, and we got our asses kicked,"" Akers said. ""... They were true soccer football players. And I recognize we had a long way to go.""

But the Americans' confidence grew each time they took the pitch and Akers knew they had something special: ""We were warriors. We wanted to win. That's that mentality... It carries on over 40 years.""

""We'll outwork you, outplay you and never ever give up,"" Akers said. ""And we see that time and time again in every competition, the USA plays in.""

Ahead of every USWNT match, U.S. players enthusiastically chant ""Ooosa, Ooosa, Ooosa"" before taking the pitch. It's a tradition that dates back to the founding members being greeted by Italian fans cheering for ""USA"" upon their arrival in 1985, an endearing connection between the past and present.

""It makes my heart explode with pride and just a sisterhood,"" Akers said. ""This thread continues and it's represented by this cheer from that very first team. So it's, it's really, really special.""

Sisterhood is a central theme of the documentary-style audio series ""Origin Story: The 85ers,"" which reunites the original members through conversations, memories and shared experiences. Forty years may have passed, but ""nothing's changed at all,"" Akers joked, likening her teammates to the cast of ""A League Of Their Own.""

""These are the characters of my teammates. They are off the hook,"" she added. ""They're completely authentic. They did things no one has ever done before, and they're still doing it because that's who they are. So I think as serious and intense it can be, it's funny and emotional too.""

Akers said the reunion was extra special because it was the first time some of her teammates revisited 1985. Although Akers went on to have a prolific soccer career that stretched until 2000, many of her teammates hung up their cleats after that trip to Italy to pursue a job, families, education or anything deemed legitimate, because ""soccer wasn't a thing"" back then, Akers recalled.

""Some of them literally packed their gear away in the attic and never looked at it again. And then when we started developing this project, they took it out of the attic and it was so emotional,"" Akers said. ""The thought that now finally they're being recognized and what they did is special.""

In addition to the 17 members of the 1985 team, many USWNT icons -- Brandi Chastain, Julie Foudy, Lindsey Heaps, Kristine Lilly, Becky Sauerbrunn and Abby Wambach -- make appearances throughout the seven-part audio series to reflect on the 85ers legacy. The voices highlight how far the program has come.

""You can't understand the rise of women's sports today without understanding and appreciating the women who built it,"" said Jaymee Messler, co-founder and co-CEO of Storied Sports. ""I feel like it closes a loop that honors the past while acknowledging how deeply it's shaped the present. And it feels like the 85ers lit that spark that this next generation turned into a wildfire.""

It's appropriate the series is presented by Adidas, who was part of their story from the beginning ""before there were lights, cameras or sponsorship dollars,"" Messler added. Adidas provided the first USWNT jersey.

Storied Sports is doing more than sharing the story. The content studio created an athlete-owned team LLC, where all 17 players are represented and trademarked in an effort to turn ""history into equity.""

""There's so much investment going into women's sports right now,"" Messler said, ""and Michelle and I and our team have been focusing on how to create some of that investment into the women themselves that have built these sports.""

The league has a chance to innovate and keep its best players

The NWSL has been the top women's soccer league in the world since its inception in 2013. While there may be teams in Europe that have more talented rosters than the best NWSL sides, top to bottom the league has more balance and competition than those abroad. Much of that is thanks to the preference of USWNT stars to play in the USA. In recent years, that has been changing as top players like Naomi Girma, Emily Fox, Lindsey Heaps, and Alyssa Thompson moved abroad in the prime of their careers. It seems like another star player will be leaving soon as Trinity Rodman has gained interest from Europe.

In an effort to keep her stateside, the Washington Spirit reportedly offered her a four year contract that would have competed with what she could make in Europe. Rodman had agreed to the terms but the deal was vetoed by NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman because, while it doesn't appear to have violated any NWSL roster rules, it ran counter to the values of the league.

Clearly, the league cannot afford to keep losing its best players and expect to keep a competitive environment that has been key to its success. That success also supports the USWNT since players need to be competing against top opposition in order to be among the best national teams in the world. While NWSL can likely have the best competitive equity in the world thanks to its salary cap, it will not be able to keep up with teams that can pay higher salaries and poach its best players.

The situation with Rodman is an opportunity for the league to innovate and create a solution so its competitiveness does not fall behind leagues who are improving and do not have the salary limitations that the NWSL has. It would be tempting to look to MLS with its designated player rule and other roster mechanisms that have brought and kept star players into the league, but MLS has been playing catchup while the NWSL has been setting the standard. NWSL needs to take proactive steps to either keep players like Rodman or it risks losing more ground as women's soccer in Europe grows in popularity and financially.

NWSL

The Spirit offered Trinity Rodman a multiyear, multimillion-dollar offer. John Hefti / Imagn Images

The Washington Spirit proposed a multimillion-dollar offer to keep Trinity Rodman in the NWSL, which she was ready to accept. It was vetoed by NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman, according to sources who were briefed on the deal but not authorized to speak on the matter publicly.

Bloomberg first reported news of the failed attempt to re-sign Rodman, who is one of the primary stars not just of the Spirit, but of the NWSL as a whole.

“Our goal is to ensure that the very best players in the world, including Trinity, continue to call this league home. We will do everything we can, utilizing every lever available within our rules to keep Trinity Rodman here,” a league spokesperson said Wednesday night.

According to sources, the Spirit had proposed a four-year scaling contract that would see the 23-year-old free agent paid more in the final two years of the deal, with the hope of an increased media-rights deal for the NWSL helping with those costs. The current media-rights deal expires in 2027. Sources did not provide exact figures for Rodman's proposed salary for each of the four years, though the annual average would be over $1 million, and felt it was competitive with inbound offers from top European clubs.

Rodman signed a four-year, $1.1 million contract extension in 2022 after her rookie season. That deal ended this year.

Berman and the league believe the structure of the proposed contract violates league rules, according to a source briefed on the league's decision.

She's worth watchin'! 😎 

Congratulations to Trinity Rodman on being named to the 2026 @forbes 30 Under 30 list. 💅🏆https://t.co/TCJA3Z6ZqY pic.twitter.com/2MwIRZzEgb

— Washington Spirit (@WashSpirit) December 2, 2025



Based on the NWSL's 2025 competition manual, the salary-cap regulations do not appear to directly forbid the increase of a salary from year to year, assuming the Washington Spirit met the league's salary cap in any given year. For the 2026 season, the team salary cap is $3.5 million; by the end of the proposed offer, in 2029, the salary cap would be $4.9 million. There is no maximum for any individual player's salary in the NWSL collective bargaining agreement.

The Spirit declined a request for comment Wednesday night.

Sources said that because the proposed contract structure did not violate any NWSL rules, the NWSL Players Association has filed a grievance with the league on Rodman's behalf.

A request for comment was not immediately returned by a spokesperson for the NWSLPA.

According to the NWSL CBA, once a grievance is filed — in this case by the PA — the league has 14 days to reply via email to say if the grievance is sustained or denied. If that doesn't happen, the grievance would then go to a committee with one representative appointed by the league and one by the PA. Arbitration is also on the table if either of those methods fail, or if both the league and the PA decide a grievance should simply go directly to an impartial arbitrator.

Rodman's status as a free agent and her future within the NWSL have been one of the major storylines of the past month. Rodman has received interest from European clubs, made all the more concerning to the NWSL as a whole after a series of high-profile departures by other American talent this year, from Naomi Girma to Alyssa Thompson.

“All I can say is the club has been doing all it can — above and beyond — to make sure that there is a path for (Rodman) to stay,” Spirit owner Michele Kang told The Athletic on Tuesday. “We've done that in partnership with the league.”

Commissioner Berman has been directly involved in negotiations between the Spirit and Rodman's representation. All standard player agreements are signed with the NWSL itself, rather than any individual teams.

Ahead of the championship, Berman said the league wants the top players of the world in the NWSL. “Particularly, we want Trinity in the NWSL,” she said, “and we will fight for her.”

It is unclear how Berman and the league vetoing the Spirit's considerable offer leaves the state of negotiations moving forward.

Get unrivaled matchday access

The U.S. Men's National Team closes the November window with its second straight matchup against a South American, World Cup-qualified opponent. After defeating Paraguay 2-1 in Chester, Pennsylvania, the USMNT now turns its attention to a matchup with Uruguay on Tuesday, Nov. 18 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. 

Here are five storylines heading into Tuesday's matchup:

Uruguay is led by head coach Marcelo Bielsa, the longtime manager deeply admired in the sport, and he'll see a familiar face on the opposite bench in U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Though this is the first time they've squared off as opposing head coaches, the two have a shared history; Biesla coached Pochettino as a player at Newell's Old Boys and Espanyol and both men are Argentina natives. Pochettino regards his former coach highly and has spoken before about Biesla's influence on him, both professionally and personally. In his press conference last week, Pochettino said it's going to be amazing to see his former manager, but that he also expects it to be tough going up against a world-class and revered coach.  

Matches between the United States and Uruguay in the all-time history series have been played remarkably close. All but one of the nine meetings between the USMNT and Uruguay have been decided by one goal or ended in a draw. The last time these two teams met was on July 1, 2024, in CONMEBOL Copa América. A 66th-minute goal from Mathías Olivera was the difference in a 1-0 win for Uruguay. The most recent win in the series for the Americans was a friendly in 2002. Two first-half goals from Tony Sanneh and DaMarcus Beasley led the U.S. to a 2-1 victory in the nation's capital. 

The USMNT put together a controlled, confident performance in the 2-1 win over Paraguay in Chester, Pennsylvania. The win is the second straight for the U.S., including the win over Australia in October by the same scoreline. Going back to September, the USMNT has gone unbeaten in four straight matches against World Cup-qualified opponents with wins over Japan, Australia and Paraguay and playing Ecuador to a draw. This run is the first time in 10 years that the U.S. has gone unbeaten against teams ranked in the top 40 of the FIFA World Ranking. And with No. 16 Uruguay, the U.S. has a chance to make it five.

Meanwhile, Uruguay is riding an unbeaten streak of their own. La Celeste finished fourth in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying and enters the matchup on a six-match unbeaten run, dating back to June. 

The two goal scorers in the Nov. 15 win over Paraguay racked up big numbers in their game-changing finishes. Midfielder Gio Reyna scored a headed goal for the first time in his professional career. The fourth-minute finish brought his international total to nine, which passes his father, Claudio's, scoring total with the U.S. Men's National Team. The second goal scorer on the night, Balogun, recorded his third goal in his third straight start for the U.S. The striker now has 12 goal contributions in 18 starts for the USMNT.

One of the storylines coming out of this camp for the U.S. was just now close the World Cup feels. Captain Tim Ream said the tournament was “knocking on the door,” and with only single-digit training sessions remaining, its proximity makes the tournament start to feel very real. Tuesday's matchup against Uruguay will be the final match of the year for the United States, and the team will not play again for four months. Just two international windows remain – in March and June – before the World Cup begins June 11 in Mexico City, so the Nov. 18 matchup with Uruguay is an important tune-up before a long stretch.","{'href': 'https://ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

The Athletic has live coverage of the build up to Friday's 2026 World Cup draw.

The pots and procedures for the 2026 World Cup draw, finalized Tuesday by FIFA, offer the U.S. men's national team a wide range of possibilities.

At one end of the range, the USMNT could get a South American power, a world-class striker and one of only eight all-time World Cup winners.

At the other end, the Americans could meet a non-threatening European side and two of the true minnows in the expanded field of 48.

And then there are many alternatives in between those extremes, paths of varying degrees of difficulty that will play a significant role in determining the legacy of this USMNT.

A difficult group, of course, does not ensure failure. The U.S. emerged in 2002 from meeting hosts South Korea, Portugal and Poland. In 2014, it qualified from a group that included Portugal, Germany and longtime nemesis Ghana.

This time around, though, the U.S. will shoulder enormous expectations. Failing to reach the knockout rounds next summer would be seen as a colossal missed opportunity and a letdown for a team that left Qatar in 2022 with optimism. Plus, as hosts, the Americans are in Pot 1, which means they will avoid international soccer's biggest superpowers, including Spain, Argentina, England and France.

That seeding, however, does not eliminate all possible challenges. The following is a look at some of the best-case and worst-case scenarios, as well as potential groups that might carry intriguing storylines.

Tenorio: Colombia, Norway, UEFA Playoff B

In this scenario, depending which team emerges from the UEFA playoffs, the U.S. would probably go into the group anything but the favorite to top it. Imagine opening up the World Cup against Erling Haaland, the goal-scoring freak motivated by making his World Cup debut. If you don't manage a result there, you have to pivot to play an extremely capable and dangerous Colombia team, and then you close the group against a team like Ukraine, Sweden or Poland. Yuck.

Bushnell: Morocco, Norway, UEFA Playoff A

We agree that Norway is the scariest team in Pot 3. In Pot 2, Colombia is the best, but, in the interest of variety, I'll note that Morocco, a 2022 semifinalist, would be similarly challenging. (So would Croatia, but, as we'll cover below, drawing a European foe from Pot 2 would lessen the likelihood of drawing tough European opposition from Pot 3 or 4.)

Advertisement

In Pot 4, the question is: Which European placeholder is least desirable? As Paul noted, path “B” almost guarantees a difficult matchup. But Italy, the favorite in Playoff A, is probably the best of the lot.

Elo ratings: Colombia (5th), Norway (11th), Denmark (17th)

FIFA rankings: Morocco (11th), Norway (29th), Italy (12th)

Tenorio: Austria, Qatar, New Zealand

This is a mix of weaker opponents and favorable scheduling. The U.S. knows it will start against a team from Pot 3. Opening up the tournament as heavy favorites against Qatar would give the USMNT a chance for a positive result and some momentum. The second game would be manageable against Austria, which is no slouch, but falls somewhere in the lower-middle of the European options. Then, if you need a result in the final group game, it's against a New Zealand team that the U.S. would definitely expect to beat.

Yes, you could hold out hope that you get the weakest-possible European side coming out of a playoff, but, on Dec. 5, you'd be rooting for the weakest teams you can see right now. This is the best-case scenario for the U.S. to win the group.

Bushnell: Austria, Uzbekistan, Cape Verde (or Austria, South Africa, Jordan)

As Paul covers, the thought experiment here is: From which pot do you want your European team? (Each group must have one, so a U.S.-Australia-South Africa-New Zealand pairing isn't possible.)

Fleshed out, the question is: Do you hope for the weakest possible team from Pot 2 (Australia or Iran) and accept the subsequent likelihood of a European playoff team from Pot 4? Or hope for Scotland from Pot 3? Or would it be best to get a European team from Pot 2 because it opens up a path to Jordan, Cape Verde or New Zealand in Pot 4?

Australia, Scotland and Cape Verde or New Zealand is intriguing, but I'll go with the latter and note that drawing any side from the bottom third of Pot 3 — Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa — would be a very favorable outcome for the USMNT.

Elo ratings: Austria (23rd), Qatar (84th), Ghana (80th) — or Iran (33rd), South Africa (77th), Bosnia and Herzegovina (68th)

FIFA rankings: Austria (24th), South Africa (61st), New Zealand (86th) — or Australia (26th), South Africa (61st), Kosovo (80th)

Tenorio: Iran, South Africa, Ukraine

Iran's fraught political history with the U.S. was on display in 2022, when the two nations were drawn into the same group and confronted each other in a must-win group finale. The Americans escaped with a 1-0 victory. President Donald Trump has sparred with South Africa's government, recently protesting a G-20 summit and claiming White South Africans were being racially discriminated against. The U.S., meanwhile, is pushing a peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

Bushnell: Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine

Trump has been at odds with Colombian president Gustavo Petro, one of the few world leaders who has been willing to openly criticize the U.S. president. (Petro recently called Trump a “barbarian” for his military attacks on boats allegedly carrying illicit drugs.) Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has been controversial in geopolitical circles for years but is, for now, enjoying warm relations with Trump, who recently welcomed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House for the first time since the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents. And lastly, for political intrigue, Ukraine is the obvious pick from Pot 4. (The U.S. cannot draw Haiti because they belong to the same confederation, Concacaf.)

Tenorio: Switzerland, Qatar, Ghana

The U.S. got stomped by Switzerland this summer, a game that might have been the ground floor of Pochettino's rebuild. A chance to go at the Swiss again at the World Cup could be seen as a marker of growth. Qatar, meanwhile, beat out the U.S. for the right to host the 2022 World Cup. The U.S.'s history with Ghana at the World Cup is well-documented, with losses in 2006 and 2010 before finally getting a win in 2014.

Bushnell: Morocco, Norway, European minnow

Morocco has now knocked the U.S. out of the U-17 World Cup, the U-20 World Cup and the men's Olympic tournament, all in a span of 16 months. Morocco's bid was also the one that Canada, Mexico and the U.S. beat out to host this 2026 World Cup. A group-stage matchup would be spicy.

From Pot 3, it would be amazing to see Haaland at SoFi Stadium in the U.S. opener. And from Pot 4, I'd love to see a World Cup debutant like Kosovo or Albania.

Tenorio: Korea Republic, Norway, Poland

Games against Korea's Son Heung-min, Norway's Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard and Poland's Robert Lewandowski would deliver the type of major star power you'd expect from a World Cup, even avoiding the powerhouse teams stocked with the biggest names in global soccer.

Bushnell: Colombia, Egypt, Turkey

Luis Díaz has never played at a World Cup. He debuted for Colombia shortly after the 2018 tournament. They then missed out on the 2022 edition. With his prime years waning, 2026 will be his golden opportunity to carry his country on a run.

Egypt, meanwhile, has Mohamed Salah, who is in decline but still talented. Turkey, which beat the U.S. in a June friendly, has two dynamite 20-year-old attackers, Arda Güler and Kenan Yildiz.

Austria, Tunisia, Slovakia

We close with a reminder that, for all the potential excitement detailed above, the most likely scenarios are far more boring. Forget the exact teams listed above; there are dozens of possibilities that would yield the reaction: Hm, OK.

In most of these scenarios, the U.S. will be favored to advance from — though maybe not win — its group. Its legacy will be earned in the knockout rounds.

The U.S. men's national team and the Mexico national team will continue their 2026 World Cup preparations in March with high-caliber matchups against two of the best teams in the world: Portugal and Belgium. 

A five-game unbeaten streak and three wins on the bounce to end the year has Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT rounding into form at the perfect time. A huge 5–1 win over Uruguay last time out confirmed the positive momentum the Stars and Stripes will take to the new year. 

Contrastingly, Mexico suffered to end 2025 with a six-game winless streak. Javier Aguirre's men must right the ship in the months leading up to the World Cup or they risk an absolute disaster come next summer. 

Both host nations know their path through the World Cup group stage already and they'll imminently find out who their rivals will be in the 2026 World Cup group stage draw on Friday.

Regardless of the draw results, Portugal and Belgium, two top-10 ranked teams with stars all over the lineup, will be valuable tests to get a good sense of where the USMNT and El Tri stand less than two months from the World Cup.

The USMNT will face Belgium in its first match of the World Cup year on March 28. Then, Portugal will come to town on March 31 in a game that could potentially see Cristiano Ronaldo play his first match on U.S. soil since 2014. Both games will be played at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. 

Pochettino is poised to select a similar group of players to the 26-strong roster he'll select for the World Cup. The Argentine manager couldn't hide his excitement when he offered his thoughts on the pair of March friendly matches. 

“For us, this is a massive opportunity to challenge ourselves against some of the top teams in the world,” Pochettino said. “These are incredible matches for the players and for the fans.”

The USMNT last played Belgium in the round of 16 of the 2014 World Cup, when even an inspired performance from legendary goalkeeper Tim Howard couldn't save the U.S. from a heartbreaking extra time elimination. 

Similarly, the USMNT also played Portugal in Brazil 2014. A hard-earned 2–2 draw helped the Stars and Stripes advance in the group stage, while Portugal failed to advance to the knockout rounds. 

A lot has changed in the past decade-plus. However, there's no denying the Pochettino's side will aim to continue its positive run to boost confidence even more before the start of the summer spectacle.

In a landmark date for soccer in Mexico, the iconic Estadio Azteca will re-open its doors for El Tri to host Portugal on March 28. El Tri will return to its spiritual home for the first time in over three years following a massive renovation project to one of soccer's cathedrals. 

Portugal is a worthy opponent for such a landmark match and it could be the first time Ronaldo plays a game on Mexican soil. However, he did feature against El Tri in the 2017 Confederations Cup, when Portugal drew against Mexico in the group stage before eventually beating El Tri in the third-place match. 

El Tri will then travel to the U.S. to face Belgium at Chicago's Soldier Field on March 31. Mexico faced Belgium in a friendly match prior to the 2018 World Cup, drawing 3–3 in the last ever meeting between the two nations.

Facing high-caliber opponents is exactly what Aguirre asked for in the lead-up to the World Cup, and Mexico national team director Duilio Davino shared his thoughts on the upcoming international friendlies.

“For us it's an honor to face Portugal,” Davino said. “A very strong team with a lot of good players. At the re-inauguration of our stadium, it'll be an honor.

“These are the type of games Javier [Aguirre] asked for to truly measure out national team. Belgium is a great team. We know the best soccer is played in Europe and where the best players are. These games will be a great parameter [for Mexico] and they'll be great rivals.

“We hope they'll be great games and to continue building our team for the World Cup.”

The official draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup takes place on Friday at the prestigious John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.

Unlike previous editions of the draw, where 32 nations awaited their fate, the World Cup has expanded to 48 teams for the 2026 edition. While six places are yet to be determined due to upcoming playoff games, 42 nations have secured their spots for the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.

The draw is expected to be dramatic, with President Donald Trump reportedly attending the ceremony, while Iranian representatives have opted to boycott the event. By Friday afternoon, the draw will be complete, and by Saturday afternoon, venues and kick-off times will be announced.

The draw will be conducted by England legend Rio Ferdinand, and North American sports icons Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal, Wayne Gretzky, and Aaron Judge will assist with the ceremony. U.S. Soccer has been preparing for this World Cup since it was awarded co-hosting rights in 2018.

The U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, but its best performance under the modern format was during the 2002 World Cup, which Japan and South Korea co-hosted. The United States men's national team reached the quarter-finals, but hasn't gone that far since.

After hiring former Chelsea, Tottenham, and Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT has a great chance to make history, but the outcome of the draw will be significant. As a host nation, the USMNT has been placed in Pot 1.

As a Pot 1 contender, the USMNT will automatically avoid top-ranked FIFA nations such as Spain, England, Argentina and France. Per World Cup rules, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it.

This applies to all confederations except UEFA, meaning that the USMNT will likely face an eclectic mix of nations from across the globe. The four-nation group will feature a team from Pots 1, 2, 3 and 4.

The draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will begin at noon ET at the prestigious John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. The action will be broadcast live on FOX, or be available digitally on the FIFA YouTube channel or the official FIFA.com website.

The USMNT has been placed in Pot 1 alongside the world's best nations.

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany

The USMNT will be drawn first and then face one nation from each pot during the World Cup group stages.

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, IR Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa

Pot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2

One way or another, Argentina star Lionel Messi is attending the 2026 World Cup.

""I hope I can be there. I've said before that I'd love to be there,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. ""At worst, I'll be there watching it live, but it will be special.

""The World Cup is special for everyone, for any country — especially for us, because we live it in a completely different way.""

The stakes of any given World Cup are so high that a coach is taking a risk whenever he selects a player, no matter how great, based largely on reputation. The pressure on Lionel Scaloni is even higher as Argentina is the reigning world champion.

Messi will be 39 when the World Cup kicks off and La Albiceleste boast a lot of attacking talent. Next summer, maybe his performance has started to tail off to a point where he isn't the best option for Scaloni on the merits.

But the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner hasn't had that sort of decline yet. He won the MLS Golden Boot in 2025 with 29 goals and tied for the league lead in assists with 19.

Messi has added another six goals and seven assists in the playoffs as Inter Miami heads into Saturday's MLS Cup final against the Vancouver Whitecaps.

Across 12 World Cup qualifying matches, he also scored eight goals and assisted on three more, so the legendary forward isn't merely padding his stats in a league that's a step below the best competitions in Europe.

As long as he isn't dealing with an injury, it's tough to picture Messi only following the 2026 World Cup as a spectator.","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","soccer"

What is the FIFA Peace Prize? Explaining new award at World Cup 2026 draw with Donald Trump rumored winner originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.

The World Cup draw always proves a spectacle. The 2026 iteration of the event will be no exception, with the expanded 48-country field set to produce more than a few shocks.

The prospect of watching the game's finest stars light up fields in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is enticing for billions. But Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Lamine Yamal aren't the only people who will be watching the event with bated breath.

So will U.S. President Donald Trump. The 79-year-old head of state could be landing some hardware of his own during the event, with FIFA set to award its inaugural FIFA Peace Prize to individuals believed to have made the greatest contribution to creating peace for soccer lovers across the planet.

FIFA has attempted to paint itself as a “neutral” observer to present-day political conflicts. The peace prize represents a shift away from that alleged principle. Suffice to say, the award — and its recipient — will be a notable talking point when it is handed out on Dec. 5.

So, what is the FIFA Peace Prize? Here's what you need to know.

MORE: USA's history of hosting the World Cup and major soccer events

Introduced in 2025, the award is designed to ""reward individuals who have taken individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace"", the FIFA Peace Prize is an award granted to individuals believed to have united the masses of soccer enthusiasts, per a FIFA press release.

It seems to borrow its title — at least somewhat — from the Nobel Peace Prize, whose committee alleges to handing hardware to the person or organization has ""conferred the greatest benefit to humankind in the field of peace"" during the preceding year, per the Nobel Peace Prize committee's mission statement.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced the award during an appearance at the America Business Forum in the Kaseya Center on Nov. 5. The Athletic reported that FIFA's announcement came as a surprise to the majority of FIFA Council members. Sources told The Athletic that the Council's eight vice-presidents were not consulted or involved in the prize's creation. The selection criteria remains murky, with council members reportedly unable to offer input into the process of determining a winner. Some found out about the award via press release, according to The Athletic.

Confusion around the award has led Human Rights Watch — one of the world's largest human rights and advocacy organizations — to write a letter to FIFA seeking clarification on the award. Human Rights Watch wrote the letter to FIFA on Nov. 11, setting a deadline of Nov. 20 to respond. As of Dec. 2, FIFA hasn't responded to Human Rights Watch's request.

Infantino offered insight into the award while speaking with an audience at the America Business Forum.

“This is the right platform to award somebody who has done so much or is doing so much for peace because we need that,"" Infantino said. ""Football helps a little bit, but then we need leaders to push it into the goal and to score the goal.""

He also said the following in FIFA's initial statement announcing the award:

“In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” Infantino said in FIFA's statement announcing the award.

Football stands for peace, and on behalf of the entire global football community, the FIFA Peace Prize — Football Unites the World will recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.”

Infantino is a known admirer of Donald Trump, having chummed around with the U.S. president during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. Trump is believed to desire the Nobel Peace Prize, with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (FL-13) nominating him for the medal in October. Trump claims to have settled eight wars since returning to office.

“At a time when global conflict is escalating and many leaders hide behind speeches instead of action, President Trump is delivering results,” Rep. Luna wrote. “This was not political theater—it was serious, results-driven diplomacy that will save thousands of lives and restore hope to millions.”

Infantino made similar claims on Oct. 9, writing on Instagram that deserves the prize for his ""decisive actions"" in facilitating a ""ceasefire"" amid Israel's genocide of Palestinians. Israelis have continued to kill Palestinians and Lebanese civilians in the weeks following the announcement of the ceasefire. On Nov. 28, the United Nations calling for an independent investigation to be conducted after video emerged showing Israeli security forces killing two unarmed and surrendering Palestinian men in Jenin, a city in the West Bank.

Trump was not awarded a Nobel Peace Prize this year. He is still believed to desire the award — or something similar to it.

During his Nov. 5 speech at Kaseya Center, Infantino was asked if Trump was a candidate for the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Infantino was coy in his response.

""You will see,"" Infantino said.

MORE:How the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will work

Given Trump's desire for a peace prize of his own — as well as he and Infantino's seemingly close relationship — it seems quite possible that the 79-year-old could land the honor. It will be presented at the draw for the 2026 World Cup on Dec. 4, a spectacle that will take place at the Kennedy Center, an 11-minute drive from the White House.

Trump and Infantino have a close relationship, with the former labeling their tie as ""crucial"" to facilitating the success of the 2026 World Cup. Trump has praised Infantino for his professional acumen, calling him a ""winner"" in a video that aired during the Miami draw for the Club World Cup, per NBC 4 Washington. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in law, Jared Kushner, watched on in attendance during the event.

Infantino celebrated Trump's return to the presidential office, visited him at Mar-a-Lago, his South Florida club, and attended Trump's presidential inauguration. As previously mentioned, he also called for Trump to take home the Nobel Peace Prize for his policy in the Middle East.

MORE:Teams and pots for the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw

FIFA's offices are located in Trump Tower, and Infantino even suggested the idea of Trump doing the World Cup draw himself.

“Just like a great opera, there will be high drama,” Andrew Giuliani, the executive director of the White House task force, said.

In 2020, Infantino called Trump ""my great friend."" He was summarily given an invitation to the signing of the Abraham Accords — an event that saw several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates and Morocco, normalize relations with Israel.

Per NBC 4 Washington, Infantino has made more public appearances with Trump than any other soccer official from Europe or South America. He appeared at the White House on Aug. 22, handing Trump a replica World Cup trophy — much to the surprise of some fellow soccer figures.

All of that is to say, Trump and Infantino aren't merely professional allies. They're friends, too.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","World Cup 2026 draw: Arsene Wenger's promise and decision that could cost UK millions","https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/world-cup-2026-draw-arsene-36351510","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:17:00 GMT","

Arsene Wenger promised the World Cup will live up to the billing as the greatest show on earth.

Wenger, now FIFA's Chief of Global Football Development, made the pledge to ensure football's world governing body would ensure next summer is a spectacular success. Former Arsenal boss Wenger spoke passionately at last summer's Club World Cup which almost became a dress rehearsal for the main event next June and July.

FIFA have grand plans for the 2026 World Cup. Wenger acknowledged the pitches “were not perfect” and that is a sentiment which was echoed by Chelsea captain Reece James who of course led his side to success in the tournament. Temperatures were a major factor as players and players' unions insisted games should not be played in sweltering heat.

Wenger is an ideal figurehead for FIFA because the Frenchman was, as a club manager, not backwards in coming forwards when it came to criticism about international football and major tournaments. Now he is one of the main characters making sure it goes well.

In fairness to FIFA, they have listened and while kick-off times have yet to be confirmed, that is clearly part of the reason why this draw has almost become a two day event.

England and Scotland will discover their Group opponents on Friday at the main draw while the teams in the play-offs - which include Northern Ireland and Wales - have also been asked to attend. Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel will attend coaches work shops across two days of meetings in Washington when they are likely to agree 26-player squads for the 48-team tournament - which is obviously an extra round of games than in 2022.

Furthermore, kick-off times and venues - for the tournament which starts on June 11 - will be a big talking point among the managers. Tuchel has already admitted that he wants games to start later, even if it means they are played in the early hours rather than prime time European slots.

That will not go down well with fans back home and could cost pubs and clubs millions in lost revenues if games kick-off well beyond midnight as they did at the Club World Cup. But the major European teams are likely to get a mix of prime time slots and later kick-off times to give everyone a share.

The United States boasts “indoor stadiums” which can host games under a roof with full air conditioning and the stadium in Atlanta is a spectacular example. Los Angeles and Dallas have similar stadiums and facilities while the final on July 19 is expected to kick off at 3pm local in the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey which is 8pm UK.

But the draw goes into extra time on Saturday because while the nations will discover their opponents on Friday, they will only get their full match schedule, dates and venues 24 hours later.

That is clearly to cope with a more demanding agenda and the TV companies will also be anxiously waiting on England's opponents.

England could get Scotland and because of the way the pots are drawn in order it means that statistically teams in pots two and three stand a higher chance of being paired with a top seed than the UEFA play-off qualifiers which could include Wales or Northern Ireland.

Norway could be a dark horse and it was interesting that Erling Haaland, their global superstar, will be represented in Washington as his dad, Alfie, flew out to the US on Wednesday.

The old TV tradition of tossing a coin to see who gets first pick on England games still exists and that will be down to the BBC and ITV to choose. There is always some poker going on as to whether to choose an extra Group match or wait for the knock-out phases.

The draw will also feature US president Donald Trump and, judging by his exploits when Chelsea received the trophy at the Club World Cup, he will want to take centre stage.

The Pots are as follows:

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia.

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European playoff teams, two intercontinental playoff teams.

Teams will be drawn into their Groups but we will not the full schedule until Saturday when FIFA are hosting another glitzy event to reveal the stadiums, kick-off times and venues. So, England will know who they play after Friday's draw.

But the FIFA World Cup wall chart spells it out clearly: matches rather than teams will be assigned to stadium venues. We will only know for absolutely certain where England will play after Saturday's announcement which is due to be presented from 6pm.

England's dream ticket would be drawn into Group J because that would mean they could potentially play two matches in Kansas City - and that is the location of their preferred World Cup training base

The venues are split into Western Regions - Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles - and Central Regions - Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City - and finally Eastern (Atlanta, Miami, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, New York/New Jersey.

For the first time ever, the draw will be split like tennis seedings to keep the top four apart until the semi finals (as long as they win their Groups, of course).

That means top four seeds Spain, Argentina, France and England are on course to meet in the semis rather like in the days of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.

England will have a warm-up base - using Inter Miami's facilities - in Florida where they will also play two warm-up games They will have to submit their preferred option for training base by January 10

World Cup tickets go on sale from December 11.

The sporting eyes of the world will descend upon the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Friday for the first-ever 48-team FIFA World Cup draw.

The draw will determine the 12 groups of four teams that will make up the tournament, and provide pathways and schedules for the 42 countries that have already qualified. The remaining six will seal their place via March's UEFA and inter-confederation playoffs.

On Wednesday, FIFA unveiled the presenters who will feature in the draw, as well as those responsible for picking the balls from the respective pots for teams and groups. 

Former England international and Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand will conduct the draw, assisted by Samantha Johnson, who serves as co-host. Former NFL star Eli Manning will host the red carpet in the lead-up to the event, where President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are expected. 

While those three will lead the draw, they will be joined by draw assistants who will select the teams from the pots. 

Among them are legends within North America's major sports, including the NHL's all-time points leader, Wayne Gretzky, as well as seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, seven-time MLB All-Star Aaron Judge, and four-time NBA champion, Shaquille O'Neal.

“To conduct this historic draw is an unbelievable honour,” Ferdinand said in a statement. “As a player, I lived for these global stages; now I'm humbled to play a different, special role together with an incredible line-up to reveal the 12 groups of four teams that the whole world is waiting for.”

Between Gretzky, Brady and O'Neal, the trio shares 15 championships through their stellar careers, while Judge has yet to win a World Series title with the New York Yankees. 

“Soccer has a unique power to unite people from all over the world and create a positive impact, and I cannot wait to see this happening in North America next year and beyond, when we host the biggest-ever FIFA World Cup,” Gretzky said.

“I'm thrilled to be part of the draw that will decide the fate of the participating teams – and stir emotions across the world. This will be an unforgettable moment for me personally.”

In addition to the draw, Friday's event will see several hosts and entertainers, with Kevin Hart, Heidi Klum and Danny Ramirez hosting the proceedings. 

Klum was previously involved in the 2006 World Cup draw for the tournament in Germany, where Italy prevailed as champions. Meanwhile, other entertainment will include opera singer Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams. Nicole Scherzinger, and a performance of Y.M.C.A by the Village People, a song now synonymous with President Trump. 

The 2026 World Cup will kick off in Mexico on June 11, with Canada and the USMNT hosting their opening matches on June 12 in Toronto and Los Angeles.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature custom-made Superior Player of the Match trophies for each of the 104 games in next year's tournament.

With the help of Michelob Ultra and FIFA, trophy creator Victor Solomon will have his handmade trophies, first revealed on Thursday's ""Fox & Friends,"" given to the stars of each match.

""No bulls---, this team and this opportunity has been one of the funnest creative collaborations I've ever had,"" Solomon said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""We'll have a partner that will come in and say, ‘All right, we have to have this, we have to have this, and this is what we want to look like. Here's a boat board, a bunch of things that it needs to look like.' I think with what we had done with the [NBA] championship bottle previously, I think maybe I had a little equity with the team, but Michelob Ultra came up to me and said, ‘whatever you want to do.' And they really sort of gave me the creative flexibility and freedom to explore what would be a relevant object for this honor.""

Solomon has created numerous trophies in the past, including the Larry O'Brien Trophy given to the NBA champions. For this past NBA Finals, he also designed championship Michelob Ultra bottles that were given to the Oklahoma City Thunder to celebrate with in the locker room.

""I have had the distinct privilege of being a part of such milestones in sports on the basketball side, and I think my partnership with Michelob Ultra was so fun for both sides in reimagining the championship bottle. I think everyone was just kind of like, ‘This was so great, we had such a fun time working together, let's just run it back. And oh, by the way, it's going to be on like the biggest, most craziest international stage of all time,'' Solomon said. ""So it's been a blast working with the team again to consider this honor and think about how we can elevate it for such an exciting moment.""

The trophy features an hourglass shape similar to the World Cup trophy, as well as a 26-degree slope on top to represent the year of the tournament. There are also 104 facets, representing the number of matches in the tournament.

Each ""Superior Player of the Match"" for all 104 World Cup matches will be awarded this trophy. (Michelob Ultra)

Solomon wanted to have the slope in the trophy for one very specific reason.

""We've heard from every player in every sport, all the players want cups where they can have the moment of being in the locker room and take drinks out of it,"" Solomon said. 

So, expect some Michelob Ultras to be drank out of the trophy. But Solomon said that it is a way for the athletes and fans watching at home to have some sort of similarity.

""Guys like you and me, when we're done with our day, we might crack a Michelob Ultra, that's our trophy for the day. 'I f---ing earned this s---. I'm going to unwind a little bit.' So as we were looking at the formal approach of this trophy, we loved the idea of it being something that had the functionality to be drank out of if someone wanted to go down that road, just to sort of symbolize the parallel between the fans at home that are watching this, and they're having their own sort of trophy experience with Michelob Ultra and then what Michelob Ultra is owning with their player at the end of the match, they get to crown their achievement too. So that was a very big part of it,"" Solomon said.

And just like celebrating with a beer, Solomon recognizes the hard work that comes with it.

""When I talk to partners and I talk to leagues, I try to make sure that they understand these guys dedicated their lives in pursuit of this moment,"" he said. ""The object that represents getting to the mountaintop of this experience needs to be as innovative and creative and thoughtful as the players that are in pursuit of them. So having a partner like Michelob Ultra and FIFA that really understood it had sort of appetite for that story to be told was really an exciting part of this process, too.""

More than seven years after the FIFA Men's World Cup 2026 was awarded to a joint bid of the United States, Mexico and Canada, and three years after learning Seattle would be a host city, the two most important days for the tournament to date are finally here.

We're finally going to learn the groups for the first 48-team World Cup. And, more important locally, what the matchups will be for the games taking place in Seattle next June and July.

All that information will come over the span of about 26 hours beginning Friday morning when the World Cup draw is held in Washington. Beginning at 9 a.m. PT, the draw will set the 12 groups of four teams that will compete in the tournament next June and July.

That's step one in what FIFA has turned into a two-part process.

The biggest piece of information most are seeking won't come until Saturday morning when FIFA formally announces the finalized match schedule. That announcement will provide the info on what matches are being played in what cities and at what times.

The decision to wait a day before setting the match schedule is a change from the past when days and locations for specific group stage matches were predetermined.

FIFA said the wait in announcing the match schedule 24 hours after the draw is an attempt at creating a schedule that allows for fans in the home countries around the world to be able to watch games at the best possible time.

Locally, the wait in setting the schedule may have less to do with the teams that end up playing here and more with the potential kickoff times.

For example, putting a game involving premier European team in Seattle probably would need to be in the afternoon as it would line up nicely for the rest of North America and be a prime time event in most of Europe that is eight or nine hours ahead.

But let's say it's a match involving a top Asian country that is played here. That would be better suited for an evening start time as that would be the middle of the day — the next day — back home.

What is already set and won't change is the groups the matches will come from to be played at Lumen Field — or Seattle Stadium as it will be known for the tournament.

The letters G, D and B are the ones to pay attention to when the draw begins.

Two of the group stage matches played in Seattle will be from Group G — the first on June 15 the other on June 26. One match will be from Group D and feature the United States on June 19. The other will be on June 24 and feature a matchup from Group B — the group including Canada. But that game won't feature the Canadians as they are already scheduled to play up the road in Vancouver, B.C. on the same day.

All other matches from Group G are being played in Los Angeles or Vancouver. The rest of Group B is being contested in San Francisco and L.A. — with the exception of Canada's opening match in Toronto. The group including the U.S. will play all their matches entirely on the West Coast.

Here's the rundown of the matches scheduled for Seattle:

Monday, June 15 — Group G match

Friday, June 19 — Group D match: United States vs. TBD

Wednesday, June 24 — Group B match

Friday, June 26 — Group G match

Wednesday, July 1 — Round of 32 match: Group G winner vs. 3rd place from Group A/E/H/I/J

Monday, July 6 — Round of 16 match.

The only two venues for the World Cup closer in proximity than Lumen Field and BC Place are Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia and MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

In other words, it'll be worth keeping an eye on how the draw plays out for matches in Vancouver as there could be some opportunity for fans interested in seeing the matches just across the border. And perhaps some better matchups.

Here's the current schedule for the matches in Vancouver:

Saturday, June 13 — Group D match

Thursday, June 18 — Group B match — Canada vs. TBD

Sunday, June 21 — Group G match

Wednesday, June 24 — Group B match: Canada vs. TBD

Friday, June 26 — Group G match

Thursday, July 2 — Round of 32 match: Group B winner vs. 3rd place Group E/F/G/I/J

Tuesday, July 7 — Round of 16 match

Do you like exorbitant production, a host of celebrities and athletes standing behind fishbowls trying to open small balls containing country names, and an event that could be wrapped up in about 20 minutes but takes two hours? Welcome to the World Cup draw.

At least the process should — should — run better than most CONCACAF events.

All countries have been put into four pots in line with their current world rankings. The exceptions are the three host countries: Mexico is in Group A; Canada in Group B; U.S. in Group D.

The rest of the pots are broken down as such:

Pot 1 — Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

Pot 2 — Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia.

Pot 3 — Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.

Pot 4 — Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2.

Every group will have one team drawn from each pot. There are rules, though. Every pot must have at least one team from UEFA (the European federation), but no more than two. Other rules keep other confederations from having multiple teams in a group. For example, the U.S. and Haiti won't be in the same group as both are part of CONCACAF.

Pot 4 is littered with potential land mines because of the teams that are still competing in the European playoffs that will take place next March.

Only four of the 16 teams competing in the European playoffs will advance to the World Cup. But that group competing includes Italy (No. 12 in the world rankings), Denmark (No. 21), Turkey (No. 25), Ukraine (No. 28), Poland (No. 31), Wales (No. 32), Sweden (No. 43) and Czechia (No. 44).

If you're Spain, how would you like a group that includes Colombia, Egypt and Italy? If you're the U.S., a group of Japan, Norway and Denmark would seem suboptimal. The fact that all four of the European playoff qualifiers were placed in Pot 4 provides some major intrigue to the draw.

Some of those teams are going to qualify. Some of those teams are going to make for some nightmare groups. There might not be a “Group of Death” as there have been with past World Cup's thanks to the expansion of the tournament to 48 teams with 32 of those advancing to the knockout rounds. But there are going to be some groups where it could be tough for a third-place team with some expectations to advance.

When Wrexham lost 3-1 at home to Queens Park Rangers on September 13, they were 21st in the 24-team Championship, with just four points from their opening five games. It felt like a brutal reality check for fans dreaming of promotion to the Premier League just two years after getting out of the National League. Manager Phil Parkinson refused to panic, though. 

""If the set-up's not right in our defensive shape, those five yards away from where you need to be as a team, then we're going to get punished with that bit of extra quality. That is the difference at this level and we know that,"" Parkinson told reporters.  ""But we've changed the squad around completely and there was always going to be a period at the start where it doesn't go completely as you'd want it."" 

Luckily for Parkinson, his plea for patience did not fall on deaf ears and now, less than three months on from that chastening loss at the Racehorse Ground, Wrexham's remarkable bid for a fourth consecutive promotion is very much back on track.

The Championship is a notoriously competitive and unforgiving league. More than half of the 30 teams promoted to England's second tier over the past 10 years have gone back down inside two seasons.

So, while Hollywood duo Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds had pumped millions into the club since taking over in 2021, they were acutely aware that even greater investment would be required just to survive in the Championship, resulting in a record-breaking outlay of £40 million ($53m) on 13 players.

Wrexham's net spend raised eyebrows - and expectations - but chief executive Michael Williamson was at pains to point out that there were mitigating circumstances on account of their unique situation.

""[The net spend was high] because it wasn't offset by any player sales - unlike a club who's in the Championship already or a club that's been in the Premier League that gets relegated to the Championship,"" he told The Leader. ""They're able to do that kind of squad change as a result of being able to sell players along the way. Or they rely on their academy players and they sell their academy players to fund some of the transfer market.

""We don't have the foundations for that within the academy, that pipeline of players, and we had three consecutive promotions, so we had to invest in the squad to be competitive.""

Nonetheless, it initially looked like a case of too much, too soon for Wrexham, who struggled to keep clean sheets and, consequently, win games during the first two months of the season.

However, after a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Stoke City on October 18 that left the Red Dragons 18th in the Championship standings, they've now risen to 10th on the back of an eight-game undefeated run featuring five shut-outs. Indeed, Andri Gudjohnsen's early strike in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Blackburn Rovers at the Racehorse Ground was the first goal Wrexham had conceded in 375 minutes of league football.

For Parkinson, the improved defensive record was all down to his players understanding the importance of the fundamentals in football, revealing that he'd used struggling Liverpool as a case in point while addressing his team before last week's win over Bristol City.

""I was listening to Virgil van Dijk's interview after the Nottingham Forest defeat,"" the 58-year-old Englishman explained, ""and he was speaking about how Liverpool have got to win the first and second balls, be competitive, work as a team and how they've got to get their way back by doing the basics in football. And that's the champions of England talking like that!

""But we had spoken about the same things early in the season: football is about making sure you're threatening at one end but also secure when you're attacking, and I think we've got a lot better at that as the season has gone on.""

Parkinson also feels that Max Cleworth's 95th-minute equaliser in Saturday's draw with Blackburn proves that Wrexham have recovered the relentlessness and never-say-die attitude that characterised their astounding ascent to the Championship.

""It's good for the lads who have come and joined us to see that we keep going right until the end here,"" Parkinson enthused after his 200th game in charge of the Welsh outfit. ""Time and time again, we've scored late equalisers or winners, and we've done it again today. The crowd could sense a goal was coming, too.""

The belief is certainly back among the fans, who, Parkinson feels, are feeding off the increase in energy they're seeing on the pitch.

""I think the atmosphere now and the feeling in the stadium is what we were used to in previous years,"" he said. ""In those early games this season, we didn't quite create that intensity in our play. We had some really good periods in all those games but we got punished in key moments.

""But we've always spoken about making this place difficult for the opposition to play and I think we've got it back where we need it to be. We've got to keep it there now and that comes with the supporters obviously playing their part, but also the manner of the performance, the physicality.""

The home form has certainly been integral to Wrexham's revival. They've not lost a league game at the Racecourse Ground since that defeat to QPR, while they're still the only team to have beaten runaway Championship leaders Coventry City so far this season. 

""As a team, it probably took a little bit of time to gel and that happens with the amount of changes that were made in the summer and you lose players and new lads come in,"" Cleworth said. ""It's hard to gel straight away, but I think we're certainly doing that now. We've tightened things up and we're really dangerous going forward.

""And it's massive for us, that home form and having the fans behind us week-in week-out when we play. I think if we can keep that fiery atmosphere going, it's hard for teams to come here and get anything.

""No matter who plays, lads who come off the bench, we've got quality all over the pitch so we're always a threat to teams and it's important that we've managed to get on a decent run. Hopefully we can continue it and with a few more runs like this, we could be potentially fighting for promotion.""

It's certainly possible at this point of the season.

As it stands, Wrexham are just three points off sixth-placed Bristol City in the final play-off spot, and are going into massive games against Preston North End (fifth) and Hull City (ninth) high on confidence.

Encouragingly, Cleworth says the players are keeping their feet on the ground. ""The Championship's infamous for anyone beating anyone,"" the academy product acknowledged. ""So, we won't get carried away with ourselves. It only takes a few losses in this league to bring you straight back to reality, so we'll just focus on the next game and then the game after that and see where we end up.""

It's also worth pointing out that the Championship is a long, hard slog and we're only 18 games into a 46-game season, so there really is a long way to go. Wrexham are undoubtedly improving, though, while Williamson says their primary aim for the 2025-26 campaign has already been achieved.

""The objective was to be competitive and to show that we could go toe-to-toe with any club in the Championship and so far this season, that's what you've seen,"" the former Inter director said. ""I actually think we could definitely be higher in the table than we are today, but the important part is that we've shown that it doesn't matter which club we're playing against in this league, we can take on anyone and come out on top.

""From my perspective now, the question is: how do we build on and off the pitch to prepare ourselves for when we do arrive in the Premier League? Ultimately, that's our objective, and I think everyone is clear on that by now.""

It has been argued that Wrexham would be better off missing out on promotion this season, that they'd benefit from another year in the Championship, as it would essentially allow the rest of the club to catch up with the remarkably rapid progress being made by the players on the pitch.

As former Liverpool chief executive officer Peter Moore, who provides strategic guidance to the Wrexham board, recently told the World Football Summit in Madrid: ""There is a risk [of growing too fast] in that you have to keep up financially and the stadium is too small. If you're going to keep up economically, your gameday revenues are critical and a 12,000 capacity doesn't cut it.""

Work is already under way on the construction of a new, all-seater Kop stand and could be completed next year, but it feels significant that McElhenney is not putting Parkinson under pressure to secure promotion as soon as possible, insisting that both and Reynolds are still thinking long-term.

""We don't want to build something that's unsustainable,"" the American said. ""As glorious as it might be to be promoted to the Premier League, it would be equally as tragic to be relegated again, because that can very quickly create that spiral downwards.

""Is the ultimate goal the Premier League? Yes, of course. Is it winning the Premier League? Yes, of course. But that actually isn't the number one goal. The number one goal is building something for the next generation and leaving something behind that is sustainable for the rest of its existence.

""So, we're going to do it [reach the Premier League] in the same way that we've been doing it from day one, which is asking the town. I sort of jumped the gun early on and just assumed that that's what the people of the town wanted for their club, and that that wasn't necessarily the case. I had a lot of very long conversations with people that said, 'Well, we might not be ready for that. The town might not be ready for that and the club might not be ready for that.'

""We have to make sure that we're always checking in with the community to make sure that this is what they want. But it was a crazy pipe dream four or five years ago where we got laughed at by the media and by the world, but I don't think anybody's laughing anymore.""

Indeed, two of Hollywood's most famous funnymen are deadly serious about getting Wrexham into the Premier League - and it arguably doesn't matter if they realise that goal this season or not. What's clearly most important to McElhenney and Reynolds is that when they do reach the peak of professional football in England, they're sufficiently equipped to stay there.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Has Jude Bellingham been ‘put off playing in the Premier League'? English clubs get transfer warning as Shaun Wright-Phillips backs dad Ian's comments on Real Madrid superstar","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/jude-bellingham-put-off-premier-league-transfer-warning-shaun-wright-phillips-real-madrid/blt5b475fa379ef5d99","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:11:37 GMT","

Jude Bellingham's treatment with the England national team may have put him off “from playing in the Premier League”, claims ex-Manchester City, Chelsea and Three Lions star Shaun Wright-Phillips. Bellingham has seen some of his behaviour questioned by those in his homeland, which could lead to the Real Madrid midfielder shunning a future return to his roots.

Bellingham stepped out of his comfort zone when leaving boyhood club Birmingham for German giants Borussia Dortmund in 2020. He is now a ‘Galactico' at Santiago Bernabeu with La Liga and Champions League titles to his name.

The 22-year-old has also earned 46 senior caps for his country, becoming a talismanic presence for England, but continues to attract criticism for supposed character flaws - with Thomas Tuchel having previously admitted that his mother finds some of Bellingham's on-field antics “repulsive”.

While some have been quick to knock Bellingham down, others continue to talk him up. Arsenal legend Ian Wright sits in that camp, with the former England striker claiming that some people are not “ready for a black superstar” before going on to say that Bellingham's potential “frightens these people because of his capability and the inspiration he can give”.

Wright-Phillips stands by those comments from his father and admits that a global superstar may start to ask questions of whether he ever wants to play club football in his homeland again.

The Premier League title winner told BestBettingSites: “If I was Jude Bellingham, I think it could put me off from playing in the Premier League, definitely. In England we seem to target a player ahead of a big tournament, like they're dying to break one of them down.

“I've just never understood why. You want your players going into a tournament full of confidence. Arrogant, almost. You want them knowing and thinking they can win. The press should big them up, help them, not tear them down like this. The press causes problems and puts doubts in their head, and changes the way they think.

“I think if you change a player's personality, you change how they play. That's not always good. Far from it. I think the players need to just concentrate on what they're doing. So if I was Jude, why would I come back when I can stay at Real Madrid and enjoy life at the same time, without bad press that comes for no reason.

“I think he's the go-to man for England, and I sometimes do not understand why he is in the crosshairs. He's not perfect, but he's performing well for club and country. It's not like he has some huge arrogant attitude, or plays badly. They should leave him be and let him prepare mentally.”

Amid reports of Bellingham potentially being left out of England's 2026 World Cup squad, Wright-Phillips added on the problem that Tuchel faces when it comes to getting so many creative talents into his team: “My approach would be first of all to tell the players that this is England, so there's no shame around being a substitute for the team at the World Cup. It's about getting the best team out on the pitch, not necessarily all your best players.

“I feel like England miss a maverick at the moment. They need a creative No.10, someone who creates something from nothing, and the closest to that is Cole Palmer. Then I'd pick two wingers, maybe [Marcus] Rashford, [Jarrod] Bowen or [Bukayo] Saka.

“But if not Palmer, then [Phil] Foden and [Morgan] Rogers are great options. At eight, you have Bellingham and then Declan Rice at six, with Elliot Anderson ready to come in for him. Bellingham has the running power, as does Declan, so they can both be up and down on the pitch. Then you have your players ahead of those two to just terrorise the opposition. You need a back four who can stop the counters. England have so much potential. I don't think it matters too much whether it's Foden or Palmer in that role, as long as the team is set up properly.”

England, with Bellingham still very much part of the fold for now, will discover their initial 2026 World Cup opponents when the group stage draw takes place on Friday - with Tuchel preparing to piece together plans for another shot at global glory.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi has lifted the lid on a shock ""childhood dream"" that was scotched by his Barcelona debut. Messi's life pivoted sharply when Barcelona chose to take a chance on him at a moment when Argentine clubs, including giants River Plate, backed away from the cost of treating his growth hormone condition. 

Signed on 14 December 2000, the napkin has become one of the most iconic artefacts in football. The blue-ink message, hastily scribbled by Barça sporting director Carles Rexach, carried a personal commitment to sign a 13-year-old Messi ""regardless of any dissenting opinions."" Alongside Rexach's name were those of transfer advisor Josep Minguella and agent Horacio Gaggioli, men who had championed Messi's potential when others hesitated. The napkin emerged amid growing anxiety from the Messi family. After his trial, weeks drifted by with little communication from Barca. As Christmas approached in 2000, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid hovered as possible alternatives. Messi's father, Jorge, feared the moment would pass. Rexach, aware the club were close to losing a generational talent, invited Jorge Messi to lunch, and, lacking an official document, wrote the pledge on the only material available. Messi was officially signed a month later, and history took its course.

Translated into English, it reads: ""In Barcelona, on 14 December 2000 and in the presence of Messrs Minguella and Horacio, Carles Rexach, FC Barcelona's sporting director, hereby agrees, under his responsibility and regardless of any dissenting opinions, to sign the player Lionel Messi, provided that we keep to the amounts agreed upon.""

Messi's Barcelona debut followed three years later, on 16 November 2003, in a friendly against Porto. Frank Rijkaard introduced the 16-year-old in the 71st minute. Even then, whispers circled La Masia suggesting that the teenager from Rosario possessed a talent beyond comparison, though few could predict the scale of what would unfold. His competitive first-team bow came the following year on 16 October, in a La Liga fixture against Espanyol. At 17 years, three months and 22 days, he became Barcelona's youngest-ever representative in official competition. The dream of playing for Newell's faded in that moment, but a new reality began.

In an interview with ESPN, Messi has now said: ""I always say that my childhood dream was to play for Newell's first team. I'd go to the stadium, I played there, and I dreamed of becoming a professional in Primera. Then my life changed completely because I left at 13, debuted for Barcelona, and everything that happened afterward. It's something I never would've imagined, not even in my best dreams. I lived things much bigger than anything I could have dreamed of.""

Messi would go on to score 672 goals in 778 games for Barcelona, win 10 La Liga titles, lift four Champions Leagues, and establish an era-defining legacy before leaving for Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. Hence, despite the romanticism attached to a homecoming, Messi never managed to fulfil that childhood wish. When he left PSG, the option was emotionally appealing but professionally unworkable as Inter Miami ultimately offered the stability and vision that Newell's could not. Now 38 and still guiding Argentina as they prepare to defend their World Cup crown, Messi accepts that the story of his early years remains unfinished. Whereas the same napkin was sold for an astonishing £762,400 at auction, far surpassing its £300,000 starting price.

The 2026 World Cup, spread across the United States, Canada and Mexico, looms large. Argentina, the reigning champions, are among the favourites once more and will learn their group-stage opponents when Friday's draw takes place. For Messi, the tournament represents an opportunity to win back-to-back World Cups as captain. His Newell's dream may remain untouched, but everything else, the records, the glory, has exceeded his dreams.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tadeo Allende struggled early, but his hot streak has arrived at the perfect time - and Inter Miami may need him more than ever in their push for MLS Cup.

Early in the season, Tadeo Allende kept missing chances - and he got plenty of them. The Argentine attacking midfielder, brought in by Inter Miami on loan from Celta Vigo last winter, was supposed to be the final piece in the Herons' attack. His job was straightforward: bury the opportunities that would inevitably fall his way.

And there were always going to be plenty. That's the reality of playing with Lionel Messi. When Messi gets on the ball, opponents tilt, their shape breaks, and gaps appear everywhere. The responsibility then shifts to those around him to exploit those spaces, time their runs and, ultimately, finish. Soccer is more nuanced than that - the rotations, the off-ball movements, the choreographed patterns - but at its core, Allende's remit boiled down to one thing.

The problem was that he wasn't finishing often enough. His 15 goals in all competitions looked solid on paper and even exceeded his xG, but Miami created such a high volume of chances that it always felt like there were more out there for him. Too often, he wasn't getting into the most dangerous spots, and a few big opportunities slipped away.

Now, that has changed. Allende has found his scoring touch - and at the perfect time. Miami are charging toward MLS Cup, with Messi producing at a historic postseason rate, tying the league's all-time playoff goals record with eight. But Allende has become the razor-sharp edge that completes the picture. And on Saturday, against Vancouver, the version of Allende that shows up may well determine whether Javier Mascherano's side survives or goes home.

And now, we have to talk about Inter Miami's transfer policy. It's a tiring thing to discuss, all said. Many eagle-eyed onlookers noticed that the Herons focused heavily on Argentina-born talent. Their manager, Mascherano, played with Messi. Some dubbed Miami's moves ""Messi's signings."" Leo gets what Leo wants. And there could be an element of truth there. 

One thing is for certain, though, Allende ran counter to a lot of what Miami needed. The Herons, during last year's playoffs, were undone by a lack of pace in central defense and aging legs in midfield. What they required was a center back capable of stewarding a backline and a rugged, MLS-experienced supporting cast to plug holes in the midfield. 

What they got, instead, were questionable options in defense and a Celta Vigo loanee with no MLS experience. Allende was a strange acquisition, unproven in the Spanish top flight and relatively inexperienced for a mid-table club in the Argentine league before. 

The messaging from the club was that Allende could contribute all over. 

""We're pleased to bring in attacker Tadeo Allende to further strengthen our attack. Tadeo's versatility bolsters our options up front as he can perform in different positions across the pitch. We're excited to bring him on board to help us compete in multiple competitions in 2025,"" said president of football operations Raúl Sanllehí at the time. 

Allende was a mainstay in the side from the first minute, playing, as the club had promised, in a variety of different roles. But his primary task was, like for Messi's Argentina, to put in plenty of legwork and open spaces for when their star man had the ball - and do everything to win it back when they lost it. The early returns were good enough. Allende found the back of the net in four straight, and looked a real threat in the opening stages of the season. 

But the goals soon dried up. After bagging against Charlotte on March 15, Allende went two months without finding the net. In that time, he tallied 15 shots - over two per game - and put just three of them on target. His chances were all pretty good ones, too, shots from close range - often from Messi feeds. In effect, Allende was asked to apply a finishing touch. And he wasn't doing it. 

Still, he was good enough off the ball to justify his inclusion, and the mere fact that he chipped in here and there with a goal made him a worthy addition. He started all but six of Miami's regular season games in all competitions, and scored a crucial goal against Palmeiras in the Club World Cup.

As for Miami, things were a little mixed. The Herons probably reached par as a team, losing to a superior side in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, finishing third in the Eastern Conference, and getting bounced from the Club World Cup by Champions League winners PSG. And, to be clear, Allende was not the problem for the Herons. Defense was a clear issue. But Miami didn't lose a single game in which he scored. 

It couldn't be ignored: when Allende was finding the net, good things were happening.

In the playoffs, though, something has clicked. Somehow, Allende has become lethal. He has scored eight thus far in the postseason and seven in his last three games. He's not missing tap-ins, skewing headers, or making silly mistakes. His hat-trick that carried Miami past NYCFC in the Eastern Conference Finals was a truly wonderful thing, three excellent finishes to cap off a fine performance. 

The third goal simply had Mascherano laughing. Yannick Bright provided the pass in behind. Allende timed his run perfectly, beat the defender for pace, and, with time to think, consider the angles, measure his shot, and contemplate all of the ways he could miss, he unleashed a delightful chip that floated over NYCFC goalkeeper Matt Freese and into the back of the net. It was the finish of a seasoned striker and a player operating with total confidence in his own abilities.

Mascherano suggested it was all about confidence: 

""There's nothing stronger in soccer than a player's conviction. When your players are convinced where to go and which road… tactics don't exist anymore, nothing else exists. For me, is about joining them in that conviction and make the less mistakes,"" he said after the win. 

Messi, historically, has needed a running mate. These things usually just happen, in truth. At Barcelona, he was surrounded by elite attacking talent everywhere: Neymar, Thierry Henry, Suarez, David Villa - to name a few. At PSG, he had Kylian Mbappe. For Argentina, various superstars have come and gone. 

This isn't necessarily American sports where a single superstar can be entirely shut down. You can't ever really guard Messi out of a game. But he does need help. Last year, that was Suarez, who was truly excellent in his maiden MLS campaign. This season, though, his form has dropped. Suarez isn't ineffective altogether, but his goal return has plummeted, and he, like Allende, was missing chances for fun at times. Miami, then, needed someone to step up at the right time. 

And more broadly, that's the role that Allende has fulfilled with aplomb. He is the clinical No. 2 at the moment, the reliable guy to make things happen when Messi is otherwise occupied. And perhaps more importantly, he's the guy that Messi trusts enough to give the ball to. With Suarez slumping, that could be invaluable.

And so we arrive at Saturday. It will be an interesting one for Mascherano. Messi is a guaranteed starter, of course, and the one that Miami will indeed count on to provide - especially against a Vancouver defense that has looked a little leaky at times in the playoffs. 

But getting the configuration around him right will be a real challenge. Suarez hasn't started the last two, with the 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti entrusted in his place instead. It has allowed Messi to drop into a deeper False 9 sort of role, and given Allende more freedom to run. To be sure, Allende and Suarez can play at the same time. Miami can also win with Suarez on the pitch. But the winning system, of late, has been the one in which the Uruguayan legend doesn't feature from the get-go. 

Without him, Miami are better. That much is clear. But Allende also needs to produce. There will be spaces and opportunities, moments and chances. And Allende, Messi's ruthless running mate, will have to take them. If he does, then a first MLS Cup could well be coming to the South Beach area.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Never go back! Harry Kane gets ‘is it the same' transfer advice as Tottenham return ruled out for ‘legend' that may leave Bayern Munich for ‘somewhere else in Europe'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/harry-kane-transfer-advice-tottenham-return-bayern-munich-somewhere-else-europe/bltc1ee7ed6bbed5cc2","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 11:07:26 GMT","

Harry Kane has been offered “is it the same” advice as a 2026 transfer for the prolific England international striker continues to be mooted. Ex-Tottenham star Stephen Carr has been discussing future plans for the Bayern Munich talisman, with GOAL being told why a stunning return to Spurs is unlikely but a switch to “somewhere else in Europe” could happen.

It has been revealed that Kane has a clause in his contract at the Allianz Arena which can be triggered in upcoming windows. If a bid of £57 million ($76m) is tabled, then the 32-year-old frontman will be allowed to enter into talks with interested parties.

Tottenham have the option of matching any offers, having stipulated as much when sanctioning the sale of their all-time leading goalscorer in 2023, and would love to welcome a home-grown icon back to familiar surroundings in north London after seeing him break his trophy duck in Germany.

Kane is, however, happy at Bayern and has been linked with other heavyweight outfits such as Barcelona and Real Madrid. With that in mind, a retracing of steps to the Premier League is not considered to be a top priority.

Quizzed on whether Kane will ever don a Spurs jersey again, Carr - speaking with Casino.org, where you can review online gambling - told GOAL: “I'm not sure. He's having unbelievable success in Germany. He's a goalscorer and will score goals wherever he goes.

“I'm sure he will have other offers. He has the buyout and do Tottenham have first refusal? Is it ever the same when a player comes back again? Not really. The team he left, he had a great relationship with him and [Heung-min] Son playing together - that worked really well. It would be a completely different team that he came back to if that evolved. I think he will have offers from big clubs if he wants to move on. He has proven that he just scores goals. He's phenomenal.”

Football folklore dictates that you should “never go back”, with Kane aware that a return to Tottenham - if things did not work out as planned - could lead to his legacy being tarnished somewhat. That will be factored into his thinking.

He will also be turning 33 next summer, with Spurs likely favouring more long-term solutions. Carr added on what happens next for a fan favourite at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium: “He left and even the fans in the end understood that he needed to leave in order to win something. He deserved to win something, which he has now. I'm sure he will win more this year.

“He had unbelievable success there [Spurs], is a legend there, and I think he is still looked at like that. He scores goals regardless but whether he would have that same success, I don't know. It would be great if he did go back, but I think he will be looking at it differently. After leaving Tottenham, giving up on the English goal record - he would have caught [Alan] Shearer the way he was going - he's not going to get younger, he does adjust his game, but I get the feeling he will stay there or go somewhere else in Europe. He might want another challenge, rather than going back to Tottenham.”

Kane has offered no indication that he is considering a change of scenery, having spoken on a regular basis of how happy he and his family - including wife Kate - are in Bavaria. He is tied to a contract through to 2027 that may yet be extended.

Bayern are understandably reluctant to part with their free-scoring No.9. They have seen Kane register 110 goals through 117 appearances - winning back-to-back Golden Boots. He became a Bundesliga title winner last season and is ready to chase down more major honours in 2026 - including the World Cup crown as captain and record-shattering all-time leading marksman of the England national team.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAT mentality explained by Portugal boss Roberto Martinez that has aided CR7's longevity","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-special-goat-mentality-portugal-roberto-martinez-cr7-longevity/blteb8722b7b06ee7e6","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:43:39 GMT","

Roberto Martinez has revealed what makes Cristiano Ronaldo special, with Portugal's national team boss explaining the GOAT mentality that has allowed CR7 to break all kinds of records. The legendary forward is still going strong at 40 years of age, with Adebayo Akinfenwa's ‘Beast Mode On' podcast being informed of why a unique character has been able to enjoy such longevity.

Ronaldo has spent more than two decades at the peak of his powers, with a remarkable international career seeing him collect 226 caps while registering 143 goals. He has been locked in a relentless battle for recognition and major prizes with eternal rival Lionel Messi, with that competition helping to bring the best out of both.

There is no sign of Ronaldo slowing down, with a new contract through to 2027 being signed in the Saudi Pro League with Al-Nassr. He is determined to reach 1,000 competitive goals and will captain his country when gracing a sixth World Cup finals in 2026.

Ronaldo has raised the bar of individual brilliance to a height that few will ever get close to reaching, with iconic spells being taken in at Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. He is one of a kind, with unwavering belief and determination having carried him to the very top.

Quizzed on what sets Ronaldo apart, Martinez told Beast Mode On: “For me, without doubt, it is because his success doesn't change his commitment to the next thing. When you win something, the next day there is less hunger. Cristiano is a person, is a player that whatever happens yesterday doesn't affect what he does today.

“I don't know if it's genetic, if you can work on it, this is the reality. He has got this incredible need to use every day to be the best that he can. That could be in terms of recovering, the training, finishing, whatever aspect that he feels he needs to work on. He is not going to leave anything that he can affect and become better. It doesn't matter if he scores a hat-trick or he doesn't score and missed three chances, his preparation as soon as the final whistle goes will always be methodical and perfectly preparing for the next day. That's something that has given him longevity.

“I always said that the footballer was retiring when the body was telling the brain ‘Look, I'm finished'. With Cristiano, I have learned it's not like that. It's the brain that tells the body it's time to finish. He has got this capacity of wanting to be the best every day that he is involved in sport. I have never seen that hunger ever before at the same level.”

Martinez currently boasts the honour of working with Ronaldo. Asked what that is like and whether the all-time great enjoys any special treatment, the 52-year-old Spaniard said: “First and foremost, you have to treat every player, individually, in a separate way. There are no two people that are the same.

“Obviously you have got Cristiano Ronaldo the player, that is in the dressing room and is somebody that wants to prepare in the best possible way because what he has done in his career - the longevity - is because he is meticulous, he is a winner, he is a hungry individual. You need to match that.

“What is important is always to get the expectations of every single player in the space that we are working with. Then there is another phenomenon that you cannot control - that noise. You are talking about somebody that is more than a footballer, somebody who the numbers in social media represent that he is followed well beyond football fans - you are talking about 600 million followers. He is probably the most famous individual in the world. That doesn't come along to what is our demand in the dressing room, and his demands.

“We always need to get the best of our players and you need to create an environment that he gets that. The rest you need to recognise as noise and if it doesn't affect the group internally, you need to accept it for what it is. You cannot lose time on trying to change that because it is impossible to control.”

Ronaldo is now held up as an inspiration to those around him, but knows that he still has to fight for his place. Martinez went on to say: “You always try to gather inspiration, stimulation, by people in sport that have achieved something that nobody has achieved before. He is a very clear example of that. He has got landmarks, playing over 225 games for a national team - no other has done it - his goalscoring record, what he has had many times in his career - 21 years of service in the national team - those are given examples for the players that are now sharing the dressing room.

“What is important is his commitment to the team. That is what is essential, to measure that because it gets to a point that the competition for places is the same for everybody. At the level of a national team, constantly your position is at risk.”

Ronaldo will, fitness permitting, form part of Portugal's plans at next summer's World Cup. He is a two-time UEFA Nations League winner, with a European Championship title to his name from 2016, and will be determined to emulate Messi by capturing a global crown before history-making boots are hung up for good.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd launch €28m bid for Olympiacos youngster amid rival interest from Arsenal and Real Madrid as Greek club demand €40m","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-launch-eur28m-bid-olympiacos-arsenal-real-madrid-greek-club-demand-eur40m/blt1d7a49e131dc5776","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:19:52 GMT","

Manchester United have reportedly launched a €28 million (£25m) bid for Olympiacos youngster Christos Mouzakitis. The offer, however, has been deemed far below Olympiacos' expectations, opening the door for rivals Real Madrid, Arsenal and Brighton to potentially force their way ahead. 

Mouzakitis has captured the attention of scouts across the continent after a sensational breakthrough season in Greece, one that culminated in him winning Tuttosport's Golden Boy Web Award with more than one million fan votes. The accolade placed him ahead of celebrated young names such as Arda Guler and Jobe Bellingham. Emerging from Olympiacos' academy as one of their brightest talents in a generation, Mouzakitis has combined composure on the ball with athleticism and has shown surprising defensive intelligence, which are notable qualities given that he began his football journey as a goalkeeper. 

His performances last season thrust him into the continental spotlight, as he emerged as a key figure for a team that not only excelled domestically but also broke historic ground. Alongside fellow academy star Babis Kostoulas, Mouzakitis helped deliver Olympiacos the UEFA Youth League title in 2024, the first time a Greek club had ever lifted a European trophy at youth level. That achievement was followed by Olympiacos' senior team winning the Europa Conference League months later, further fuelling international attention towards the youngster. 

According to Sport Time, United have been tracking Mouzakitis for more than a year, with club scouts alert to his potential since he began surfacing in Greece's top flight. Brighton, meanwhile, have also monitored him closely, especially after signing Kostoulas for nearly £30m ($40m) last summer. Real Madrid have likewise been proactive. Xabi Alonso, who was on the touchline overseeing Madrid during their 4-3 Champions League victory in which Mouzakitis featured for the full 90 minutes, praised the teenager's maturity beyond his years. 

That match was reportedly watched closely by representatives from United and Chelsea, reaffirming the midfielder's ability to hold his own against elite opposition. Arsenal, too, have entered the equation and are believed to be assessing their options ahead of the summer window. With Mikel Arteta reshaping his midfield dynamics, a versatile, press-resistant talent such as Mouzakitis fits the type of long-term profile the club has targeted in recent years.

While interest is overwhelming, Olympiacos are in no hurry to sell. The Greek champions are demanding a sum close to €40m (£35m/$47m) for any January move, placing the bar well beyond both Manchester United's €28m bid and Real Madrid's marginally higher offer. Sources close to Olympiacos insist the club will not entertain negotiations unless an offer surpasses €30m (£26m/$35m). The club views him as a cornerstone for the next stage of their sporting project, especially given his contract status, influence and trajectory. Mouzakitis' value continues to rise, bolstered by his seven caps for the Greek national team and his strong involvement for Olympiacos this season, where he has registered two assists in 10 league appearances and featured five times in the Champions League.

United's midfield is expected to undergo a substantial rebuild by 2026, with significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of several players. Casemiro's contract expires at the end of the season, while Bruno Fernandes is expected to strongly reassess his position at Old Trafford following the 2025-26 campaign. The club are also open to letting Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte leave in January should appropriate offers arise.

Alongside this, United have been linked with a series of midfield options like Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, among them. Mouzakitis sits high on their list, but club executives believe the most sensible window to complete a deal would be the summer of 2026, giving them time to plan a full integration strategy and avoid inflated mid-season prices.

For now, the Greek club hold all the leverage. Unless a club steps forward with a bid approaching €40m, the teenager is expected to remain in Piraeus for the foreseeable future. But with three of Europe's heavyweights circling, it will be difficult for Olympiacos to hold on to their prized asset beyond the summer of 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Each decade introduced new milestones for the FIFA World Cup. New tactical implementation and technological advancement enhanced on-field interactions. Evaluating football history commemorates past players' career peaks while forging towards a more dignified future.

13 teams participated in the 1st World Cup. The simple knockout format made competition straightforward and easier to handle.

 

This competition did not have qualifying matches. Guillermo Stabile performed the World Cup's first hat-trick.

The 1934 tournament introduced qualifying matches. The widespread popularity generated more fan interest. News stations clamored for media coverage during World Cups to ensure everyone heard about these matches worldwide.

 

West Germany won 3-2 against Hungary in the 1954 tournament. The “Miracle of Bern” happened when Helmut Rahn scored the winning goal. How's that for an underdog victory?

Before televisions, World Cup commentaries were only available on the radio. England's 1966 tournament was the first to be televised. El Salvador, Morocco, and other countries debuted during this decade. New competing nations fostered diversity within a growing global competition.

 

FIFA revamped its branding to become more notable amongst players and fans. Brazil's victory in the 1970 World Cup prompted FIFA to allow a design competition. They received 53 entries of what individuals thought the new trophy should look like.

 

Silvio Gazzaniga was an Italian artist who won the contest for his sketch showing two people holding up the Earth together. This trophy design is the same to this day probably because of its strong symbolism of conquering any challenge through teamwork and collaboration.

High pressing and compact defensive blocks became more prevalent. Players pressure opponents as close to their goal area as possible while high pressing. Athletes stay close together during compact defensive blocks.

 

The back-pass rule changed football in 1992. Goalkeepers once relied on shot-stopping to disadvantage opponents. The rule now prevents this time-wasting tactic. It also inadvertently increased high pressing and faster transitions on the field.

The World Cup transformed much quickly because of technological advances in the 2000s onward. Advanced broadcasting standards became prevalent in the 2002 World Cup.

 

Africa hosted their first World Cup in 2010. 2014's new goal-line technology distinguishes real and ghost goals. The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) (2018) has guided human referees' final decisions.

 

Women's football has increased in viewership and participation in recent years. Record-breaking attendance records are encouraging higher investment in the Women's League.

FIFA continually promotes global diversity with what they stand for. They slowly add more nations to the tournament roster, keeping it interesting for new and old players.

 

Fun Fact: 48 teams will compete in the 2026 World Cup. That's 35 more teams than the 1930 tournament.

 

Who do you think will win the 2026 tournament? Keep watching closely. You never know who could grab the victory from under another team's nose.

What do you get for the man who has everything—everything except for a winning record against his great tennis rival?

Tennis' biggest stars didn't just let their racquets do the talking in 2025. To look back on a memorable season, we're counting down some of the biggest winners in the press conference room and on the microphone—and Frances Tiafoe takes the top spot in our countdown for the stinging one-liner he delivered that cut through that cloud of controversy that marred his quarterfinal loss at Roland Garros.Most viral moments: When Frances Tiafoe and Coco Gauff walked onto court without racquets2025 proved to be a challenging year for the fan-favorite American, but an up-and-down season was decidedly on the upswing when he put together his deepest-ever run at Roland Garros in June. Previously dubbing clay-court seasons of prior years ""an eye-roll situation,"" Tiafoe teamed with Tommy Paul to make recent history for the U.S. in Paris, as two American men were among the eight quarterfinalists for the first time since 1996.But the good feelings quickly evaporated for both in that round: A physically-hampered Paul won just five games against eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, while Tiafoe was bundled out in four sets by Lorenzo Musetti—but only after the Italian was spared a sticky exit himself.

But the good feelings quickly evaporated for both in that round: A physically-hampered Paul won just five games against eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, while Tiafoe was bundled out in four sets by Lorenzo Musetti—but only after the Italian was spared a sticky exit himself.

While the 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 for Musetti looked otherwise routine, the Italian was left biting his nails when, after losing a point to trail 5-3 in the second set, he kicked a ball towards the back fence and it rebounded against the shoulder of a line umpire standing there.The official was unfazed, and Musetti received a code violation warning for unsportsmanlike conduct.Tiafoe didn't blame the incident, which came in the set he won, for his defeat. But he did slam a perceived double standard in decision-making for players' bad behavior. The moment came two years after doubles player Miyu Kato was defaulted from a Roland Garros match after hitting a ball girl, a decision that caused controversy given the apparently accidental nature of the hit.

Obviously he did that and nothing happened. I think that's comical, but it is what it is. Nothing happened, so there's nothing really to talk about. Obviously it's not consistent, so it is what it is. Frances Tiafoe

Musetti, for his part, called the incident a ""really unlucky coincidence.""I was a little bit, honestly, scared, because I really didn't want to harm nobody, of course,"" he said. ""So, I immediately went to the line umpire, and I of course said, Sorry, I apologize to everyone.”The two players' seasons continued to diverge from there.

Then, in a matter of minutes, the bottom fell out for Fils. He lost 10 straight games; by the time he had surrendered the fourth set 6-0, he was struggling to move. Fils blamed a back injury, but Munar wasn't buying it. “Everyone knows his timeout was due to cramps,” he said.Whatever the ailment, Fils' descent continued into the fifth. When he went down 1-3, he bashed a ball into the stadium's upper deck.Did that moment of rage-venting save him? Fils was a new man after that. In the next game, he wore Munar down with corner-to-corner forehands, as he had early on, and leveled the set at 3-3. From there, it was a battle of the good Fils versus the gassed Fils. The good version drilled fearless forehand winners and flapped his arms for more noise from the crowd. The gassed version had trouble standing up. When he did, he was liable to send an overhead careening toward the stands.Serving at 4-4, the gassed Fils went down 0-40. But the good Fils got off the mat, threw in a serve and volley, and cranked up the forehand machine one last time. He saved a break point with a blazing forehand winner, and broke with another. That—and some helpful hissing of his opponent from the fans—was just enough to get him over the finish line. Fils won the last point with a net-cord that set up his 69th and final winner.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Max Verstappen might be in with a chance of winning a fifth World Championship in Abu Dhabi, but the Red Bull driver remains in a relaxed mood.

Max Verstappen has insisted that he is feeling “very relaxed” ahead of the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with the Dutchman admitting that he is content with how he and Red Bull have been “turning things around from difficult times” during the second half of the season.

Verstappen enters the weekend in second place of the Drivers' Championship and just 12 points adrift of leader Lando Norris, having dramatically closed the points gap following a strong run of form across the last eight rounds which has seen him take five victories.

Prior to the decisive event at the Yas Marina Circuit, Verstappen explained during Thursday's media day that he was focused on other things in his life before arriving at the venue.

“I spent some time with my daughter,” the Red Bull driver said. “I figured some stuff out for GT3 for next year, figured out some stuff for my sim racing team as well, planning for next year. Pretty straightforward stuff before arriving here.”

Verstappen went on to detail how he is seemingly not feeling the pressure entering into the weekend, having not anticipated that he would still be in the championship fight given that he was 104 points adrift of former leader Oscar Piastri just a few months ago in August.

“I'm very relaxed, nothing to lose,” the 28-year-old reflected. “I'm just enjoying being here, but for me it's not even about being here – I've been enjoying the second half of the season, working with the team and how we've been able to turn things around from difficult times.

“[We've gone from] having a debrief after the race, feeling very disappointed and frustrated with the performances, to just enjoying, smiling, having these wins again. It's fantastic, so I'll just take it.

“To me everything here is just a bonus and sitting here fighting for the title. That's also what makes it really straightforward for me. We will just try to have a good weekend, but even then it's not really in my control, so I guess I'll just try to enjoy it.”

Looking back on the campaign, Verstappen struggled to pick out any particular incident that he would deem as one where the title might have gotten away from him.

“At the end of the day, it's won over 24 races – some races go a bit better than others,” the four-time World Champion conceded. “A lot of the races we didn't have a lot of pace, or enough pace to challenge for a win, but here we are.

“In general I'm just very proud of the season we've done, how we've come back as well in the second half. We'll just try and keep it fun now until the end, but to always pick one particular moment or whatever, that's always a hard one.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Lando Norris heads into the Abu Dhabi season finale at the top of the standings, but can he stay there?

Lando Norris has insisted that his approach will be “the same as every weekend” at the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, despite acknowledging he has “more to lose” than championship rivals Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri.

After a tricky Sprint event in Qatar last time out, Norris leads Red Bull rival Max Verstappen by a reduced margin of 12 points, while McLaren team mate Piastri is 16 points back – meaning any one of them could walk away from the Yas Marina Circuit with the 2025 title.

As the F1 paddock reconvened on Thursday, all three contenders were grouped in the same press conference to discuss their mindsets, hopes and expectations, with Norris kicking things off as the man at the top of the Drivers' Championship.

“It's the same as every weekend – nothing changes,” said Norris, in terms of how he and McLaren are treating the decisive days ahead.

“Of course, some reviews of last weekend, like the same after every weekend, really, just reviewing what went on, what was clearly and obviously not good for us, some of the mistakes you've made. Also the less obvious things that we could improve on. That's normal post-race understandings, and therefore preparations for the next race.

“Otherwise, nothing does change, it gets treated the same from everyone inside the team. It's more excitement, I guess, for everyone at the same time. Apart from that, the work and how you approach it all remains the same.”

While Verstappen declared that “everything is a bonus” on his side after a remarkable post-summer recovery and Piastri played into his own outsider status, Norris was later asked if he feels there is more to lose as the championship leader.

“I guess in terms of position of course I have the most to lose, because I'm the one at the top,” he commented. “I'll do my best to stay there until the end of the year – a few more days!

“At the same time, if it doesn't go my way, I'll try again next year. It'll hurt probably for a little while, then that's life, we'll crack on and try and do better next season.

“I also feel the mentality of having nothing to lose, because it's just a race, for a championship, but in 30 years' time I probably won't think of it that much either way.”

That said, Norris' answer to a follow-up question highlighted just what it would mean to the 26-year-old Briton to put his hands on the sport's ultimate prize.

“Ask me hopefully in a few days, or a few weeks,” Norris smiled.

“This has been my whole life, it's everything I've worked towards my whole life, so it would mean the world to me, and it would mean the world to everyone that's supported me and pushed me for the last 16 years of my life, in terms of trying to get to this point.

“It would mean everything. It would mean my life until now has been a success and I've accomplished that dream I had when I was a kid. Other than that, I don't know what else to probably say.

“It's a reward for a lot of hard work that goes into things, and I think it goes to whoever deserves it most.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Ahead of his final race as a Racing Bulls driver, Isack Hadjar has been reflecting on what lies ahead for him in 2026 as he prepares to join Max Verstappen at Red Bull.

Isack Hadjar has shared his reaction following the news that he will be promoted to Red Bull in 2026, with the Frenchman admitting that he “needs to deliver” as he prepares to embark on “the beginning of a new journey”.

It was confirmed in the days prior to the 2025 season finale in Abu Dhabi that Hadjar – who has impressed many during his rookie campaign for Racing Bulls – will make the step up to partner Max Verstappen next year, while Yuki Tsunoda becomes a reserve driver for the outfit.

Over at Racing Bulls, Liam Lawson continues on with the squad and rookie Arvid Lindblad will join to fill Hadjar's vacant seat.

Reflecting on his new role during Thursday's media day at the Yas Marina Circuit, Hadjar said: “It's a very good moment in my career, that's for sure, for all the hard work through the years being rewarded now.

“This is just the beginning of a new journey, but I'm very excited, and stepping into a new era of Formula 1 as well – it's very good timing.”

When pushed for details on how he found out about his promotion, the 21-year-old explained: “There was no very cool phone call where I pick up the phone and it's like, ‘You're a Red Bull Racing driver' – that was not really how it worked.

“It was just a talk with Helmut [Marko, Red Bull advisor] I had, [which] made me understand I was driving for Red Bull and I have to deliver – that's it.”

With a new wave of technical regulations due to come into effect for the 2026 season, Hadjar insisted that he has “no expectations at all” entering into his new position “because everyone is starting from scratch”.

“I'm just really looking forward to, in January and February, working with the team and getting to know the people,” he added. “It's going to be crucial to try and be ahead a bit.”

While other drivers promoted to the team have struggled to match the pace of Verstappen in recent years, Hadjar believes that both he and the Dutchman will face the same challenge in getting used to the new generation of cars.

“It won't be the same car next year, so we're going to get the car we have, the car the team is going to build,” the French racer said. “I have to adapt to that car, and Max will have to do the same job.

“If the car goes into one direction, at least I'll be there to feel the change, and ideally I contribute to that change. That would be the ideal scenario.

""I've never repeated; every year I've always competed in different cars, so I don't know what [it's like] twice, doing the same thing, the same job. I think I'm pretty decent at that, so I'm actually confident.”

When it was put to Hadjar that there may be similarities between himself and Verstappen in terms of driving style – and whether this had influenced the decision to promote him – he responded: “With the line-up for next year, they chose it because it makes sense, and of course because it's a new regulation the timing is just very ideal for me.

“In terms of styles, Max has a very unique style and I would say [that for] myself as well. I'm not trying to copy what he's doing but, in terms of mindset, we have some things in common.

“What I find very impressive with Max is that, after four World Championships, he's still very hungry, and very mad when it doesn't go his way because he always wants to win. I don't think every champion can do that; once you've passed a certain level you can maybe slow down a bit in your approach, but he seems to be starting just like I am, so it's very impressive.”

And when asked what excites him the most about becoming a Red Bull driver, Hadjar pointed to the team's past – as well as reflecting on the opportunity to race alongside Verstappen.

“Being in a World Champion team – when I grew up watching Formula 1, I saw [Sebastian] Vettel winning all these races with the Red Bull – and being team mates with Max,” the rookie answered. “I'll see what it's like – facing the best ever in the world is definitely super exciting.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Mercedes have Red Bull behind them in the battle for second place of the Teams' Championship, but George Russell is hopeful that the Silver Arrows can seal the runner-up spot in Abu Dhabi.

George Russell is confident that Mercedes have a “very good shot” of sealing second place in the Teams' Championship during the season finale in Abu Dhabi, with the Silver Arrows needing to fend off the challenge posed by Red Bull.

After overtaking Ferrari for P2 following the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in September, Mercedes further consolidated that position at the next race in Singapore, where Russell clinched his second victory of the campaign.

But while the Scuderia have slipped further back to a now confirmed position of fourth, Red Bull have moved forwards thanks to Max Verstappen's strong run during the second half of the season, meaning that the Milton Keynes-based outfit sit 33 points behind Mercedes.

Asked for his thoughts on the upcoming event in Abu Dhabi during Thursday's media day, Russell reiterated that the team's aim is to secure that all-important runner-up spot in the championship.

“It's another race, to be honest. Obviously, we want to try and secure P2 in the Constructors' Championship,” the Briton explained. “It was a bit of a shame we couldn't achieve that in Qatar, but we have a very good shot this weekend and [we'll] just go out and enjoy the last race of the season.”

Reflecting back on how the squad performed last time out at the Lusail International Circuit, Russell – who finished the race in P6 – suggested that the final result did not necessarily reflect the team's potential.

“I think, thanks to Isack [Hadjar], I had quite a long race in traffic!” Russell remarked. “I think, unfortunately, we were very competitive. I think it was only really Oscar [Piastri] who was more competitive.

“I think, nine times out of 10 when you are very competitive, the result is there. And I think, unfortunately, this was the one out of 10 times when you do have the car, and unfortunately, it doesn't go the way you hope.

“And I think that Lap 7 Safety Car, starting on the inside – I think every driver in the first four rows who started on the inside lost at least one position – so that just compromised the whole weekend.”

While Mercedes are yet to have their second place confirmed in the Teams' Championship, Russell will end the campaign in fourth place of the Drivers' standings, equalling his previous career-best result in 2022.

When quizzed on which season was the better one for him, the 27-year-old answered: “I think both seasons were very strong. I'd say this season, without doubt, has been my most competitive.

“I think 2022 was really challenging, experiencing porpoising for the first time and the challenges we were going through as a team and also my first year against Lewis [Hamilton]. But I think this has been a strong year.”

Also hoping to secure second place for Mercedes during the Abu Dhabi weekend is Russell's team mate Kimi Antonelli, who will complete his maiden campaign in the sport at the Yas Marina Circuit.

Reflecting back on his debut season as an F1 driver, Antonelli – who sits in seventh place of the Drivers' Championship – summarised: “It's been going very fast, faster than expected. Melbourne feels not long ago, and I'm actually sad we're already at the end of the season.

“I would like to have a few more races – of course it's not possible, but I've been enjoying quite a lot. A season of ups and downs, but we've been having a strong second last part of the season.

“Definitely a lot of positives to take away and, despite the difficult moments, I have to say I've learnt massively and I grew up a lot as a person and I matured a lot. Really glad, just aiming to finish the season on a high and focus on 2026.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

F1 TV commentator Alex Jacques explains why Red Bull are taking a chance on a driver who is still only 18-years-old…

Arvid Lindblad will be the new kid on the block next year in Formula 1 after he was announced as Liam Lawson's team mate at Racing Bulls for 2026. F1 TV commentator Alex Jacques explains why Red Bull are taking a chance on a driver who is still only 18-years-old…

The British-Swedish racer, born to a Swedish father and Indian mother, became the youngest ever F2 winner in Jeddah this season at just 17-years-old, and at Silverstone in Formula 3 last year he became the first driver to win both the Sprint and Features races in a weekend.

In doing so he displayed both raw speed and adaptability under pressure – the two traits valued most highly by Formula 1 bosses in modern times.

On paper his junior career is not the headline grabbing run of an Oscar Piastri, George Russell or Charles Leclerc. There's been no title double in Formula 3 and Formula 2, or even a realistic challenge for either of those crowns.

His CV comprises a single season securing fourth place with Prema Racing in the 2024 Formula 3 Championship, and this season he secured two wins in Formula 2 where he sits in sixth position with two races of the campaign to go.

This season Lindblad was placed with the same Campos team as 2025 F1 rookie Isak Hadjar, giving Red Bull a trusted outfit to develop their young driver.

And it feels like the teenage racer has driven with the same confidence of his predecessor: trusting that promotion was assured if he met his set objectives.

In days of old, fourth and sixth place championship finishes would not have been enough for the most cut throat team in F1, but in recent times things have changed.

That Lindblad's promotion feels so similar to Hadjar's is a testament to head of the programme Guillaume Rocquelin, who has brought wisdom to a set up which had started to drift.

Incredibly, the Faenza team which Lindblad is joining had once signed Brendon Hartley after the New Zealander sent Helmut Marko a text asking if they had any drives going.

Similarly they re-signed Alex Albon in 2019 after dropping him from the programme years previously. Albon went from no F1 drive in November 2018 to Max Verstappen's team mate by August 2019. There was a lack of rhyme or reason to the moves.

Such haphazard recruitment has diminished in recent times. Rocquelin takes a wider view, focusing on evidence of improvement rather than just pure results.

This stands in sharp contrast to the 2010's era where Pierre Gasly was told “win GP2 and you'll be promoted to F1” only to be told he hadn't won the title convincingly enough and he was sent for an extra year of junior racing in Japan.

None of this context is to diminish Lindblad's talent behind the wheel because it is sizeable. But the young charger has benefited from Red Bull modernising their approach.

So what can Racing Bulls expect from their new driver?

In his younger years Lindblad claimed multiple karting titles and the prestigious Formula 4 Macau street race victory, and after Red Bull identified him in their words as a “generational talent” they signed him at 14 years of age.

That put Lindblad on a steep learning curve each year but it's a path he's thrived on. Under the mentorship of F2 race winner and FIA Formula E champion Oliver Rowland, Lindblad believes the Yorkshireman – a hugely naturally talented driver in his own right – has helped him understand how to be competitive when jumping through the motorsport pyramid in consecutive years.

“To have someone with that knowledge and capability, helping to guide me, has been instrumental to my transition, because it is a massive step,” he said last year.

Lindblad's drive at Silverstone's F3 Feature race last year was a standout performance. At a circuit he'd somehow never driven before he mastered the greasy conditions on slick tyres to take victory.

Winning in low grip conditions never goes unnoticed higher up the ladder, and to sweep an F3 weekend in an ultra-competitive 30-car championship was hugely impressive.

After many TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) tests in two-year-old F1 machinery showed Racing Bulls he had the foundation for Formula 1, Red Bull were further delighted by FP1 runs in Silverstone and Mexico City – especially the latter which saw Lindblad use different tyre compounds effectively and outpace regular driver Yuki Tsunoda with a fine run to P6.

Affable in the paddock and well liked by team personnel, Lindblad once had the confidence to sidle up to Lando Norris and proclaim “I want you to remember me, I'll see you in five years”.

In March 2026 he will deliver on his promise and will share the grid with the British driver.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Having joined forces 12 months ago in Abu Dhabi, the Leclerc brothers will once again be team mates at Ferrari in the weekend's first practice session.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will once again be joined by younger brother Arthur in Free Practice 1 for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, taking the seat of Lewis Hamilton for the one-hour session.

The Leclerc siblings made Formula 1 history 12 months ago in the same session, which marked the first time two brothers competed together as team mates.

Arthur Leclerc will take over Hamilton's SF-25 and fulfil Ferrari's final mandated rookie driver session this year, with Dino Beganovic and Antonio Fuoco having previously driven for the team in FP1 sessions this year.

""Charles and I are very happy to be driving again together in FP1. It's very exciting to be in a car on the other side of the garage from him,"" said Arthur.

""From a technical point of view, driving the car on track is always useful for us drivers who mainly support the team with our work in the simulator back in Maranello. It helps us to give better feedback to the engineers.""

The younger Leclerc finished P18 in FP1 last year before taking part in the young driver test after the Grand Prix weekend.

Previously, the 25-year-old raced in F2 in 2023 before spending the last two seasons as a Development Driver for Ferrari, while also racing in sports cars this term.

""In terms of physical preparation, I've worked mainly on my neck, which is where you most feel the G forces, and I also did a lot of cardio work,"" he said.

""On the technical side, obviously I worked a lot in the simulator to be as well prepared as possible.

""My job will be to provide useful feedback on what we are testing and gather as much data as possible to improve the correlation between the performance on track and the results we see in the Maranello simulator.""

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

A date has been set for the Cadillac F1 Team's very first livery reveal…

Cadillac are set to present the livery for their debut Formula 1 car during a television advert at February's Super Bowl.

The American outfit, who are backed by General Motors and led by former Marussia Sporting Director Graeme Lowdon, are preparing to become the sport's 11th team next season.

Multiple Grand Prix winners Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez were recently confirmed as their two drivers, with IndyCar star Colton Herta taking on a testing role.

On Wednesday, a few days before the 2025 finale in Abu Dhabi, Cadillac took to social media to share the latest development in their F1 journey.

As per a special graphic and accompanying news story, Cadillac will show off their 2026 colours on February 8 during coverage of the Super Bowl – the annual league championship game of the National Football League (NFL).

Cadillac's livery reveal will follow on from a private test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya between January 26-30, where teams will run their 2026 challengers – built to all-new regulations – for the first time.

Test two will be held at the Bahrain International Circuit between February 11-13, with another test coming at the same venue from February 18-20.

Cadillac will then get set to head to Australia for their debut F1 weekend from March 6-8.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, from the race winner to the all-important championship victor.

The 2025 Formula 1 season reaches its conclusion this weekend in exciting style, with three drivers still in contention to clinch the World Championship – but what do the odds say about who might come out on top in Abu Dhabi? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

A three-driver race is on the cards as the 2025 season concludes in Abu Dhabi this weekend. Lando Norris arrives as the championship leader at the Yas Marina Circuit; however, he struggled in the previous two rounds amid a disqualification in Las Vegas and fourth place in Qatar.

Team mate Oscar Piastri, meanwhile, produced his best weekend since Monza last time out. The Australian starts with seven victories in his portfolio this term.

Max Verstappen has already etched his name into the history books with four World Championships, but the Dutchman has the potential to produce one of the greatest comebacks in F1 history this weekend.

He was 104 points adrift of the leader before Monza, but starts this weekend in second place, only 12 points away from Norris. Verstappen is the in-form driver on the grid, boasting nine consecutive podiums between Zandvoort and Lusail with five of those results being victories.

Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli continues his impressive run at the backend of the campaign, producing two podiums in three races. He held onto fourth spot until the 56th lap in Qatar, when an error nudged him off track, giving Norris a gap to pass him. The Italian is showing that he can consistently deliver, and offers value for money for a top-three performance.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc also can't be written off at this venue, having stood on the rostrum in his last three visits to the UAE Capital. In 2024, the Monegasque driver started from 19th on the grid and worked his way through the field to finish third.

Antonelli's senior, George Russell, clocks in for the final round as the only driver on the grid to have finished every race this year. The Briton has joined in the champagne celebrations on nine weekends this term, twice as a winner. He's also remarkably consistent, averaging 4.0 in his past 10 appearances.

One driver who has also found his rhythm is Carlos Sainz. The Williams racer produced his second podium for his new team in Qatar and back-to-back top sixes. While he has an outside shot of making the podium, he's showing the pace of the vehicle and his ability to compete with the top four teams.

Qatar produced another challenging weekend for Lewis Hamilton, as he greeted the stewards outside the top 10. The Ferrari driver appears to lack confidence and cohesion with his pit crew, but despite the hiccups, he's still finished among the top six in nine races this year.

Alex Albon also remains a contender for a top six, despite last achieving the feat in the Netherlands. He's collected five top-six results across the campaign, better than any of his midfield rivals.

Double World Champion Fernando Alonso crossed the line in seventh in the last round, his fourth such result this year. The veteran has only made the top six once all season, but he's constantly knocking on the door.

Red Bull number two Yuki Tsunoda starts the weekend ahead of Albon and Alonso in the betting, but he's only cracked the top six once this year and is a better option for a top 10 outing in the final round. Over in the Racing Bulls pen, Isack Hadjar is worth a look, after finishing as one of the first six cars three times this year.

New Zealander Liam Lawson has found some rhythm in the second half of the year, conjuring up six top-10s in the previous 13 rounds. From youth to experience, Nico Hulkenberg was unlucky in Qatar, just clipping Pierre Gasly and crashing out. That's now his second DNF in five races, but he's captured three top-10s in that period as well.

Speaking of Gasly, the Alpine senior drove well all weekend and showed immense promise until the contact with Hulkenberg. He's registered five top-10s this year, but only one in the previous 10 races.

Another rookie who has excelled late in the year is Haas' Ollie Bearman, but Qatar didn't go according to plan. A disastrous pit stop saw him lose time and accrue a penalty for an unsafe release. He eventually retired from the race, leaving Doha point-less.

On a positive note, the youngster has six top-10s to his name in the past nine appearances. Bearman's team mate Esteban Ocon struggled at Lusail, but he's been reliable of late, posting a 50% top-10 return in four starts.

The Yas Marina Circuit plays host to perhaps the most important Qualifying session of the year this weekend; the driver who has started in pole position in the last 10 races has gone on to win the Grand Prix.

Verstappen and Piastri desperately need a win if they have a shot of leapfrogging Norris for the title. Norris clocked the fastest time on Saturday last year at this venue and proceeded to win the race, and the papaya driver is tied with Verstappen on seven Pirelli Pole Position awards this year.

Piastri trails the duo with six starts from the front row on the grid. The Australian powered to first place on Saturday night in Doha, his first since Zandvoort.

Elsewhere, Russell has proudly captured two poles this year, but both of them were on street circuits or at the minimum hybrid layouts. Leclerc is the only other driver to win the pole position award this year, stopping the clock fastest in Hungary.

Leading into Monza, McLaren had captured 12 wins across the campaign, which aided the Woking outfit in claiming the Teams' Championship at the Singapore Grand Prix. Despite a sensational start to the season, the papaya outfit has faltered in the last 10 rounds, capturing only 20% of the victories.

Mercedes contributed one to the cause, through Russell in Singapore, but other than that, it's been all Red Bull. The Milton-Keynes garage has taken home five team trophies in the last eight races, all thanks to Verstappen. They are also seeking to end their campaign on a hat-trick.

Ferrari have faced a challenging season this year, but we can't ignore their history at this venue, as the squad from Maranello have delivered a podium-performing vehicle since 2021 in Abu Dhabi. Can they finally come right and grab the chequered flag?

Three drivers are in the hunt to secure the 2025 Drivers' Championship this weekend. Norris is in pole position in the standings and only needs to finish on the podium to clinch the title, while finishing fourth or worse will leave his fate in the hands of Verstappen and Piastri.

If Verstappen wants a fifth title, he'll need to seal victory in Abu Dhabi and hope Norris finishes outside of the top three.

Norris' team mate, Piastri, has more ground to make up. The Australian needs to gain 16 points on the leader, which means he can only win the title if he grabs top honours in this race and Norris crosses the line in sixth or worse.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

From the Drivers' Championship showdown to a big 2026 promotion – here are the main stories ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Twenty three races down, one to go, and still three drivers in with a chance of becoming the 2025 World Champion. The season is set for a thrilling finale this weekend, and on top of the three-way battle there are plenty of other positions to be finalised, and reactions to be given, at the last race of the year in Abu Dhabi.

A week ago, it was only Lando Norris who could win himself a Drivers' Championship, but the two other contenders managed to keep themselves in the frame in Qatar, even if there were differing emotions as a result.

What looked set to be an Oscar Piastri victory – likely ahead of Max Verstappen in second and Norris in third – changed on Lap 7 in Qatar when McLaren were the only team not to bring their drivers into the pits during a Safety Car period. With the entire rest of the field doing so, it lost out on race time and the path was clear for a Verstappen victory.

Piastri still salvaged second but could not challenge Verstappen, while Norris was limited to fourth place behind Carlos Sainz. The upshot of all that was Norris retained his championship lead, but Verstappen moved into second place – 12 points adrift – and Piastri dropped to third, 16 points behind his team mate.

The equation for Norris is simple this weekend, as a podium finish will guarantee him the title. Beyond that, it's easiest to focus on what the other two contenders need to do.

Verstappen has to finish on the podium – with neither McLaren driver doing so – to have any chance. A win for Verstappen coupled with fourth or lower for Norris will win him the championship, while if the Red Bull driver is second he needs Norris no higher than eighth, or if he's third then Norris no higher than ninth.

For Piastri, a top-two finish is necessary to be in the frame, and a win would be enough as long as Norris doesn't finish in the top five. If Piastri is second, he will need Norris to be 10th or lower, and Verstappen to not finish on the podium.

Given the pace of the McLaren, the title picture still remains firmly in their hands with Norris, but as Team Principal Andrea Stella pointed out on Sunday night, they will need to execute better than they have at the last two races.

Drivers' standings after Qatar

While Mercedes are in control, there remains a chance that Red Bull could still earn second place in the Teams' Championship off the back of Verstappen's Drivers' title charge.

Kimi Antonelli's mistake late on in Qatar drew misguided questions from Red Bull for a spell after the race, as the Italian rookie lost a position to Norris. Red Bull have since said they “sincerely regret” comments that the move could have been intentional, after Antonelli received online abuse.

The impact of the error that cost Antonelli fourth place was not only two extra points for Norris, but two fewer for Mercedes in their fight against Red Bull for second in the standings. Verstappen's win meant Red Bull closed in by seven points on Sunday, and sit 33 adrift heading into the final round.

There are a maximum of 43 points on offer, so Mercedes simply need to add 11 points of their own to cement second place, but given a strong overall showing from Yuki Tsunoda in Qatar – where he scored points in both the Sprint and Grand Prix – it's not beyond the realms of possibility that Red Bull could pick up enough points to put pressure on if Verstappen is able to win the race.

The final race weekend of the season always brings clarity on the final results, but sometimes there are more positions decided than is the case this year.

In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Antonelli are separated by just two points for sixth place, while Alex Albon in eighth could still theoretically be overtaken by any one of four drivers in Carlos Sainz, Isack Hadjar, Nico Hulkenberg or Fernando Alonso.

Below them, everyone is also in a position that could change – albeit only a win would move Franco Colapinto up in the standings – with Oliver Bearman in 13th theoretically able to climb as high as ninth or drop as low as 19th.

But the final Teams' Championship positions are deemed more important this weekend, given the extra prize money that comes with each place a team gains.

Ferrari are guaranteed to finish fourth and Williams fifth, but sixth is still up for grabs, with Racing Bulls 12 points ahead of Aston Martin. Haas in eighth (19 points behind Racing Bulls) and Sauber in ninth (24 adrift) can also both technically climb as high as sixth, though they would need big results to do so.

If Racing Bulls are able to hold onto the sixth place they currently occupy, they will end the year on a high and say goodbye to one of the stars of the season as Isack Hadjar prepares to move up to Red Bull in 2026.

Red Bull have confirmed the talented Frenchman will partner Max Verstappen next season, with the rookie having impressed in a debut year that featured a podium in Zandvoort and two other top-six finishes – so far at least – as he currently sits 10th in the Drivers' standings.

The second Red Bull seat has been a difficult one to occupy in recent seasons, with Sergio Perez replaced 12 months ago, Liam Lawson only getting two races with the team at the start of this year, and then Yuki Tsunoda managing just one top-six finish of his own in that car.

It will be an emotional weekend for Tsunoda as he loses his race seat for next year and becomes reserve at Red Bull, with Arvid Lindblad a new name on the grid next season at Racing Bulls alongside Liam Lawson.

The British-Swedish driver steps up after just one year in F2 – where he currently sits sixth in the championship with two wins to his name – and will continue the Red Bull tradition of providing opportunities to young talents.

Abu Dhabi marks the final race of the ground effect era cars that were introduced in 2022, with an emphasis on trying to create impressive aerodynamic performance from the floor while also making it easier to follow another car more closely.

It has been a very fruitful era for Red Bull and Max Verstappen, but has also seen the return of McLaren as a force at the front of the field, while Ferrari came close to a Teams' Championship last year and Mercedes have also won races.

As the field bunches up towards the end of a regulatory cycle, naturally the small differences in cars make it harder for drivers to overtake. But four teams have won races, and nine of the 10 have stood on the podium across the past three seasons, while every team finished in the top six at some stage this year.

The new regulations in 2026 provide the chance for a complete reset of the competitive order, but will also see two new names joining the fray as Audi and Cadillac become part of the grid. Audi are taking over the Sauber team, while Cadillac represent an expansion to 11 constructors, and there promises to be some exciting storylines to follow from both next season.

When the chequered flag drops on Sunday night, there will be just 50 days until the new cars are running for the first time during a private shakedown in Barcelona, and both Audi and Cadillac will be able to say that they will be on the grid for the next race, in Australia on March 8.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Pirelli have confirmed the tyre compounds that will be in use at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Formula 1 will close out a thrilling 2025 season with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this weekend – and tyre suppliers Pirelli have confirmed the compounds that the teams and drivers will have available to them.

A combination of the C3 as the hard, the C4 as the medium and the C5 as the soft will be deployed at the Yas Marina Circuit, which mixes flat-out stretches with tight, technical sections.

Drivers will get two sets of the hard tyre (marked white), three sets of the medium tyre (marked yellow), and eight sets of the soft tyre (marked red), as well as access to the green intermediate tyre and the blue full wets, should they be required.

An extra set of softs is reserved for those who reach Q3 in Qualifying, while all drivers must use at least two different slick compounds during the race, providing the track is dry.

“Historically, the Yas Marina track sees graining on the tyres, but as from last year this phenomenon seems to be relatively limited,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview.

“The greater resistance of the current tyres could reduce it to such an extent that even the soft, usually only used in Qualifying, could be a tyre around which to put together a race strategy.

“At this track, degradation is thermal in nature and is generally seen on the rears due to the requirement for traction especially in the final sector of the track.

“In Yas Marina last year, 19 drivers fitted the medium for the start, the sole exception being Lewis Hamilton, who went with the hard.

“The one-stop was the quickest strategy, using the hard for the second stint. Of the top 10 finishers, only Fernando Alonso pitted twice. Just one driver ran the soft with the sole aim of setting the fastest race lap.

“Graining and degradation were both limited and so, even those who pitted before half-distance managed to run just two stints with no difficulties.”

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Yuki Tsunoda will drop back to a test and reserve role for the 2026 season after losing his race seat at Red Bull.

Yuki Tsunoda has given his first full reaction to the news that he will drop off the F1 grid in 2026, admitting it is “tough” to take but he is also yet to fully process the situation.

Shortly after the Qatar Grand Prix weekend, Red Bull announced that Isack Hadjar is taking Tsunoda's place next season, while F2 racer Arvid Lindblad is stepping up to partner Liam Lawson at Racing Bulls.

Tsunoda, meanwhile, has been demoted to a test and reserve role for both Red Bull and Racing Bulls, meaning he falls off the grid some five years after his debut with the then-named AlphaTauri squad.

Asked when he found out he would not be continuing with Red Bull, Tsunoda said: “I heard after the race in Qatar. Obviously, I was disappointed. It's tough.

“At the same time, I'm not fully recognising or fully feeling it yet that I'm not racing next year. It's surprising that I was kind of okay the next morning – I was thinking about Abu Dhabi. It's not ideal.

“What I've got to do here is exactly the same, what I was trying to do in Qatar. It's to be competitive as much as possible and ideally help Max [Verstappen] and finish as high as possible for myself and the team.”

Tsunoda started 2025 at Racing Bulls, having been overlooked for a Red Bull seat during the winter, but he finally got his chance at the senior team in a swap with Liam Lawson two rounds into the campaign.

However, the struggles Lawson and a long list of previous Red Bull drivers experienced alongside Verstappen were also seemingly felt by Tsunoda, who has endured a spate of early Qualifying exits and had to settle for occasional minor points.

“I'm not saying I don't have regret at all,” said Tsunoda, pondering his early-season promotion. “I'm missing the Racing Bulls car, which part of the car I developed since the regulations started. Some DNA is in there and you throw out your baby. So, I missed that and kind of regret that.

“At the same time, I don't mostly regret it. I kind of understand it why this seat is a little bit difficult, but at the same time I think, towards the end especially, the team gave me a lot of support.

“I think at the last few races, it looks like I'm struggling, because sometimes I was exiting Q1. If you look at the result, it's a lot different, but I see consistently the difference between me and Max. I can't remember the last time I was four-and-a-half tenths back.

“I'm pretty happy with it. I jumped in in the middle of the season, he drove this car for four years, and being this close is something [of a] different situation to a lot of drivers who were driving [here] before.”

As for what the future might hold alongside or beyond his F1 test and reserve duties, Tsunoda said: “I leave it to my manager and I only think about Abu Dhabi. Let's see how it goes with the race.

“It will be a new experience for me. The last few years I've been racing. I will miss [it], for sure, but I think at the same time I can see a lot of new perspectives being inside both teams, learning a lot of things I never even imagined.

“Let's be positive. I'm just thinking about Abu Dhabi, and let's think about the future afterwards.”

Pushed on whether a move to a series such as IndyCar could be an option, he said: “F1 is my life. It's too early stages [to think about anything else].

“For now, the only motivation I have is F1. I'm not really thinking about that competition for now, but I'll do as much as I can with any opportunity to make myself sharp.”

The superstar says he'll ""maybe, definitely"" have new music ready for his 'Post Malone & Buddies' set this February in San Francisco.

	Lyndsey Havens



Post Malone is headed to the Super Bowl – again. 


	In 2024, Posty was booked as the pre-game performer, singing “America the Beautiful” in Las Vegas. And earlier this year, he headlined both the YouTube Tailgate Concert and a one-night-only Bud Light Backyard concert in New Orleans. 


	Come February, Posty will return to headline Bud Light's Super Bowl concert: Bud Light Presents Post Malone & Buddies. For the performance, Posty will take over Fort Mason, San Francisco (about an hour outside of Santa Clara, where the game is set for Levi's Stadium).

	“We show up every year to provide football fans with bucket-list experiences,” Todd Allen, Bud Light's SVP of marketing, shared in a statement. “We're pumped to run it back with Posty, our buddy of nearly a decade, for what will be one of the most electrifying shows of Super Bowl [weekend].”


	As for if Post would ever want to book the weekend's prime headlining slot – the halftime show – Posty tells Billboard that he “would love to.” Over Thanksgiving weekend, he headlined the hometown halftime game between his beloved Cowboys and the Kansas City Chiefs. And while he knows a Cowboys Super Bowl “is not in the cards as of this moment,” he also is “sick of the f—ing Chiefs. Can we stop with the Chiefs Super Bowl bulls–t?” he asks with a laugh.


	Yet, has not one but multiple Kansas City tattoos. “Not by my choice. This was a gentleman's bet,” he says. “And you know what happens? [Travis] Kelce cheated, and I'm gonna say [Patrick] Mahomes cheated a little bit too. And there was a tattoo artist right in the corner, so I have both of their signatures on me — and a KC logo.” (Naturally, he has a Cowboys tattoo as well.)

	











	As for his Bud Light headlining gig, Post teases he may have new music ready to live debut by then – offering a signature “yes ma'am” – after telling Billboard back in April that he was working on his next album, another country set.


	“A hundred percent,” he says of performing new songs. “We've been working very, very diligently on new music. And we have 45 songs. It's just a matter of finishing said songs. And the schedule has been so very busy. So we're working and working, but there will be new music by then…Allegedly.”


“Allegedly a hundred percent maybe, definitely,” he teases. “Keep your ears [open].”

The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer also co-wrote such classics as ""Green Onions"" & ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.""


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



	Legendary guitarist Steve Cropper, who played on seminal recordings by such artists as Otis Redding, Booker T & the M.G.'s, Wilson Pickett and many more, died Wednesday (Dec. 3) in Nashville. He was 84.


	Cropper's son confirmed his father's death on Facebook. “It's with the heaviest of hearts that I share the news that my amazing Dad passed away this morning,” Stephen Cropper posted. “He certainly lived an incredible life and enjoyed every minute of entertaining you all. Please lift prayers of comfort for my family.”

	











	As the guitarist for Booker T & the M.G.'s, which served as Stax Records' house band during the 1960s, Cropper was an architect of the sound, with his ringing, often spare guitar work and deft touch heard on R&B and pop classics including Redding's “(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,”  Eddie Floyd's “Knock on Wood,” Pickett's “In the Midnight Hour” and Sam & Dave's “Soul Man” (Sam Moore immortalized Cropper with his “Play It, Steve,” ad lib on “Soul Man”).




	“Steve Cropper was a towering figure in the history of rock and R&B,” says Steve Greenberg, reissue producer of 1991's Grammy-winning The Complete Stax-Volt Singles box set, who frequently worked with Cropper. “As one of the all-time great electric guitarists, his unique playing style brought deep character to hits ranging from ‘Green Onions' to ‘Dock of the Bay' to Rod Stewart's ‘Tonight's the Night.' Add to that his songwriting and production on classics like ‘In the Midnight Hour,' ‘Knock on Wood' and, of course, ‘Dock of the Bay,' and Steve Cropper goes down as one of the key creators of popular music in the 1960s.”


	Greenberg also notes the role of Cropper and the band in a racially divisive time. “Steve, along with Duck Dunn, Al Jackson and Booker T. Jones, recording as Booker T. and the M.G.'s, were the rare mutiracial group that dared defy the South's awful color line in the early '60s. Working together at Stax Studios in segregated Memphis during the most tumultuous years of the civil right movement, they, in a spirit of equality and fraternity, created an indelible body of American music.”


	Cropper, who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T & the M.G.'s, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, was also a noted producer, telling The New York Times in 2018 that he finished producing “(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay” under great duress following Redding's death in a plane crash in 1967. “If I had a week to work on it, it probably would have been overembellished,” he said. Instead, he finished it in less than 24 hours.


	The song earned Cropper one his two Grammys, winning for best rhythm & blues song at the 1969 ceremony. Cropper was nominated for nine Grammys, including most recently in 2024 for best contemporary blues album for his set, Friendlytown. In addition to “Dock of the Bay,” he won at the 1995 ceremony for best pop instrumental performance for the Booker T. & the M.G.'s track “Cruisin'.”

	











	Cropper experienced a renaissance in 1979 when The Blues Brothers emerged. He got a phone call from John Belushi, who was half of the fictional blues duo Jake and Elwood Blues, with his “brother,” Dan Aykroyd, and recorded with the pair and made a suggestion that was golden. “What they wanted to do probably would have made it anyway, I don't know, was basically all slow, kind of medium-tempo blues songs. Nothing wrong with blues songs, but there was nothing in there commercial to dance to,” Cropper recalled in an interview for the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum in 2019.


	“So, at the end of the rehearsal one day I said, ‘John, why don't you do something you can dance to?' He said, ‘Like what?' I said, ‘Like Sam & Dave,'” he continued. I looked at [keyboardist] Paul Shaffer and said, ‘Remember “Soul Man”?' and they started going crazy and dancing. So, when they get through with it… John turns around to me and says ‘Steve, I love that song, but it's too high for me,' and I just dropped it down.” The remake reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979 and introduced the classic to a new generation.


	“Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensures that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come. and countless musicians and fans whose lives he transformed through his extraordinary gift,” his family said in their statement.


	“Steve Cropper's offerings to American music are significant but his contribution to soul and R&B music are immeasurable,” Pat Mitchell Worley CEO, Soulsville Foundation — which includes the Stax Museum, Stax Music Academy, and Stax Charter School — said in a statement. “As a founding member of Booker T. & the M.G.'s and a cornerstone of the Stax Records sound, his songwriting and guitar work shaped the very language of soul music. A gifted songwriter, producer, and musician, Cropper helped create timeless hits that continue to influence artists and people worldwide. His signature style helped define an era and cemented his legacy as one of the most important guitarists in modern music history.”

	











	Survivors include wife Angel Cropper and children Andrea, Cameron, Stephen and Ashley.

The pop icon has been behind the camera for 14 music videos.


													By
												

	Denise Warner



	Singer, songwriter, producer and director: the multihyphenate talents of Taylor Swift cannot be ignored. With eyes on a full-length film directorial debut, Swift has cut her teeth on many of her music videos.


	Since 2019, the “Fate of Ophelia” star has directed 14 of her own videos – three with partners and the other 11 completely solo. Her albums Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights, Red (Taylor's Version), The Tortured Poets Department and The Life of a Showgirl all feature her masterminded visual creations.


	And she's been heavily awarded for her efforts. Of her five MTV VMA Video of the Year wins, four of them were for videos where she sat in the director's chair – “You Need to Calm Down,” co-directed with Drew Kirsch, All Too Well: The Short Film, “Anti-Hero” and “Fortnight” feat. Post Malone. (Her win for “Bad Blood” was under the helm of Joseph Kahn.) And “The Man” – her first solo directorial experience – took home Best Direction, as did All Too Well, “Anti-Hero” and “Fortnight” at MTV's venerable show. ATW even earned the Grammy for Best Music Video in 2023, and “Fortnight” was nominated in that same category in 2025.


	Scroll below for our ranking of Swift's self-directed videos. And for more on Swift, check out our rankings of her songs written for movies, her title tracks and her biggest Billboard hits.


	(Not included in this list are the home or concert-footage-based videos that she directed throughout her career like “I'm Only Me When I'm With You” from 2008, “The Best Day” from 2009 and 2021, “Christmas Tree Farm” from 2019, “Cardigan (Cabin in Candlelight Version)” from 2020 and “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” from 2024.)


Album: LoverYear: 2019Co-Director: Dave MeyersTaylor let go of the serpentine Reputation era by literally exploding a snake into butterflies at the beginning of the video for what would be Lover's first single. Co-starring a game Brendon Urie as both foil and mirror to Swift's difficult but lovable protagonist, the colorful and bright visuals – and special effects galore – enhance the saccharine, bubble gum pop of the track.


Album: folkloreYear: 2020


	For “cardigan,” Swift faced a daunting task – film during the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic. She elegantly carries it entirely on her own, offering an antique and dusted setting that leads her to greener pastures, which then throws her into the sea. Ultimately, she finds her way back home to the cozy comfort of the sweater that launched a thousand cardigans.


Album: evermoreYear: 2020


	Sister albums and sister videos: “willow” begins as “cardigan” ends, in the same dusty attic in front of the same stained piano with the same muted aesthetic. This time, there's company – including a witchlike coven that Swift would transfer to the Eras stage and a sweet love story for the ages.


Album: LoverYear: 2019Co-Director: Drew Kirsch


	A celebrity-filled clip – Laverne Cox! Jesse Tyler Ferguson! Ciara! Adam Rippon! Hayley Kiyoko! Billy Porter! Ru Paul! Ryan Reynolds! And most surprising, Katy Perry! – Swift's ode to LGBTQ allyship bursts with rainbow-colored sass and pride.


Album: LoverYear: 2020


	Dressed in drag, Taylor upends criticisms thrown at successful women in this lamentation on those double standards, successfully subverting the commentary she's received through the years. (With a cute, meta appearance as her director-self, asking the male lead – also her – if he can be more likeable.)


Album: MidnightsYear: 2023


	Before “The Fate of Ophelia,” Taylor kept it 100 on the land, the sea and the sky, traversing through space, the ocean and even a yellow brick road in the elaborately cinematic “Karma.”


Album: Speak Now (Taylor's Version)Year: 2023Metaphorically challenging the state of Swift's masters at the time, “I Can See You” finds Taylor Lautner, Joey King and Presley Cash breaking the singer out of a vault in a museum with plenty of audacious thrills.


Album: MidnightsYear: 2022


	In a preview of her Showgirl aesthetic, this Cinderellian tale sees “house wench” Taylor oppressed by her wicked stepmother (Laura Dern) and stepsisters (Este, Danielle and Alana Haim), only to find strength through her fairytale-esque godmother (Dita Von Teese), who teaches Swift how make the whole place shimmer. As for the prince (Jack Antonoff)? Well, she ghosts him, obviously – a diamond's gotta shine.


Album: MidnightsYear: 2023


	Swift prances around in the aesthetically retro clip, questioning the preconceived notions about her value in a relationship. All, she just wants to “stay in that lavender haze” – the dreamy happiness of content – with her partner, played by transgender activist and model Laith Ashley. (A positively progressive casting choice by Swift.)


Album: The Tortured Poets DepartmentYear: 2024


	Post Malone and Swift's chemistry quietly sizzles in the grandiose “Fortnight” that follows the progression of a tortured poet. The noirish approach compliments the fleeting and doomed love affair between the two. (And in a fabulous nod to The Dead Poets Society, Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles appear as mad scientists experimenting on the troubled heroine.)


Album: MidnightsYear: 2022


	What's better than one Taylor Swift? Three Taylor Swifts – one as the moral center, one the devil on the other's shoulder and a giant one, who represents the overwhelming “monster on the hill” and likely Swift's thoughts on her celebrity. Featuring a hilarious imagining of what her funeral – starring Mark Birbiglia, John Early as her sons and Mary Elizabeth Ellis as her daughter-in-law – would look like, the video ends with the three Swifts sharing a bottle of wine. She thinks she's the problem, but here, she takes her introspective hit to a whole new level.


Album: LoverYear: 2019Co-Director: Drew Kirsch


	With a gorgeous, mid-century modern appeal, Swift depicts a beautiful ode to devotion, floating through longing and anxiety while building the foundation that houses their passions and intimacy. (Although, she would burn it down during the Eras tour.)


Album: The Life of a ShowgirlYear: 2025


	After the spark of a flame ignites, the one-take shots of “Ophelia” race through exqusitely drawn evolutions of showgirls – a model for the painting that takes its inspiration from the Friedrich Heiser canvas of the title character (itself inspired by the Milias rendering), a burlesque performer, a go-go dancer, actresses, Busby Berkeley starlets, Vegas performers, and of course, modern pop stars – an elevated and impressive feat of filmmaking.


Album: Red (Taylor's Version)Year: 2021


	Timeless and bittersweet, Swift captures the feelings of a situationship to end all situationships – with Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien portraying a couple who weren't built to last. Forged in the personal yet universal, Swift uses all 14 minutes (expanding on the 10 from the song itself) to lay bare a story of love and betrayal – and the longing that's left at the end.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Fast & Furious star Vin Diesel will now write the feature take of Mattel Studios' Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. 


	Vin Diesel's attachment to the project as a star and a producer under his One Race Films banner was first announced in April 2021. 


	The new live-action feature film will bring to life the tabletop boxing game and its characters, Red Rocker and Blue Bomber. 


	Robbie Brenner, President of Mattel Studios and Chief Content Officer, who is also producing the movie, said, “Vin is a powerhouse storyteller with an unmatched understanding of action, heart, and world-building. His creative vision for Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is bold, human, and deeply cinematic—exactly the kind of storytelling we love at Mattel Studios.”

	Vin Diesel added, “I am excited to expand the Mattel universe by bringing this classic toy from my childhood to a modern audience by telling a story that examines the role of competition in a world often measured by strength and dominance that dares to reveal the power of compassion at its core.”


	One Race's Samantha Vincent is also producing. Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots will be overseen by Darian Greenbaum and Andrew Scannell for Mattel Studios and Vin Diesel for One Race.


	Following the massive success of Barbie at Warner Bros in 2023, which was that studio's highest grossing movie ever at $1.44 billion, Mattel Studios has up next a live-action feature take of popular toy franchise, Masters of the Universe with Amazon MGM Studios which will hit theaters on June 5, 2026. In addition next year, there's Matchbox with Apple Original Films, that pic starring John Cena. 


Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots was previously set up at Universal. 


	Vin Diesel is repped by CAA, Linden Entertainment, Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan, and Greenburg Glusker.

Haven't we already seen the best version of this movie with Real Steel?

“Vin is a powerhouse storyteller” 

Stop, stop, I'm laughing too hard.

Can someone help Mattel.

This will go smoothly and absolutely be a movie.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","Blake Lively Rejects Justin Baldoni's Move To Dismiss ‘It Ends With Us' Suit; Accuses Co-Star Of “Throwing The Kitchen Sink” At Sexual Harassment & Retaliation Claims","https://deadline.com/2025/12/blake-lively-rejects-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-dismissal-1236634734/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:00 GMT","


					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


Blake Lively says she deserves her “day in court” over the “toxic environment” Justin Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios' inner circle created during the making of It Ends With Us and the subsequent alleged retaliation inflicted upon the Another Simple Favor star.


	“In their latest effort to avoid accountability for the hostile environment they created during the production and marketing of It Ends With Us, Justin Baldoni, Jamey Heath, Steve Sarowitz, and their co-defendants ask this Court to shield them from trial, and deny Blake Lively her day in court, by throwing the kitchen sink at Lively's sexual harassment and retaliation claims,” exclaims a filing early this morning from the actress rejecting a late November motion for summary judgment by Baldoni, his execs and PR team.

	











	“Defendants' campaign to transform Lively—a mother of four with decades of experience in the industry who simply sought a safe and respectful workplace—into a “bully” who “took over” Baldoni's Film is not a defense to harassment, retaliation, defamation, or any claim Lively has advanced,” the heavily redacted 72-page document adds of what Lively's team of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Dunn Isaacson Rhee lawyers slam as “Defendants' scattershot theories.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Accusing the Wayfarer defendants and their Bryan Freedman-led legal team of enacting a strategy of “Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender” and peddling “their victimization narrative,” Lively today rejected the attempt by her IEWU co-star to toss out her allegations of rabid misconduct. 

	











	“Lively may be a movie star, but on the set of the Film, Heath and Baldoni were her bosses with a total consolidation of power as lead actor, producer, director, co-chairman, president, and CEO,” the memo document states, setting the stakes and context, from Lively's POV. “They set her schedule and her salary, appeared on and managed the set every day, were responsible for receiving and addressing HR concerns, and had the power to exert influence over Lively's working conditions. Id. Heath and Baldoni also leveraged their close friendship to ‘act with a certain degree of impunity' and cover the other's misdeeds.”


	With blacked-out sections on almost every page except the table of contents, the opposition to summary judgment comes more than six months after Baldoni's $400 million countersuit was tossed out and four months before the trial over Lively's sexual harassment and online smear campaign claims against Baldoni and gang is set to start in NYC.


	A March 9 starting trial that looks almost certain to occur, not being anywhere near a settlement at this pitched point, especially if Judge Lewis Liman deep sixes Baldoni's request to dismiss the matter. Multi-brand businesswoman Lively has stated in previous filings that she is seeking damages in the range of $500 million.


	Today and late Wednesday's filings in federal court also come nearly a year after Lively first filed her initial complaint of December 20, 2024 with the California Civil Rights Department complaint against Baldoni over what may or may not have actually gone down on the clearly troubled and Sony distributed IEWU.


	As they have before, Rainn Wilson and fellow Freedman client Sage Steele make cameos in Lively's also very heavily redacted 259-page response to Wayfarer's previously filed statement of undisputed material facts, as does Deadline and several other publications. IEWU author Colleen Hoover, who has recently lamented how the legal disputes have overshadowed her work, also gets a lot of mentions in the documents filed early this morning, but most of the context is unknown, due to heavy redactions. As before, concerns about Baldoni's behavior raised during production by IEWU co-star Jenny Slate, and a series of communications by Sony executive Ange Giannetti show up too. There are also some “famous friends,” who are likely Taylor Swift and Hugh Jackman, Lively hubby Ryan Reynolds‘ Deadpool & Wolverine co-star. 


	More significantly, the New York Post (where Melissa Nathan's sister is “a reporter at Page Six”) and People Magazine (where “at least eight articles which were favorable to Mr. Baldoni” were placed, according to Lively's response) are mentioned repeatedly, along with communications from Nathan and attorney Freedman on media coverage that ended up being favorable to Baldoni.


	Reps for Baldoni and Wayfarer did not respond to Deadline's request for comment on Lively's latest filings.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss will moderate a town hall next week with Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, for a town hall event that will air on the network on Dec. 13.


	The event will be pre-recorded before an invited studio audience in New York, with Kirk “fielding questions from young evangelicals, prominent religious leaders, and figures across the political spectrum,” per the network. It will air at 8 p.m. ET and will be streamed on Paramount+ and CBS News 24/7. 


	Kirk has taken on the leadership of Turning Point USA, the conservative organization founded by her husband.

	











	Weiss' role as moderator is a familiar one given her credential as creator of The Free Press, but it is unusual for the leader of a network news division, figures who typically stay behind the scenes.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In a statement, Weiss said, “Like so many people around the world, I will never forget the moment that Erika Kirk forgave her husband's killer. I am eager to speak to her—and thrilled to be doing so in front of a group of Americans who I know will elevate the conversation.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Pictures & Walter Hamada‘s 18hz have preemptively acquired The Littles, a new horror short from American Horror Stories producer and bestselling author Andrew Duplessie, for feature development, with Duplessie set to expand his work as writer-director.


	Written, directed and produced by Duplessie, The Littles recently premiered to a sold-out audience at New York Comic Con, with star Violet McGraw in attendance. The short follows 11-year-old Juliet, who in stubbing her toe on a loose floorboard, unwittingly sets off a series of mysterious events. As she investigates, Juliet finds herself pulled into a chilling, otherworldly encounter — one that will unravel the secrets of her home and alter her reality forever.

	











	Integrating live-action with stop-motion animation from The Nightmare Before Christmas alum Anthony Scott, the short also stars Janel Parrish (Pretty Little Liars), and Dominic Sherwood (Shadowhunters).




			Watch on Deadline		







	In a statement to Deadline, Duplessie said, “I'm thrilled to be partnering with 18hz to bring the Littles to life as a feature. Walter and Nick are true horror aficionados who immediately saw the potential and vision of the project. I've always loved the art of stop motion especially when it's combined with horror, and the response to this short has been truly inspiring. I can't wait to work with 18hz to expand this universe and show the rest of the world what lurks beneath their floorboards.”


	A filmmaker, author, and tech entrepreneur, Duplessie's debut novel, Too Scared to Sleep, was acquired by HarperCollins and Warner Bros. and reached the Barnes & Noble and Amazon bestseller lists. He began writing by posting stories on Instagram, building a large following and later writing the viral story “Mystery Dog,” which has amassed over 100 million views on YouTube. He is represented by Anonymous Content and attorney Miles Metcoff of Yorn, Levine, Barnes.


	Recently reupping its production pact with Paramount, Hamada's 18hz is next set to see the release of its Johannes Roberts horror film Primate on January 9. Formerly a DC Films chief and New Line Production EVP, Hamada first signed with the studio in November 2022. Recently producing New Line's It films and Matt Reeves' The Batman, his upcoming slate includes an untitled horror film from director André Øvredal, as well as the films Familiar and Suffer Little Children from Caye Casas and Rodrigue Huart, respectively.

Rosemont police claim they have found no video evidence in their ongoing investigation to back Tara Reid's claims of being drugged during her November visit to a Chicago hotel bar. 

“While video surveillance showed Tara Reid at the hotel bar, at no time did video show anyone tampering with or adding something to her drink,” the Rosemont Public Safety Department said in a statement Wednesday.

“We can confirm that a bartender covered her drink when she left the bar which is standard practice for bartenders to do.”

The police, however, are still waiting to receive the “American Pie” star's hospital records.

The department cannot “confirm at this time if or what specific chemical testing the hospital may have conducted.”

“We are working with Tara Reid to receive those records which she has also not received. Pending those results or further information coming forward, our detectives will follow up on those leads accordingly.” 

The message closed, saying that authorities have found “no criminal act that has been committed” and that they are not currently investigating anyone.

Following the initial investigation results, Reid doubled down on her claims she was drugged Wednesday, telling Page Six in a statement, “Bottom line is no one ends up in the hospital incapacitated for over 8 hours after a drink. Last thing I remember is having one drink and waking up in the hospital the next day without remembering anything.”

She added that it was the “scariest feeling I have ever felt.”

“I felt so helpless. This has been a horrifying experience for me that is severely affecting my mental health. I cannot sleep over this it's a very scary feeling not knowing what happened to me. I believe I was drugged. Something happened to me,” she said.

Reid, 50, who has a history of issues with substance abuse, came forward with claims that she was drugged during her Chicago visit on Nov. 24 after she was captured on video being transported out of the hotel via stretcher on Sunday morning. 

In a clip obtained by TMZ, the “Big Lebowski” actress appeared to be nearly unconscious as she was helped by a group of people into a wheelchair.

At the time, a rep for the actress told Page Six that Reid had filed a police report after the incident and was “cooperating fully with the investigation.”

“Tara is recovering and asks for privacy during this traumatic time,” the rep continued. “She also urges everyone to be careful, watch your drinks and never leave them unattended, as this can happen to anyone. She will not be making further comments at this stage.”

Reid later told TMZ that the scary incident “made me pass out for eight hours.” 

“It's just really scary. It's for all — not just girls, but for guys, for anyone. You have to really be careful with your drink,” she warned on Monday.

The “Sharknado” actress added, “The whole thing is really scary. I'm just glad that I was in a public place. … And that there was security there to help me.”

Jennifer Lopez is getting rid of the last vestiges of her relationship with Ben Affleck.

The couple, who were previously engaged in 2002 and broke up, finally wed in 2022. The following year, Lopez was spotted sporting an infinity tattoo on her ribcage with Affleck's name.

Though the relationship ended when she filed for divorce in August 2024, the permanent ink lasted well past the couple's second expiration date.

The tattoo design features an infinity symbol with an arrow shooting through it — both Lopez and Affleck's names written along the infinity lines.

Affleck also got a tattoo at that same time: two crossed arrows with both of their initials.

Fans have been abuzz about the potential removal of the singer's tattoo since the divorce. J.Lo sparked rumors in September 2024 when she appeared on the red carpet in a dress with totally cut-out sides.

The ink appeared to be completely gone, though later photos revealed it was just covered with makeup.

Fast forward to May, however, and her backless dress at the AMAs suggested that J.Lo had begun the removal process.

According to an anonymous commenter on Deuxmoi, Lopez chose to replace her existing design with a hummingbird “in place of his name.”

The snarky replies ensued, saying, “This is why you don't get someone's name tattooed on your body,” and “Hell no to Bennifer 3.0.”

In an Instagram post, Lopez shared a video from a performance this past summer; the tattoo, albeit faded, still exists.

Could she be in the process of lasering it off? 

Fans will get a better idea once the “Dinero” singer begins her upcoming residency, “Jennifer Lopez: Up All Night Live in Las Vegas,” on Dec. 30, 2025, at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

Jennifer Lopez's business attire probably wouldn't fly with your HR department.

The singer chose a chocolate-brown power suit for The Hollywood Reporter's 2025 Women In Entertainment Gala on Wednesday, but it wasn't exactly one you could wear in the workplace.

Designed by Harith Hashim, the look featured a blazer and pencil skirt that hit at mid-calf. While the skirt was tailored to an office-appropriate length, the blazer boasted a plunging neckline with a draped collar shawl, revealing J.Lo's cleavage.

In keeping with the ‘80s suiting vibes, Lopez held a Tyler Ellis brown croc envelope clutch in one hand, layered Bulgari Tubogas chokers around her neck and tortoiseshell sunglasses over her eyes.  

Lopez is no stranger to a plunging neckline, having worn one of the most iconic deep V necks with her history-making 2000 Grammy Awards Versace gown.

She put her signature twist on an office-ready staple for her latest daytime event.

Back in October, the 56-year-old performer also chose a Hashim design. This tailored-with-a-twist look included a camel-toned pencil dress with wide fur cuffs.

At the gala, Lopez was given the Equity in Entertainment Award, “honoring her work amplifying the voices of underrepresented communities in the entertainment industry,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The singer is gearing up for a Las Vegas residency, beginning with her first concert on Dec. 30.

On Tuesday, she shared a decidedly more daring look, throwing it back to a sequin flame bra and thong that she wore during her World Pride performance in Washington, DC, last summer.

She was joined by Prince William, King Charles, Queen Camilla and more for the luxurious white-tie event.

The Queen Mother and Queen Elizabeth have previously worn the crown. Though the late Queen, who died on Sep. 8, 2022, wore it only once during her reign, on a 2005 trip to Malta.

This event is the first time it has been worn in public in 20 years.

According to longtime royal jewelers, Garrard, the tiara was “crafted for Queen Victoria in 1853 under the direction of her beloved husband and consort, Prince Albert.”

“The Oriental Circlet was originally set with a collection of opals, one of Albert's favourite gemstones, and 2,600 diamonds. Later, believing that opals were unlucky, Queen Alexandra replaced them with rubies.”

Along with the royal bling, the princess wore a custom glittering blue cape gown by British designer Jenny Packham, which she paired with silver Gianvito Rossi Rania pumps in silver-silk organza ($2,695).

She accessorized with the Bespoke Maud Clutch in black satin from Anya Hindmarch ($775) and chandelier diamond earrings that originally belonged to the late Queen Elizabeth.

Of course, she also wore the Royal Family Order and the Royal Victorian Order sash and star.

The headpiece marks the fifth tiara Princess Catherinre has ever worn in public.

In 2011, she walked down the aisle wearing the Cartier Halo Tiara to marry Prince William, now 43. The princess has also been photographed wearing the Lotus Flower Tiara, the Strathmore Rose Tiara and the Queen Mary Lover's Knot Tiara.

She most recently wore the Lover's Knot Tiara in September for the state visit of President Trump and first lady Melania Trump.

In July, Middleton wore the same royal headpiece for the French state visit, marking her first tiara moment since 2023, after she resumed royal duties following her battle with cancer.

Goldie Hawn teared up as she spoke about her close friendship with the late Diane Keaton.

“She just brought so much joy, so much life, so much exuberance,” Hawn said onstage during the Women in Entertainment Gala Wednesday. “She was like lightning in a bottle.”

“There wasn't anything she couldn't do,” she continued. “There wasn't any world that she couldn't live in. She was just an extraordinary human being.”

Hawn — who starred alongside Keaton in “The First Wives Club” — broke down in tears while remembering when they lived in neighboring buildings.

“It was just the greatest thing knowing she was just below me,” Hawn, 80, said. ” … She was always on my mind, she was so close to me.”

Hawn also recalled the moment she found out the “Annie Hall” star had died.

“Then, came time when she passed, I happened to learn when I was in my backyard, and I went over to my backyard to my rose garden,” she shared. “I just looked down. She can't be gone. She just cannot be gone. No one like that should ever die.”

Keaton died on Oct. 11 and her cause of death was listed as pneumonia. She was 79 years old.

Hawn shared an emotional tribute to her on Instagram, noting that they talked about possibly living together one day.

“We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends,” she wrote. “Well, we never got to live together, but we did grow older together. Who knows… maybe in the next life.”

“Shine your fairy dust up there, girlfriend,” she added. “I'm going to miss the hell out of you.”

Hawn and Keaton's fellow “The First Wives Club” co-star Bette Midler also shared kinds words after Keaton's death.

“The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me,” Midler, 80, wrote on X.

“She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!,” she continued.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Chad Powers will live to Catfish again","https://www.avclub.com/chad-powers-renewed-hulu-season-2-glen-powell","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:24:00 GMT","

Great news for people who enjoying looking at a puffier Glen Powell, especially one who also happens to resemble a cartoon lion with a speech impediment: Hulu has confirmed that it's renewing its sports comedy series Chad Powers for a second season. The show—the only one we've ever seen in which “our main character drives a Cybertruck” constitutes a major plot point—will now get to successfully resolve its season 1 “Will this guy get to continue lying to millions of people so he can play football?” cliffhanger at the streaming service, to the deep satisfaction of several. (Presumably.)

This is all per Deadline, which reports that the series, which disgorged its six-episode first season back in September and October, will see Powell and series co-creator Michael Waldron return for another stint with the appropriately named South Georgia Catfish. The series centers on Powell as Russ Holliday, a pretty bad guy who becomes a slightly better guy after slathering himself in prosthetics to transform himself into soft-spoken weirdo “Chad Powers,” all in service of resurrecting his college football career. Initially based on an Eli Manning TV stunt, the show has scored decidedly mixed reviews with critics, with our own Meredith Hobbs Coons deriding it as “mean as shit” without even having “the decency to be funny about it.”

But, hey, nobody consults us about this kind of  thing, and the lure of having a TV show that kind of looks like Ted Lasso, if you squint—and ignore its own creators' repeated attempts to distance themselves from that concept—is presumably too juicy to pass up. In addition to Powell, Chad Powers stars Perry Mattfeld, Quentin Plair, Wynn Everett, Frankie Rodriguez, and Steve Zahn. No word on when this just-announced second season is likely to return to the streaming airwaves.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Paranormal Activity is getting Paranormal Re-activated","https://www.avclub.com/paranormal-activity-franchise-revived-james-wan","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 03:48:00 GMT","

It's been four years since the Paranormal Activity last found enough footage to make a trip to theaters. And, even then, 2021's Paranormal Activity: Next Of Kin was a pretty Hail Mary attempt at a franchise revival, appearing as it did seven years after Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension sent the series into nearly a decade of slumber. (It turns out “pivot to Amish” wasn't the instant success story that producers at Paramount and Blumhouse were hoping for.) Now, though, the low-budget horror franchise is busting out the night-vision cameras for yet another installment of lo-fi frights.

This is according to Deadline, which reports that Paramount and the merged Blumhouse-Atomic Monster will soon be reviving the series, originally created by first film writer/director/star Oran Peli. (Among other things, that means that another huge name in modern horror, James Wan, will be producing on the series for the first time, with the Conjuring mastermind joining Peli and a number of other established horror producers on the incoming film.)

What we don't have yet, though, is a premise—which has kind of always been the issue for a series that made a huge initial splash when it first arrived sporting a genuinely interesting gimmick, and then spent the next 12 years failing to find anything especially compelling to do with it. (The answer has mostly been to try to build up ever-more elaborate mythology around the films' central family and their relationship with less-imaginary-than-you'd-like friend “Tobi,” but it's notable that sequels have gotten more credit for finding weird places to stick a security camera than in their overall storytelling.) All that being said, Paranormal Activity has been very good to Paramount in terms to getting a lot of money out of very little investment, which helps explain why this eighth installment of the franchise is apparently being treated like a “priority” project right now.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Writer says his Elon/SpaceX biographical series has ""died"" at HBO","https://www.avclub.com/ashlee-vance-elon-musk-hbo-spacex-series-died","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT","

Ashlee Vance, author of one of a couple of Elon Musk biographies floating around out there—and specifically the SpaceX-focused Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, And The Quest For A Fantastic Future—has popped up on social media this week to state that a planned HBO adaptation of the series has now formally “died” at HBO.

The series was initially announced to be in development back in 2020, when Musk was in a different, arguably less-immediately-impactful-to-a-regular-person phase in his campaign to be the main character of a planetary dystopia. (We're talking two years before he bought Twitter, for instance, in case it's all turned into a time slurry slowly drizzling through your heads the way it has for us.) At the very least, it was a period of time where HBO could be forgiven for thinking they were signing on—with Channing Tatum in a producing role—for a show about some flavor of visionary, and not that guy who turns meme names into actual programs for chopping the United States' foreign aid budget into pieces.

Vance claimed in his post—on X, natch—that he and his team “Had some wonderful scripts. They were smart and funny and true to life. I imagine it would have been a massive hit.” Suggesting that people are afraid to make a project about Musk now, Vance noted that the rights to his book have now reverted to him, in case any TV studios with hagiography in their hearts and cash burning a hole in their pockets want to bite.

Interestingly, while HBO hasn't commented directly on Vance's post, Deadline does quote sources who actually say the project was passed on by the network a few years back, making it less clear why the author, who's also apparently producing projects on brain-computer interfaces and OpenAI—guy has a type, we'll give him that—is opening up about the whole thing falling apart now.

Today, in “radical self-awareness” news: Tim Meadows damn well knew, going into the release of his 2000 Saturday Night Live-based comedy movie The Ladies Man, exactly how popular the character of smooth-talking lover Leon Phelps was—and wasn't. “I knew how popular the character was,” Meadows said in a recent podcast interview about his career. “And it was not Wayne's World popular. It wasn't even A Night at the Roxbury popular.”

And while we, personally, would not be able to utter the phrase “not even A Night At The Roxbury popular” about our own work without doing immense psychic damage to ourselves—even though, Christ, it's probably true—Meadows has come to terms with the film's status over the years. Speaking to The Daily Beast‘s The Last Laugh podcast this week, the comedy veteran noted that, “The thing I learned from it was to not get caught up in worrying about the success or failure or something. Just because it wasn't a success didn't mean that it wasn't a good movie. The movie is probably 90 percent what we wanted it to be.”

(A bit of historical context: The Ladies Man reportedly brought in $13.7 million at the box office in 2000, which was, indeed, significantly less than Roxbury‘s $30 million in 1998. It did make significantly more than some more serious SNL flops like Stuart Saves His Family and It's Pat, in the grand, depressing pantheon of Saturday Night Live movies, but there are a pretty huge number of things—streaming charity marathons, tiny island nations, especially industrious magpies—that have brought in more money than It's Pat.)

In the interview, Meadows—who's currently starring in CBS's new sitcom DMV, and had a recent, very fun turn in Peacemaker—talks about hiding the Ladies Man voice for years from his SNL colleagues, having never really sought out the pressure of a recurring character despite ultimately serving for 10 years on the series. “I thought of it as something that if people found out about, I would get arrested,” Meadows joked about the voice and character of Leon Phelps. “So it was like a deep, secretive thing that I kept hidden.”

Pamela Anderson is a famously recognizable name. However, if it were up to the star, she would be known by a different moniker.

“Before the world knew Pamela Anderson, there was Pamela Hyytiäinen — a child raised on myth and magic,” according to Vogue Scandinavia. “Her Finnish grandfather, Herman Hyytiäinen, was a logger and a poet who believed in folklore, fairies, and trees that whispered secrets to each other. Between grandfather and granddaughter, a whole imaginative universe bloomed.”

“He was the closest person to me in my life,” the star said.

“Hyytiäinen was her grandfather's surname before it was changed to Anderson when the family arrived in Canada, tucking her roots behind a slightly more North American gloss,” per Vogue Scandinavia. “Still, the Nordic spirit endured.”

That's why Anderson revealed, “Sometimes I don't want to be Pamela Anderson. I want to be Pamela Hyytiäinen. I would like to change my name, but they won't let me.”

Not only did Anderson's family have a different last name, but her grandfather also taught her a different language.

“Herman taught her Finnish — or what she thought at the time to be a magical language that no one else could understand,” Vogue Scandinavia noted. “As a child, she carried a small white Finnish dictionary everywhere under her arm, learning new words to impress him. The language and connection was theirs alone.”

“It kind of left with him,” Anderson explained while noting that her grandfather passed away when she was around 11 years old.

If Anderson were to change her last name, she would be far from the only Hollywood figure to do so.

Kat Dennings' real last name is Litwack, according to People.

Dove Cameron is really Chloe Celeste Hoffman.

Vin Diesel wanted a tougher name than his own, Mark Sinclair.

Olivia Wilde was previously known as Olivia Jane Cockburn.

Meg Ryan was born as Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra.

If you met Nicki Minaj when she was younger, she might have introduced herself as Onika Tanya Maraj.

DJ (and Taylor Swift's ex) Calvin Harris is actually Adam Richard Wiles.

Jon Bon Jovi's name was originally John Francis Bongiovi Jr.

John Legend was John Roger Stephens.

The late Kirk Douglas was given the name Issur Danielovitch when he was born.

And the late Audrey Hepburn was born as Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston.

In recent years, Chris Harrison has been living his own happily-ever-after down in Austin, Texas with his wife, former “Entertainment Tonight” host and producer Lauren Zima. However, once upon a time he was the host of “The Bachelor” franchise. That gig ended, though, after he sat down for an inteview with former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay. Now, she's opened up about the infamous interview during the Tuesday, December 3, episode of “Love It or Leave It Presents: Bravo, America!” podcast.

For some background, “[i]n 2021, Lindsay interviewed longtime Bachelor and Bachelorette host Harrison, 54, while she worked as correspondent for Extra,” according to Us Weekly. “During the chat, the pair talked about Matt James, who was the show's first Black Bachelor. Lindsay brought up the drama of contestant Rachael Kirkconnell's attendance at a southern antebellum party while she was in college. (The style of party has received backlash over the years due to the era's affiliation with slavery and the Confederacy.)”

When the issue was brought up during Harrison's interview with Lindsay, he “slammed the criticism and defended Kirkconnell as a victim of cancel culture. … Harrison was subsequently let go from the show, which led to a falling out between him and Lindsay.”

“I'm known for asking direct questions, relevant questions. And Chris was there to promote, nobody even knows — some drink maybe. So it was a perfect storm,” Lindsay said of the interview. “ABC PR wasn't on the call. Warner PR wasn't on the call. It was the PR of that drink company, so there's no one to stop him and say, ‘You're going the wrong way.' It was 15 minutes of him ranting and raving.”

“He was just showing his true self, but I was sitting back, like, I know this to be you, the audience doesn't. I'm just shocked that you have the audacity to be saying this,” Lindsay recalled. 

“And then when he finished… I go to my EP, and I said, ‘Did you see that?' She said, ‘No.' I said, ‘Only air whatever he said about his promotion.' I said, ‘Put the whole thing on YouTube, unedited,'” she continued. 

She added, “And then the next day, it blew up, and I sent it to an executive at ABC, and he was like, ‘Yeah, I already saw it. It's the first thing on my desk this morning.'”

After the interview sparked a buzz, Lindsay says Harrison got in touch. “He texted me, or called me, that morning and was like, ‘Well, they're saying I'm gaslighting you.' He still didn't get it until somebody said something and apologized. And then when I tried to explain to him why it was offensive. It was dismissive.”

During Lindsay's podcast interview, she was asked by host Jon Lovett if Harrison would end up losing his “Bachelor” gig if the incident happened today.

“He would have sat out maybe, maybe he wouldn't have hosted the finale episode, and he would have been able to come back. I think he thought that for himself,” she said. “If it had not happened in February of 2021 that's when cancel culture was heightened.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Scott Wolf Drops Restraining Order, Signaling Progress With Estranged Wife Kelley Wolf","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/scott-wolf-drops-restraining-order-kelley-wolf/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 02:39:34 GMT","

In a promising sign that “Doc” star and Hallmark fan-favorite Scott Wolf is feeling hopeful about his estranged wife Kelley Wolf's progress while undergoing mental health treatment, the actor dropped his restraining order against her, People first reported on December 3, 2025. 

During a hearing on December 3, per People, a Utah judge dismissed all protective orders against Kelley, 49, after an oral request to do so was made by Scott, 57. “The case was then dismissed,” People reported, “and any protective orders issued have been declared null and void.”

It's a positive sign after months of legal proceedings and concerning updates from Kelley, which began after she announced in early June that she and Scott were separating after 21 years together. Days later, she was placed in an involuntary hold at a Utah hospital. 

After her release, Scott was granted his first temporary restraining order against Kelley on June 25. The situation continued to spiral over the next two months, leading up to Kelley's arrest on August 26 for doxxing friends and family members, including posting Scott's personal phone number and screenshots of communication with their kids. 

Kelley was charged with three misdemeanors — one count of electronic communications harassment and two counts of electronic disclosure of personal identifying information — and another restraining order was filed against her. Days later, she was charged with another misdemeanor for violating that order.  

Kelley continued to struggle in September, especially after her lawyer requested that she no longer represent the “Real World: New Orleans” alum. On September 21, Kelley was admitted to a Utah mental health hospital after making threats to her and Scott's safety, according to People. 

Multiple sources told the outlet that Kelley, who's worked as a life coach and motivational author, underwent an interview and mental health examination five days later, which prompted a judge to issue “a court-ordered minimum 60-day involuntary psychiatric hold” and required her to take prescribed medication while there to help stabilize her. 

In the meantime, Scott has stayed mostly quiet about his family's chaotic few months, but did share a sweet photo of Kelley for her birthday on October 14, wishing her a happy birthday. The “A Merry Scottish Christmas” star has also filmed new episodes of FOX's “Doc,” with his return to the series slated for January 6. 

Kelley, meanwhile, has deleted nearly all of the social media posts she made since early June, including her announcement about her separation from Scott. She has posted a handful of Instagram Stories over the last few weeks, including a selfie on November 15 in which she looked bright-eyed in a red baseball cap and denim jacket, simply writing over the photo, “Hi.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hallmark Movie to Feature the Pop Star & ‘American Idol' Alum Who Inspired It","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/lauren-spencer-smith-hallmark-christmas-movie/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:39:42 GMT","

Pop star and “American Idol” alum Lauren Spencer Smith is about to appear in a Hallmark Christmas movie — and it's one she inspired. 

On December 7, 2025, Hallmark Channel will premiere its original movie “Single on the 25th” starring network fan-favorites Daniel Lissing and Lyndsy Fonesca, with a cameo by Spencer Smith, whose 2022 song of the same name inspired the rom-com. 

In a promotional video taken on the set of Hallmark's “Single on the 25th” and shared across the network's social media, Spencer Smith said she's thrilled to be in a Hallmark movie. 

“I was over the moon,” she said of learning her song had inspired a new movie and that she would be in it. “I called my mom, I called my boyfriend, I called everyone. I'm so excited because Christmas is my favorite holiday.” 

“Honestly, every Christmas, me and my friends watch Hallmark Christmas movies,” Spencer Smith beamed, “so I'm so excited that one that I will be a part of will be part of that tradition going forward.”

Like in Spencer Smith's song, Hallmark's “Single on the 25th” is about a woman who hates being single during the holidays “because everywhere she looks, couples are kissing under the mistletoe.” 

Fonesca plays Nell, whose family cancels their holiday plans at the last minute, leaving her to try making the most of her week alone. But after an unexpected run-in with her neighbor Cooper, played by Lissing, the proud bachelor gives her some tips on enjoying single life during the holidays. 

The movie was filmed in September in Montréal, per Casting Workbook. During the shoot, Spencer Smith told Hallmark, “My experience on set so far has been amazing. Everybody is so kind. You know, the lead actors just feel like family and friends. It's so cute, and I love it.” 

While her song “Single on the 25th” is a tear-jerker that “everyone can relate to,” Spencer Smith told Hallmark she loves that the movie dives deeper into the story and has a “happy ending.” 

During season 18 of “American Idol” in 2020, Spencer Smith advanced to the Hawaii round as part of the Top 20, but the pandemic soon shut down live production, forcing the contestants and judges to appear from their homes for the rest of the season. Spencer Smith was eliminated after her first at-home performance, along with eight other contestants.

The Canadian-born songstress had a very different look back then, and used the rest of the pandemic to hone her songwriting skills and find her voice as an artist, telling the Toronto Star two years later that being eliminated from the show “definitely was a kick-start to ‘Yeah, I'm gonna prove everybody wrong.'”

She certainly did. By the summer of 2022, Spencer Smith had two massive hits with “Fingers Crossed” and “Flowers,” which has over 47 million views on YouTube. That led to a bidding war between major record labels, according to Variety. She eventually signed a record deal with Republic and Island Records, and a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music.

Spencer Smith released her sophomore album, “The Art of Being a Mess,” in June. After recently touring Europe and Australia, she'll kick off the U.S. and Canadian leg of her tour in early February. 

“Single on the 25th” premieres on Hallmark Channel on December 7 at 8 p.m. Eastern time and will be available to stream the next day via Hallmark+.

Since completing his breakout drama series “Sons of Anarchy” in 2014, Kurt Sutter has had a hard time finishing what he starts. After one season, the writer-producer beat FX to the punch by self-canceling his low-rated and poorly reviewed follow-up show, “The Bastard Executioner,” before being ousted from the “Sons of Anarchy” spinoff “Mayans M.C.” prior to Season 3 in the wake of cast and crew complaints of a hostile work environment.

Despite initially blaming Disney for “creative scrutiny” so over-the-top he “feared for the creative future of storytelling,” Sutter's first foray outside of FX hasn't gone any better. Netflix's “The Abandons,” a period Western about two rival families warring over land in the mid-1850s, didn't even finish production with its creator, writer, and showrunner still on board. Sutter left his own series with just three weeks left in production amid reports that his initial 100-minute pilot caused Netflix executives to question the show's direction. Reshoots were ordered, the original 10 episodes were cut down to seven, and the resulting first season is so hollowed out (four of the seven episodes clock in under 39 minutes), it's difficult to tell what greater ambition the series might've once sought.

Still, what's alarming about “The Abandons” — which ranks up there with Joss Whedon's “The Nevers” as titles so bad they act as their own harbingers of doom — isn't confined to what happened behind the scenes, but also how it feels to actually watch it.

 










The released footage carries all the markings of a carved-up turkey, from fleeting, inexplicable appearances from recognizable cast members to vexingly incomplete sequences. And yet, context aside, “The Abandons” often feels like standard-fare streaming slop: Shallow arcs are stretched past their breaking points, clichés are deployed faster and more freely than bullets in a shootout, and the talented leads are mainly there to convince viewers what they're saying is worth taking seriously. (Or, even more cynically, to make things easy on Netflix's vaunted algorithm. “If you liked Gillian Anderson in ‘Sex Education'...” please don't watch “The Abandons.”)

Anderson stars as Constance Van Ness, a wealthy widow whose lucrative mining operation drives the local economy. Ruthless and respectable, Constance is the face of early American capitalism: a woman so blinded by her wealth she'll order people killed in the morning and then spend her evening arguing the land she's after isn't about money; it's a matter of “survival.”

This land is known as Jasper Hollow, an expansive ranch near Constance's mines that Fiona Nolan (Lena Headey) currently calls home. The former nanny was gifted her little slice of heaven by her late employer as thanks for nursing him back to health once. (He died later, from something else, I guess.) Now, she lives there with her grown, adopted children, Elias (Nick Robinson) and Dahlia Teller (Diana Silvers), Albert Mason (Lamar Johnson), and Lilla Belle (Natalia Del Riego).

 










When the story begins, Constance has been harassing Fiona for more than a year. She made multiple offers to buy Jasper Hollow and, once rejected, resorted to less diplomatic means of procurement. For instance, one morning Fiona wakes to discover her cattle is out of their pen and being steered by masked cowboys toward a cliff. Her family's quick actions save most of the herd, but they're helpless to keep Constance from squeezing the ranch again tomorrow, or the next day, or the one after that, until Fiona hands over her land or dies trying to hold onto it.

In their respective stances toward family and life, Fiona and Constance represent two disparate yet overlapping visions of the American way. Constance prioritizes her own family over anyone and anything else. She cares about the community only as far as it continues to support her economic “needs,” and her only way forward in life is via perpetual expansion. (Ah, capitalism.) Fiona puts her family first, too, but to her — an Irish immigrant invited in by strangers — family is an inclusive status that's earned rather than inherited. Such a malleable interpretation infuriates Constance, who repeatedly screams about being a “true mother” compared to Fiona, who's merely a fraud. 

Here, though, the cracks in “The Abandons” start to show. Constance, for the most part, is a cartoon villain lent legitimacy by Anderson's commanding presence (although anyone with an ear for accents won't find her performance quite as convincing). So why are there contradictory scenes emphasizing her kindness and generosity, like when she finds the local kids a proper school teacher? They don't fit next to the many more scenes of her torturing and murdering people (including young women), and the rest of her arc doesn't justify an understanding of Constance any deeper than the black hat she often sports. Might they be glimpses of a more well-rounded character left on the cutting room floor, who only exists now as a ghostly implication? Who's to say, but it's a sin of omission that strikes too often, rendering the ensemble flat and bizarre rather than sturdy and complex.

 










Other perplexing abnormalities include an abrupt scene where Headey's antiheroine starts shouting at God so suddenly you nearly miss the blasphemy; Patton Oswalt popping up just long enough for you to think, “Hey, is that Patton Oswalt?” before he disappears sans explanation; then there are the sparsely populated battles, mixed metaphors, and inconsistent levels of violence. At one point, a horse and rider jump over a ravine, and the rider is pulled to safety, but the horse just… vanishes. You have to assume the poor steed fell to its death, but not a word is lent toward confirming as much, let alone a shot of the fallen stallion. Lest you think I'm angling to see more bloody corpses onscreen, the series still makes time to watch a man fall from the top of a mountain to his splat on a rock. You can almost hear the accountants arguing over which special effects shots they're willing to pay for.

“The Abandons,” clearly, was just dumped on Netflix to justify its cost, and the finale's perfunctory cliffhanger all but confirms it. As the credits roll, it's easy to imagine an executive sighing and saying, “Welp, good enough.” Yet looking back now, with a few hours hindsight, the series doesn't feel all that unique. Sutter's show, if you can still call it that, is demonstrably worse than plenty of recent television, but it's not markedly inferior to a number of programs whose creative team sticks around from start to finish.

 










I didn't hate myself for watching “The Abandons” like I did after finishing Ryan Murphy's latest “Monster.” I didn't question my sanity in the same way “The Morning Show” makes me do every single season. And I'm not convinced it's any more deleterious to popular culture than the junky, smooth-brained “content” regularly churned out and immediately forgotten, a la “Untamed,” “The Sandman,” and “The Waterfront.” Maybe it lacks the polish provided by their financial resources, but the end result is close enough to join their undistinguished (and indistinguishable) club.

Despite its contentious creation, the true tragedy of “The Abandons” is that even in pieces, it still serves the same function as all those other shows: to make slop so prevalent, viewers won't be able to separate the bad from the abandoned.

“The Abandons” premieres Thursday, December 4 on Netflix. All seven episodes will be released at once.

“Committed to the bit” may be the perfect way to describe “Fackham Hall,” the new satirical historical comedy written by brothers Jimmy and Patrick Carr — in collaboration with Steve and Andrew Dawson and Tim Inman — and directed by Jim O'Hanlon. 

Marrying the attention to detail and luxuriousness of a period drama like “Downton Abbey” or “Upstairs Downstairs” with the stupidity of a Monty Python or ZAZ film, “Fackham Hall” delivers just over an hour and a half of nonstop gags in the form of puns, wordplay, bodily humor, and slapstick stunts. And yet, it also somehow finds time for a dizzying amount of story.

Following a favorite BBC miniseries storyline, the 1930s-set film takes place primarily at a massive English manor. There, the put-upon oldest daughter of an aristocratic family has to choose between marrying out of duty or desire. After her flighty younger sister (Emma Laird) runs from the altar and into the arms of the local manure man, Rose Davenport (Thomasin McKenzie) becomes the next in line to marry their unappealing cousin (Tom Felton),  the presumed heir to Fackham Hall. But that plan, worked up by Lord and Lady Davenport (Damian Lewis and Katherine Waterston), gets complicated when a handsome pickpocket named Eric (Ben Radcliffe) mistakenly lands a job at the estate and sets his sights on Rose.

The affair grows less decorous in farcical scenes of upstairs and downstairs life — kitchen staff toiling away on blunts, a trigger-happy shooting party, and cockney pub patrons breaking out in song — and the various side plots. At one point, the film takes a sharp turn into “Gosford Park” territory, introducing a murder, a diligent but hapless inspector to solve the crime, and more succession talk. But even before that, a dizzying gallery of characters pop in to satirize period drama tropes or — like a fictional J.R.R. Tolkien composing Orkish — British culture at large. 

The film is bursting with witticisms, pop culture references, cheap gags, and signs scrawled with various puns, including “Tailor Swift,” to varying comic success. With nearly 280 jokes crammed in, according to the writers' count, there's barely time to digest the jest before it's on to the next bid for a laugh.  

That's not to say that the film's over-the-top approach to comedy doesn't work, or that it hasn't been done before. Much like “Airplane” or “The Naked Gun,” “Fackham Hall” succeeds because it effectively skewers its target genre, and its top-tier actors know how to deliver a joke to its furthest possible endpoint.

 










Like much of the supporting cast, Lewis and, especially, Waterston capitalize on the fact that they're just as at home in a serious period drama as anything else, playing Lord and Lady Davenport straight enough to make their ridiculous behavior land. Meanwhile, McKenzie and Radcliffe share a winsome screwball chemistry, literally falling over themselves and each other to profess their love. But even with actors who understand comedic styles and timing, “Fackham Hall” wouldn't work as well without the hall itself.  

The effort put into bringing to life the bustling fictional manor, which is actually an ancestral home in Liverpool, is remarkable given that we're talking about a film that thrives on bathroom humor. From the cramped servants' quarters filled with everyday items to the gilded, richly carpeted upstairs spaces and the garments that go with each, the level of craftsmanship rivals that of a big-budget period drama, while still including farcical details, like a wonky melting snowman at the grand entrance, to keep it in a certain realm.  

 










The relentless spoofing is, fortunately, buttressed by a convincing backdrop for marrying British comedy to the historical drama. It's all lovingly shot by director of photography Philipp Blaubach and polished to a degree that might even send Julian Fellowes into admiration. Those aspects of the bit — relentlessly pursued from the opening credits to the final scene — keep the film moving and energized, with enough reason for the audience to still be looking around for jokes 100, 200, or nearly 300 in.

A Bleecker Street release, “Fackham Hall” opens in theaters on Friday, December 5.

Breathing forcefully. In, out. In, out. Finding release. It's no surprise that a choirgirl film would begin at choir practice, but the black screen at the start of “Little Trouble Girls” is more concerned with what precedes the singing: a rhythmic, pulsing exhalation that borders on the sexual. There's a deep connection in the breathing we hear, a physical harmony these unseen singers share as they connect with their own bodies too. And then silence, suddenly, as a religious illustration of what appears to be a vulva appears on screen. The image is taken from a small 14th-century prayer book made for the Duchess Juta of Luxembourg. and what looks like female anatomy is actually supposed to depict Christ's wound with various tools of his torture and punishment placed around it. But the sexual connotations are entirely deliberate, of course; to believe in Jesus is to be promised a life reborn, yet the vulva is where life itself begins.  With such a charged and curious start, it soon becomes clear that Urška Djukić's directorial debut isn't just another Catholic schoolgirl coming-of-age story. For one thing, it's softer than you might expect, more tender than shameful, although it can be unpredictable too, often driven by a wild and lustful energy. That's just as true of the narrative as it is of the 16-year-old girl at its heart. Before we meet Lucija (Jara Sofija Ostan), her whispers creep in first while the image of Christ's wound lingers, hushed and secret with a religious fervor. New sounds emerge then as the camera holds close, first to Lucija's ear and then others close by. Saliva, a yawn, even the sound of hair being twirled crackles with intensity thanks to Julij Zornik's stark sound design. It's intense to the point of discomfort, which is about right if I recall even a fraction of what it feels like to experience puberty firsthand.

That potential for turbulent change is hastened when Lucija and a fellow student named Ana-Maria (Mina Švajger) end up on a special choir trip together for a week in Northern Italy. The convent they stay in is gorgeous, complete with a thick olive tree Lucija can't stop gazing at in the courtyard. That is, until one of the semi-clothed workmen and his thick muscles catch her eye. The once-sheltered Lucija is suddenly thrust into a heady mix of intense choir rehearsals and barely suppressed longing, plus candid games of truth-or-dare and even spin-the-bottle after lights out, which stirs something else in her connection to Ana-Maria.  When Ana-Maria dares Lucija to “passionately kiss the most beautiful girl in the convent,” is she in awe of the smooch Lucija gives to the Virgin Mary (in marble statue form), or is she perhaps a little jealous? Tensions simmer throughout their convent visit, thrumming just barely below the surface. It's there in the heat the girls feel spying on the workmen as they go swimming. It's there in the choirmaster's endless irritation at the relentless noise their building work creates. And it's there in the tangle of hormones the choir girls must navigate once they're thrust in such close quarters together. To do so in such a strictly religious environment heightens every feeling, the churning mass of erotic charge that Djukić embodies in sanctified imagery throughout. What could have been a generic sexual awakening circumvents tradition and expectation with surprise developments and increasingly sensual turns. Even when the film toys with cliche, as it does with multiple time-lapse montages of flowers in bloom, it's still in keeping with Lucija's viewpoint, to which Djukić becomes so perfectly attuned. Few films in recent memory have so perfectly captured a queer sexual awakening on the precipice of possibility, almost overwhelmed with the tantalizing prospects that this new adult world has to offer. From the singing to the silence that comes when Lucija's lost in thought and desire, Djukić expertly crafts a tangible atmosphere of yearning that aches with youthful restlessness.  So too does Ostan who navigates Lucija's emerging libido with a wide-eyed innocence on the tipping point of something revelatory and even ethereal. Her sensitive, vulnerable performance anchors every scene, shifting little by little into a newfound maturity by the end. Švajger is just as good playing her more popular friend Ana-Maria whose flirtatious posturing belies the truth of her age and experience. What could have been a standard mean girl role is anything but in Djukić's delicate, capable hands. Because “Little Trouble Girls” might be deliberately adolescent in its outlook, but the result speaks to a maturity rarely found in teen features of its ilk, as tight in its focus as it is dreamy in its longing for epiphanies of both a physical and spiritual nature. As such, Slovenian cinema has found a promising new voice in Djukić whose choirgirl debut prioritizes the force and power of young female voices all too often silenced by patriarchal institutions. 

Kino Lorber will release “Little Trouble Girls” in NYC on Friday, December 5. It will open in Los Angeles on Friday, December 12.

Karly Hartzman and MJ Lenderman get about halfway through his song “Wristwatch” when someone in the crowd at Third Man Records' Blue Room tries to sing along. “I got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome,” Lenderman sings, and a voice from the audience harmonizes loudly—well, loudly enough to be captured by 1955 Scully lathe—on those last two words. Lenderman released Manning Fireworks just two weeks before this show in September 2024, and a tidal wave of raves and profiles is still crashing around him, shining a spotlight on every aspect of his life, including his recent breakup with Hartzman. People are understandably psyched to see him in such an intimate setting, and they want to sing along.

As valiantly as that audience member tries to will it into existence, that big moment in “Wristwatch” never arrives. Lenderman's Himbo Dome boast is hardly a moment at all, but in this case merely a lyric delivered against an electric guitar strum—the definition of anticlimactic. The sing-along never materializes, and that enthusiastic voice fades away awkwardly in disappointment or embarrassment or just the dawning recognition that this is not that kind of show.

These few seconds demonstrate the shortcomings of Live at Third Man Records, for which Hartzman and Lenderman strip their songs down to the bones. They pare away the defining traits of both Wednesday and the Wind—crunching guitars, weeping pedal steel, and pounding drums—but they neglect to add anything particularly compelling in their place. There are some moments that hit hard with a ragged kind of glory: when their guitars get tangled up on “She's Leaving You,” when their voices veer off in different directions on “TLC Cage Match,” when Hartzman puts some English on the word “fuckin'” in “Feast of Snakes.” But she and Lenderman run through it all at a slack dirge, with every song played at roughly the same tempo and most of them losing steam as they proceed. It's about as exciting as watching a tire deflate.

That is unexpected and wildly disappointing, considering that they are two of the most distinctive songwriters and bandleaders working today, colliding a range of left-of-center influences—Vic Chesnutt, Drive-By Truckers, John Prine—into songs that traffic in skewed imagery and complex ideas. Lenderman can be sly and evasive, favoring second-person pronouns that sound accusatory even after you realize he's usually talking to himself. Hartzman is much more traditionally confessional, almost always writing in first person as she traces complicated scenarios across multiple storylines (similar to the Truckers' Mike Cooley). Both are aces with a turn of phrase that leavens extreme pathos with humor. They open this Blue Room set with 2018's “How Do You Let the Love Into the Heart That Isn't Split Wide Open,” and the song is barely even a minute of them singing that long title. It's pretty funny in its matter-of-factness, a meta-commentary on love songs—at least in its original incarnation. In this setting, however, it's over before it even registers as a song, which makes it less of a stakes-defining introduction and more of an awkward throat-clearing.

Assembling a set short enough to fit on two sides of a record, they draw from the darker corners of their small catalog, mixing in Wednesday songs with Lenderman songs. There are two tracks from their 2021 EP Guttering, one non-album single based on a Harry Crews novel, and one from Lenderman's 2021 solo album Ghost of Your Guitar Solo. And, of course, there are several from Manning Fireworks and Wednesday's Rat Saw God. That vaults-clearing approach, however, lends Live at Third Man Records a finality that the duo perhaps didn't intend and the music can't uphold.

Even more than a year later, it's impossible to ignore everything that was happening around this show. Just six months earlier, Hartzman and Lenderman ended their six-year romantic relationship, officially breaking up in a bar in Kyoto. Hartzman took that heartache into the studio as Wednesday recorded Bleeds, and her account of recording “That's the Way Love Goes” is as harrowing as the song itself. But the news was publicly announced during the promotional cycle for Manning Fireworks (“I guess I should mention me and Karly broke up,” Lenderman told The New Yorker), so when they were standing together on the Blue Room stage, it was still fresh.

Was it a relief to share their secret? Did it add new complications to their professional lives? Were they still trying to figure it out? Live at Third Man Records arrives freighted with unbearable weight, but their set gives nothing away. It doesn't need to feed gossip to be a good live album, but there's a strange and unsatisfying self-consciousness to the proceedings, as if they'd both learned very quickly to be more guarded. When Hartzman tells the audience they're going to play a few numbers even after they stop recording, she adds, “I'ma talk probably a lot more when I know it's not going to be permanent.” No doubt that's the better set, the unrecorded one—when they can shed all that weight and everybody can sing along.

Correction: The 1955 Scully lathe used at Third Man Records' Blue Room is not the same Scully lathe personally owned by Jack White.

Few artists appreciate the joy of a late-night drive like Karri. With last year's Late Night Slider Music and its newly released sequel, SLIDER II, the San Francisco native has recreated the atmosphere of a midnight cruise while cautiously emerging from the world of underground R&B. He's been backed by Drake and longtime friend Chubbs, who signed Karri to his PFL Records imprint. At first, Karri mostly stuck to his “Lo' N Slo'” sound, which pairs lo-fi production with slurred, woozy vocals. Now he's sharpened his approach by pairing those vocals with brighter production that gives room for more emotion and color: It's like he realized the destination is just as important as the drive.

Karri isn't looking to reinvent the wheel with SLIDER II, but he does find new ways to expand his approach. SLIDER II begins with “Crashout,” a minute-long vent session that cuts deep over the somber strums of a guitar. “That nine-to-five ain't got you working/Just clock out cause you worked my last nerve,” he sings. His vocals are bare, as if they were sung into a voice memo for future use, lending a new sense of vulnerability for his music. “Unconditional Interlude” pairs Karri and Pimmie, a growing interlude specialist and $ome $exy $ongs 4 U feature standout, as a swooning couple. Their voices are stern and gentle until a climatic repeat of the chorus breaks the tension. With Karri's echoing affirmation of unconditional love, it's the only moment on the record when things feel certain.

SLIDER II also marks a development for Karri's production, offering more vibrancy without completely steering away from his comfort zone. Produced by Noel Cadastre, “Not a Romantic” cruises as Karri's Auto-Tuned vocals pierce through an echoing bass with the chill of an ice pack to the neck. Echoing organ-like synths swing in like a gust of wind behind, adding a jolt of life into what would've otherwise been another dose of dark sky soliloquies. But it's not always so melancholy. “Go,” with Kehlani, brings the Bay Area bounce to the forefront by sampling E-40's “Tell Me When to Go,” making it the most fun and high-spirited song in Karri's catalog.

With these tone shifts comes a sense of optimism. Mack Keane's shimmering production on “Time Again” contrasts with Karri's pleas to an unrequited love, and though the metaphors may be cheesy (“Only one that told me nice guys finish last/And all these bright skies can turn to ash”), they showcase a singer swept off his feet and head over heels in love. You get a sense of where Karri's mind wanders to during his nighttime drives. Where Late Night Slider Music dwelled on the pain, SLIDER II looks toward the future. Even though he still thrives under dark skies, Karri makes it a point to show us that there's still life under the stars.

Every so often, an outsider manages to repurpose the tools of hip-hop with enough style and charisma to render questions of authenticity totally irrelevant: “Ginseng Strip 2002,” “Pop the Glock,” “Gucci Gucci”. “MAKGEOLLI BANGER,” by the Korean hyperpop artist Effie, might be the latest entry in this storied lineage. While the song's basic outline might seem generic—a carefree party girl anthem soundtracked by fluorescent hyperpop—Effie's performance makes the track feel singular. Slipping fluidly between Korean and English, she raps effervescently, borrowing slang and references with no regard for borders. She drinks makgeolli (sparkling rice wine) until she passes out; she feels like Yung Lean; she needs her boy to speak Chinese; she says “bang bang,” like she's Chief Keef; she's not sorry for her sins. The chorus feels defiantly celebratory and is fittingly punctuated by the sound of fireworks launching. This is music that can make you feel invincible for just under three minutes, a song as fizzy and intoxicating as its namesake drink.

Effie has been making pop music for the better part of five years, though her early work, which was both slicker and more subdued, had far less personality. This may have been due in part to her choice in producers; pullup to busan 4 morE hypEr summEr it's gonna be a fuckin moviE is her first release working exclusively with the kinetic Korean-American producer kimj. After working extensively with American artists including NBA Youngboy, Rod Wave, Che, and glaive, kimj is now extending his reach into the emerging Korean hyperpop scene, producing for artists like the Deep. He draws a great deal of inspiration from PC Music—specifically A.G. Cook's production—a sound that admittedly feels a bit stale in the post-BRAT era. (Even hyperpop's biggest mainstream star is moving on.) But his colorful, chaotic beats seem to draw Effie out of her shell. She could sound almost clinical on previous releases: demure melodies, clean production, a touch of Auto-Tune. But she brings a surplus of energy to these songs—rapping, singing, shouting, and even pushing some of her vocals to the brink of unhinged, like the monkey howls at the close of  “CAN I SIP 담배.” In a sea of polished K-pop stars, she sounds unrestrained—her voice grimy and compressed—and gloriously messy.

Her perspective seems to have evolved alongside her sound. While she initially adopted a detached, enigmatic posture (she cites Drain Gang as an early inspiration), these days, she sounds more like a flippant child of pop culture who's equally fluent in Korean sensibilities and American hip-hop technique. Rapping in Korean on songs like “More Hyper,” she slides into different flows and fills the gaps in kimj's chiptune barrage with squealed ad-libs that recall Young Thug. Effie sang and rapped largely in English until recently; she told Dazed earlier this year that she finds it challenging to sound fluid in her native tongue due to Korean's syllabic structure. On these new songs, however, she seems to unlock a previously unseen nimbleness. Now, lines that begin in English sometimes end in Korean and vice versa; she makes stitching different languages and cadences into a single flow sound effortless.

pullup to busan 4 morE hypEr summEr it's gonna be a fuckin moviE only runs about 13 minutes, but Effie manages to cover an impressive amount of ground in that time. On the rage rap number “2025기침,” she barks her lines one syllable at at time over a crunchy, blown-out beat. She coins a new way to bum a smoke on the wobbly, playful “CAN I SIP 담배,” (which translates to “Can I sip the cigarette?”), punctuating her bars with gasps. “LET'S FIND A GOOD MANAGER” is bouncy and shot through with sunny optimism: hyperpop meets pop-punk. Meanwhile, “thankie thankie,” which closes the EP, is sentimental and bite-sized; its spoken-word vocals sound like a late-night phone call.

The Korean music industry has achieved worldwide domination through brutal efficiency, producing an endless stream of impossibly slick, endlessly digestible pop—the sort of music that PC Music artists were cheekily imagining a decade ago. While Effie and kimj are clearly influenced by both of those camps, their end goal doesn't seem to be either an imitation or a critique. With these six songs, they present a vision of what Korean pop could become: conversant instead of extractive in its relationship to hip-hop, texturally abrasive, mildly sleazy in the mold of blog house. On pullup to busan, Effie sounds like a 22 year-old having fun with her friends, but also like something more: a prototype for a different kind of global pop star.

	After the shocking murder of the Notorious B.I.G. in March 1997, Sean Combs planned a send-off fit for a king. But once he learned of the steep cost, Combs decided to bill the entire cost of Biggie's funeral back to his estate, the label's co-founder alleged in a new Netflix documentary. 


	Meanwhile, Combs pretended he was personally paying for the extravagant funeral, Kirk Burrowes said in Sean Combs: The Reckoning, which premiered Tuesday. “He was gonna make the funeral be a recoupable charge to Biggie in death,” Burrowes said. “Sean, doing a big show looks good on him. But he's not gonna tell the world that Biggie was gonna pay for it.”


	The Notorious B.I.G (real name Christopher Wallace), was shot to death in Los Angeles on March 9, 1997 — just six months after his West Coast friend turned rival Tupac Shakur was similarly gunned down in Las Vegas. (Wallace's murder remains unsolved, while known L.A. gang leader Duane “Keefe D” Davis is set to stand trial next year for his alleged role in Shakur's death. He has pleaded not guilty.) 

	











	On March 18, 1997, thousands of fans packed the streets to pay their respects to the Brooklyn rapper, as a hearse with his coffin inside rolled through the borough. The entire Bad Boy family, including Wallace's wife, Faith Evans, and his group Junior M.A.F.I.A., were in attendance at the star-studded funeral at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on the Upper East Side.

	Passing off the cost of the funeral was not the only shady move Combs pulled after Wallace's death, Burrowes claimed. Combs allegedly tried to change some of the terms of Wallace's recording contract posthumously.

	“Sean wanted me to change the agreement to more favorable terms for Bad Boy, and [Wallace's] family and mother would not know,” Burrowes said. “And since [Wallace] had signed the agreement, [Combs] wanted those changes to come from out of the center of the agreement and have those pages replaced with the other terms. I said, ‘That's not right. I'm not doing it.'” A few months later, Burrowes was fired. 


	And when it came to a Rolling Stone cover opportunity in 1997, Combs advocated for himself while Burrowes pushed for Wallace. “I was telling Sean, ‘Let's make it Biggie. You still have a chance [for a cover in the future],'” Burrowes previously told Rolling Stone. “He's like ‘No, he's dead. I'm putting out [Combs' debut album, No Way Out] in July. I need to be on the cover of Rolling Stone.”

Jenni Rivera's youngest son, Johnny López, always wanted to revive La Gran Señora with a full banda reimagining. But when Rolling Stone named the 2009 album one of the Best Albums of the 21st Century earlier this year, he knew it was time to give it to the people.


	On Thursday night, Rivera's estate will release the 2025 banda edition of La Gran Señora, featuring hits like “Ya Lo Sé” and “No Llega El Olvido” — this time backed by full banda arrangements on every track, just as she performed them live. The release arrives ahead of the 13th anniversary of Rivera's tragic death on Dec. 9, 2012, in a plane accident.


	“Over the last two years of her life, she performed many of the songs from that album live with a banda, but she never had the chance to record them in the studio,” López tells Rolling Stone. “They carried a different impact and allowed her to sing them in the style she felt most comfortable with. Now, 16 years later, we have her full Banda version of the album for listeners to enjoy and experience.”

	











	López served as the creative director for the album, aiming to honor the essence of his mom's original recordings while incorporating new production and instrumentation that felt more aligned with her style of performing them. 


	“I want to make it clear we never have the intention of ever releasing anything musically using AI,” López wrote on X ahead of the album's release. “Any Jenni recordings that are released by us will always be 100% authentic.”

	











	He tapped Luciano Luna as a producer for the project and even added small tidbits — like her iconic phrases “¿Y me estás oyendo, vieja pioja?” on “La Gran Señora” — that weren't on the original recording. López also added “Yo Soy Una Mujer,” featuring previously unreleased audio recorded by Rivera back in 2008. The album also includes Rivera's Spanglish cover of Latino country star Freddy Fender's “Before the Next Teardrop Falls,” mixing both banda with the country essence of the original song with the sound of steel guitar.

As a music fan I'm so l excited for the fact that this album will have physicals 😍Pre-Order goes live this Friday! pic.twitter.com/bCTkkzrzIp


	“Many thanks to my brother Johnny López, who believed in this project from the very beginning,” says Jacqie Rivera, who heads Jenni's estate. “He is, without a doubt, her number one fan, and his dedication has been invaluable every step of the way.”

	López says he approached the album in the same way Rivera did her last album, Joyas Prestadas, which she released as both a “Pop” and “Banda” version. The album also follows 2023's Misión Cumplida, which included Rivera's unreleased covers and a collaboration with her daughters Chiquis and Jacque on “Pedacito de Mi,” one of her unfinished recordings.


	“My biggest dream for it is that it causes another Banda wave. It has that potential,” López told Rolling Stone at the time, with Chiquis adding: “The banda queen is back, baby!”

Gwen Stefani talked about No Doubt's upcoming Sphere residency and hoping to make it “really nostalgic” for fans during a visit on Wednesday on The Tonight Show.


	“We're excited,” Stefani told Jimmy Fallon. “We did Coachella, and it was so unbelievably amazing, and we're kinda talking for a while — we do everything slow — but we were talking for years again, trying to find that thing that would be as good, and I think the Sphere is the future, you know what I'm saying? It's kind of a cross between a concert and a movie.”


	Stefani then talked about what vibe the band is going for with the Sphere residency. “I think the goal — I mean it instantly sold out; I think we have six more shows left — I want people to come and make it feel really nostalgic, like they're back in time, like ‘Remember this? Remember this, guys? This is what we did together,'” Stefani said of the fans. “They're a big part of our lives, and we want to see them in Vegas.”

	











	While No Doubt's Sphere shows won't take place until May 2026, the band is already deep in the planning stages for the shows due to the sheer amount of preparation required to stage concerts at the Las Vegas venue.

A
 beat-up truck with dark windows and no license plates pulls into the main market of Miragoâne, a hardworking coastal town in Haiti's southern peninsula. The no-nonsense government commissioner, Jean Ernest Muscadin, steps out into the fierce August glare and shoulders his rifle for a patrol. Bald, clean-shaven, and muscled enough to fill the sleeves of his shirt, he walks with quick and purposeful strides, accompanied by his squad of enforcers — a mix of civilian henchmen and police officers in tactical gear and balaclavas. Word of Muscadin's arrival ricochets through the warren of street stalls, and supporters rush out to greet him with a flood of raw emotion. Men clutch his hands and whisper praise in his ear. A woman kisses him on the cheek; others break into sudden fits of clapping and dancing. Several children trail behind him, wide-eyed. Young and old, they all exclaim the same thing: Papa cheri! Dear father! Our father is here! 


	With the Haitian state effectively collapsed, Muscadin has made a name for himself across the country and the diaspora for a zero-tolerance approach to crime fighting that has largely insulated the south from the gang terror emanating from the capital, Port-au-Prince. Although his official duties are to prosecute crimes — initiating legal proceedings, forwarding criminal complaints to a judge — the United Nations and Haitian human-rights investigators allege the 49-year-old commissioner has acted as judge, jury, and executioner, summarily killing dozens of purported gang members himself. And he's doing so in plain sight: Social media channels are rife with videos of crowds gawking at Muscadin victims left roadside to send a message, their blood pooling on the ground. “The Great South will always be a graveyard for gangsters,” he's fond of saying on camera. 

	











	Muscadin's critics say his Dirty Harry-style tactics are degrading what's left of the state, making him scarcely any different from the gangsters he's hunting down. “He has begun to drift, and since the state doesn't have the capacity to intervene to stop him, he's entering a spiral,” says Himmler Rebu, a retired Haitian army officer. But in a climate of near-anarchy, the rogue commissioner's harsh brand of justice has struck a deep chord among a population that is taking matters into its own hands out of desperation. In the lawless vacuum that followed the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, vigilantes have fought back alongside police in a widespread movement known as Bwa Kale (street slang in Haitian Creole for “erection”), slaughtering hundreds of suspected gang members across the country with machetes, rocks, gasoline, and matches.

	No place epitomized the spirit of anti-gang resistance more than the working-class neighborhood of Solino, in Port-au-Prince. Though it lacked a domineering Muscadin-like figure, the densely packed bowl of concrete and tin-roofed homes was home to a staunch brigade of vigilantes that guarded entry and exit points around the clock by the light of trash-can fires, allowing residents some peace of mind. Children walked to school unaccompanied. Kompa music played late into the night at street bars. And as the gangs overran other parts of the city, extending their reign of murder, rape, and extortion, the local soccer field became a sanctuary for the swelling ranks of internally displaced. “It was a beautiful neighborhood,” recalls Stephanie Luma, a lifelong resident. “If you came at any time of the day — 1, 2, 3 a.m. — you would feel at ease and find anything you needed to eat.”


	The standoff began to shift in late 2023 after the two largest gang coalitions, the G9 and the G-Pep, ended their blood feud and formed an alliance called Viv Ansanm (“Live Together”) to oust the government. Early the next year, while then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry was out of the country, the alliance launched an offensive in Port-au-Prince that freed nearly half of the prison population, shut down the airport, and temporarily closed the port. Solino, a gateway to one of the city's largest commercial corridors and other vital areas, became the gangs' strategic focal point. Residents were increasingly struck by gunfire, including Luma's husband, Kendy, a shoe vendor who was shot dead on his way home from work. Multiday sieges stoked fears of an imminent takeover, compelling her and her daughter to flee during the night. “In the morning, when we returned, they would start shooting again,” she says. “It went on like that until we were forced to flee for good.”

	After the November 2024 killing of a much-loved police officer who was leading the neighborhood defense, the gangs invaded Solino. Although she escaped, Luma, then four months pregnant with her second child, says her home was torched along with scores of others. Flush with military-grade weapons trafficked from the U.S., Viv Ansanm has since consolidated its hold over 90 percent of the capital and pushed farther into rural areas, sparing nothing in its path. Nearly 5,000 people died in gang violence over a nine-month period ending in June, according to the U.N. Hospitals, schools, media offices, and cultural touchstones have come under attack, along with the U.S. Embassy compound. The airport receives few domestic flights, and the gangs control all of the main roads in and out of the capital, choking aid and commerce. A Haitian journalist colleague likens it to an “open-air prison.” 

	











	Luma now lives in a filthy makeshift camp, one of the more than 1.4 million Haitians uprooted by violence. The U.N. estimates another 5.7 million people — half the population — face acute food insecurity, in a spiraling humanitarian crisis that has been made worse by the Trump administration's funding cuts to the World Food Program and shuttered USAID. Government food distributions in Luma's camp are irregular at best, clean water in short supply. With gunfire raging almost every night, she sleeps “with one eye open,” unsure of where she'll run to next. Normally, she would head to Kenscoff, in the mountains above the city, but the gangs are dug in there despite efforts of a Kenyan-led multinational police mission to dislodge them. 


	“We always say: ‘Our lives are in the hands of the gangs,' because if we run and leave this place, we will have nowhere else to go.”


	Meanwhile, Haiti's nine-member transitional council is all but invisible. Tasked with holding elections for the first time since 2016, the unelected leadership has been plagued by infighting and scandal while outsourcing security operations to foreign mercenaries. Erik Prince, the American founder of Blackwater whose contractors committed a 2007 massacre of civilians in Iraq, confirmed in August that his new private-military company, Vectus Global, had signed a 10-year contract with the government to battle the gangs and restore tax collection on the borders. The company's opaque operations, which began in March, have coincided with a surge of drone attacks targeting gangsters such as Jimmy “Barbecue” Chérizier, the former police officer who fronts Viv Ansanm, designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. (Vectus Global didn't respond to requests for comment.)


	An October U.N. report claims drone strikes killed 527 suspected gang members and 20 civilians from March to late September. But these figures are contested, and the civilian death toll is climbing — a pattern that risks inciting popular blowback in a land with a history of rising up against intervention. “This contract with foreign mercenaries proves the Haitian government is not serious about security,” says Abel Loreston, a lawyer protesting outside the prime minister's ­residence. “Our people are in misery, and they want to maintain the status quo so they can stay in power to keep profiting and stealing.” Invoking the memory of Jean-Jacques ­Dessalines, a revered leader of the revolution that evicted colonial France and ended ­slavery, he shouts, “No more foreigners on the soil of Haiti!”

	











	Instead, Loreston favors a more homegrown resistance incarnated by Commissioner Muscadin — a cold-blooded agent of justice whose ends justify the means. “Even the Bible says those who kill with swords should be killed by swords,” Loreston says. “Most Haitians back Muscadin since he lives among them and knows their pain. If there were no Muscadin, the south would be finished. And if he were in Port-au-Prince, things would be very different. Gangsters would be afraid to step outside because they know that Muscadin doesn't play around.”


	Early on a weekday morning, Muscadin and his crew are running a snap checkpoint on Highway 2, the sorry excuse for a road that connects his Nippes department territory to the capital. Two days before, acting on a tip, he intercepted a shipment of police SWAT uniforms and body armor shipped by would-be gang infiltrators, and he's heard that more contraband is inbound. No motorists are immune to the commissioner's scrutiny. Not the tap-tap drivers he recognizes, or a pallet of caskets, nor a U.N. aid truck bearing a load of rice and palm oil. Muscadin orders the driver to open the rear door for a spot check. His right index finger invariably points straight above the trigger of his rifle, disciplined yet poised to fire.  


	A few minutes later, he flags down a pickup full of passengers. An elderly man from New York visiting family in the south recognizes the commissioner and blurts out “Muscadin!,” starstruck. Muscadin shakes his hand and then grills a young traveler with dreadlocks and shifty eyes. He speaks in a stern and fluent baritone, leaning closer as the subject mumbles vague answers that elicit more forceful questions from the commissioner. He scans the man's ID card one more time, registering the details, and waves him on. 

“We always say our lives are in the hands of the gangs, because we have nowhere else to go.”


	“If he's not a gangster, we send him home. But if he is a gangster, he's dead,” Muscadin tells me later. “It must be an eye for an eye. You have to strike them proportionally to their action, at the same level they attack the population. Someone who has a big gun in his hands, who is killing people, who is kidnapping people — if he finds me, he will kill me. Any of my guards who finds him will kill him; they will spit on his body, spit on his face. And me, if I find him, what should I do with him? Do you think I can just arrest them? Never.”


	For every 100 people he intercepts, Muscadin reckons just one or two of them are gangsters. He says dreadlocks and tattoos are often telltale signs, but they're not enough. “Here we must have proof, as I'm a man of the law.” Muscadin searches for incriminating phone messages and videos, and cross-checks a suspect's alibi with people living in their local community, looking for discrepancies. Additional intelligence is gleaned from a vast network of informants that he's cultivated around the south. “Every single man who [we have] killed in the Nippes is a gangster; not one innocent has died,” he insists. “If a single innocent person was killed, the population would rally against us.”

	











	Muscadin hails from the southern city of Les Cayes. His father farmed sweet potato and manioc, which his mother bore to market on her head. As a boy he “always dreamed of becoming a Catholic priest,” and still would, he says, if Haiti ever finds peace. He studied law in Port-au-Prince and served in the prosecutor's office of another district until his 2019 appointment as commissioner of Miragoâne, a troubled city of 90,000 in thrall to a local gangster. “President Moïse told me the gangsters and killers — either they die or run away,” Muscadin says. “And he gave us the means and the strategies to establish security.” Moïse, a onetime banana exporter, was assassinated in 2021 in his bedroom by a hit squad of Colombian mercenaries, plunging the country into chaos. (Among those charged in the case are a former Haitian Justice Department official, a former police chief, the acting prime minister, and the head of security for the national palace.)


	Along with avenging the president's death, Muscadin's chief motivation is combating the gang menace that permeates life in the capital and is spreading outward. He cites how people are forced to sell their belongings to pay kidnapping ransoms; and women are raped and tortured by gangsters who melt plastic bags on their skin. “These things,” he says, “have made me revolt as a human being.” He counts Alexander the Great, Stalin, and George W. Bush as influences — the latter for asserting he'd go to war against Iraq with or without U.N. support. Likewise, Muscadin says, “When I make a decision, I act on it,” in spite of the risks and persistent calls for him to resign or be fired — something he's convinced would have already happened if officials didn't fear the public's wrath. Indeed, after Haiti's justice ministry wrote Muscadin a December 2023 letter accusing him of “disregard for the law” and flouting his jurisdiction, one former ministry official noted that “even a simple letter of reprimand [against Muscadin] was seen as an act of courage on the part of the minister.” (On a separate occasion when he faced public criticism, thousands demonstrated on his behalf in the streets, saying, “If Muscadin weren't here, we would all be dead.”)


	Muscadin still collects a small government paycheck each month. But without his patron Moïse, he depends on the largesse of southern businesspeople and supporters in the diaspora who track his exploits on friendly social media and YouTube accounts run by local journalists. “Ninety-five percent of government commissioners are thieves who steal land and property and free prisoners for money, but Muscadin can't be bought — he is a self-made man,” says Theriel Thelus, a New York-based Haitian media personality whose anti-gang diatribes have stoked the Bwa Kale vigilante movement and support for Muscadin. In 2023, Thelus led a successful GoFundMe campaign that raised tens of thousands of dollars to purchase an armored vehicle for the commissioner. Muscadin says that, save for a church, “there's nowhere I can't go in the [south],” claiming that top-level justice ministry officials have granted him the authority to operate across jurisdictions despite public censure from the ministry. (The Ministry of Justice and Public Security did not respond to requests for comment.)

	











	People living in the region concede that Muscadin's scorched-earth policy has been a mixed blessing to the economy. Because the highway connecting the southern peninsula to the capital is now blocked by police, businesspeople pay upward of $3,000 per container to ship cargo by boat a mere 20 miles from Port-au-Prince to Léogâne in the south, a hefty toll that gets passed on to consumers. A bag of cement that sells for $8 elsewhere in the country might go for double the price, and staples like rice and wheat flour have risen by as much as 30 percent. Still, the gang extortion that is an inescapable fact of life in the capital is almost nonexistent in the south. Merchants in Miragoâne count their money openly and operate long after dark.   


	“If Muscadin were not here, people would not be able to walk,” says Dieuseul Saint-Jean, a fuel-truck driver parked next to a billboard erected by supporters of a rifle-bearing Muscadin that presides over the central junction. “Fortunately, when he captures a gangster, he does not send them somewhere to think; he sends them to a place they can never come back from.” Cafe owner Choulette Jean calls Muscadin her “second god,” and credits him for an influx of business as more and more people decamp from Port-au-Prince for security. “Before we could not sleep,” she says. “Now, Miragoâne is paradise.” 

“It's not a good image for a government official, nor the country. [Muscadin] is above the law.”


	At a nearby cellphone-repair stand, 31-year-old Jean Urie Nathan says he recently left the capital to live with his mother's family after witnessing a spate of killings. In the stalls next to him, young men who might elsewhere slide into gang life operate a sewing machine and a snack bar. In a country where more than half the population lives on roughly $2 a day, Nathan admits, criminal temptations abound. But in Muscadin's domain, he and his peers exercise self-restraint, calmly settling any disputes that arise to avoid trouble with “the father.” “Here I only hear the birds singing. And if I hear a gunshot, at least I know it's a police officer who is doing the shooting,” he says. “Port-au-Prince is like a different planet.”

	











	Just 20 miles away from Muscadin's territory, in Port-au-Prince, the airport is still closed to commercial U.S. flights after they were fired upon by the gangs. The only practical way to reach the capital is an unreliable charter flight to the northern city of Cap-Haïtien. From there, U.N. humanitarian helicopters shuttle passengers to Pétion-Ville, a residential suburb where international aid agencies still have a foothold. Having missed my Friday connection due to delays, I opt to run the gauntlet on a public bus down National Highway 1. Erik Prince has reportedly said that being able to drive from Cap-Haïtien to Port-au-Prince without being waylaid by gangsters would be “one key measure for success” of his company's operations, predicting roads would be taken back within a year.


	The 130-mile trip is uneventful until we pass Saint-Marc, two hours from the capital. Armored police vehicles peppered with bullet holes rumble past, and it's not long before we're stopped. A vigilante with rum on his breath and a revolver sagging from his torn jean shorts calls everyone off the bus for inspection. Farther along, tree-trunk chicanes and tire barricades are manned by pistol-wielding teens. A parting graffiti message, “The gangs must be exterminated,” is tagged on a wall as we near the front line in Arcahaie. (Three weeks later, Viv Ansanm carried out a retaliatory massacre in the area that left at least 42 people dead.) Our passage into gangland is signaled by portraits of Chucky, Tupac, and the Mask. Soldiers reposted from the Village de Dieu slum lounge in the shade with assault rifles. They exchange salutes with our driver, who's never made to stop. His company bosses have paid their tax.


	Since taking over the capital, the gangs have blocked off key roads to dictate the flow of traffic and thwart police incursions. According to Diego Da Rin, a Haiti analyst at the International Crisis Group, tactics include creating camouflaged ditches that trap armored vehicles so they can be ambushed by gang members with molotov cocktails, and posting snipers at strategic points. Networks of lookouts and informants, many of them children, allow them to keep 24-hour watch over the streets; some gangs even operate surveillance drones to monitor their territorial borders and maintain aerial visibility during offensive operations. Uncontested authority over much of the capital and critical roadways lets them “extract revenue from all economic activity in the areas they control,” Da Rin says, enabling them “to grow their ranks and arsenals, and maintain tight control over their strongholds and any new territory they seize.” 


	Reaching Solino the next day to meet with Vag, the shot-caller for Viv Ansanm in the area, entails changing vehicles and following a moto guide on a roundabout route through the waterfront industrial zone. Reefs of trash have swollen in the absence of city services. Delmas road, the usually bustling commercial artery that runs east from the port, is deserted. We detour through a maze of dank alleyways to the rendezvous point. A late-model Land Cruiser pulls up, and we slalom uphill past the charred husks of vehicles to the ruins of Solino.

	











	Vag steps out with a pink ski mask and walkie-talkie and leads me on a shotgun tour of the neighborhood. His rail-thin gang dons looted wigs, scuba masks, and fake gold jewelry. The last time I was in Solino, in May 2023, I stayed out past midnight with a local defense group patrolling this same area in a haze of fire smoke. Now it's hardly recognizable. Block by block, homes are a mosh of calved floors and blown-out walls — the kind of wholesale destruction associated with bombs and artillery, not small-arms fire. The plastic casings of electrical wire lay about like dead serpents, stripped of their copper insides. Gaping living rooms are strewn with ash-covered belongings: undergarments, teddy bears, Economics for Dummies, ID cards left behind. The dead quiet is interrupted only by the screech of sheet metal dragged away by scavengers on motorbikes.


	Kamikaze drones have become a regular presence in the skies above. Though none have been spotted in a few hours, we move through the wreckage at a fast clip, surging across streets exposed to police snipers. At a church that serves as the gang's lookout post, Vag points his rifle at their position a few hundred yards away in the Christ-Roi neighborhood and bangs off several rounds. A barrage of return fire cracks into the wall, and Vag responds in kind. A message painted outside promises “Jesus will be back.”


	Vag retreats to lower ground and sparks a blunt to calm his nerves. Originally from Bel Air, a downtown slum with a reputation for political resistance, he says he dropped out of school and fell in with a kidnapper named Kempes Sanon, a G-Pep member who was then battling Chérizier's G9 coalition. Getting a gun in his hands was a means to strike back against elites who have long profited at the expense of the underclass, he says. “We are hungry, and we are jobless; we're all in misery.” (On two occasions, his soldiers make furtive, hand-to-mouth gestures at me seeking money for food.) The rich “steal blindly without caring about anything — that's why there's so much insecurity now,” he goes on. “They gave us weapons and ammunition to have control over us, but they've come to regret it.”

“If the U.S. promises $5 million to capture me, it's clear I disturb the system it has created.”


	When I ask about the devastation in Solino, Vag claims Viv Ansanm had no choice but to smash through to secure freedom of movement across the city. Seizing Solino better positioned the gangs to advance on the rest of the Delmas corridor, the prime minister's offices, and the transitional council. “The private sector was an accomplice — they create these situations so they can earn money,” he adds, alluding to a cynical subplot. Unsurprisingly, given the anarchy and violence, conspiracy theories swirl everywhere in Haiti. Each side posits the most sinister of plots without much evidence other than horror. People search for explanations and villains to make sense of societal collapse. (Without offering proof, a former government security official later tells me he believes the gangs were manipulated by developers to raze Solino as part of a “city reorganization project,” but ultimately lost control.)

	











	Vag likewise asserts the highway between Port-au-Prince and the southern peninsula was sealed off by a southern businessman in league with corrupt officials, not Viv Ansanm. Instead of paying transit fees to the gangs on the southwestern edge of the capital, everyone is now obliged to ship their southbound cargo on boats at a massive markup. “They are making a fortune using the sea,” Vag says. “Do you understand?”


	Vag alleges that Muscadin is one of the officials enforcing this monopoly. “The [business elites] realized they can't use us anymore, so they chose a government official, who forgets he's an official, and they pay him to block the south,” he says. “A man whose mandate is to protect and serve is not allowed to kill for nothing. Muscadin is no longer [acting like] a government official — he's a gangster like us. It's a battle between gangsters.”


	Seated at his desk on the lower level of Miragoâne's Palace of Justice on a Thursday morning, Muscadin is in the eye of a legal storm. Opposing lawyers furiously plead their cases on behalf of family members locked in a dispute over an inherited piece of land. In a justice system riddled with graft and inefficiency, the commissioner understands that people want results over procedure, settling disputes in a matter of minutes. Flanked by two armed bodyguards, he takes it all in, sweat soaking through his shirt, until he's heard enough and smashes a silver bell for silence: The defendant who sold his parcel of land without permission must get his money back to reimburse his relatives. “If I hear you make one more threat,” Muscadin warns, “I'll come for you.” No one dares challenge the verdict. The attorneys shuffle papers for the next case, which involves stolen laundry, in a litigation smackdown that will last most of the day. Outside, more than 30 people wait in line, fanning themselves against the heat.   

“Muscadin is a gangster like us,” says gang leader Vag. “It is a battle between gangsters.”


	“When the population has a misunderstanding among them, they come to see the commissioner, because they believe in the justice given here,” says veteran lawyer Bleus Claude, noting that people travel from other jurisdictions for Muscadin's judgment. “He inspires confidence because he is not corrupted and he doesn't ask people for money to give them justice.” 


	If a case is more complex, he'll refer it to an investigative committee. But when he issues a verdict, it is decisive and accepted by all parties. “If you're right, he tells you you're right, and if you're wrong, he tells you you're wrong — that's why people trust him,” Claude says. “In Port-au-Prince, justice is for sale.”

	











	A quote is posted behind Muscadin's desk: The government commissioner is a military man in plain clothes. Though he'll typically hear a few dozen cases each week, he says he doesn't feel comfortable in the office,  preferring to hunt down gangsters in the streets. “Fighting every day, that's what we like to do,” he says. “We live like soldiers.” Divorced with two children, Muscadin rarely takes a day off, sleeps in three-hour stretches, and swears he'll never be found drinking in the street or having affairs with people's wives. Canvassing the south nonstop in his hearse-like truck, he boasts he has the guns and muscle to “take out any gangster, at any time. And we do it with love — not only for our country. It's a pleasure for me to attack gangsters.”


	Muscadin's critics counter that his zeal has run amok. A 2022 U.S. State Department report on human rights cites a video that began circulating in May of that year in which Muscadin walks up to an alleged gang member from Village de Dieu named Elvain Saint-Jacques and tells him to “say his last words to his parents” before shooting him at point-blank range. That same year, he was also accused of murdering a clerk from Nippes. When a human-rights advocate published an open letter denouncing the extrajudicial killings, another video clip made the rounds on social media where Muscadin threatened to arrest her. 


	“He's a bad guy,” says Pierre Espérance, the executive director of the National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH). The organization has documented at least 38 extra­judicial killings attributed to Muscadin, though Espérance says the true count is higher. (According to the U.N., Muscadin executed 27 people with “complete impunity” over a three-month period early last year.) 


	“He is not protecting people's lives; he is making them afraid,” Espérance adds. “Zero tolerance doesn't mean you can arrest someone and kill them without trial.” 


	I speak with nearly a dozen people living in the south who insist their relatives were non-gang members executed by Muscadin. The only one willing to go on the record, a soft-spoken 27-year-old painter named Jonathan Maurice, shared his story despite the risks of living in Muscadin's hometown of Les Cayes. Jonathan says he initially “appreciated” how Muscadin all but eradicated gang crime in the city, even if he was disturbed by the commissioner's alleged habit of summoning local journalists to execution scenes.

	











	 “It's not a good image for a government official, nor the country,” he says. “[Muscadin] is above the law.” 


	On a Sunday morning in May, Jonathan received a call alerting him that his uncle, Durancy Maurice, a moto-taxi driver, had been picked up by Muscadin on a gang dragnet. Jonathan drove around frantically in search of the commissioner's familiar truck. He ­managed to track it down and shadow the vehicle at a distance until it came to a stop near a bridge. Muscadin hauled his uncle out of the back and put him on his knees. Seeing Jonathan approach on foot, Muscadin ordered him to come and kneel opposite his uncle. As Durancy begged for his life, Jonathan says, Muscadin shot his uncle in the back of the head. The bullet's path was diverted as it passed through his uncle's skull, sparking the pavement next to him. “[My uncle] saved my life,” Jonathan tells me, breaking into sobs.


	Muscadin's men shot several more rounds into his uncle's body. Jonathan told the commissioner to shoot him, as well. He says Muscadin put his foot on his head, telling him he would finish him off if witnesses were not present. Then Muscadin's men started to bludgeon him in the ribs with their rifle butts. Medical X-rays show four were broken on the right side.


	Jonathan says he reached out to 13 local journalists to share his story. The only one who posted a video calling his uncle's killing into question quickly took it down for fear of retribution. When Jonathan got a hold of a judge to file a case, the judge told him Muscadin had threatened him personally, so he could not pursue the matter. Today, Jonathan has no expectation of justice, but says it's his duty, come what may, to clear the name of his uncle, an honest, law-abiding man who left behind a wife and two children: “Imagine I am a victim and I air my complaint — I will be victimized again. There is no justice in Haiti.”

“The people of solino will feel much more comfortable at home in their crushed homes than in shelters.”


	When I confront Muscadin about the Maurice killing, he betrays a fleeting look of surprise and disgust. “Other motorcycle drivers informed against him,” he snaps back. “His family members are just paid to lobby against me.” The RNDDH, he continues, are “a group of slaves” used by rapacious elites and foreign powers that fear his growing popularity and want to control Haiti's politics by spreading misinformation. “They don't know the reality on the ground. If they think those baseless reports can stop us, I will attack the gangs even harder.”


	In Muscadin's view, the weak state has capitulated to the gangs out of fear and greed. “The insecurity is good for them; it enables them to stay in power longer [without elections].” In the same way he claims he's capable of eliminating any gangster, anywhere in the south, Muscadin says specialized police units in Port-au-Prince could take out Viv Ansanm leaders like Chérizier “tomorrow” if they were given the order and robust support. “These criminals are only still alive because the state is afraid of them.”

	











	In late September, the U.N. Security Council finally answered the transitional council's pleas for a larger international mission to combat the gangs. The so-called gang ­suppression force will deploy up to 5,550 foreign personnel with a more aggressive mandate to pursue and arrest gang members. The U.S., for its part, has slapped sanctions on a host of Haitian businessmen and former politicians for financing the gangs, and intercepted thousands of American-made weapons bound for Haiti, while ramping up the pressure on Chérizier. In announcing a $5 million bounty for information leading to his arrest, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro cited “heinous human-rights abuses,” notably his alleged involvement in the 2018 La Saline massacre that killed 71 people. (He's always denied the allegations.)


	Meeting up with Haiti's most wanted man in his Lower Delmas base has never been very difficult. The morning I turn up, Chérizier steps out half-naked in a towel and barks at his soldiers for loitering in the street. He's put on weight since I last saw him in 2023, and his chin is flecked with gray. He reappears in a black tactical vest packed with bullet magazines, and we take a walk up to a vacant health clinic. It has a USAID plaque on the wall and large caged windows — the better to scan for kamikaze drones that have become a fixture over the neighborhood.


	Chérizier says he survived two drone attacks in March, the same time Prince's Vectus Group mercenaries started operating in Haiti. He dismisses reports that Johnson “Izo” Andre, the brash leader of the Viv Ansanm-allied 5 Segond gang, was seriously injured in a May strike, along with claims that hundreds of gang members were killed in a matter of months. “The local and international media are making propaganda for the government to put the idea in people's heads that [Vectus Group] is doing a good job” so they can justify their contract, he says. “In all the blocks where they use drones against us, ­aren't we still in the same places? In reality, the drones don't kill gangs, they kill civilians. The regime is carrying out massacres in the ghettos.” (According to rights groups, a Sept. 23 drone attack against a gang leader at a birthday party in the Cité Soleil slum left 13 civilians dead. Eight were children.) “Our objective is to wipe out this current racist system of apartheid and destroy this political class because it is these corrupt politicians, in complicity with the corrupt oligarchs, that brought us to this critical situation we are in today.” 


	Despite the fact that President Moïse was killed by mercenaries, Chérizier notes the “nine thieves” of the transitional council have again contracted foreign mercenaries to extend their time in power without accountability or oversight. “The poor will get poorer, and they will get richer.” As soon as the council is overthrown, Chérizier pledges, Viv Ansanm will “cancel all the bad contracts” and then “create some sort of stability to hold an election.” 


	Chérizier's revolutionary rhetoric has only amplified with time. Neighborhood walls bear his likeness as Che Guevara, as does his custom-made cellphone case. But for all of the social-justice messaging, some experts contend that Viv Ansanm's ulterior motive is more self-serving. 


	“What they really want is to ensure that whoever is in charge agrees to open negotiations and offers them amnesty for their crimes,” says Crisis Group's Da Rin. “To bring down the government without being dismissed, both in Haiti and internationally, as a criminal takeover of the state, Viv Ansanm needs some form of popular support to strengthen its image as an insurgent movement instead of a coalition of criminals seeking to erase their wrongdoing.” 

	











	When I bring up the destruction of Solino, Chérizier shows visible remorse. At one point, prior to forming Viv Ansanm, he'd backed vigilantes defending the area against his former G-Pep rivals. He says it's “a long story” involving “bad blood” with a small group of people that ended up impacting the entire neighborhood. (A Haitian journalist later tells me that a group of police officers living in Solino had accepted a bounty to kill Chérizier, a betrayal that further stoked the gangs' appetite for vengeance when they finally overran the area.) “The local people couldn't understand what we were fighting for, so they decided to face us in battle,” Chérizier says. Now, in ­damage-control mode, he's working on a plan that would enable former Solino residents to return home — part of a broader strategy to win back trust and “become one with the population,” he says. “The people of Solino will feel much more comfortable at home in their crushed houses than living in temporary shelters.”


	Chérizier seems untroubled by the U.S. bounty and the coming deployment of a beefed-up military force. “If the U.S. government can promise $5 million to capture me, it's clear that I disturb the system it has created in Haiti,” he says, calling the U.S. “an accessory” to Haiti's misery. In its August indictment of Chérizier, the U.S. named his childhood friend Bazile Richardson, a Haitian American trucker living in North Carolina, as a co-conspirator for sending a series of money transfers to the gang leader that amounted to less than $40,000 (one was for $25 to top up his phone plan). Chérizier calls the charges absurd given that a single AK-47 assault rifle costs more than $10,000 in Haiti, adding that he has more than 100 of them. (Richardson has pleaded not guilty.)


	“If the FBI wants to know who used to finance me,” Chérizier says, “they should talk to Reginald Boulos,” a Haitian oligarch and former presidential candidate accused of financing gangs who is currently in immigration detention in Florida. (A source close to the Boulos family calls the allegation “categorically false.”) “They must also arrest Claude Joseph,” the former acting prime minister indicted for the assassination of Moïse. “They have to put me face to face with Youri Latortue,” a former senator sanctioned by U.S. authorities for trafficking drugs. (Joseph and Latortue didn't respond to requests for comment.) Chérizier maintains he's never committed crimes against American citizens or sent drugs north, and is ready to negotiate with U.S. authorities so long as there “are no lies told.” Otherwise, he's “ready to fight to the death.”


	As for Muscadin, Chérizier says he has no connection to him and is not worried by his strength in the south: “He kills people without evidence, but Muscadin is not an obstacle to us. He has never confronted a strong armed group like Viv Ansanm before. We don't fear him.” 

	











	A couple of hours after my sit-down with Chérizier, a surreal spectacle likely stage-managed by the gang leader plays out in the heart of the capital. More than 500 displaced Solino residents gather under the overpass of the Carrefour Aéroport, one of the city's major intersections, a short walk from their homes. Almost a year after the gangs purged them in a hail of fire and bullets, they've been told they can return. Suddenly, a throng of residents from Chérizier's Lower Delmas base, a rival territory, marches in waving flags and tree branches, and the Solino side erupts in cheers. The groups combust into a carnivalesque frenzy of dancing and call-and-response song: “We must all become one! We are the same blood!” On any other day, anyone caught out in either neighborhood might have been lynched. In this moment, Solino's outcasts celebrate a possible homecoming alongside former enemies sent to reassure them they would be safe to enter. 


	The crowd advances up the hill toward Solino, past bullet-strafed storefronts tagged with Roi Babé (“King Barbecue”) and over furniture barricades, and the euphoria starts to fade. A human skull staked to the ground marks the edge of gang territory. Viv Ansanm soldiers hang back in the shadows of gutted buildings, masked up and weapons down. Rony Nazaire, a 43-year-old father of seven, says he saw his block destroyed on a YouTube video but would rather pitch a tent on his own concrete block instead of “sleeping like pigs” in a camp. On seeing his burnt shell of a home in person for the first time in more than 10 months, though, he stands in silence for a minute, stricken by the visceral reality. “There is nothing left. What can we rebuild from this?”

“It's not that the bandits are braver. It's that the state has totally abandoned the field.”


	I descend back to the now-vacant crossroads with a group of journalists, and we run into a small convoy of Haitian police and Kenyan armored vehicles on patrol. A Kenyan turret gunner starts to rotate in our direction, and I wave my camera to preclude any trigger-happy behavior. After a confused look from the driver through a cracked plate-glass window, the convoy lumbers past us up the hill toward Solino. We're hustling in the opposite direction through no-man's-land, to the relative safety of middle Delmas, when gang fire kicks off a gun battle that echoes throughout the barren warscape. 


	Haitian authorities now project holding elections in August 2026, having deemed the previous Feb. 7 deadline “materially impossible.” But absent a dramatic surge in international support, the odds of delivering credible polls by then remain “vanishingly small,” says Robert Muggah, an expert on security and organized crime in Haiti. If a hasty ballot is attempted, he expects there will be targeted attacks on polling sites and election staff, kidnapping of local officials, and gang-enforced road enclosures to cut people off from voting. Though Haiti has pulled off elections in tough circumstances before, such as after the devastating 2010 earthquake, today the state is far weaker. Gangs are heavily armed, displacement is widespread, and hunger is more acute. “The most plausible outcome is a delayed election into 2027 and toward a negotiated extension or reconfiguration of the transitional authority,” Muggah adds, “punctuated by protests and sporadic gang offensives.”

	











	It's not yet clear when the surge of international forces will arrive, and many Haitians don't think it will make any difference in the long run. “They'll do some things and then they'll leave, and the same problem will come back,” says Rebu, the retired army colonel. He cites the 2004-17 U.N. intervention known as MINUSTAH, which had some ­initial ­success in taming the gangs and building up the national police force, before a deadly cholera outbreak and reports of widespread rights abuses incited a popular backlash. “We had no troops to replace MINUSTAH, so there was no successful transition to stabilize the situation.”


	The deployment of private military companies is similarly destined to be ill-fated because “they are in it for the money — they are not coming to die,” Rebu asserts. “They will play cat and mouse as long as they can because the longer the problem lasts, the longer they can stay and profit. It's a commercial and political transaction they've made, but it will not produce results.” In teeming slums, kamikaze drone attacks kill far more civilians than high-value targets. “If you disorganize the enemy and don't have ground troops to exploit that action, then you just kill people, plain and simple.” The U.N. recently flagged the government's use of drones as “likely unlawful” under international human-rights law.


	With police outgunned by weapons of war, and lacking actionable information, Rebu wants to rehabilitate the fledgling Haitian army to take back the capital's streets and porous borders that allow guns, drugs, and bad actors to move freely. Now, he says, “anyone can come in and do anything.” The yearslong project would require building better intelligence networks, and could benefit more immediately from foreign technical assistance. At the same time, the government needs to overhaul a broken justice system so that it's capable of prosecuting criminals, while developing social programs to demobilize gang members. “If you build a house and you don't put doors and windows in, you shouldn't be surprised that a thief comes to visit,” he says. “It's not that the bandits are braver. It's that the state has totally abandoned the field.”  


	This void accounts for the extraordinary popularity of Commissioner Muscadin. “Precisely because of the absence of the state, the population supports his actions even though they're crimes,” Rebu explains. “He ends up believing he's doing good, even though he knows very well he's acting outside the law. It's the vacuum of power that makes people like him into heroes.”


Muscadin! Muscadin! Long live Muscadin!  Under a searing midday sun the following week, hundreds of Muscadin partisans block traffic on the Boulevard  des Quatre Chemins, the main road through Les Cayes. They are convinced that the U.S., France, and Canada are part of a conspiracy to oust their beloved commissioner, and they won't stand for it.

	











	“We are with Muscadin to the end,” says Anthony Desir, a mechanic wearing a pro-Muscadin T-shirt. “The international community has been complaining about human rights, yet they've committed far greater crimes in the world. They can't revoke our Muscadin.” 


	Another protester tells me that any media trying to smear the commissioner “will be put aside,” a less-than-subtle threat.

“We are with Muscadin to the end,” says a mechanic. “They can't revoke our Muscadin.”


	I'm soon bundled into a sweltering plywood radio studio off the street, where Muscadin is giving an interview to a roundtable of local journalists whose questions are laced with flattery. One asks about the U.N. report alleging Muscadin killed at least 27 people suspected of gang ties over a three-month period. The commissioner scoffs that “they know they are lying,” that the actual number is much higher. A second asks whether Muscadin would ever move to Port-au-Prince if summoned to take on the gangs. “[The government] would never entrust me with that jurisdiction because peace would return and the population would be free to cry out ‘Up or down with them,'” he says. “Trust me, if today they could drop a drone on my head, they would do it. My biggest fight is not with the gangsters with sandals, but with the gun smugglers and the bullet sellers — the guys in power who are insecurity's father and mother.”


	Nearing the end of the session, the host says that even if Muscadin does not run for president in the next election, his legion of admirers would write him into the ballot regardless. The commissioner deadpans that he's not interested in politics that would interfere with his day-to-day actions on the street. “I don't have any such plans. I am a commissioner of the government. I'm doing my job, and I'll go farther than anyone can imagine.” To conclude, he offers listeners in Haiti and the diaspora some reassurance: “Haiti does not belong to the corrupt and to the gangsters. Remember that when it's darkest, a new dawn is closer.”

	











	Muscadin steps outside into the wild embrace of his supporters. Revved up by a Rara band of drums and tin trumpets, they strain against his bodyguards to touch the man who embodies the vengeance of a proud nation pushed to its breaking point — at once a symptom and tainted savior. The commissioner walks with them for a few minutes, amused by all the adulation. And then he's off again. An informant has alerted him that a driver in the employ of a government official is alleged to have killed several people and was now hiding out in his city. 


	“There's a problem,” he says, piling into his truck with his crew of gunmen. “I need to go check it out.”

A version of this story appeared in the daily Threat Status newsletter from The Washington Times.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is standing by statements he made several years ago, questioning whether unidentified flying objects may be otherworldly visitors.

Mr. Rubio said on Fox News Channel that his comments in the new documentary “Age of Disclosure” appear to have been selectively edited.

The documentary quotes some 30 mainly former officials in alleging a decades-long cover-up by the U.S. government regarding UFO crashes, technology and even alien bodies. The CIA and the Pentagon supposedly directed the cover-up.

Mr. Rubio is the most prominent of those interviewed and stated in the film that there have been “repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities … is not ours and we don't know whose it is.”

Asked about the remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio said, “I'm not disavowing that. It was an interview that was done almost, like, maybe three or four years ago when I was in the Senate.”

The film, however, identifies Mr. Rubio as secretary of state.

Mr. Rubio said he was describing allegations made by people who had come forward, including military pilots and senior military officers who stated that government UFO programs existed that “not even presidents were made aware of.”

“So I was describing what people had said to me, not things that I had firsthand knowledge of in that regard,” Mr. Rubio said. “A little bit of selective editing, but it's OK because you're trying to sell a show there.”

The secretary said he has not seen the documentary but said, “There have been things that fly over the airspace, restricted airspace, be it where we're conducting military exercises or the like, and everyone in the government says they're not ours.

“And so what I worry most about, just me personally, is that some adversary — another country, for example — has developed some asymmetric capability for surveillance or the like that we just are not prepared for,” he said.

“We're looking for missiles and fighter jets, and they're coming at us with drones and balloons.”

Mr. Rubio noted that the North American Aerospace Defense Command began searching for high-altitude balloons in 2023 after China sent a spy balloon that went largely undetected across the U.S.

“All of a sudden, they spotted a bunch of balloons flying overhead, and 90% of them were innocent things; a couple of them were Chinese,” he said.

“But we never looked for balloons because our radars aren't trained for that,” he said.

Mr. Rubio said some of the claims made by naval aviators and people with high-level security clearances were “pretty spectacular,” although he said he is not calling them liars.

“So we have people with very high jobs in the U.S. government that are either (a) liars; (b) crazy; or (c) telling the truth, and two of those three options are not good. I don't know the answer,” he said.

The Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which investigates what it calls unidentified anomalous phenomena, has stated it found no evidence of extraterrestrial origins for the phenomena.

The ""View"" airspace has been breached once again.

ABC

 From sonic phantoms and unknown entities to the echos of alleged backstage yeller Taraji P. Henson's voice, The View's storied airspace is a breeding ground for chaotic invasions — and, at the start of the holiday season, the program's atmosphere has once again been breached by a flying object that attacked Whoopi Goldberg.


 On Thursday's broadcast, as the 70-year-old EGOT-winning actress and her cohost Sara Haines attempted to spread holiday cheer with a special toy segment, a pair of unidentified flying objects hovered over their heads.


 Haines tried to reach up and touch one of the objects, which glistened with green, yellow, and red lights as it swirled around in the air.


ABC

 ""It'll come down, it'll come down, it'll come down, it'll come down,"" the segment's guest promised as the saucer lingered above Haines.


 Apparently sensing potential impending discord, the Whoopi Goldberg War Room™ sprung into action as its commander grabbed ahold of one of the objects before tossing it back into the air and swiftly ducking to avoid its swift flight (all while holding a stuffed cow in her hand).


 ""When they lower themselves, and here's how we turn it off..."" the guest said, before Haines gave an update on the battlefield excursion playing out in front of her.


 ""We lost Whoopi!"" Haines exclaimed, as the camera showed Goldberg chasing the object — which had zipped off at high speed — to the corner of the studio.


 Goldberg then retrieved the object and returned to join Haines, with them slathering dolls in Play-Doh and shoveling tiny marshmallows into their mouths for a game that tasks players with using a set of tiny arms to feed themselves.


 Thursday's activity in the skies is, by far, not the first time alien vessels have infiltrated The View.


 Goldberg once got up from the table to confirm that a dead alien was, in fact, dead as the show displayed an alleged alien body on a giant screen behind the cohosts.

 ""It's definitely dead,"" the Ghost star said as she pointed to the being on the screen.


 Then, in March 2024, Goldberg informed The View interview guest Kumail Nanjiani that aliens are, in fact, real.

A shift in the conversation surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) may be on the horizon as President Donald Trump hints at the possible release of highly anticipated government files.

Speculation is mounting over what the public might learn from the '3I/ATLAS' and broader UAP records, marking a potential moment of clarity in a decades-long mystery.

According to reports circulating online this week, US President Donald Trump could be preparing to release key public statements concerning the '3I/ATLAS' files and a collection of confidential UAP records.

According to a post shared on X by @3IATLAScoinX, sources close to the president suggest he believes the American public 'deserves full transparency' regarding various confidential issues. The post claims that Trump has recently renewed his focus on sensitive documents and might move to release them.

The X post makes it clear that Trump might disclose key details from the 3i/ATLAS files, yet it gives no information on what these files cover. Though no formal account of the files exists, backers and online analysts say they contain data linked to national security and intelligence programmes.

According to the post, sources claim Trump is also preparing to declassify confidential records linked to unidentified aerial phenomena. Such documents might include 'radar data, pilot accounts, and analytical reports' concerning sightings that the US military could not fully explain.

The post concludes by noting that 'all signs suggest that major disclosures could be on the horizon,' positioning the possible release as part of a broader effort to be transparent about long-classified information.

With the X post, 3IATLAS (@3IATLAScoinX) shared a 2024 video of Trump speaking on Joe Rogan about military pilot reports and the ongoing queries he receives about unexplained objects in the sky. In the footage, Trump confirms that pilots have approached him to describe unusual aircraft.

He is quoted as saying, 'You jet pilots that say they saw something, and they said we saw things, sir, that were very strange, like a round ball,"" he said. ""But it wasn't a comet or a medium, it was something, and it was going four times faster than an F-twenty-two, which is a very fast plane.'

Trump remarked that he is often asked about unidentified aerial phenomena, noting, 'I get that question as much as almost any question. Do you think that we have aliens coming? You know, flying around or whatever?' he said.

He went on to say that life existing on other planets is a perfectly possible idea. He clarified, 'There's no reason not to. I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.'

Trump also referred to theories suggesting that some sightings near US military ships might be foreign aircraft. He remarked, 'A lot of the speculation too, that some of these drones that hover over battleships, that these are Chinese drones, and that they're not UFOs.'

However, Trump countered this by saying several people he had spoken to were convinced they had witnessed something genuinely unusual. He said, 'I did interview, let's say three or four guys, solid beautiful people. They said. Sir, do something there. You know there's something there.'

He then highlighted the famous 2004 incident involving retired Navy Cmdr. David Fravor reported a very fast-moving object off the San Diego coast. Trump described the event, saying, 'They clock that thing going from 50 thousand feet above sea level to 50 in the second.'

He added that the proof shared by pilots is more than just spoken accounts. 'Visual evidence, photographic evidence, video evidence, radar evidence,' he said. 'Whatever the hell it is, it moves in a way that would turn a human being to jello if you're inside of it.'

Despite the X post claiming that Trump is planning major releases, neither he nor his campaign has officially verified any upcoming declassifications. The president has previously discussed UAP sightings, yet precisely what any future disclosures would cover remains unclear.

Even so, the convergence of the X post, Trump's latest remarks, and growing interest in military sightings has fuelled high anticipation among enthusiasts and transparency advocates.

The actual release of the ATLAS files or UAP records remains uncertain, but current online activity suggests a significant reveal is widely expected.

The new chapter marks the first major creative collaboration between Wan and Blum after their merger.

The ‘Paranormal Activity' franchise is officially set for a major resurgence, with horror veteran James Wan joining the production team for a new feature film. This high-profile collaboration, announced following the merger of Wan's company, Atomic Monster, with producer Jason Blum's Blumhouse, signals a significant push to revitalize the iconic found-footage series. The project, which Paramount Pictures will co-finance, co-produce, and distribute, is being treated as a theatrical priority for all parties involved.

Via The Hollywood Reporter, the new Paranormal Activity installment will see Wan step into the role of producer alongside Blum and the original film's director, Oren Peli, who is producing through his Solana Films banner. This union brings together the creative forces behind ‘The Conjuring,' ‘Insidious,' and the franchise that launched Blumhouse into a horror powerhouse. 

James Wan expressed his long-standing admiration for the first film. “I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying. I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise,” said Wan.

Meanwhile, Jason Blum highlighted that this collaboration was a direct result of the Blumhouse-Atomic Monster merger. “Diving in with James for this exciting rebirth of the franchise that started it all for Blumhouse is exactly what we dreamed of,” Blum stated. He confirmed he would be “actively involved with him to introduce this new chapter,” which follows the seven previous films, the most recent being Next of Kin in 2021.

The Bennu Sample!

Planetary scientists have found a wide range of molecules that are crucial for life among a lot of other organic substances present in asteroids, meteors, and even interstellar space. Now, scientists report new insights into asteroid Bennu, which was sampled by the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx. The latest research suggests tentative evidence for a substance we have not encountered before in extraterrestrial material.

When it comes to molecules fundamental to life, we usually focus on the nucleotide bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil, which are the fundamental units of DNA and RNA. There are also amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Although over 500 are known, only 22 are used by known life. Of those 22, only 14 have been found in stuff from outer space – until now, possibly.

The new work confirms the presence in the sample of all five nucleobases and of the 14 amino acids that were already found by others. They also report tentative detections of tryptophan, a pretty important amino acid. This molecule is the precursor of the neurotransmitter and “happiness molecule” serotonin, of the hormone melatonin, which regulates the sleep cycle, and the vitamin B3. A form of vitamin B3 has previously been detected in the Bennu sample, which gives credence to this new detection.

Still, the team is looking into other ways to check the Bennu material to confirm the presence of tryptophan without doubt. Tryptophan is pretty fragile, so it is not a big surprise that it has not been found before in meteorites. The delicate collection of 121.6 grams (4.3 ounces) of material by OSIRIS-REx might have kept this and other dainty molecules safe.

“Our findings expand the evidence that prebiotic organic molecules can form within primitive accreting planetary bodies and could have been delivered via impacts to the early Earth and other Solar System bodies, potentially contributing to the origins of life,” the authors wrote in the paper.

OSIRIS-REx dropped a capsule with the sample in the Utah desert after over two years orbiting the 500-meter (1,630-foot) wide Bennu, which is currently the number one most dangerous asteroid, as it has a 1-in-1,750 chance of hitting our planet between 2178 and 2290. The date of greater risk is September 24, 2182. Coincidentally, the sample came back to Earth on September 24, 2023.

The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Dean Norris (“Breaking Bad”) and Jessica Garza (“The Purge”) will star in the supernatural horror-comedy Dubbels, Deadline reports.

The ensemble also includes Zak Corrigan, Marié Botha (“The Penguin”), Jordan Mann, Steele Whitney, Jonathan Cruz, and Jessica Gibbon.

In the film, an environmental engineering firm led by Pete (Corrigan) is assigned to evaluate an abandoned ski resort built upon mountain springs. The mysterious landowner (Norris) and his captivating daughter (Botha) pressure the team to bend to their will.

Little do they know the springs are cursed, and Pete's clairvoyant wife (Garza) endures a heroic journey to save husband and his team.

Writer-director Paul Marashlian makes his feature debut on the indie film, which recently wrapped production on location in the Catskill Mountains of New York.

Jersey Shore Shark Attack director John Shepphird produces alongside Andy Clark. Beatrice Sniper (Hell House LLC Origins: The Carmichael Manor) handled the special effects makeup.

Dubbels is slated for completion in Spring 2026 to hit the festival circuit.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Unlike The Winchesters, This Supernatural Prequel Would Have Lasted More Than One Season","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-samuel-colt-prequel-spinoff-better-winchesters/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Supernatural has rotten luck when it comes to spinoffs. The backdoor pilot for Supernatural: Bloodlines quite fairly didn't lead to a full series, the backdoor pilot for Wayward Sisters quite unfairly didn't lead to a full series, and when a spinoff did finally get off the ground with The Winchesters, it was canceled after a single season.

At this point, it would be fair to ask whether Supernatural as a premise works without Sam and Dean Winchester. While that viewpoint certainly has merit, one could also argue that Supernatural hasn't always put its faith in the right spinoffs. Wayward Sisters had a lot of support behind it, but was never picked up, while The CW went ahead with The Winchesters despite confusing canon changes at its heart.

 The biggest problem with any Supernatural spinoff is how to make it feel like Supernatural without feeling too much like Supernatural. When it comes to expansion, different approaches work for different franchises. Better Call Saul tied directly into Breaking Bad in an ingenious way that complemented both shows, whereas Yellowstone has thrived by making each release distinct.

After years of trial and error, Supernatural apparently falls into a weird awkward gap between those two approaches. Bloodlines' city setting removed any trace of Supernatural from its DNA, whereas Wayward Sisters and The Winchesters were essentially Supernatural without Sam and Dean.

Only one spinoff had any hope of finding the right balance: a prequel set in the 1800s with Samuel Colt. The series would have centered on the Colt's creator, as well as the secret hunter the magical weapon was originally created for.

While nothing ever came of it, Supernatural creator Eric Kripke once mentioned how the show's writers shared vague dreams of a Samuel Colt spinoff (via Starpulse), citing how Sam and Dean's story already felt like a modern-day western. And therein lies the reason Samuel Colt was perfect for the spinoff treatment. The Old West vibe would have maintained the tone and feel of Supernatural's main show (unlike Bloodlines), but by virtue of being set 200 years earlier and featuring totally different characters, would feel a lot more unique than Wayward Sisters or The Winchesters.

""Western meets paranormal"" is a tried-and-tested blend in fiction, with the ""Weird Western"" rapidly growing in popularity over recent years. Even prior to that, classic westerns such as Clint Eastwood's 1973 classic High Plains Drifter incorporated spooky elements to great effect.

As a period piece, The Winchesters' 1970s timeline wasn't far enough from Sam and Dean's era to create a profound difference. Sure, the lack of cellphones helped, but the spinoff still enjoyed modern conveniences like cars and payphones, as well as a pop culture backdrop rooted in music and movies we still love today. Going back to the 1830s with Samuel Colt, viewers would have witnessed a very different society of monsters fighting a very different society of horse-riding hunters.

 One benefit a Samuel Colt spinoff would have enjoyed over The Winchesters was a completely clean slate. With very little known about Colt and hunters generally in the 1800s, a prequel series would have reveled in its own corner of the Supernatural timeline almost entirely free from restrictions and potential lore contradictions.

Having said that, Supernatural did lay some tantalizing groundwork for a larger story involving Samuel Colt. According to the gun's history, Samuel created it for a mysterious hunter who used six of the original thirteen bullets. Exactly who this hunter was remains unclear, although Samuel himself is a possibility. Either way, six monsters strong enough to require the Colt means six potentially riveting stories Supernatural still hasn't told.

And because two centuries separate the Winchester brothers from Samuel Colt, a Colt spinoff could introduce major new villains and monsters defeated long before the 21st century. Wayward Sisters and The Winchesters were both somewhat limited in that regard, with the latter's Akrida feeling too much like a rug-pull to succeed.

The future of Supernatural remains unclear, especially after another failed spinoff. If The CW ever did revisit the franchise, however, a Samuel Colt prequel would be a good place to start.

You're walking on ESP manifestations, wooah!

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's psychic platforms confront you long before you can actually do anything but scan them. You need a specific piece of gear to trip the light fantastic across these ethereal bits of psychic energy, but the boots do more than just let you use psychic platforms. They're one of Samus' most essential upgrades.

Below, we explain how to get Metroid Prime 4's Psychic Boots and how to use them to walk on psychic platforms.

 The good news is that you can't miss Prime 4's Psychic Boots. Unlike some other Metroid games, you get Samus' power-ups in a set order. And there's no risk of taking a wrong turn and passing by the boots, as the first few major areas you visit on Viewros are entirely linear.

The bad news is that those first psychic platforms will remain tantalizingly out of reach for a little while yet. Ignore those platforms for now, and press on through Fury Green. You'll end up in a desert and, immediately afterward, in Volt Forge's Vi-o-La factory. Fight your way through the factory's generator towers, claim your Vi-o-La, and then at the end of your first visit, you'll encounter the nefarious AI construct Xelios. Defeat it to get the Psychic Boots.

These are basically Metroid's traditional Space Boots with a psychic twist. They let you double jump like the Space Boots always do, and you can walk on psychic platforms with them.

 Psychic platforms manifest as little wisps of purple energy initially, and you can't walk on them. Activate the scan visor, and scan the wisps to manipulate them into platforms. Once they've taken shape, you can jump on them as if they were regular, non-psychic surfaces, and they remain active and shaped. There's no time limit, so you're free to linger and plan your next move if need be.

But just as important is the fact that, despite having ""psychic"" in the name, these are very much just Samus' traditional Space Boots. You can double-jump by pressing B after jumping the first time and reach areas that would otherwise be inaccessible, so don't forget that.

Baltic, Gateshead ASMR prophets, Soviet hypnotists, mountaintop rituals … there is scene after scene of breathtaking beauty, elemental ambience and disorienting anxiety in this first solo UK show by the Uzbek artist film-maker

Your heart almost stops the moment you enter Saodat Ismailova's As We Fade. Within a minute, you'll forget about the outside world. The Baltic has curated a concise, brave first solo exhibition in the UK of film pieces by the Uzbek artist and film-maker. It is exhilarating, terrifying and unforgettable.

The room is dark. Four works are arranged around a padded black square in the centre for sitting or lying down on – a reference to the void, something Ismailova has been fascinated with throughout her two-decade practice. She grew up during perestroika, a period of widespread political, social and economic reform in the late 1980s, when Soviet ideology began to collapse leaving a void in the culture. Ismailova felt this deeply – her father was a cinematographer and she was on sets with him from a young age. The family lived in a building opposite the largest and oldest film studio in Uzbekistan. During perestroika, films stopped being screened in public.

The four works sing to each other across the void; they crackle, scream and collide. The atmosphere of the space is elemental – images of fire, ice and cascading currents of water recur across the projections, while you can almost feel the sand whipping the back of your neck as you listen to the powerful desert wind.

The first work that draws me towards it is the mesmerising, eponymous As We Fade, projected through 24 sheaths of silk suspended in the air, arranged in a glittering, shimmering line. The silk is significant, since the artist's homeland, Uzbekistan, sat at the heart of the ancient trade route between east and west. The number of silks mimics the old cinematic standard number of frames projected per second. The footage, found and new, is of people performing rituals on the sacred Sulaiman Too mountain. It can't be seen on every panel – they fade and disappear. Ismailova wants us to think about the images, but also what is not seen.

References to the subconscious abound – the whole space feels like a psychic dreamspace. The strange, mystical Melted Into the Sun plays at the bottom of the space, with traditional cushions (that once belonged to the artist's grandmother) on the floor. The film loosely and lyrically explores an 8th-century prophet-like figure, Al-Muqanna. Faceless figures pace through the dusky topographies and under magenta skies, between significant locations: the Amu Darya river, the burial ground of Chillpiq; the city of Bukhara. With aspects of ASMR and video game aesthetics, the film avoids getting too bogged down in its retelling of local history. And its questions, asked by a narrated voiceover in the uvular sounds of Uzbek, are universal: who determines where is east and where is west?

I was blown away by Swan Lake, a rapturous ode to films from the central Asian region made between 1988 and 2001, from the collapse of the eastern bloc to the post-Soviet period. Ismailova's film is visceral, poetic, avant garde but intelligible, deeply rooted in a time and place yet without boundaries. It captures the ambience of the time with an orchestral command of the exquisite cinematography taken from 28 films made in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

There is scene after scene of breathtaking beauty, violence, protest, disorientation and anxiety; men, women and children dreaming; a woman kissing a fish; a man licking a shard of glass and a woman bursting into flames. There is crackling footage of ballet dancers performing Swan Lake, which was broadcast on state TV on a continuous loop following the deaths of Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko in the 1980s, and later when the Soviet Union collapsed.

The work is threaded through with ideas about psychic space, power and propaganda. You allow yourself to be pulled along even as it warns that you are being manipulated. It was inspired by Ismailova's memories of watching the hypnotist Kashpirovsky, a Rasputin-like figure, on Soviet state television. In 1989, he attempted mass hypnosis – an excerpt of the broadcast is included – in the USSR's last effort to save its crumbling regime and control its population.

Ismailova is known for making works that consider the distinct male and female realms in central Asia, and this show riffs on these parallel worlds – centred on Zukhra, which was shown at the 2013 Venice biennale. It is a single, long shot of a woman sleeping on a bed, soundtracked with archival news recordings and a narration of the legend of Venus. Then she gets up and walks out of the room, leaving us looking at the empty bed. It is a daringly simple work that perfectly evokes the enormity and possibility of a woman's apparently passive and domestic inner world – the space in which she is often confined to but not diminished by.

You could be subsumed in this world for hours. Each film here is a universe of its own, richly layered, steeped in historical allusions. Yet clear meanings and political context matter less than magic and feeling in As We Fade.

A volcanic eruption in 1345 may have kicked off a series of events that led to the Black Death sweeping through medieval Europe.

An unknown volcanic eruption in the mid-14th century may have set the stage for the spread of the Black Death in Europe, according to a new study. By triggering a cool and overcast period in the Mediterranean, the eruption started a domino effect that led to a downturn in agricultural production, which required merchants to import grain — and the bacterium Yersinia pestis that causes bubonic plague — via the Black Sea.

The bubonic plague pandemic, more commonly known as the Black Death, reached Europe in 1347 and quickly affected Italian port cities. The plague then spread throughout Europe over the next few years, resulting in the deaths of between 30% and 60% of the population.

Martin Bauch, a historian at the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe in Germany, told Live Science in an email that one very specific aspect of the plague pandemic intrigued him: ""How and why did the Black Death reach Italy from the Black Sea at precisely this moment?""

To answer this question, Bauch and Ulf Büntgen, a geographer at the University of Cambridge, investigated climate-driven changes in the Mediterranean that could explain the sudden appearance of the Black Death in 1347. Their research was published Thursday (Dec. 4) in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

When combing through contemporaneous historical accounts, the researchers noticed reports of reduced sunshine, increased cloudiness and a dark lunar eclipse, all independently reported by observers in parts of Asia and Europe between 1345 and 1349. All of these astronomical and weather phenomena could be attributed to a large-scale volcanic aerosol layer, which has been known to cause cold spells as the sulfate aerosols reflect sunlight back into space.

Paleoclimate data gave the researchers a clue: High amounts of sulfur in polar ice cores suggested one or more eruptions of a previously unknown volcano around 1345.

""We cannot say very much about the volcanic eruption,"" Bauch said. ""From the ice cores, we know that the eruption must have taken place in the tropics, because sulfate was found in similar concentrations in the ice of both the North and South Poles.""

The researchers also looked at tree-ring data from around Europe and discovered that the summers of 1345, 1346 and 1347 were much colder than normal while the autumns were much wetter, causing soil erosion and flooding. Historical records also confirmed that changes in the environment had decreased the yield of a number of crops, including the grape harvest and grain production in Italy, requiring merchants to begin importing products from the Black Sea area to prevent famine.

""Upon return in the second half of 1347 CE, the Italian trade fleets, however, not only brought grain back to the Mediterranean harbours, but also carried the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis most likely via fleas that were feeding on grain dust during their long journey,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

The first cases of plague in humans were reported in Venice just a few weeks after the arrival of the last grain ships. ""This initiates the typical infection cycle,"" Bauch said. ""Rodent populations are infected first; once they die off, the fleas shift to other mammals and ultimately to humans.""

Importing grain after several years' worth of volcano-induced climate change therefore prevented a Mediterranean-wide famine but also introduced the Black Death into Europe, the study authors proposed.

—Single gene may help explain the plague's persistence throughout human history

—Mass grave of plague victims may be largest ever found in Europe, archaeologists say

—Earliest known strain of plague could have come from a beaver bite

""This study brings in new information on the 1345 volcano, which helps explain why the Black Death — that is, the epidemic well-documented in sources from 1346 to 1350 — happened when it did,"" Monica H. Green, an independent scholar and expert on the Black Death who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. ""But it happened how it did — with a 'plague infrastructure' of rodents and insect vectors already established — because local reservoirs had already been established.""

The onset of the Black Death resulted from a unique-but-random combination of short-term factors, like climate, and long-term factors, like the grain distribution system in Italy, the researchers wrote in the study.

Even though the Black Death resulted from a rare confluence of environmental and social factors, it's important to gain a better understanding of the causes of past pandemics, the researchers wrote, because ""the probability of zoonotic infectious diseases to emerge and translate into pandemics is likely to increase in both a globalised and warmer world.""

The Government Accountability Office said Thursday that it has opened an investigation into Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who has served as an attack dog against President Donald Trump's enemies.

The congressional watchdog's probe was requested by a group of Senate Democrats, who had asked the GAO to determine whether Pulte and other FHFA employees ""misused federal authority and resources"" in pursuing information about targets of Trump.

""Specifically, we request an investigation into Director Pulte's recent referrals of New York Attorney General Letitia James, U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and Congressman Eric Swalwell to the U.S. Department of Justice for mortgage fraud,"" the Democrats wrote the GAO on Nov. 17.

A GAO spokesman told CNBC on Thursday, ""I can confirm that GAO has accepted this request following our standard process.""

""The first thing GAO does as any work begins is to determine the full scope of what we will cover and the methodology to be used,"" the spokesperson said. ""This can take a few months, and until that is done, we cannot provide any estimates on a completion date.""

Swalwell, D-Calif., last week sued Pulte, accusing the FHFA chief of abusing his authority to make ""fanciful"" allegations of mortgage fraud.

Swalwell's lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked the congressman's private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech.

""Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,"" Swalwell said in a statement last week.

Daily roundup of research and analysis from The Globe and Mail's market strategist Scott Barlow

RBC Capital Markets head of global energy research Greg Pardy made one change to his Global Energy Best Ideas list, adding Permian Resources Corp. (PR-N),

“Our view: In November, the RBC Global Energy Best Ideas List was up 0.7 per cent compared to the iShares S&P Global Energy Sector ETF (IXC) which was up 2.9 per cent and a hybrid benchmark (75 per cent IXC, 25 per cent JXI – iShares Global Utilities ETF) that was up 2.8 per cent on a sequential basis” 

The full list is now California Resources, Chord Energy Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Permian Resources, PrairieSky Royalty, Canadian Natural Resources, Woodside Energy, Enerflex Ltd., SLB, AltaGas Ltd., Pembina Pipeline Corporation, Cheniere Energy, Inc., Energy Transfer LP, Williams Companies Inc., EDP Renováveis, S.A., Northland Power and Superior Plus.

Citi strategist Chris Montagu monitors 93 global investment themes for performance patters. His monthly report was published Thursday,

“Minimal turnover in the top/bottom 10 themes but a reshuffling of ranks. Pension Shortfalls is now the top ranked theme. After months of being the most attractive theme, the Risky Business theme has dropped to 5th driven by a fall in Momentum rankings. The Defence theme has come back into the top 10 but in reality it hasn't been too far out of the top 10 for most of this year. Why is it ranked so highly? The theme is attractive across nearly factors, particularly Price Momentum but where it falls down is on Valuation. Theme Model Performance — Model performance has not been stellar in the past months, and November was the first time since March that the top themes have posted a negative return. However, this shouldn't be a surprise given that many of the longer-term secular themes – like AI – were under pressure in November. Top Performing Themes — Pharma orientated themes have been consistent outperformers recently and November saw them rise to the top. The best performing themes were Genetically-Informed Therapies and Biotech. Also as a sign of the volatility in markets, Quantum Computing which was a top performing theme in October, was off – 2.79 per cent in November but still remains one of the better performing themes of the last three months”

BofA Securities chief U.S. equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian detailed what might be an important change in market leadership in November,

“A weakening labor market, easier Fed policy and an air pocket in AI explain some of the market trends we saw last month that suggest a change of leadership into 2026. The S&P 500 returned up 0.25 per cent vs. the equal-weighted index up 1.78 per cent, and the Nifty 50 mega caps (down 0.56 per cent) lagged the Other 450 (up 1.32 per cent). The comeback in AI was a late month story, not enough to push the Russell 1000 Growth index (down 1.81 per cent) ahead of the Russell 1000 Value index (up 2.66 per cent) in November. Gold (up 4.48 per cent) was the best-performing asset, and investment grade bonds (up 0.64 per cent), Long-Term Treasuries (up 0.42 per cent) and T-bills (up 0.28 per cent) were also ahead of the S&P 500. The VIX (down 6.25 per cent), WTI oil (down 3.38 per cent) and ex-US equities (up 0.15 per cent local currency / down 0.01 per cent in USD) lagged. Among global sectors, Health Care (up 7.7 per cent) and Media & Entertainment (up 4.6 per cent) led performance while Software (-7.3 per cent) and Semis (down 5.8 per cent) lagged . Breadth came back with a vengeance: 64 per cent of stocks outperformed the S&P 500, but year-to-date, just one of three stocks is ahead of the index. In November, amid the underperformance of Tech (down 4.36 per cent), most (8 out of 11) sectors outperformed the S&P 500, led by Health Care (up 9.14 per cent), Communication Services (up 6.34 per cent) and Materials (up 3.97 per cent). Consumer Staples (up 3.97 per cent) outperformed Consumer Discretionary (down 2.44 per cent), and we favor Staples (overweight) over Discretionary (underweight) for 2026. Communication Services and Tech still lead all other sectors year-to-date (up 33.8 per cent and up 23.7 per cent, respectively) … In a sharp reversal, Value factors, which lagged Growth factors by 9.9ppt year-to-date through October, posted a up 3.3 per cent avg. gain in Nov., outperforming all other factors groups and leading Growth factors by 2.2ppt. Four of the top five factors overall were Value factors. High Dividend Yield, which lagged the index by 5.1ppt year-to-date through Oct, also posted a strong gain up 3.5 per cent … We're bullish on small caps into 2026”

Canada's main stock index hit another record high on Thursday, outperforming U.S. stocks, after the latest round of bank earnings underscored resilience in the economy despite tariff uncertainties.

The S&P/TSX Composite index was up 293.03 points, or 0.94 per cent, at 31,453.57 at 11:25 a.m. ET, trading above last week's intraday record high of 31,411.01 points.

Canadian lenders TD Bank (TD-T), Bank of Montreal (BMO-T) and CIBC (CM-T) topped analyst estimates for fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, boosted by their capital markets businesses that benefited from a rebound in dealmaking and higher trading revenue.

TD and CIBC shares touched record highs, but BMO shares dipped.

The big six banks, which also include Royal Bank of Canada , Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank that have already reported, wrapped up fiscal 2025 with earnings that exceeded expectations, despite challenges from a sluggish domestic economy and tariff uncertainties due to changing U.S. trade policies.

A breakdown of the big banks' year-end earnings so far

 “The glass half-full interpretation is markets are forward-looking. The fact that markets are strong is probably discounting an improving economic backdrop going into 2026,” said Brian Madden, chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel.

Investor sentiment has been buoyed by expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut next week. Traders are pricing in an 87 per cent probability of a December rate cut, up from 83 per cent a week ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Ahead of a Bank of Canada rate decision next week, a survey showed Canadian economic activity contracted in November for the first time in six months as a measure of employment declined.

The energy index was up 0.8 per cent on Thursday as oil prices rose after Ukrainian attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure signaled potential supply constraints.

Logistics software firm Descartes jumped 9.8 per cent after its third-quarter revenue beat estimates.

The U.S. stock market is holding near its records on Thursday, continuing its relatively calm run following weeks of sharp and scary swings.

The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged in midday trading and remains just 0.6 per cent below its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9 points, or less than 0.1 per cent and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1 per cent lower.

Dollar General helped lead the market and rallied 11.2 per cent after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. More customers shopped at its stores, and it also squeezed more profit out of each $1 in sales that it made.

Hormel rose 2.8 per cent after likewise reporting a better profit than expected, thanks in part to strength for its Planters nuts and Jennie-O turkey offerings. It also gave a forecasted range for profit in the upcoming year whose midpoint was above analysts' forecasts.

Salesforce, meanwhile, added 1.3 per cent after swinging between gains and losses earlier in the morning. It delivered a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue fell just short.

CEO Marc Benioff extolled how Salesforce is “uniquely positioned for this new era” of artificial-intelligence technology, even if worries continue that all the world's spending on AI may not end up worth it.

Besides such worries about potential overinvestment in AI, concerns about what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates had sent U.S. stocks on sharp swings since it set its all-time high in late October.

After some back and forth, the general expectation on Wall Street is now that the Fed will indeed cut its main interest rate next week in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market. If it does, that would be the third such cut this year.

Investors love lower interest rates because they boost prices for investments and can juice the economy. The downside is that they can worsen inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2 per cent target.

But Treasury yields ticked higher on Thursday following another rise for Japanese government bonds. Expectations for a coming Fed cut to rates also took a very slight hit after reports suggested the U.S. job market may be a bit better than expected.

One report said fewer U.S. workers filed for unemployment last week. The number was the lowest in more than three years.

A separate report said that the number of layoffs announced last month fell by more than half from October's surge. It still was above year-ago levels, though, according to outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

While stronger-than-expected data is of course good news for U.S. workers, it could also indicate the job market doesn't need as much help from lower interest rates.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09 per cent from 4.06 per cent late Wednesday. While the move was relatively modest, increases in yields can discourage some buyers from buying stocks and other investments instead of bonds.

Among the stocks falling on Wall Street was Kroger, which dropped 5.7 per cent. The grocer reported weaker revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its profit beat forecasts. It also lowered the top end of its forecasted range for an important measure of revenue this year, while raising the bottom end by less.

Snowflake sank 11.2 per cent despite topping analysts' expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. Analysts at UBS said the company's stock may be feeling a letdown after excitement had grown so much after it blew past expectations in the quarter just before. Growth in product revenue also decelerated a bit in the latest quarter.

In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 2.3 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.2 per cent.

Hegseth apparently told the admiral: “When you get an order … don't ask questions.”

Just weeks after the Trump administration's likely illegal boat strike campaign began, the military official tasked with overseeing the operation was ousted by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who was apparently incensed with the admiral for raising concerns about the strikes and other egregious demands made of him, new reporting finds.

The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Admiral Alvin Holsey's shock departure in October, less than a year into his three-year post as the head of the U.S. Southern Command, came as a direct result of pressure by Hegseth, Pentagon officials said. 

Holsey did not elaborate on the reasons for his departure when he announced it, and the move sparked confusion and uncertainty. It came as lawmakers were raising alarm about the administration's secrecy surrounding the campaign, and just as the administration was escalating the campaign with a CIA authorization to conduct lethal operations in the Caribbean and Venezuela and undertaking a buildup of troops around the region.

“Having [Holsey] leave at this particular moment, at the height of what the Pentagon considers to be the central action in our hemisphere, is just shocking,” said Todd Robinson, former assistant secretary for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs. Other officials and lawmakers noted the highly unusual nature of the departure at the time.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Hegseth asked Holsey to step down, marking a “de facto ouster that was the culmination of months of discord” between the two. When Holsey first took over Southern Command, Hegseth effectively demanded full compliance from the 60-year-old military official.

“You're either on the team or you're not,” Hegseth reportedly told him on a video conference. “When you get an order, you move out fast and don't ask questions.”

Then, in March, Hegseth was suspicious that Holsey was leaking plans for the military to “reclaim” the Panama Canal, as President Donald Trump had commanded. Hegseth felt that Holsey wasn't developing the plans to carry out the illegal plan quickly enough, The Wall Street Journal found.

When the military brass began planning for the boat strike operation, Holsey was “concerned about murky legal authority for the boat strike campaign,” the publication reported. This lines up with other publications' reports that Holsey had disagreements over the campaign.

Expert opinion has repeatedly vindicated those reported concerns, with human rights and military legal experts saying that the strikes amount to murder, breaking both international human rights and domestic law. New revelations of a “double tap” strike, carried out in the military's first publicly reported attack on September 2, have also raised alarm that the orders for the strikes are patently illegal and may be exposing people up and down the chain to legal recourse.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 A Conversation With Emma Ashford

In the last decade, American foreign policymakers have been forced to reckon with a shifting global balance of power. Theorists have long argued over the shape of international order. But such questions now occupy practitioners, as well, as they grapple with the end of the unipolar moment that followed the Cold War and struggle to shape new strategies that account for new geopolitical realities.

Emma Ashford is a leading proponent of a more restrained U.S. foreign policy. In an essay for Foreign Affairs, as well as in her new book First Among Equals, she argues that American policymakers must, above all, get comfortable with the fact of a multipolar world. “Instead of artificially cleaving the world in two,” she writes, “the United States should choose to embrace multipolarity and craft strategy accordingly.”

Ashford joined Dan Kurtz-Phelan on Monday, November 17, to discuss this new order, how the Biden and Trump administrations have dealt with these changes, and how the United States must adapt to thrive in a multipolar age.

Live Updates


• Double-tap controversy: Senior lawmakers are receiving classified briefings from the admiral who Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said ordered a follow-up strike on an alleged Caribbean drug boat. The House Intelligence Committee chair expressed confidence in Hegseth, while a top Democrat described his meeting with military officials as “troubling.”
    


•  Trump stands by Hegseth: President Donald Trump said he'd support releasing video of the second strike and stood by his secretary of defense, as Hegseth faces bipartisan backlash for the strikes and use of the Signal app.
    


• Diplomatic moves: Trump signed a peace deal today with the presidents of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are traveling to the US for ongoing peace talks, a source told CNN.
    


• DC pipe bomber probe: Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a man accused of planting pipe bombs near the RNC and DNC headquarters before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has been federally charged with using an explosive device.
    


            As lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to be briefed on the US boat strikes in the Caribbean, elsewhere in the city, the Department of Justice made a major announcement regarding the Jan. 6 Capitol riot pipe bomber investigation.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi announced today that Brian Cole Jr., the man accused of planting viable pipe bombs outside the DNC and RNC offices the night before the 2021 attack, has been federally charged with using an explosive device.
    


            The years-long investigation is still ongoing, Bondi said, adding that investigators were still executing search warrants and that more charges could be brought against Cole.
    


            She slammed former President Joe Biden's Justice Department for failing to make an arrest sooner, saying that the “cold case languished for four years.”
    


                    “Let me be clear, there was no new tip, there was no new witness, just good, diligent police work and prosecutorial work,” Bondi said.
                





            Nearly a dozen Democratic lawmakers sent letters today to executives from seven companies — including Amazon, Apple and Meta — asking for more information about their donations to President Donald Trump's planned ballroom, including whether they were seeking “favorable treatment from the federal government.”
    


                    “We write regarding our concerns about the potential corruption surrounding President Trump's construction of an expensive new ballroom at the White House, the role your company may have played in funding this project, and any potential quid-pro-quo arrangement associated with these funds,” the lawmakers wrote in the letters.
                





            Among the questions the lawmakers asked the executives from Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Union Pacific Railroad are:
    


            The members of Congress who sent the letters include Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth, Richard Bluementhal, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Dave Min, Mark Taken, Hank Johnson, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Andre Carson, Dan Goldman and Yassamin Ansari.
    


            “This is the most corrupt presidential administration in history,” Min said in a statement to CNN. “And while this Department of Justice may not be enforcing any laws against Trump's benefactors, corporations need to know we are watching closely. The rule of law still exists in this country and anyone who participates in pay-to-play should consider themselves on notice.”
    


            The president hosted some of the donors for a dinner at the White House in October. Days later, demolition of the White House East Wing began to make room for the proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which the president has said would cost “about $300 million.”
    


            The chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee issued a fierce defense of the September double-tap strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean, following a briefing with Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Dan Caine.
    


            “The first strike, the second strike and the third and the fourth strike on September 2nd were entirely lawful and needful, and they were exactly what we'd expect our military commanders to do,” chairman Tom Cotton said.
    


            Asked what he saw reviewing video of the second strike, Cotton told reporters, “I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat, loaded with drugs bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight.”
    


            He continued, “And just like you would blow up a boat off of the Somali coast or the Yemeni coast, and you'd come back and strike it again if it still had terrorists and it still had explosives or missiles, Admiral Bradley and Secretary Hegseth did exactly what we'd expect them to do.”
    


            Cotton also told reporters Admiral Bradley “was very clear” he was not given an order to “kill them all” or not give quarter.
    


            “Admiral Bradley was very clear that he was given no such order, not to give no quarter or to kill them all. He was given an order that, of course, was written down in great detail, as our military always does,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump is joining the presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda on Thursday for a ceremonial signing of a peace deal intended to stop decades of fighting in eastern Congo.
    


            Trump announced that the deal, which he said formalizes terms agreed to in June, is called the Washington Accords.
    


            Trump hosted the foreign ministers of each nation in June, when they signed what the US president called “a wonderful treaty.” But deadly fighting in the region has persisted in the months since Trump touted that agreement.
    


            For the US president, however, this is another moment to herald his efforts to end conflicts around the world. Thursday's signing is being held at the former US Institute of Peace building, which the State Department renamed for Trump on Wednesday, after his administration gutted the independent agency earlier this year.
    


            Trump said Wednesday the newly signed compact would include a “permanent ceasefire, the disarmament of non-state forces, provisions for refugees to return to their homes, and justice and accountability for those who have committed illegal atrocities.”
    


            A key tenet of the agreement is that it will open up some of the region's critical minerals for the US government and American businesses as well as energy cooperation, a Trump administration official said.
    


            Trump also touted bilateral agreements the US is signing with each country to “unlock new opportunities for the United States to access critical minerals.”
    


            “And we're going to take out some of the rare earth, take out some of the assets, and pay, and everybody is going to make a lot of money,” Trump said.
    


CNN's Alayna Treene contributed to this post. 



            First lady Melania Trump announced that seven more Ukrainian children allegedly abducted by Russia have been returned to their families, heralding what she has described as “unwavering” dedication to the effort, despite some concerns from advocates.
    


            “My dedication to guaranteeing the safe return of children to their families in this region is unwavering. I commend the leadership and persistent diplomacy of Russia and Ukraine in the pursuit of the reunification of children and families,” Trump said in a press release announcing the release of the children, six boys and one girl.
    


                    She added, “In close partnership, my representative and I have provided humanitarian support from the United States to enhance the reunification initiative's outcome. My hope is that, ultimately, our collective efforts will lead to broader regional stability.”
                





Remember: Trump announced earlier this year that she was working through direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with backchannel meetings and calls with the Kremlin on the issue, touting the release of eight Ukrainian children in October.
    


More context: Some advocates who have lauded the children's return also raised concerns in conversations with CNN about the way the first lady got involved — and especially her passive-voice characterization of how the children ended up in Russia, fearing that it will only end up playing to Putin.
    


            “Everyone is moving very carefully, but everyone is clear on the point that the first lady's office needs to hear: Thank you — but it is 35,000 kids, not seven or eight,” Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, told CNN at the time. Raymond's Ukraine Conflict Observatory is operating on private donations through the end of the year after the Trump administration cut its funding.
    


            Following classified briefings on the US military's second strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, top lawmakers on the Armed Services Committees mostly declined to comment on the meetings this morning.
    


            Rep. Mike Rogers, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, did not share any information from the briefing and told CNN he was “running late for a meeting.”
    


            Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN, “yes,” he's pushing for an additional briefing with the full committee, but Smith did not provide further information, saying he would instead release a statement.
    


            Sen. Roger Wicker, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also declined to comment on the briefing, saying “I'm going to withhold comment at this point.”
    


            Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley will continue to brief top lawmakers throughout the day.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “serves at the pleasure of the president” even as he acknowledged the Signal controversy was a “mistake” that should not be repeated.
    


            “He serves at the pleasure of the president, and again, I think that ultimately, the metric by which I would measure is: are we safer today? And I think that arguably, you look at the prior administration, I don't think there's any question about that,” he said when asked if it was appropriate for Hegseth to continue to lead the department after the DOD Inspector General found he endangered troops though his actions.
    


            He was pressed by CNN if the country would be even safer if someone other than Hegseth, who has been battered by controversy, was in charge, but he didn't directly answer.
    


            “The Signalgate issue, I think, everybody's acknowledged was a mistake. Hopefully, they've learned from it and can do it better,” he said. “But again, he serves at the pleasure of the president, and I think as I observe what's happening both here at home and around the world, I think our country and our world are safer places because of this administration's leadership.”
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth risked compromising sensitive military information that could have endangered US troops and jeopardized mission objectives in March when he used Signal to share details about an upcoming operation targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen, the unclassified version of a report by the Pentagon's Inspector General released on Thursday confirms.
    


            Specifically, the unclassified Inspector General report concludes that Hegseth violated Department of Defense regulations both by sending the information to a Signal group chat that included other top Trump officials, and a reporter, and using his personal phone to do so, according to the report.
    


            On Wednesday, CNN first reported details of the classified version of the IG report, which was sent to Congress Tuesday evening.
    


            The unclassified version confirms that Hegesth declined to sit for an in-person interview with the IG as part of its investigation and, in written responses, asserted that the information did not require classification before it was shared, citing his broad authority as Defense Secretary.
    


            Read the unclassified report here.
    


            House Intelligence Chairman Rick Crawford told CNN that he is “confident” in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after receiving a classified briefing from Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley about US military strikes in the Caribbean.
    


            “I feel confident and have no further questions of Hegseth,” Crawford told CNN.
    


            Asked if he was told that Hegseth ordered the second strike on a suspected drug boat in September after the original strike did not kill everyone on board, Crawford said, “I'm not going to disclose the details of the meeting we just had, but I'm satisfied with the information I received.
    


            Crawford said he thought the second strike was justified and that it is his “understanding” that Bradley ordered the second strike.
    


            “We shouldn't be surprised when we send folks to do a mission, when they do their mission,” Crawford added.
    


            The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said leaving a briefing with top US military officials that what he learned about September's double-tap strike in the Caribbean was “one of the most troubling things” he's seen as a congressman.
    


            Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut told reporters that Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley defended the decisions taken during the September strike. But Himes concluded after reviewing video of the incident that “you have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, were killed by the United States.”
    


                    “Any American who sees the video that I saw, will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors – bad guys, bad guys, but attacking shipwrecked sailors. Now there's a whole set of contextual items that the admiral explained. Yes, they were carrying drugs. They were not in the position to continue their mission in any way,” Himes said.
                





            “People will someday see this video, and they will see that that video shows, if you don't have the broader context, an attack on shipwrecked sailors,” the congressman said.
    


            He said the admiral said there was no “kill them all” order and there was not an order to grant no quarter.
    


            Himes said he thinks the video should be released publicly.
    


            The US military has killed at least 83 people in strikes that have destroyed 22 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. See a timeline of the strikes here.



            There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.
    


            The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels, beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review due to a classified Justice Department finding.
    


            The US military's September strike has come under increased scrutiny as the Trump administration's explanation has shifted. CNN and other outlets have reported that after an initial strike on a boat killed some of the crew and appeared to disable the ship, the military determined there were survivors and ordered at least one additional strike, according to sources.
    


            Trump revived a playbook carried out in Afghanistan for his campaign targeting alleged drug boats. The US spent more than a decade carrying out attacks, known as “signature strikes,” based on similar rough intelligence profiles as part of its drone campaign in the Middle East.
    


            Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine arrived at the US Capitol roughly half an hour ago, ahead of a day of briefing senior lawmakers.
    


            The briefings will be related to the controversial double-tap strike the US conducted against a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean in September.
    


            They did not respond to a shouted question from a reporter as they arrived.
    


            The Defense Department has been making the case for the follow-up strike that killed survivors during an attack on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean by arguing that the survivors were still “in the fight.” They appeared to be radioing for help and could have theoretically continued trafficking drugs if they'd been rescued, according to people briefed on the strike.
    


            Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who will brief Congress today on the double-tap strike, is expected to make a similar case to lawmakers and will show the video of the operation, an official said.
    


            More than two months after a reported double strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean, lawmakers are set to question a career Navy SEAL with over 30 years of military experience about the attack.
    


            Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, a Navy SEAL officer was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the strike, has had the responsibility of the follow-up attack pinned on him by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, as well as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


            Bradley is broadly respected by Republicans and Democrats alike, and sources who served alongside him or under him praised him as a quintessential Naval officer.
    


            A source familiar with Bradley described him as stoic, meticulous, and “very level-headed.” He has largely approached the idea of speaking with Congress positively and with an understanding that this is what the job requires, the source said.
    


            The admiral, who now leads US Special Operations Command, had carried out “thousands of strikes over his career,” the source familiar said. “This was his 37th month at [Joint Special Operations Command] — he knew what he was doing.”
    


            Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said earlier this week that Bradley is “a highly decorated, highly respected” officer. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly said he has a “stellar reputation” and said any decision to carry out a follow-on strike is the fault of the culture fostered by Hegseth, as well as President Donald Trump.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seize the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine “in any case,” including by military means, according to state media.
    


            One of the Kremlin's biggest demands has been for Ukraine to surrender territory in the Donbas region, which has been annexed but not yet conquered by Russia.
    


            Ahead of a summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Thursday, Putin gave an interview with India Today, in which he said Russia would “liberate Donbas and Novorossiya in any case — by military or other means,” according to Russian state media TASS.
    


            Novorossiya, or New Russia, is a historical term referring to territories toward the west during the Russian empire. Putin has revived the term and used it in declaring Crimea part of Russia in 2014.
    


            Putin also described his meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, about a plan to end the war on Tuesday as lasting a long time since both parties had to “go through each point of the peace proposals,” according to TASS.
    


            Putin said Russia did not agree with some of the points of the US-brokered proposal, but that it was a “difficult task.” He reiterated Russia's demands that Ukraine withdraw its troops from Donbas and “refrain from military action,” according to TASS.
    


            Trump said the US delegation had a “very good meeting” with Putin, and that they believed the Russian president “would like to see the war ended” — though the talks failed to yield a breakthrough.
    


            Ukrainian officials are traveling to the US, where they have been invited to hold talks with their American counterparts on a plan to end Russia's war, a Ukrainian source told CNN.
    


            On top of his efforts to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump also has ambitions of stopping a decades-long conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
    


            The foreign ministers of Rwanda and DR Congo signed a White House-brokered peace deal in Washington, DC back in June. Today, the leaders of both countries are set to meet with Trump and then each other.
    


            Here's what's on Trump's schedule today. Most early events are closed to the press, though we're expected to have access to the signing ceremony around noon.
    


            Ukrainian officials are travelling to the US, where they have been invited to hold talks with their American counterparts on a plan to end Russia's war, a Ukrainian source told CNN.
    


            The head of the Ukrainian delegation Rustem Umerov and Kyiv's Chief of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov are travelling to Miami, the source said.
    


            Peace talks are gaining momentum following a lengthy meeting in Moscow on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.
    


            Those talks were “very useful, constructive, and highly substantive,” but a “compromise option was not found,” Russian foreign policy adviser and Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said.
    


                    A day later, Trump told reporters: “President Putin had a very good meeting yesterday with Jared Kushner and with Steve Witkoff. What comes out of that meeting? I can't tell you, because it does take two to tango.”
                





            Zelensky said Wednesday that Umerov and Hnatov will “begin preparations for a meeting with the envoys of President Trump in the United States.”
    


            North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis tells CNN's Kaitlan Collins that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is responsible for the processes that led to the killing of survivors from a boat strike in the Caribbean.
    


            President Donald Trump says a massive show of force from the US around Venezuela is “much beyond” a pressure campaign on his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro, as he weighs next steps after saying strikes on the alleged drug targets in the country would start “soon.”
    


                    “We know every route, we know every house, we know where they manufacture this crap. We know where they put it all together. And I think you're going to see it very soon on land,” Trump said yesterday.
                





            The US military has amassed roughly 15,000 troops and more than a dozen warships in the region, and Trump has been briefed on a range of options, including targeted strikes on Venezuelan government and military facilities, or potentially a more direct attempt to oust Maduro.
    


            The US military has already struck a string of boats that it alleges are carrying drugs, killing 83 people since the first attack in September.
    


            That attack is coming under growing scrutiny after a followup strike — or so-called double-tap — was ordered following an initial hit that did not kill everyone on board.
    


            Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also sought to distance themselves from the decision to launch the second strike, insisting they weren't aware of what the military had done after the first strike.
    


            Hegseth said the admiral who ordered the second strike, Frank “Mitch” Bradley, has his full support. And Trump said his administration would release video of the second strike
    


            Today, Bradley will face questions from Congress over that strike as bipartisan criticism from lawmakers grows, with particular concerns over its legality.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This story contains a graphic image of items submitted into evidence in Brian Walshe's murder trial.



            The Massachusetts jury weighing the case of Brian Walshe saw a collection of evidence on Wednesday, including photos of items covered in what looked like blood, as prosecutors work to prove he murdered his wife around New Year's 2023.
    


            The evidence capped the third day of witness testimony in Walshe's murder trial, which also featured witnesses who prosecutors called to establish Ana Walshe did not travel after returning home to Massachusetts from Washington, DC, where she lived and worked – despite her husband's initial claims that she had left early on January 1, 2023.
    


            Meanwhile, Walshe's defense worked to undercut any suggestion he might have been motivated to kill his wife because of the more than $1 million in life insurance policies she had purchased.
    


            Walshe has already pleaded guilty to misleading police and improperly disposing of his wife's body. But he maintains he did not kill the corporate real estate manager and mother of three. He faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.
    


Brian Walshe is on trial for the murder of his wife Ana. Here's a timeline of the case



            The trial in Dedham, Massachusetts, will continue Thursday. Prosecutors previously said they planned to call key witnesses later this week, like the man Ana Walshe was having an affair with before her death.
    


            Here are the takeaways:
    


            A forensic scientist from the Massachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory walked the jury through photos of evidence recovered from dumpsters near an apartment complex where Brian Walshe's mother lived.
    


            Prosecutors have alleged Walshe tossed several bags at the location in an effort to cover his tracks, throwing away items that they previously said belonged to Ana Walshe, including a pair of Hunter boots and her Covid-19 vaccination card.
    


            On Wednesday afternoon, the jury saw photos of several items recovered during the January 9, 2023, dumpster search, and prosecutors brought several into the courtroom to admit them into evidence. One by one, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Greg Connor carried evidence bags to forensic scientist Davis Gould, who confirmed the contents of each bag without removing them for jurors to see.
    


            Judge Diane Freniere told the jury they would have access to the physical evidence during deliberations.
    


            Several items recovered from the trash search were covered in what appeared to be blood, according to photos shown in court – though Gould only referred to “red-brown stains.”
    


            The jury saw photos of a black jacket, white towels and a white robe that were covered in these stains. A pair of gray slippers showed similar smears and a clump of what appeared to be hair on the bottom of one shoe. Another evidence photo showed several tools recovered from the trash, including a hatchet with similar “red-brown stains” and a hacksaw.
    


            Prosecutors did not make a connection between the items and Brian and Ana Walshe in court Wednesday. But they've previously said investigators determined that items recovered from those dumpsters were covered in blood and the couple's DNA. They will likely make that link explicit through a later witness.
    


            Gould also said he processed Walshe's Volvo at the family's home and tested several locations for blood. He did not testify to the results of that testing, but again, prosecutors have previously said Ana Walshe's blood was recovered in the car.
    


            Prosecutors called a series of record keepers whose brief testimony bolstered their claim that there is no evidence Ana Walshe left on her own from the family's Massachusetts home after January 1, 2023, when she was last seen alive celebrating the New Year.
    


            In the immediate aftermath of his wife's disappearance, Brian Walshe told police she had left early that morning for Washington, DC, to address an emergency at work. She typically used an Uber, Lyft or taxi to go to the airport, he told them at the time. At trial, Walshe's defense has acknowledged this was a lie, claiming instead that he found her dead in bed.
    


Grisly online searches take center stage in Brian Walshe's murder trial. Here are takeaways from Day 2



            However, records custodians for Uber and Lyft confirmed she didn't use either ridesharing app between December 30, 2022, after arriving in Massachusetts, and January 8, 2023, when Brian Walshe was arrested.
    


            A records custodian for JetBlue testified Ana Walshe was considered a “no show” for a flight from Boston to DC that she had booked for January 3, 2023. She was also a “no show” for a flight on January 13, from DC back to Boston, the witness said.
    


            A representative from the US Customs and Border Patrol similarly testified there were no records of Ana Walshe leaving the country after she returned in early December 2022 from a trip abroad.
    


            A Massachusetts state trooper testified she searched Ana Walshe's townhome in Washington, DC, on January 7, after she had been reported missing. The property was “neat and tidy,” the trooper said, and showed no signs that Ana had recently been there.
    


            Jurors also heard from an insurance agent who had sold Ana Walshe a $1 million term life insurance policy and a $250,000 whole life insurance policy in 2021 – though defense attorneys on cross-examination worked to defuse the life insurance as a potential motive.
    


            Brian Walshe was the beneficiary of both policies, Mark Selvaggi, the insurance agent, testified under direct questioning. The Walshe family also had whole life insurance policies on all three of their children, with Ana Walshe as the sole beneficiary, he said.
    


            When Ana Walshe bought the policies, Selvaggi said, she had to undergo a health assessment – and received the highest health rating by the insurance company. Ana Walshe also submitted to blood and urine tests as part of that health designation process.
    


            On cross-examination, Selvaggi testified it's common for married couples to name each other as beneficiaries of life insurance policies when they have minor children: The surviving spouse can use the insurance to continue to care for their children.
    


            The defense also had Selvaggi acknowledge that, before Ana Walshe bought her policies, Brian Walshe had first tried to purchase life insurance policies on himself. But he was repeatedly denied because of a pending federal case in which he pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork.
    


            “It was probably your recommendation that Ana applied because Mr. Walshe was getting denied?” defense attorney Kelli Porges asked.
    


            “Correct,” Selvaggi said.
    


            Selvaggi said he wasn't aware of a follow-up screening with Ana Walshe after she bought the policy in 2021. He also said he wasn't sure if there were any evaluations for pulmonary, cardiac or neurological health included in her original assessment.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to discuss President Donald Trump's closure of Venezuela airspace amid rising tensions and former President Biden's defense of his Afghanistan withdrawal as national security concerns rise.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif, will not run in Texas and has chosen to remain in the Golden State to run in the newly gerrymandered 48th Congressional District, Fox News has learned.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that Issa's friends and congressional colleagues asked him to consider running in Texas after Prop. 50 passed in California, but the Republican has decided to fight it out in California and expects to have President Donald Trump's full support. 

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Issa confirmed his decision to run in California despite his district being significantly reshaped toward a Democratic advantage.

""I'm thrilled to set the record straight and here's the truth: Texas House members and residents of that state did ask if I would consider running there following Gavin Newsom's historically corrupt gerrymander,"" Issa said. ""I appreciate the opportunity, but California is my home. I told them I'm going to stay in Congress, and I don't need to go to Texas for that.""

""I believe the people of Southern California in San Diego County and Riverside County who elected me so many times will, regardless of registration, consider my record in full and allow me to continue serving them,"" he added. ""I can hold this seat, I'm not quitting on California, and neither should anyone else.""

Issa currently represents California's 48th Congressional District — but the lines of the district will temporarily shift in several future contests because voters passed Proposition 50 last month.

During a radio interview on Wednesday's episode of ""The Mark Davis Show,"" Issa indicated that he had considered the possibility of running in Texas's 32nd Congressional District.

The lawmaker noted that he was slated to meet with Trump on Wednesday.

Issa said during the interview that he needs to go where he can be most useful. 

The Texas legislature and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott greenlit redistricting plans in the Lone Star State, but those plans have been sidelined because a federal court enjoined the state from using the new map in the 2026 elections.

Republicans currently hold the House majority and will be aiming to maintain their grip on power in 2026, a task that could prove more difficult since Trump won't be on the ballot like he was in the 2024 elections.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the D.C. National Guard ambush, broader concerns over Biden-era Afghan vetting and migration pauses from high-risk countries.

EXCLUSIVE: Afghan evacuees with rap sheets that include convictions for sexual battery and lewd acts with a minor and arrests for alleged child-fondling and terror-group support were among the ""worst of the worst"" recently swept up by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security.

DHS released the list days after one former Afghan evacuee allegedly shot two West Virginia National Guard members, killing one, and another was charged in a Newark, Del., terror plot. The agency says the arrests reveal explosive failures in the 2021 vetting system that rushed evacuees into the country after Kabul fell.

Biden administration officials insisted their 2021 Operation Allies Welcome vetting was sound, but a senior DHS official said the president's ""trust without verification"" approach to evacuee backgrounds helped drive the recent surge in attacks and plots.

""Under Secretary Noem, DHS has been going full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and criminal illegal aliens that came in through Biden's fraudulent parole programs,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. ""When Joe Biden let 190,000 Afghan nationals in, they didn't do criminal background checks, vet social media, someone just vouched for them, and they took the words as truth.""

DHS has captured sexual predators, terror suspects, pedophiles and other violent ""unvetted"" foreigners in their persistent daily work of executing President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement orders, the agency added in a statement.

Not all of the arrests have involved Afghan evacuees. ICE arrests have included Iraqi ""criminal illegal alien"" Ziaulhaq Faqiri, who entered the U.S. as a ""special immigrant Iraqi employee"" during former President Joe Biden's term. Faqiri's criminal history includes convictions for ""carnal abuse"" and sexual assault.

But many arrests have involved those who came to America in the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

One of the evacuees from Operation Allies Refuge – the mass exodus upon the immediate fall of Kabul often involving third-party countries, versus ""Allies Welcome,"" the process that utilized domestic military bases as housing – was arrested recently as a ""criminal alien"" residing in the U.S.

Qesmat Din Zafran was apprehended around the fourth anniversary of the 2021 Afghan withdrawal and has convictions for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.

Other recent captures include the October arrest of Operation Allies Refuge participant Mansour Walizada, who has convictions for sexual battery and an arrest for child fondling, according to DHS.

Mohammad Tabesh Rasoli was recently arrested by ICE, which found him to have a conviction for hit-and-run. The case involved Rasoli seriously injuring a pedestrian he struck while driving 50 miles per hour, the agency said.

Iowa authorities honored a request to transfer another Afghanistan evacuee: Javid Ghamgeen.

Ghamgheen had been convicted of two meth-possession counts, as well as burglary and assault on a public officer.

DC NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING SUSPECT FORMALLY CHARGED

Two others arrested after coming to the U.S. following the American withdrawal were Asirullah Khalid-Khan and Said Mohammad Tanai.

Tanai had a prior conviction for assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, while Khalid-Khan's record included sexual assault and kidnapping.

In yet another incident, an Afghan evacuee was arrested in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley on allegations he provided support to the Khorosan Group, also known as ISIS-K.

Jaan Shah Safi was arrested on Wednesday in Waynesboro – just outside Staunton.

DHS officials said Safi's father is currently a commander of an Afghan militia group.

Safi was brought to Philadelphia about one week after the Afghanistan evacuation commenced and applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) – but saw it terminated by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this year.

NATIONAL GUARD KILLING REIGNITES IMMIGRATION WAR IN CONGRESS AS REPUBLICANS DEMAND SWEEPING REFORMS

Officials said Safi was the third Afghan terror suspect arrested in ""recent days"" who was brought to the U.S. during the Biden-era operations.

Meanwhile, a Mideast-born student at Biden's alma mater was arrested in Delaware on Wednesday after police conducted a traffic stop near Newport.

Police encountered 25-year-old University of Delaware student Luqmaan Khan with a Glock handgun, multiple magazines, a ballistic-armored plate and a notebook that included handwritten descriptions of how the weapons could be used in an attack.

The book also included the name of a University of Delaware police officer, the layout of a university building and the words ""UD Police Department.""

Pakistan's foreign office disputed reports Thursday that Khan was of ""Pakistani-origin,"" with spokesman Tahir Andrabi telling Arab News that Islamabad's investigation of the situation found Khan to instead be an Afghan national who fled to Pakistan with his family as a refugee.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Chatbot-Delusion Crisis","https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/ai-psychosis-is-a-medical-mystery/685133/","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:18:55 GMT","

Researchers are scrambling to figure out why generative AI appears to lead some people to a state of “psychosis.”

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Chatbots are marketed as great companions, able to answer any question at any time. They're not just tools, but confidants; they do your homework, write love notes, and, as one recent lawsuit against OpenAI details, might readily answer 1,460 messages from the same manic user in a 48-hour period.



Jacob Irwin, a 30-year-old cybersecurity professional who says he has no previous history of psychiatric incidents, is suing the tech company, alleging that ChatGPT sparked a “delusional disorder” that led to his extended hospitalization. Irwin had allegedly used ChatGPT for years at work before his relationship with the technology suddenly changed this spring. The product started to praise even his most outlandish ideas, and Irwin divulged more and more of his feelings to it, eventually calling the bot his “AI brother.” Around this time, these conversations led him to become convinced that he had discovered a theory about faster-than-light travel, and he began communicating with ChatGPT so intensely that for two days, when averaged out, he sent a new message every other minute.



OpenAI has been sued several times over the past month, each case claiming that the company's flagship product is faulty and dangerous—that it is designed to hold long conversations and reinforce users' beliefs, no matter how misguided. The delusions linked to extended conversations with chatbots are now commonly referred to as “AI psychosis.” Several suits allege that ChatGPT contributed to a user committing suicide or advised them on how to do so. A spokesperson for OpenAI, which has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic, pointed me to a recent blog post in which the firm says it has worked with more than 100 mental-health experts to make ChatGPT “better recognize and support people in moments of distress.” The spokesperson did not comment on the new lawsuits, but OpenAI has said that it is “reviewing” them to “carefully understand the details.”



Whether the company is found liable, there is no debate that large numbers of people are having long, vulnerable conversations with generative-AI models—and that these bots, in many cases, repeat back and amplify users' darkest confidences. In that same blog post, OpenAI estimates that 0.07 percent of users in a given week indicate signs of psychosis or mania, and 0.15 percent may have contemplated suicide—which would amount to 560,000 and 1.2 million people, respectively, if the firm's self-reported figure of 800 million weekly active users is true. Then again, more than five times that proportion of adults in the United States—0.8 percent of them—contemplated suicide last year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.



Guarding against an epidemic of AI psychosis requires answering some very thorny questions: Are chatbots leading otherwise healthy people to think delusionally, exacerbating existing mental-health problems, or having little direct effect on users' psychological distress at all? And in any of these cases, why and how?

To start, a baseline corrective: Karthik Sarma, a psychiatrist at UC San Francisco, told me that he does not like the term AI psychosis, because there simply isn't enough evidence to support the argument for causation. Something like AI-associated psychosis might be more accurate.



In a general sense, three things could be happening during incidents of AI-associated psychosis, psychiatrists told me. First, perhaps generative-AI models are inherently dangerous, and they are triggering mania and delusions in otherwise-healthy people. Second, maybe people who are experiencing AI-related delusions would have become ill anyway. A condition such as schizophrenia, for instance, occurs in a portion of the population, some of whom may project their delusions onto a chatbot, just as others have previously done with television. Chatbot use may then be a symptom, Sarma said, akin to how one of his patients with bipolar disorder showers more frequently when entering a manic episode—the showers warn of but do not cause mania. The third possibility is that extended conversations with chatbots are exacerbating the illness in those who are already experiencing or are on the brink of a mental-health disorder.



At the very least, Adrian Preda, a psychiatrist at UC Irvine who specializes in psychosis, told me that “the interactions with chatbots seem to be making everything worse” for his patients who are already at risk. Psychiatrists, AI researchers, and journalists frequently receive emails from people who believe that their chatbot is sentient, and from family members who are concerned about a loved one saying as much; my colleagues and I have received such messages ourselves. Preda said he believes that standard clinical evaluations should inquire into a patient's chatbot usage, similar to asking about their alcohol consumption.



Even then, it's not as simple as preventing certain people from using chatbots, in the way that an alcoholic might take steps to avoid liquor or a video-game addict might get rid of their console. AI products “are not clinicians, but some people do find therapeutic benefit” in talking with them, John Torous, the director of the digital-psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told me. At the same time, he said it's “very hard to say what those therapeutic benefits are.” In theory, a therapy bot could offer users an outlet for reflection and provide some useful advice.



Researchers are largely in the dark when it comes to exploring the interplay of chatbots and mental health—the possible benefits and pitfalls—because they do not have access to high-quality data. Major AI firms do not readily offer outsiders direct visibility into how their users interact with their chatbots: Obtaining chat logs would raise a tangle of privacy concerns. And even with such data, the view would remain two-dimensional. Only a clinical examination can fully capture a person's mental-health history and social context. For instance, extended AI dialogues could induce psychotic episodes by causing sleep loss or social isolation, independent of the type of conversation a user is having, Preda told me. Obsessively talking with a bot about fantasy football could lead to delusions, just the same as could talking with a bot about impossible schematics for a time machine. All told, the AI boom might be one of the largest, highest-stakes, and most poorly designed social experiments ever.

In an attempt to unwind some of these problems, researchers at MIT recently put out a study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, that attempts to systematically map how AI-induced mental-health breakdowns might unfold in people. They did not have privileged access to data from OpenAI or any other tech companies. So they ran an experiment. “What we can do is to simulate some of these cases,” Pat Pataranutaporn, who studies human-AI interactions at MIT and is a co-author of the study, told me. The researchers used a large language model for a bit of roleplay.



In essence, they had chatbots pretend to be people, simulating how users with, say, depression or suicidal ideation might communicate with an AI model based on real-world cases: chatbots talking with chatbots. Pataranutaporn is aware that this sounds absurd, but he framed the research as a sort of first step, absent better data and high-quality human studies.



Based on 18 publicly reported cases of a person's conversations with a chatbot worsening their symptoms of psychosis, depression, anorexia, or three other conditions, Pataranutaporn and his team simulated more than 2,000 scenarios. A co-author with a background in psychology, Constanze Albrecht, manually reviewed a random sample of the resulting conversations for plausibility. Then all of the simulated conversations were analyzed by still another specialized AI model to “generate a taxonomy of harm that can be caused by LLMs,” Chayapatr Archiwaranguprok, an AI researcher at MIT and a co-author of the study, told me—in other words, a sort of map of the types of scenarios and conversations in which chatbots are more likely to improve or worsen a user's mental health.



The results are troubling. The best-performing model, GPT-5, worsened suicidal ideation in 7.5 percent of the simulated conversations and worsened psychosis 11.9 percent of the time; for comparison, an open-source model that is used for role-playing exacerbated suicidal ideation nearly 60 percent of the time. (OpenAI did not answer a question about the MIT study's findings.)



There are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the research. The MIT team didn't have access to full chat transcripts, let alone clinical evaluations, for many of its real-world examples, and the ability of an LLM—the very thing that may be inducing psychosis—to evaluate simulated chat transcripts is unknown. But overall, “the findings are sensible,” Preda, who was not involved with the research, said.



A small but growing number of studies have attempted to simulate human-AI conversations, with either human- or chatbot-written scenarios. Nick Haber, a computer scientist and education researcher at Stanford who also was not involved in the study, told me that such research could “give us some tool to try to anticipate” the mental-health risks from AI products before they're released. This MIT paper in particular, Haber noted, is valuable because it simulates long conversations instead of single responses. And such extended interactions appear to be precisely the situations in which a chatbot's guardrails fall apart and human users are at greatest risk.

There will never be a study or an expert that can conclusively answer every question about AI-associated psychosis. Each human mind is unique. As far as the MIT research is concerned, no bot does or should be expected to resemble the human brain, let alone the mind that the organ gives rise to.



Some recent studies have shown that LLMs fail to simulate the breadth of human responses in various experiments. Perhaps more troubling, chatbots appear to harbor biases against various mental-health conditions—expressing negative attitudes toward people with schizophrenia or alcoholism, for instance—making still more dubious the goal of simulating a conversation with a 15-year-old struggling with his parents' divorce or that of a septuagenarian widow who has become attached to her AI companion, to name two examples from the MIT paper. Torous, the psychiatrist at BIDMC, was skeptical of the simulations and likened the MIT experiments to “hypothesis generating research” that will require future, ideally clinical, investigations. To have chatbots simulate humans' talking with other chatbots “is a little bit like a hall of mirrors,” Preda said.



Indeed, the AI boom has turned reality into a sort of fun house. The global economy, education, electrical grids, political discourse, the social web, and more are being changed, perhaps irreversibly, by chatbots that in a less aggressive paradigm might just be emerging from beta testing. Right now, the AI industry is learning about its products' risk from “contact with reality,” as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has repeatedly put it. But no professional, ethics-abiding researcher would intentionally put humans at risk in a study.



What comes next? The MIT team told me that they will start collecting more real-world examples and collaborating with more experts to improve and expand their simulations. And several psychiatrists I spoke with are beginning to imagine research that involves humans. For example, Sarma, of UC San Francisco, is discussing with colleagues whether a universal screening for chatbot dependency should be implemented at their clinic—which could then yield insights into, for instance, whether people with psychotic or bipolar disorder use chatbots more than others, or whether there's a link between instances of hospitalization and people's chatbot usage. Preda, who studies psychosis, laid out a path from simulation to human clinical trials. Psychiatrists would not intentionally subject anybody to a tool that increases their risk for developing psychosis, but rather use simulated human-AI interactions to test design changes that might improve people's psychological well-being, then go about testing those like they would a drug.



Doing all of this carefully and systematically would take time, which is perhaps the greatest obstacle: AI companies have tremendous economic incentive to develop and deploy new models as rapidly as possible; they will not wait for a peer-reviewed, randomized controlled trial before releasing every new product. Until more human data trickle in, a hall of mirrors beats a void.

Australia is about to ban young teens from most platforms. The rest of the world is watching.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

Australia is actually doing this. As of December 10, no one under 16 will be allowed to have an account on TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram, or basically any other platform an average teen might care about. Other countries have attempted partial restrictions, but Australia's Online Safety Amendment is the first real ban, and it comes with heavy fines for social-media companies that fail to comply. “Social media was a big social experiment,” says Julie Inman Grant, Australia's eSafety commissioner, who is in charge of enforcing the law. “In some ways, this is an antidote social experiment.”

The inspiration came from Annabel West, who is married to Peter Malinauskas, South Australia's premier (roughly the equivalent of a governor). Last year, she read The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness, a best seller by Jonathan Haidt, arguing that among teens, a spike in anxiety, depression, self-harm, and eating disorders coincided with the wide distribution of cellphones. Australia has a history of sudden, sweeping social reforms. In 1996, shortly after the Port Arthur massacre, in Tasmania, the country introduced dramatic restrictions on firearms. Malinauskas drafted the social-media legislation for South Australia, and within a year, the Online Safety Amendment passed as national law.

The law somewhat vaguely requires social-media companies to take “reasonable steps” to stop kids under 16 from having or creating accounts on their platforms. The social-media companies initially responded predictably, Inman Grant told us, saying they couldn't possibly comply and that they had no idea who was actually under 16. But Inman Grant, an American who worked for 20 years in Big Tech, rolls her eyes at most of their excuses and is determined to push them to do better.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Inman Grant about how the law will work and how she will enforce it. We hear from Australian teens who will lose their accounts just around the start of the country's summer break, with its potential for maximum boredom. We also talk with Jo Orlando, an Australian researcher who studies young people and technology and who doesn't think the ban is the answer.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Hanna Rosin: At this time next week, teenagers in Australia will be living in a new reality.

Katherine: I don't even know what I'm gonna do. I don't even know what the point of me having a phone is anymore then.

Rosin: Starting on December 10, which is just around the start of Australian summer break, a new law called the Online Safety Amendment takes effect. And when it does, no one under the age of 16 will be legally permitted to have an account on any of the most popular social-media platforms.

That includes Facebook, Instagram, Kik, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X, and YouTube, so nearly all of them. Companies that violate the law will be fined in the tens of millions.

This is not one of those vague “protect the kids” laws that everyone can pretty much ignore. Officials in Australia have been negotiating with social-media companies for the better part of a year, hearing out their excuses and pushing right through them.

Australia is serious, and young Australians are just realizing what's about to hit them.

Katherine: My name's Katherine. I'm 15. I'm in year nine.

Rosin: Katherine—we're using her first name because she's a minor—made her first social-media account when she was 10 or 11. Snapchat is her favorite.

Katherine: I wake up; I message my friends, ask what they're doing today, making plans and stuff like that. Just keeping in contact with them.

Rosin: And like a lot of Australian teens, Katherine is dreading this change.

Katherine: I don't really care about the videos and stuff; I just wanna be able to communicate with my friends. And without that, I feel like I can't, because I don't really have anyone's numbers, because it's inconvenient. You know what I mean? I just feel like I'll lose all my friendships.

Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I'm Hanna Rosin. The Online Safety Amendment is a pretty radical experiment. It is largely crafted and championed by adults, and its effects will be felt most acutely by kids.

And it is truly an experiment. Even the person charged with executing it says that it all moved pretty quickly. They're not sure that 16 is the right age. They're still nailing down some enforcement mechanisms.

But given the research from all around the world about kids, social media, and depression, it was probably inevitable that some country would be brave enough to try this.

The inspiration for the policy came from the wife of Peter Malinauskas, who's South Australia's premier, which is like a governor. His wife had just finished reading The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness, which is a best seller by Jonathan Haidt—who, by the way, is an Atlantic contributing writer.

Peter Malinauskas (from ABC Adelaide): I'll never forget it. She put the book down and said to me, You better bloody do something about this. And then we got to work.

Rosin: The work started with local legislation to enforce age restrictions on social media just in South Australia. And then the idea spread to other states and, eventually, the Australian Parliament.

Then–Communications Minister Michelle Rowland: I introduce the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (From ABC News Australia): Today, this morning, the minister and I have an important announcement, and this one's for the mums and dads. Social media is doing harm to our kids, and I'm calling time on it.

Rosin: That last voice was Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The law had passed with robust bipartisan support.

But passing the law was just step one.

[Music]

Rosin: In 2023, the senate in France passed a similar law. It banned teens under 15 from using social media without a parent's consent.

But the French law has yet to be enforced. It ran into political, legal, and technical issues. A headline at the time referred to it as “the most profound social media ban that never happened.”

The really tricky thing here with these bans seems to be how to actually enforce age verification. A lot of governments get tripped up on that step.

But in Australia, they've found a truly dogged bureaucrat, someone who just isn't moved by the many excuses that the social-media companies make.

Julie Inman Grant: This is part of the Big Tech playbook, where you had them saying, Oh, it's too hard. Thirteen to 15 is a novel age. We can never do that. We don't actually know. Oh, we don't have any underaged users on our accounts.

Rosin: That is Julie Inman Grant, Australia's e-safety commissioner. And, yes, that's an American accent. Inman Grant was hired partly because, for about two decades, she worked in various Big Tech companies—Microsoft, Twitter, Adobe—and, much of that time, she was working on safety policy.

When the Online Safety Amendment was signed into law last year, it required social media companies to take “reasonable steps” to stop kids under 16 from having or creating accounts on their platforms. Companies found to be slacking on enforcement can be fined up to nearly 50 million Australian dollars, or about 32 million U.S. dollars.

Simple enough on paper. But it's Inman Grant's job as the e-safety commissioner to actually figure out what counts as “reasonable steps” and then how to hold the companies accountable.

Inman Grant: Companies know who you are, they know how old you are, and that's why they are so good at targeting advertising to you. They also know when a child is underage. They use what we call “self-declaration” or “age-gating,” where they'll just ask a child their age, and of course, they lie to get on the platform. So what we've said, in the first instance, to the social-media platforms is, Self-declaration, age-gating is not enough. You need to use a layered safety approach.

So some companies already use AI-based technologies to be able to assess whether their users are underage. So they might look at things like 13-year-olds speak to other 13-year-olds. They might use natural language processing to look at the emojis, the grammar, the acronyms. The way they speak tells them a lot about how old a child is. If a child logs in before or after school, they're likely school aged.

So all of these signals are being picked up by tools that the companies have developed and been using for over a decade.

Rosin: I asked Inman Grant to describe for me what the morning of December 10 might look like for kids under 16. Let's imagine a 15-year-old goes to open Snapchat on her phone. What would she see?

Inman Grant: It will depend on the platform and how accurate their age-assurance technologies are. But I should just walk you through because it did take a lot of mental gymnastics; this has never been done before. So—

Rosin: Okay, let's simplify the gymnastics.

Starting in late November, tons of kids under 16 across Australia started getting notifications from some of their favorite social-media apps telling them that their account will either be deleted or suspended next week.

Some people who might fall in a gray zone—like, it's not obvious if they're over 16 based on their search histories or other data—will be required to verify their age on December 10, whether that's with a government ID or something like an AI-powered face scan.

Inman Grant: So what we're asking the companies to do on December 10 is to deactivate or remove as many under-16 accounts as they can identify.

We've also put the burden on them. Of course, we know that children are going to try and use VPNs and get around things, but the burden's on the platforms to prevent circumvention.

Rosin: What she's talking about here is kids circumventing the law by using a virtual private network, or VPN, to make the platforms think they're accessing them from a country other than Australia. Several kids we heard from mentioned that they or their friends planned to use a VPN.

But Inman Grant is not daunted by this plan. She says tech companies should be able to catch kids using VPNs too.

Inman Grant: Netflix does it very effectively, and we see other companies doing that as well, so they know how to do this.

We're also asking them to prevent what we call age-based circumvention. So generative AI could be used to try and spoof an age-assurance system, as could just wearing a mask or using graphics from a game.

So we've put in a lot of technical detail about how we expect young people will circumvent, and again, the burden's on the platforms to prevent that from happening.

Rosin: And if a kid still manages to slip past all of these barriers, she's asked them to develop back channels for adult informants.

Inman Grant: So we've also asked them to develop a user reporting form so that parents or educators can report that there's an under-16 on their platform that has been missed.

We've also asked them—because some may take a more overzealous approach, where they overblock—and so we've said, You need to have an appeals process for those who you may have inadvertently blocked that are 16 and should legitimately be on there.

Rosin: Inman Grant has been negotiating with the social-media companies for the better part of the year, and for now, she's left it up to them to decide how they wanna go about deplatforming all the under-16s.

On December 10, though, her powers kick in, and she plans to start asking a lot of questions—very specific questions, like, Hey, you've already told us that there are 400,000 under-16s on your platform, so how many of those accounts have you deactivated? How many have you seen migrate to new fake accounts? How many have you seen start to use VPNs?

Inman Grant: I think it'll be pretty evident in the first couple weeks who is doing this well, who is not doing this well, and who's not doing it at all. I won't give up all the tools of the trade, but we will be watching and looking at compliance.

Rosin: And for those who are not doing it well, she will start imposing fines, although she didn't tell us exactly when those fines would kick in. Remember, this is an experiment; no one has tried it before.

Inman Grant: So on December 10, what we should see is not that every social-media account is going to magically disappear; we know that it will be imperfect. What we're really hoping for is that there will be a significant normative change for parents so that being on social media all the time is not a battle. And I think, for young people, just to free them up to read more books, to engage face-to-face with their friends, to enjoy Australia's beautiful beaches, to get out on the footie field.

And it's worth noting—this was a very quickly deliberated bill. So there wasn't really an evidence base about why 16 was chosen.

[Music]

Inman Grant: So we'll be looking at: Was that the right age, and how does this affect 13-, 14-, 15-year-olds? Are they actually sleeping more? Are they interacting face-to-face more? Are kids doing better in school?

So it's going to be a very broad-ranging longitudinal study to look at: What are the benefits, what are the impacts, and what are some of the unintended consequences?

And I think that's the right thing to do. We've got governments all over the world that are watching.

Rosin: Denmark, Norway, New Zealand, and Malaysia have said they're interested in some form of a ban.

Inman Grant: To be able to develop an evidence base and to look at the implications and then to improve and hone legislation and the regulation over time, I think, is really necessary. Social media was a big social experiment. In some ways, this is an antidote social experiment.

Rosin: By the way, some lawmakers in the U.S. have become aware of Inman Grant. Recently, Jim Jordan, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, sent her a letter calling her a “zealot” for leaning on X to take down certain violent content and asking her to testify in Congress.

Reining in tech is a touchy subject—for lots of different people.

After the break—

Rachel: I've seen people in my TikTok say, Australia's not letting kids live their life. I'm like, You guys are being so dramatic about this.

[Break]

Rachel: I'm Rachel. I'm 13, and I'm in grade seven.

Snapchat was my first social-media account. I got it when I was—like, a month after I turned 11. And then I got TikTok and Instagram when I was 12.

Harrison: My name's Harrison. I'm 13 years old, and I'm in year seven.

I met new people on Snapchat that they added me, and I knew they're at my school, and I never talked to them before, and then I've gotten close to them, and I talk to them.

Annie: I am Annie. I'm in year nine, and I'm 14 years old.

Being able to plan things online is easier. Like, when you're making a party or something, and you've got a group chat, I feel like that's a good thing. It's more convenient.

Rachel: Sometimes I'll literally search out Sunday resets, and then I'll watch the restocking videos. And then sometimes I'll just watch funny videos. It honestly just depends on the day. I just watch videos.

Cheyenne: I'm Cheyenne, and I'm 15.

Everything on social media can be fake. Sometimes there are really good people, and they post really good content, and what they post is good. And then sometimes people, what they post, is just kind of fake.

Rosin: Kids have a lot to say about how they spend their time online. But asking them to imagine life without social media is like asking about life without cutlery. You don't think about it too much until it's gone. It's a means to an end. And the idea of not being able to access it at all is just strange.

Annie: I feel like it'd be sort of distressing, almost, not being able to have that type of easy way of talking to people, especially 'cause I'm moving schools, so it's, like, all my school friends, I'm gonna have to stay in contact with them. It will be a lot harder. I'd be lost, almost. I wouldn't know what to do.

Harrison: It's gonna be sad, but it's also gonna be good for it to happen 'cause I won't be as addicted, and yeah.

Rachel: I feel like I would feel more productive because I'm not staring at a screen for two hours, so I will go out and hang out with my friends and do all that instead of going on my phone for hours.

Annie: I'm gonna be quite bored. (Laughs.) If I'm just at home and have nothing to do, usually, I just go on my phone, and I can't do that.

Harrison: It's gonna impact my daily life by making me go outside more and do things more productive. I just think it'll be better for me and my eyes, actually, 'cause the blue light and the stuff and just staring at things.

I just reckon it's pretty good.

Cheyenne: It's gonna be annoying because that two-month holiday that we have for summer, I'm not gonna be able to use social media, connect with people. I think that will be quite annoying 'cause I'm gonna struggle to find entertainment 'cause I'm gonna be at home all day.

At least I can message people and call people still, but it's gonna be very different.

Rosin: One thing that became clear to me as I heard from Australian teens, talked to my own teenage kids, read about this policy, talked to experts is that I, and many other adults who weren't born into the phone age, we don't really have the right words or metaphors for the role that social media plays in young people's lives.

Like, Snapchat isn't just a disappearing-photo app. It's how many young people meet up, connect, make plans. It's the staging ground for their social lives.

TikTok is an endless fire hose of algorithmically curated videos—and it's also a way to explore your identity.

Jo Orlando: The reality is, if you're talking to young people, a lot of them will admit to spending too much time on their phone or on a screen. Another reality is that social media is not just something that they watch and flick and scroll through.

Rosin: That is Dr. Jo Orlando.

Orlando: It's something that is kind of completely threaded through this generation of adolescents' social, cultural, educational—every other element—kind of world.

Rosin: She's a researcher in digital well-being and author of the book Generation Connected.

Orlando studies how young people use technology, which means she spends a lot of time talking with kids and teens, just listening to them talk about their online lives.

Orlando: I study our relationship with technology, and it's continuously changing, isn't it? The technology platforms change, the apps we use change, but the ways we use technology changes as well. So I spend a lot of time just unpacking that.

Rosin: Orlando does not think the ban is the answer. She thinks social media just is their world now, so better to accept that and teach them to live in it in a healthier way—starting very young.

Orlando: See, a ban is a technical response. So, Turn it off—that's just a technical response. But when you think about how all-encompassing culturally, psychologically social media is, just switching it off isn't gonna work. It's just part of the culture. So if we actually wanna protect young people online, we need strategies that kind of address exactly the multifaceted thing that it is.

We have to think about, culturally, how do we shift this so the content on there or how they're responding to the content on there is safer? We have to think psychologically, from a brain development, how do we do it? And then from a tech-design element. So there are three big factors that are feeding into this.

Simply switching off social media for young people is one part, of just the technology side of it. But we're missing the social and cultural side, and the brain-development side here.

Rosin: Mm-hmm. It seems difficult when you do—like, a ban seems easier. You just say “no,” and it just sends a message.

Orlando: (Laughs.) It does, doesn't it? It sends a message. But that's why there's so much pushback and complication, and it's not just the young people who are pushing back. A lot of parents are pushing back here too because it just feels completely unrealistic that you take away this great, big part of their culture, completely remove it.

It kind of just doesn't make sense anymore—maybe five years ago, but not now.

Rosin: There has been a growing consensus that social media is, on balance, harmful for teenagers. What do you think about that research—or what do you think is missing from that research?

Orlando: Yeah, look, I think, you know, we know there is. Anyone can just go on social media, and we know there'll be things that we would rather our children didn't see.

But there's also a lot of really good use that they're making of it. It's very integrated into their social world. It's how they communicate. There's a lot of young people who've got their own little businesses on social media. One person said to me yesterday, Look, how can they do this? My maths teacher is terrible. The only way I'm learning maths properly is on social media—tapping into teachers who might be on social media.

Rosin: It's worth noting here that, under the new law, kids under 16 will still be allowed to watch videos on YouTube and even scroll through TikTok. The big difference is they won't be able have an account.

Inman Grant's thinking is that the algorithm and advertising will be less precise that way, although who knows yet how true that is. You probably, though, still could watch a math video.

Orlando: So I don't think the social-media platforms are bad in themselves; it's the algorithms that I think are the kind of the enemy here in a way because they feed on extreme, shocking content, and we're seeing that increasingly.

So if we ban it, and we allow children, then, to go on when they're 16, what has happened in that time while it's been banned? The algorithms will still be the same. They still won't have learnt how to deal with social media, probably. They won't have any social-media literacy at all, because they are supposedly not using it.

So I think this ban will simply just put all the negative sides of social media on pause. Our young people will then go on when they're 16, completely fresh and green, because we would've felt, Well, they're old enough now to be able to handle it. So I think, in the ban, a lot of things aren't being attended to that need to be attended to.

Rosin: Yeah, I hear that. But there are a lot of potentially dangerous parts of adulthood that we, as a society, decide to delay or age-restrict, like you can't smoke at a certain age, gambling, drinking, driving a car. Sure, there are underaged kids who find ways to do those things before it's legal, but I'm still glad that those age restrictions exist. Is that a fair comparison?

Orlando: Yeah, look, I think kind of a comparison to a legal drinking age makes a lot of sense or gambling and that kind of thing. But the thing about alcohol or cigarettes is that that's kind of almost a separate part of a person's life. It's not like they're holding it 24/7, or it's in their pocket, and they're not allowed to use it.

The thing about technology or having a phone or having a screen is that, like I was saying, it's kind of already part of us. We've got 2-year-olds who are using their parents' phone, and it's completely threaded through a child's life from very early on.

Rosin: All right, so what you're saying is an all-out ban is not the right approach, that this all-or-nothing tactic could do more harm than good. But also, you do agree that there are aspects of these platforms, like algorithms, that are not good for teens. So how would you start to think about untangling some of the good parts from the less good?

Orlando: Yeah, sure. I think what's really needed, first up—I can't believe we're not thinking about this. (Laughs.) I've certainly given my recommendation to the government. I think social-media literacy is a thing.

When I talk to young people, a lot of them don't even know what algorithms are. They don't understand what an echo chamber is. I did a session in a high school the other day, and I got them to look at their kind of feed, and then I got them to swap their feed with someone else, and they were genuinely surprised that the other person had something completely different. That is a fundamental understanding of social media: that we're caught in our own algorithm; we're caught in our own echo chamber.

So that's number one. I'd definitely do social-media literacy—not when they turned 13 or 16, but way back, way earlier than that. It should be just as important as maths and English is at school, really important.

And I think a second one would be parent education. So a lot of the time, parent education is around fear, cybersafety. But parents aren't getting a balanced understanding of the online platforms and how young people use them.

So those two things—I think those two empowering strategies are absolutely needed.

[Music]

Rosin: Now, it doesn't seem to me that these two strategies, more robust social-media education and age restriction, are mutually exclusive.

But anyway, there is one more thing Orlando is worried about, which is the way the social-media ban might force kids underground. What happens if a kid secretly gets around the age verification and then runs into trouble online?

Orlando: The risk for them might actually enhance. We know there's a lot of predators online. We know there's a lot of kind of negative content on there. But if something happens, because they're not allowed to use it, they're breaking the law, they haven't told their parents, I think the risk for them then could potentially really enhance. Who do they turn to? Are they a lot more vulnerable because the support structures are then gone around them?

Rosin: I've written about kids and social media over the years, and generally, I've been on Orlando's side—or at least the side of: Adults don't fully understand these dynamics, so they should stop imposing nostalgia for their own childhood on kids today.

But the research over the last couple of years on kids, social media, and depression, it's strong enough that someone should run this experiment because, in a few years, it really will be too late. So why not Australia?

Young teens like the ones we spoke to for this episode, who are now 13 and 14, they will surely be disoriented and even feel “lost,” the word that Annie used. But there is a chance that, for kids younger than them—who are, say, 7, 8, and 9 now—there will, in fact, be the norm shift that Australia's going for.

Inman Grant, who has teenage children herself, is trying to see if that's possible.

Inman Grant: It's probably Generation Alpha that will probably experience the most positive generational change. They'll be allowed to have their childhoods. And I'd say that's been the really surprising thing we've heard from young people, particularly people over 16.

[Music]

Inman Grant: Gosh, I wish this was in place when I was there. I wasted so much time. I worried about the wrong things. I saw terrible things. Kids were cruel—all of these things.

I think we will look back on this—and I'm getting a lot of personal blowback, as you can imagine. But I'd like to believe that we're on the right side of history here, and at least we're giving it a go.

Rosin: By the way, two 15-year-olds challenged the ban last week in Australia's highest court, saying it disregards children's rights. One compared it to George Orwell's 1984.

But the Australian government so far is standing firm.

A major seafood company wants to farm octopuses for their meat. Activists and academics say it's impractical and cruel.

Last year, California and Washington state banned farming octopuses for their meat, and bills have been introduced in seven other states — plus the US Senate — to do the same. Lawmakers in Chile and Spain are weighing a prohibition on farming them, too.

All this legislative activity, and yet there's not a single octopus farm anywhere in the world.



This story is part of a series supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from EarthShare. 

The movement to ban octopus farming before it starts — led by animal welfare activists, ocean conservationists, and concerned academics — might be easy to dismiss as a solution in search of a problem. On paper, farming them doesn't even make sense: they're wild, solitary, carnivorous, and cannibalistic; in the first two months of their lives they're incredibly fragile and the vast majority die; and their urine contains high amounts of ammonia, which means whatever company that farms them would have to deal with the ordeal of a lot of polluted water.

They're also talented escape artists.

These are all traits you really don't want in an animal you're trying to farm. But it hasn't stopped the Spanish seafood giant Nueva Pescanova from trying to make large-scale octopus farming a thing in order to supply “premium international markets,” like the US, South Korea, and Japan, where consumer demand for octopus meat is on the rise.

Currently, huge numbers of octopuses are already caught from the wild to be used for food. In 2023, over 350,000 metric tons of octopuses were captured from the ocean, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, which totals well over 100 million individual animals. They're typically caught in traps — which they mistake for natural shelter — and then killed using a variety of disturbing methods, including clubbing them in the head, stabbing their brains, or hanging them in the air to suffocate to death.

But octopus catches have declined in some regions due to overfishing — and so, to create a more reliable supply, Nueva Pescanova hopes to open its first octopus farm as soon as it passes an environmental review. But to those who oppose octopus farming, the pursuit is impractical at best, and morally atrocious at worst, given the animals' complex needs and impressive cognitive abilities. Octopuses can use tools, solve problems, and they even like to engage in play. In the wild, their home ranges span several acres where they hunt, hide, and explore.

“This is a solitary animal that requires a lot of stimulus…So putting it into a confined setting that has high density with other [animals] creates immeasurable stress, produces aggression, produces high levels of cannibalism,” Sophika Kostyniuk, an ecologist and managing director of the nonprofit Aquatic Life Institute, told me. “It is just totally unethical.”

In 2019, Nueva Pescanova said it had figured out how to raise octopuses in captivity — that it could successfully hatch octopus eggs, raise them to adulthood, and breed them for another generation. Farmed octopus meat would be on store shelves by 2023, the company said at the time. But its start date remains unclear, as its proposed farm in the Canary Islands is still awaiting environmental review.

Another major Spanish seafood company, Grupo Profand — which didn't respond to an interview request for this story — and a few university research centers are also busy trying to figure out how to commercialize octopus farming.

In 2023, the nonprofit Eurogroup for Animals obtained Nueva Pescanova's plans for its first octopus farm on the Canary Islands, which was first reported by the BBC. The documents revealed that the company planned to:

Both in the wild and in captivity, it's not uncommon for octopuses to turn cannibalistic at high densities. But Nueva Pescanova has claimed it hasn't observed any cannibalism in its trials. That caught the attention of Jennifer Mather, an octopus expert and psychology professor at the University of Lethbridge, who believes octopuses cannot be economically nor humanely farmed. Mather told me she had asked Nueva Pescanova to send her the data, which, she alleges, the company declined to provide.

“That makes my scientist alarm bells go off,” Mather said. “Show me the evidence, and in the case of a commercial enterprise, if they don't show me the evidence, I suspect it's because the evidence isn't there.”

Nueva Pescanova declined an interview request for this story and didn't respond to a question about Mather's request for data. Over email, a spokesperson said that “not a single case of cannibalism has been recorded in five generations of octopuses raised by Nueva Pescanova in aquaculture.”

Mather has other reasons to think farming octopuses is not feasible. Octopuses are carnivores who are “nuts about crabs,” she said, but feeding them crabs, which are expensive, is “economically not a good idea.” If you feed them fish pellets, which Nueva Pescanova has stated it will, “they'll eat them, but they will grow more slowly and gain less weight,” Mather said, which is a strike against the commercial viability of octopus farming.

But Nueva Pescanova's plan states that its octopuses can quickly reach a market weight of 2.5 to 3 kilograms with a mortality rate of 10 to 15 percent.

The company has also argued that farming octopuses will help conserve wild populations. Mather dismisses that claim, explaining that wild octopus populations are generally fine because the commercial fishing industry's plundering of the oceans has killed off many of the octopus' predators, like sharks and large fishes. While octopus populations in Spanish waters have fallen in recent years due to overfishing, Nueva Pescanova's conservation claim is dubious; there's little to no evidence that fish farming has helped wild fish populations rebound.

I wanted to talk to someone supportive of octopus farming, and since Nueva Pescanova and Grupo Profand wouldn't talk to me, I reached out to Roger Villanueva.

A marine biologist at the Institut de Ciències del Mar, part of the Spanish government's national research council, Villanueva has studied octopuses for decades — including how to farm them. A couple months ago, he co-authored a letter in the journal Marine Policy arguing against a proposed ban on octopus farming in the US, calling for a “balanced approach” to the issue. Over 100 of his peers signed it, too. (It's worth noting that his co-author on the letter consults for a Japanese fast food chain that specializes in octopus dishes, and several of the co-signers have affiliations with the seafood industry, including some with ties to Nueva Pescanova).

When I spoke to Villanueva, he didn't deny that there are some practical obstacles that stand in the way of commercializing octopus farming, though he believes they can be overcome. But he doesn't agree with the welfare concerns.

“The animals are intelligent,” he acknowledged, but in his view, farming them is not fundamentally different from farming chickens or pigs — “animals that we [have used] as food for many, many thousands of years.” It's an argument Nueva Pescanova has made, too. The movement to preemptively ban farming octopus, Villanueva told me, comes from a “sentimental point of view.”

But the fact that we farm chickens and pigs for food isn't really an argument in favor of farming octopuses, considering how terribly farmed pigs and chickens are treated. What's likely more relevant is that octopuses possess so many traits and behaviors that are incompatible with intensive farming: they're solitary, but on farms, they'd be tightly packed into tanks with other octopuses. They like dark shelters, but they would be subjected to occasional periods of constant light. They're carnivorous hunters who would be forced to subsist on manmade pellets. And their cognitive sophistication, plus how little we understand about how to give them a good life in captivity, could further compound that suffering.

But Villanueva said that farms can measure and improve octopuses' welfare in a number of ways, such as observing their appetites, checking cortisol levels, and monitoring skin color changes, which can provide insight into their moods. Farms can maintain good water quality, keep small and large octopuses separate (to reduce cannibalism), and provide places for them to hide and shelter, as they like to do in the wild — all things that Nueva Pescanova says it will do.

“It's not easy work” to ensure good welfare on octopus farms, Villanueva said, but it's possible if farms develop good standards.

None of this, however, sits well with Mather. “You can do all these things to figure out whether they're stressed or not — the answer's going to be, ‘Yes, they are,'” Mather said. “And then what do you do?”

More fundamentally, Mather said, octopus farming denies octopuses the ability to be octopuses. “The freedom to express species-typical behavior is in some ways the most important welfare one,” she said. It's not just about “surviving until somebody comes and slaughters you; it's about, ‘Are we really taking away the fundamentals of an animal's life?'”

The disagreements between Villanueva and Mather reflect a broader divide among the scientists who study aquatic animals, and the kinds of questions they ask.

Jennifer Jacquet, an environmental science and policy professor at the University of Miami, is leading the academic charge against octopus farming, including a letter in support of a US-wide ban that was signed by around 100 academics. She told me that much of the marine science research community aims not to protect oceans and help wild animal populations thrive for their own sake, but to “increase [food] production, maybe make fisheries sustainable so that they don't kill themselves by totally over-exploiting” fish populations. “You really have to think of [the field] as completely beholden to the industry interests.”

Mather said that many in the cephalopod research community — those who study octopuses, squids, cuttlefish, and some other animals — “are not fundamentally interested in the animals qua animals; they're interested in the animals as subjects,” she said, of “exploitative enterprise.” (In a 2010 newsletter of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council — an organization for cephalopod scientists — one member wrote that she was looking for a publisher for a cephalopod cookbook, for which many fellow members had “contributed some fabulous recipes.”)

There's a similar dynamic at play in the academic fields that study animals farmed on land.

Still, while a significant segment of the cephalopod research community is focused on how octopuses can be used commercially, many within it — and outside of it — are pushing to protect octopuses from suffering and exploitation.

Octopuses are used in experimental research by scientists in a range of scientific fields, including evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and robotics. In the 1990s, Mather helped get some basic welfare protections for cephalopods used in experiments in her home country of Canada; other countries later followed. By 2012, a group of prominent neuroscientists declared that evidence indicates that all birds and mammals, “and many other creatures, including octopuses,” possess the capacity for consciousness.

And public interest in octopuses swelled in 2021, when the hit Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher — which captivated audiences with a story of a human relationship with a wild octopus in South Africa — won the Oscar for best documentary (Mather was a scientific adviser on the documentary). A year later, the UK passed a law declaring that all vertebrate animals and some invertebrates — including cephalopods — are sentient, and that future laws need to consider their welfare.

But the specter of octopus farming could pose a major setback to this progress. And it reveals that there's no point beyond which the industries that raise animals for food will think twice about how far they're pushing the animals themselves. They'll breed chickens to grow so big they can't walk, just to squeeze more meat out of each bird. They'll cram salmon, who make epic migratory journeys in the wild, into small tanks. They'll tightly pack solitary octopuses if it can help them expand into new markets.

But Mather and some of her welfare-minded colleagues want industry to look at more than just profit. “When it comes right down to it, how to make a lot of money should not be what we really care about,” she said. “We share this planet with the animals — all the animals — and our basic orientation should be, ‘Are we caring?'”

Jensen Huang, the head of the world's most successful AI company, says the tech won't take your job, but it might create some strange new ones.

Many, including Geoffrey Hinton, the so-called ""godfather of AI,"" have warned that AI's rapid evolution could trigger mass unemployment and deepen inequality.

In an episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" published on Wednesday, Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, took a more optimistic view, saying he thinks jobs that are greater than the sum of their tasks will survive.

""The question is, what is the job?"" Huang said. ""Your job has to be more than the task.""

He pointed to radiologists as an example of a job that won't be superseded by AI.

AI can now scan images more efficiently than humans, yet the number of radiologists isn't shrinking, he said. The reason for that, according to Huang, is that the purpose of radiologists is to diagnose disease, not to study an image.

""The image studying is simply a task in service of diagnosing the disease,"" he said.

Huang acknowledged that purely task-based jobs will likely be replaced by automation, adding that it ""could be a lot of people.""

""If your job is just to chop vegetables, Cuisinart's [the kitchen gadget company] gonna replace you,"" he told Rogan.

However, the Nvidia CEO also predicted that entirely new industries and jobs will emerge as AI continues to develop, raising one of his big obsessions: robots.

When robots enter the mainstream, society will need ""a whole new industry of technicians and people who have to manufacture the robots,"" Huang said, including one particularly unusual new job role.

""You're gonna have robot apparel … because I want my robot to look different than your robot, so you're gonna have a whole apparel industry for robots,"" Huang told Rogan while laughing.

When pressed by Rogan if he thought such jobs would be done by other robots, Huang added: ""Eventually.""

Huang's comments echo those of other CEOs who have said that the robot revolution will create whole new jobs previously unthought of.

In November, David Risher, CEO of ride-hailing firm Lyft, said that the rise of robotaxis could lead to the rise of the ""car-tender.""

""I think there will be fun things that people are going to be doing in the cars that are not just driving. It's making drinks, it's telling stories, it's being the local guy,"" Risher said on a podcast.

In another segment of the podcast, Huang acknowledged that he doesn't know where the new technology he's racing to help develop will end up, or what AI's ultimate goal is.

""I don't think anybody really knows,"" Huang said. ""I think it's probably going to be much more gradual than we think. It won't be a moment. It won't be as if somebody arrived and nobody else has.""

Huang said that he was optimistic about where AI is headed. Historically, he said, society has always been wary of new technology, but those concerns tend to fuel progress rather than hinder it. In AI's case, he said, that caution is actively shaping safer, more reliable systems.

""If history is a guide, it is the case that all of this concern is channeled into making the technology safer,"" Huang said.

AI has developed to the point where it conducts research before answering, reflects on its responses, and utilizes tools to provide a better solution — all of which has helped reduce hallucinations, the Nvidia CEO said.

""If you look at what we're going to do with the next thousand times of performance in AI, a lot of it is going to be channeled toward more reflection, more research, thinking about the answer more deeply.""

Trump's Second Term:

Bill Pulte

A government watchdog is investigating whether Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his position to level allegations of mortgage fraud at President Donald Trump's perceived political opponents. 

The Government Accountability Office opened the probe after Senate Democrats last month requested the legislative watchdog look into the matter. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and Senator Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, led six colleagues in asking Comptroller General Gene Dodaro to “promptly” investigate in a Nov. 17 letter.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Yesterday highlighted the relevance of a market adage: Bad news can actually be good news for investors. After private payroll data showed weakness in the labor market, stocks climbed as investors hoped the report would strengthen the case for an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's meeting next week.

Here's what to know:

Salesforce blew past earnings per share expectations for the third quarter, sending shares higher in today's premarket. While the company's quarterly revenue came in slightly under Wall Street's consensus forecast, Salesforce offered stronger-than-anticipated revenue guidance for the current three-month period. 

Salesforce also said annualized revenue from its Agentforce AI software jumped 330% year over year. The firm set a better-than-expected revenue target of $60 billion for fiscal 2030 for Agentforce.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang returned to Washington, D.C. yesterday to meet with Trump and discuss chip export restrictions. Huang then went to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are weighing whether to approve a rule that would limit AI chip exports.

Huang said the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act — known as the GAIN AI Act — ""is even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act."" Huang also broke with some of his fellow AI executives by slamming state-by-state AI regulation. Such oversight would ""drag this industry into a halt"" and would ""create a national security concern,"" he said.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is slated to vote today. On the docket: whether to change its longstanding recommendation that babies gets the hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth.

While it's unclear how the committee will rule, any change to the recommendation would have major impacts within public health. Some experts caution that doing away with the decades-old recommendation could lead to a higher rate of chronic infections in children.

Meet Sterling Anderson, General Motors' new executive vice president and product chief. As CNBC's Michael Wayland reports, the self-proclaimed ""Silicon Valley cowboy"" is taking the Detroit automaker by storm.

Anderson's remit includes overseeing ""the end-to-end product lifecycle"" of GM's vehicles, according to the company. He told CNBC that the he wants to see a faster rate of innovation and create a ""unified approach"" to product.

Also helping General Motors: Trump's decision to cut tariffs on South Korea. The company is the second-largest new vehicle importer from the country, behind South Korea-based Hyundai Motor.

Major tokens added as much as 5% as bitcoin BTC$91,354.66 hovered above $93,000 on Thursday, a move some traders described as a potential fake-out as volatility stayed elevated across the crypto market.

Cardano's ADA added 5% as key network developments passed a 70 million ADA proposal to jumpstart on-chain activity, in a first such governance vote. Ether ETH$3,096.58 moved 4% as the Fusaka upgrade went live, with the update designed to help the network handle the increasingly large transaction batches coming from the layer-2 networks that settle on top of it.

Attention is now centered on whether BTC can stabilize in the $90,000–$91,000 support region. Market-wide positioning remains fragile after a sharp liquidation cycle at the start of the week, though the broader crypto market is still attempting to carve out higher lows after its late-November drawdown.

“On December 3, the crypto market saw broad gains as BTC briefly broke above $93,000 before swiftly giving back its advance — a structure that resembles a potential “fake breakout,” Bitunix analysts told CoinDesk in an email. “The short-term setup has shifted into a choppy pullback, with markets watching whether BTC can stabilize within the $90,000–$91,000 support zone.”

“On the upside, $93,200 has emerged as the new resistance band,” they added.

ETF flows showed a familiar split. Bitcoin funds saw $58.5 million in inflows while Ether products recorded $9.9 million in outflows, continuing a trend of capital rotating toward BTC while ETH faces steady, moderate withdrawals.

Such a pattern has persisted for several weeks, reinforcing the view that institutional flows remain more comfortable adding bitcoin exposure during periods of macro uncertainty.

Macro developments continued to shape risk sentiment. U.S. President Donald Trump signaled tighter control over the Federal Reserve through key personnel decisions, saying he plans to announce his Fed Chair nominee early next year.

He has repeatedly suggested that Kevin Hassett is his preferred choice — a candidate widely viewed as more dovish and supportive of lower rates.

Markets have begun to price in the possibility of a more accommodative framework in 2025, though that outlook clashes with inflation still above target and a labor market that has not fully cooled.

Background sentiment received a lift from recent institutional moves. Vanguard opened access to crypto ETF trading for its clients on December 2, reversing years of resistance to the asset class. Bank of America separately told institutional clients they may allocate 1%–4% of portfolios to digital assets.

Broader market cap has risen to $3.15 trillion, forming a higher local peak and signaling early attempts at trend formation despite continued caution below the $3.38 trillion threshold.

Ethereum activated its Fusaka upgrade on mainnet on Wednesday, bringing the network's second major upgrade this year and introducing changes to data availability and block capacity that developers said would define its next phase of scaling.

The upgrade was activated at block height 18,200,000 in late afternoon, following test deployments across the Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi test networks throughout October. Final readiness checks were completed across client teams earlier this week.

Ethereum's price has sprung to life, having traded between roughly $3,150 and $3,210 in the hours after Fusaka went live, climbing steadily through Wednesday evening and past midnight early Thursday, according to CoinGecko data. It's currently up 4.3% on the day to $3,200.

Volume swelled from $28.2 billion to $32 billion at the time of writing, over a roughly six-hour period. The price action has been attributed to “strong accumulation from shark wallets” holding 1,000-10,000 ETH, according to early analysis from Santiment.

Fusaka's activation “finally aligns” its base layer “with the scale of activity already happening” across its layer-2 ecosystem, Blockscout, an open-source block explorer for chains based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, told Decrypt.

“Ahead of Fusaka's activation, we saw signs of preparation for higher data throughput across the L2 networks we index with the most visible shift in posting patterns,” it said.

Several rollups are “increasing the regularity of state-root submissions and adjusting block intervals,” a trend that could mean “smoother sequencing and more regular batch updates,” they add. “The trend is incremental rather than disruptive, but it is noticeable,” they said, adding that it suggests “an ecosystem getting ready for more capacity and more predictable throughput.”

Fusaka introduces PeerDAS, a data availability sampling system that allows each node to store only a fraction of the posted blob data, rather than every byte. It reduces bandwidth and storage requirements and gives the network room to expand blob throughput by roughly eight times compared to previous limits.“PeerDAS in Fusaka is important because it literally represents sharding,” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted on the occasion. “Sharding has been a dream for Ethereum since 2015, and data availability sampling since 2017, and now we have it.”

The upgrade also enables Blob-Parameter-Only (BPO) configuration changes, which let clients raise blob capacity without a full hard fork, according to the Ethereum network's official roadmap.

Alongside the base fee changes for blobs, the upgrade prevents blob fees from collapsing when gas prices rise, which pays for running transactions and smart contract logic on Ethereum.

Fusaka also adds tweaks that make transactions safer and easier to run, which developers said could help reduce costs and support decentralization as network activity grows.

Fusaka appears to be an “infrastructure-heavy update,” Shiv Shankar, CEO of decentralized zero-knowledge compute marketplace Boundless, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.

The changes included are “long-standing requests” and “meaningfully expand capacity without disrupting the system's fundamentals,” he added.

Those improvements would likely “influence how value flows through Ethereum's base layer, and the most direct beneficiary is Layer 1 block space,” a Sygnum Bank study claims.

“When the network becomes more efficient in handling execution or processing larger volumes of data, the effects will likely lead to a gradual increase in fee burn and validator rewards,” the bank wrote. “These will not be visible immediately, but they will slowly accumulate as network activity rises.”

Fusaka would “alter the competitive positioning across rollups” and help “define the downstream effects of the next cycle,” Guillaume Poncin, CTO at blockchain developer platform Alchemy, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.

Rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum that execute transactions off-chain but post transaction data to the main network.

The upgrade “represents a structural improvement to Ethereum's settlement architecture,” Edwin Mata, co-founder and CEO of tokenization platform Brickken, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.

“By reducing the data load that rollups and validators must process, the network becomes more predictable in both performance and cost,” Mata explained. “That predictability is what regulated institutions look for when assessing whether a public chain can support issuance and post-trade activity at scale.”

Fusaka effectively “lowers the operational threshold for node participation” in such a way that it could widen the validator base and reduce concentration risk, Mata added.

“Capital markets depend on resilient networks with no single point of failure, and improved decentralization directly contributes to that requirement,” he said.

Ethereum is starting December in Bitcoin's shadow. The token is selling off with the rest of crypto but holding key support zones as traders wait for signs of stabilization in risk assets. It has lagged Bitcoin on the way up this cycle, giving the tape less euphoria but also less excess to unwind.

The tone shifted from quiet strength to cautious consolidation as macro pressure pulled the entire crypto complex lower.

Against that backdrop, we ran Ethereum through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT.

The model generated a thirty-day outlook based on recent trading action and a focused set of technical indicators. At the time of the run, Ethereum traded at $2,752.20. For the period from Dec. 1 through Dec. 31, the model's base-case projection came out to:

Average predicted price: $2,900.80

Implied move: about 5.4% higher

Signal snapshot: MACD turning positive, RSI deeply oversold

The forecast points to a modest recovery as Ethereum stabilizes after a sharp pullback. Still, broader AI price prediction says that Ethereum could reach $28,230.61 by 2030.

For investors looking to position around that kind of long-term outlook, Coinbase offers a straightforward way to trade ETH. New users can earn up to $400 in rewards by completing short educational lessons and making their first qualifying trade.

MACD has climbed back toward its signal line after a multiweek slide, reflecting early signs of regained momentum. RSI in the low-30s signals oversold conditions that often precede short-term bounces when macro headwinds ease. The model reads the tape as fragile but capable of a rebound.

Trending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.

Ethereum's latest move is macro-led. A risk-off shift tied to global rate concerns and thin weekend liquidity has hit BTC and ETH simultaneously, pushing ETH below $2,918 support and forcing a test of the $2,800 zone. Leverage resets and forced liquidations have amplified the drop, with hundreds of millions in liquidations across majors.

On-chain fundamentals remain stable. Gas fees are low, network activity is consistent, and developer momentum continues ahead of the December ""Fusaka"" upgrade aimed at improving L2 scaling and lowering transaction costs. The fundamental story has not broken even as the chart has weakened.

Technically, ETH sits at a key crossroads. Support is clustered in the $2,750–$2,800 area. A breakdown would open room toward $2,100–$2,200 if macro stress accelerates. A swift reclaim of $3,000 would reset short-term sentiment and reopen the path toward the low- to mid-$3,000s into month-end.

Analysts note that ETH has traded with less leverage and less speculative excess than BTC this cycle, which can help cushion sharp drawdowns. Sentiment sits in ""fear,"" not capitulation.

Viewed against these fundamentals, a forecast calling for a 5.4% rise over the next month reflects a market that is bruised but not broken. The model captures oversold conditions alongside a structurally intact fundamental story anchored by L2 growth and steady on-chain usage.

For now, ETH could trade in a wide range defined by macro volatility. Any sustained move back toward $3,000 will depend less on crypto-specific catalysts and more on whether global risk appetite finds its footing.

Crypto's riskiest tokens are crashing on a scale that stands out even by the industry's own volatile standards, abandoned by retail speculators saddled with humiliating losses and a growing sense the game is rigged.

Cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin have been hit hardest in the market downturn that kicked off early October. A MarketVector index tracking 50 mid- and micro-cap tokens has fallen nearly 70% this year, hitting its weakest level since early 2020. Altcoins have now shed $200 billion on paper since the market peaked.

The retail tide that once lifted everything from Trump-branded coins to dog-theme tokens is no more. In past cycles, altcoins would surge alongside Bitcoin and then fall harder. This year, the cohort largely missed the rally - and when the downturn hit, they cratered afresh, sending once-popular tokens like Dogecoin 50% lower since the September high.

One reason: competition for retail dollars has become far more crowded. Zero-day options, speculative tech stocks, leveraged ETFs and prediction markets can offer faster upside, better thrills, and less chaos. And with thousands of small coins - from joke tokens to half-abandoned blockchain experiments - the question is how far the shakeout runs.

For many traders, the meme-era logic was the point: buy a token early, hope someone else arrives later, and repeat. It was speculation built on the greater-fool trade, and for years, it worked. But that engine has broken down. Prices are no longer rising simply because new buyers show up. Investors are starting to judge tokens the way they judge companies - by whether they have users, revenue, or a working product.

“For years, many tokens appreciated simply because of market cycles rather than real progress – and that era is ending,” said Shuyao Kong, who is building a new blockchain platform called Megaeth. “Today it's influenced by cypherpunks, traders, Wall Street institutions, and even politics. No single narrative moves the market anymore, and the rise of traditional valuation frameworks is unsettling for some.”

Altcoins sit at the market's outer edge, a mix of memecoins, decentralized-finance experiments and governance tokens designed to give holders a say in how projects run. Most trade in shallow markets with few natural buyers, driven by social-media buzz, day-trader leverage and hopes of catching the next tenfold jump. That model thrives when money rushes in and collapses just as quickly when it rushes out. And even many of the governance tokens tied to projects with clearer economic models have slumped, another sign of retail exhaustion.

Part of it comes down to something simple: many of the new places to speculate feel safer or easier to understand. Turbocharged stock funds and options have become everyday tools. And on the blockchain, a newer crop of products that track real companies - essentially crypto versions of stock futures - let traders bet on firms like Apple, Nvidia or Tesla with around-the-clock access. These products are still tiny but show where speculative habits are drifting.

Daily volumes for small- and mid-cap crypto derivatives on Hyperliquid - an altcoin trading hub specializing in perpetual futures - have thinned sharply since October's crash. By contrast, prediction-market activity on Polymarket has hit records.

The venues themselves have changed too. Apps that once funneled retail money into altcoins now offer other ways to bet. Robinhood Markets Inc. is leaning into sports bets. Gemini Space Station Inc., the crypto exchange founded by billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is preparing to offer prediction market contracts. Decentralized-finance platform Hyperliquid lets users spin up DIY contracts on everything from stock indexes to shares of private companies, while Coinbase Global Inc. has expanded its offerings.

At the same time, billions of dollars have been absorbed by Bitcoin ETFs - money that no longer sloshes into smaller, riskier tokens. Together, those shifts leave far less capital flowing into the altcoin universe than in past cycles.

Jack Melnick, who works in digital assets and trades his own money, said he has shifted much of his activity from altcoins to these new crypto-based stock bets.

“For the first time, as someone who likes to keep capital onchain, I now have the ability to trade the same businesses I covered in my TradFi days,” he said. “These products give me easy leverage and exposure to companies that generate real revenue at more reasonable fundamental valuations than their crypto counterparts.”

Melnick said this cycle has exposed how few altcoin projects ever build something people actually use - what the industry calls product–market fit. At the same time, he noted, many new tokens launch at increasingly high valuations after large private funding rounds. “By the time users get access to bidding altcoins,” he said, “the majority of the upside has already bled away.”

Another drag this cycle is basic supply pressure: many projects released large batches of new tokens this year, flooding the market and keeping prices pinned down. The launch of the Trump memecoin underscored the point - money rotated into it, draining demand from dozens of smaller meme tokens.

Altcoins won't vanish - the greater-fool impulse always finds new outlets - but the reliable bid that carried past cycles is missing.

There are notable exceptions. Tokens such as BNB and HYPE have held up because they use parts of their revenue to buy back coins and reduce supply - a mechanism closer to stock buybacks. A few others, including Zcash, have posted temporary eye-catching gains thanks to narrative buzz. But those winners are notable mainly because they're so rare.

Only about a dozen crypto projects generated more than $1 million in revenue over the past month, according to Token Terminal - out of thousands still trading. The vast majority are drifting lower, with little to anchor their value.

“Mainstream retail traders are no longer seeing the convex returns in altcoins that they have in previous cycles and instead are finding that upside in equities tied to AI, quantum, nuclear energy and other emerging speculative sectors,” said Joshua Lim, global co-head of markets at crypto prime broker FalconX.

A non-fungible token, or NFT, is a digital asset that can represent real-world objects, such as artwork or even digital land in the metaverse. These cryptographic assets are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency. The ownership information is secured and stored on a blockchain, a type of distributed ledger.

With all the buzz over NFTs in the crypto world, you might wonder if NFTs are a good investment. So, let's take a closer look at how you can buy an NFT.

What exactly is an NFT? Perhaps the first thing to understand is how an NFT differs from a fungible token.

If you think about two separate $1 bills, they're the same. If I take your dollar and give you my dollar, we both still have the same thing. This means a $1 bill is a fungible asset.

On the other hand, if you have a portrait painted by Pablo Picasso, exchanging that artist's work for a picture drawn by a 3-year-old isn't the same. That's the basic premise behind NFTs.

The concept of fungible versus non-fungible has been in our lives for centuries.

– Merav Ozair, blockchain expert and fintech professor at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

A fungible object is something interchangeable or indistinguishable from something else, whereas a non-fungible one is the opposite.

Since NFT transactions are recorded on a blockchain network, their ownership is verifiable. But just like physical art, collectors still face counterfeit issues, too.

The concept of NFTs began in the early 2010s and was rooted in the idea that blockchains could represent unique, noninterchangeable digital objects.

NFTs first entered the mainstream when Ethereum-backed crypto collectibles, like CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties, came onto the scene in 2017. Popularity and interest in NFTs caused the market to mushroom during the Covid-19 era. At its peak in April 2022, the NFT market was valued at over $16.8 billion.

By late 2022, the NFT market started to slide from boom to bust. NFT-related scams, such as fake marketplaces and phishing attacks, eroded trust and caused many to lose money, too. As of December 2025, the NFT market is valued at around $3 billion.

But NFTs still hold their place in the world of art and collectibles. Today, there's a lot more focus on NFTs having practical or utility-driven applications. These include real-world asset tokenization (such as real estate deeds), digital identity and authentication (like KYC) and brand-driven membership, to name a few examples. NFTs were even used at some European music festivals in 2025 to reduce counterfeit tickets and scalping.

Minting is the creation of the NFT. A creator mints an NFT, such as turning a digital file (such as digital art or collectible clips) into a digital asset. Typically, a smart contract must already exist since minting is a function of the smart contract.

With a smart contract, the terms of the agreement are written in code. This type of digital contract removes the intermediary. So, when the conditions for the agreement are met, the contract automatically runs.

Some marketplaces also allow creators to use a shared smart contract, so they don't need to create one themselves.

When the token is minted, it's placed on a supported blockchain network. Ethereum (ETH) is a popular blockchain for creating and supporting NFTs. But there are other networks, too, such as cardano (ADA), solana (SOL), polygon (MATIC), tezos (XTZ) and avalanche (AVAX).

The token record of an NFT is effectively immutable on the blockchain, and difficult to alter. This helps preserve both uniqueness and authenticity. NFTs are typically supported on transparent chains, like Ethereum, tezos and polygon.

Once an NFT is minted, users can list the NFT for sale on the marketplace of their choice, trade it to someone else or give it away for free. Minting involves the process of linking metadata to the token (the metadata can be on or off chain).

Some NFTs are nontransferable, with smart contract restrictions. This is referred to as being “soulbound,” although this practice is somewhat rare in the NFT world.

Of course, buying an NFT isn't like buying a stock or putting cash into an account protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). FDIC-protected accounts include checking, savings and other deposit accounts if held by an FDIC-insured financial institution.

There are no guarantees that the price of an NFT will go up. That means you need to take time to understand what you're buying.

There are many popular NFT types to choose from. You can view the table below to see examples of well-known NFT projects, most of which run on Ethereum, flow or solana.

NFTs have evolved far beyond the early days of CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. While those collections helped push NFTs into the mainstream, many other types now exist. For example, utility NFTs aren't tied to art, but they can provide a functional benefit, such as membership access or governance rights.

Photography has even become an area for NFTs, with artists Dave Krugman and Justin Aversano leading the way. Both of them have collections that are sold on the NFT marketplace, OpenSea.

But this barely scratches the surface. We haven't even begun to touch on AI-generated NFTs or other types of NFTs with emerging formats that might be applied to other real-world applications.

Once you find an NFT you want to purchase, you'll need to follow these steps:

On any platform, you'll need a crypto wallet to get started buying NFTs.

A crypto wallet is where the keys to your NFT will be stored once the NFT is purchased. These wallets can be stored either online or offline. Offline storage is usually recommended since it's considered more secure. Here are some key terms to also understand when choosing a crypto wallet for your NFT:

Custodial wallets: A crypto wallet platform that holds your keys.

Noncustodial wallets: A wallet in which you hold the keys.

Some NFT marketplaces, such as Nifty Gateway and NBA Top Shot, accept credit cards for NFT payments. But many other NFT marketplaces may require cryptocurrency (like ether) to make purchases.

When you do your research, you'll want to make sure you understand how to fund your crypto wallet as well as the types of crypto that back up a particular NFT project. For example, Bored Ape Yacht Club collectibles are supported on Ethereum.

Most likely, when you're looking at an NFT marketplace, you'll already have a type of NFT in mind that you intend to purchase.

The NFT marketplace is often an intermediary that can collect funds for the purchase and integrate with crypto wallets for storage. So, you'll want to access a marketplace based on the following: tokens available, fees, wallet connectivity (if applicable) and type of payment needed, such as credit card, solana, ether or other cryptocurrencies.

If you're buying NFTs with cryptos, it may also require on-chain fees, depending on the blockchain. For instance, if you're buying an Ethereum-based NFT, you'll fork over money for network fees, or “gas fees.”

You might also have to pay marketplace fees. There is typically a payment processor fee if you're paying with MoonPay or via credit card. You may even have to pay a platform fee, too.

Example: Let's walk through the process of how to buy NFTs on OpenSea as an example. That marketplace has a special feature called MoonPay at the checkout window that converts the ETH amount into a credit card payment. You'll also pay the network fee, plus the processing fee associated with the transaction(s).

With your OpenSea account, you can also link multiple crypto wallets to store your digital assets.

Of course, OpenSea isn't the only NFT marketplace around. Other popular NFTs marketplaces are:

Once the NFT is either minted, purchased from the marketplace or transferred to you by the NFT's current owner, it will appear in your wallet.

It's important to remember that when you buy an NFT, “you're buying a token ID where that token is actually stored,” says Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of layer one blockchain Pastel Network. So, you're now the proud owner of the token and its token ID.

Of course, if your NFT is a piece of art, you can print physical copies of it or store the digital image, but the NFT you own is only the token ID. You don't own the rights to the image or the original image itself unless those ownership rights are specified in your contractor via a license.

Like many things in this world, the value of an NFT is in the eye of the beholder.

This doesn't mean that NFTs can't fetch a hefty price. For example, “The Merge” has a $91.8 million price tag, and Beeple's “Everydays: The First 5,000 Days” sold at auction for $69.3 million. It should also be noted that the eye-popping figure that “The Merge” sold for was a fractional sale, split among over 28,000 buyers.

The value extends from authentication and uniqueness, but not all NFTs come with a heavy price tag. Some are valued at less than $1.

As with a painting, the market itself will decide the final value. Obviously, not every painting sells for millions of dollars. But some people believe some paintings might be worth that much. So, they're willing to pay that price.

Of course, NFTs don't have to be art. There are also collectible NFTs, which include digital variations of trading cards and highlight reels. For example, a dunk shot moment of LeBron James sold at auction in 2021 for more than $380,000.

Whether or not investing in NFTs is a good idea depends on the types of NFTs that you purchase, your investment goals and risk tolerance. It's worth noting, though, that since the early 2020s, the NFT marketplace has simmered down. The average price of an NFT sold on Magic Eden is roughly $240, and around $50 on OpenSea.

Even if you're taking a “buy and hold” approach with your NFT investments, counting on the appreciation of your token(s), you should be aware that:

Common mistakes when buying NFTs are related to rushed purchases without prior research. When you decide you want to own an NFT, you'll need to:

Lastly, like any investment, you'll want to diversify your portfolio of digital assets. A common mistake is failing to diversify by allocating too much money into one single NFT project.

For as diverse as the NFT market is, you can expect the motivations for buying an NFT to be as assorted as a “variety pack.” There is no typical buyer in this sphere. NFT buyers range from digital art and collectible enthusiasts to speculative investors and even metaverse users—so it's extremely varied based on interest.

The NFT market is relatively new and not very regulated, leaving the door open for potential scams. For this reason, it's a good idea to purchase NFTs from reputable NFT platforms.

Here are a few common NFT scams to be aware of:

Rug pull: Cybercriminals promote an NFT project with false promises about future potential value. As these NFTs are unloaded, NFT scammers disappear and the value of the promoted NFTs drops.

Airdrop scams: This is when hackers promise to deposit free NFTs into a cyber wallet. Scams typically involve phishing for approvals, where users are tricked into harmful transactions.

When you buy an NFT, you are typically receiving the token on the blockchain for your respective NFT and possibly a license to view. You typically don't receive a copyright transfer unless the creator explicitly transfers it to you in an agreement, such as a legal contract, terms of sale or via the terms built into the smart contract.

In short, income from a digital asset is taxable.

The rules that apply to cryptocurrency are the same for NFTs. The selling or trading of an NFT can trigger a taxable event, meaning you could be on the hook for capital gains tax. Some NFTs might even be considered “collectibles” by the IRS, carrying an even higher tax burden.

There is even a question on the federal income tax form that reads: “At any time during the tax year, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?”

Yes, some platforms like Nifty Gateway, Rarible and NBA Top Shot will allow you to make purchases via credit card.

Some NFT sell for as little as a few dollars. There are also free mint NFT projects where you only pay the network and platform fees. These NFT “thrift store” moments sometimes appear on Magic Eden with solana and polygon-based projects, and on OpenSea with polygon-supported NFTs.

Huaxia Bank, a major state-owned Chinese lender, issued $637 million in blockchain-based bonds settled exclusively in digital yuan. The issuance was carried out through Huaxia Financial Leasing, a subsidiary of Huaxia Bank.

The digital yuan, operated by the People's Bank of China, enables real-time, on-chain recording of the bond issuance process and simplified settlement. The issuance demonstrates the practical application of blockchain technology in real-world financial transactions within China's regulated digital asset framework.

Chinese banks are integrating blockchain into bond issuance processes, recording transactions in real-time to ensure immutability and streamlining settlement by removing intermediaries through digital yuan wallets.

State-owned financial institutions in China are increasingly using blockchain technology and the digital yuan for bond issuance, advancing developments in asset tokenization within the financial sector.

While encouraging the use of its central bank's digital currency for financial applications, China's central bank maintains restrictions on cryptocurrencies.

Newly released emails show Epstein helped rescue Bitcoin's core developers during a governance crisis – drawing him deeper into the Silicon Valley networks that would frame crypto as a way around democratic states

For two decades, Jeffrey Epstein moved through the private networks that shaped modern Silicon Valley — even after his sex-offending conviction.

Newly released House Oversight Committee files, combined with a deep review of archived material, reveal how his money, ideas and relationships flowed into the founders, labs and political circles now defining America's new tech order.

Part One of this exclusive three-part investigation explored how Epstein was embedded in the Silicon Valley ‘Broligarchy' brains trust. Part Two uncovers how Epstein intersected with pivotal moments in Bitcoin.

Jeffrey Epstein's ties to Silicon Valley did not break after his conviction. As we revealed in part one of this investigation, through the Edge Foundation – a private forum that functioned as a kind of inner brain-trust for the founders of Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla and others – years after being jailed for soliciting a child, he remained in circulation among the architects of the digital age, now among the biggest donors to Donald Trump. 

But the newly released documents point to a deeper story. The Edge Foundation was not just a talk-shop. For Epstein, it was a route to influence the direction of Silicon Valley, AI, Big Tech and cryptocurrency at their most pivotal period. One of the most crucial moments of impact was on Bitcoin, the world's most recognised, valuable and widely used cryptocurrency.

At the very moment Bitcoin's future was in jeopardy, Epstein's money and access placed him inside the institutions that were beginning to frame the cryptocurrency as a tool to route around nation states – and consolidate power among a new class of networked tech elites. 

One of them was billionaire tech magnate Peter Thiel, who not only operated in Trump's inner circle during his first term, but has massively expanded his influence on the second Trump administration, with more than a dozen people closely connected to him now folded into it.

In 2012 Joichi (Joi) Ito – Director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab – delivered a webinar to the Edge network. Ito had been a member of the Edge Foundation since 1999 when he first attended and dined with Jeffrey Epstein.

By 2013, Ito began concertedly inserting Epstein into MIT circles despite him being “disqualified” in the university's donor database, telling colleagues that Epstein had been fully vetted. A key figure at this time was the co-founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, who sat on Ito's MIT Media Lab advisory council. Ito turned to Hoffman to help manage Epstein's relationship with the Media Lab – arranging to meet both men on campus to discuss fundraising.

Hoffman and Ito have since apologised for their connection to Epstein.

Between 2013 and 2017, Epstein donated $525,000 to the Media Lab. Other MIT recipients aligned with the Edge network had already benefitted from his money – including £100,000 to AI pioneer Marvin Minsky in 2002 and $225,000 to the quantum physicist Seth Lloyd.

In April 2015, Byline Times can reveal from the House Oversight corpus, Ito forwarded Epstein an internal summary of a major shift underway in Bitcoin's governance. Its core code was maintained by “five core developers” and around a hundred contributors, Ito explained to Epstein – but “only the five core developers decide what changes are made to the core code”. The Bitcoin Foundation, which had financed the project's infrastructure, had just imploded. The collapse came at a pivotal moment: Bitcoin's next upgrades would determine whether it became a global monetary platform or remained a niche experiment.

Into that vacuum, Ito wrote, the Media Lab had “moved quickly”, persuading three of the five programmers – “lead developer, Wladimir”, “Chief Scientist Gavin”, and a third key engineer “Cory Fields” – to join MIT. “This is a big win for us,” Ito told Epstein. 

In a short note attached to the message, Ito was more direct: “Used gift funds to underwrite this, which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.” Epstein replied: “gavin is clever.”

The substance of the exchange was clear. With the Bitcoin Foundation in collapse, MIT's Media Lab had positioned its own ‘Digital Currency Initiative' as the new institutional centre of gravity for Bitcoin's development. It did not ‘control' the cryptocurrency – miners, node operators and contributors retained decisive power – but, for the first time, the main home and paymaster for most of the core developers was an academic lab partially underwritten by Jeffrey Epstein.

A few months later, this new institutional leverage intersected directly with Silicon Valley's most influential founders. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who sat on MIT Media Lab's advisory council, invited Ito and Epstein to an August 2015 dinner in Palo Alto with Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel – the PayPal co-founder and driving force behind Palantir. Hoffman later said the meeting was arranged at Ito's behest. 

The gathering placed Epstein at the same table as the figures who would go on to champion Bitcoin and the wider crypto ecosystem as tools to bypass national sovereignty via decentralisation – just months after MIT, using Epstein-funded “gift funds”, had recruited the majority of Bitcoin's core maintainers.

Zuckerberg, who was also copied on a 2011 Edge Foundation confidential email list with Epstein and other Silicon Valley founders (including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, Larry Page and many others), had previously attended an Edge Billionaires' Dinner in 2008.

In October that year, Epstein would continue to engage with the MIT Media Lab on the Bitcoin project. Joi Ito arranged a meeting between Epstein and students leading the Digital Currency Initiative to discuss Bitcoin, also attended by Edge Foundation member and AI pioneer Daniel Hillis. Hillis had also been copied into the December 2011 email list with Epstein and other Silicon Valley founders.

The substance of these conversations about MIT's work on Bitcoin has never been disclosed.

This elite enthusiasm for crypto would only intensify over the following decade. Peter Thiel has argued that “Bitcoin will never be controlled by the government, unlike ‘woke companies',” insisting that public equities were now “quasi-controlled by the government in a way that Bitcoin never will be”. 

Elon Musk, when asked earlier in 2025 whether his newly launched America Party would support Bitcoin, answered bluntly: “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” framing crypto as a decentralised counterweight to state monetary power. 

Mark Zuckerberg – who has repeatedly attempted to integrate crypto infrastructure into Meta's platforms – has said that the technology underpinning Bitcoin reflected a belief “very strongly in trying to decentralise and put power in individuals' hands.”

Epstein was, in short, helping underwrite the institutional node through which many of Bitcoin's most consequential changes would be proposed, tested and released. And it placed him, via Ito and Hoffman, inside the same social and intellectual circle beginning to frame Bitcoin not simply as a financial asset, but as the bedrock of a new political architecture designed to route around democratic states. Epstein was not the author of this ideology, but he was moving inside the very circles where these ideas were being cemented into Silicon Valley's emerging political identity.

By the time of that August 2015 Palo Alto dinner – where Epstein sat with Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel at Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman's invitation – Epstein had already begun cultivating Thiel directly. 

Hoffman had introduced the two men the previous year, and their correspondence shows an easy familiarity. 

In May 2014, Epstein emailed Thiel, “That was fun, see you in three weeks,” confirming not only that they had already met, but that another meeting was scheduled. 

Emails released by the House Oversight Committee show the two remained in casual contact over the years that followed.

By 2016, Epstein had invested $40 million into Thiel's venture capital firm Valar Ventures, which finances some of the fastest-growing fintech companies in the world.

That year, Thiel endorsed Trump from the main stage at the Republican National Convention, pledged $1.25 million to support his campaign and went on to join the president-elect's transition executive committee. He advised Trump on technology and national security policy and had immediate influence over appointments to the Pentagon, the White House and the wider federal bureaucracy.

In one 2016 message, Epstein wrote to Thiel with a wry jab:

“trump delegate? fun”

In another exchange that year, Epstein forwarded material about Tom Barrack, the real-estate mogul and Trump confidant who would later chair the Presidential Inaugural Committee. Epstein described him as a serious player in Trump's orbit – nudging Thiel toward a closer awareness of the power structure forming around the man he just endorsed.

The contact did not stop once Trump took office. In at least one exchange from 2018 – nearly two years into Trump's presidency – Epstein wrote to Thiel:

“Are you enjoying LA?”

Thiel responded:

“Can't complain thus far.”

Epstein replied with another invitation – this time a suggestion that Thiel should visit him in the Caribbean that December. 

By this point, Thiel's protegés – including Michael Kratsios – had been elevated into senior roles in the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the White House. And Thiel's companies were deepening their relationships with the national security state. 

Thiel was also ramping up investments in the cryptocurrency that Epstein had underwritten a few years earlier. In October 2017, Thiel had declared that people were “underestimating” Bitcoin and that it had “great potential left” – comparing it to gold as a secure, reserve form of money, noting its limited supply and the security of its underlying math.

Shortly after, and during his continued engagement with Epstein, Thiel's Founders Fund began purchasing Bitcoin, investing between $15 million and $20 million when the price was below $30,000. By March 2018, Thiel was describing Bitcoin as a “deeply contrarian” investment. Four years later, Founders Fund exited nearly all its cryptocurrency positions, selling for a reported $1.2 billion profit just before the market crash later that year. A month after that bonfire sell-off, Thiel delivered a fiery speech about how the financial “gerontocracy” – a society run by old people – is holding back Bitcoin's potential as a “revolutionary youth movement”. He went on to declare: “The central banks are going bankrupt. We are at the end of the fiat money regime.”

The newly released emails show Epstein repeatedly presenting himself as being in close contact with Trump's circle in private messages during this period – and in some cases demonstrating insider knowledge he could not have had without real access.

As Byline Times previously revealed, the clearest evidence of access to Trump's political inner circle came in March 2019, in a series of emails to Steve Bannon. In those exchanges, Epstein relayed assessments of Donald Trump's emotional state, factional disputes inside the West Wing and upcoming personnel moves – insider details that only became public months later. The timing and specificity of Epstein's descriptions indicate that he was receiving sensitive information from individuals inside the President's orbit. 

The newly disclosed email correspondence between Peter Thiel and Jeffrey Epstein confirms that the convicted child rapist and accused serial sex trafficker were in regular contact during Thiel's involvement in Trump's inner circle – shortly before Epstein revealed to Bannon sensitive information on internal White House politics that would only become public months later. 

Documents show Jeffrey Epstein was not cast out after his child sex-crime conviction but remained embedded in a confidential inner circle of Silicon Valley founders with strategic influence on the modern world, including Musk, Bezos, Brin, Page, Gates and Zuckerberg

Peter Thiel was contacted for comment through the Thiel Foundation, but no response was received.

A decade after his conviction, Epstein had found a channel into the centre of American political power – through the same Silicon Valley–Thiel networks that were defining the Trump project. His access was no accident: it was part of the structure that had carried him this far.

This was Part 2 of a three-part investigation. Part 3 traces how the same networks carried a far darker ideology into Silicon Valley's AI elite.

Sovereign wealth funds were buying the dip in bitcoin BTC$93,325.36, according to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

“We're seeing more and more legitimate, long-holding investors investing in it,” Fink said Wednesday at the New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. “I can tell you there are a number of sovereign funds [...] they are adding incrementally at $120,000, $100,000; I know they bought more in the $80s.”

That state actors have been buyers of bitcoin isn't news — Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company and Luxembourg's sovereign wealth fund are among those that have previously disclosed investments in the spot bitcoin ETFs.

That SWFs were adding to positions as bitcoin plunged below the $90,000 level in recent weeks is notable though, as Fink continued: “They're establishing a longer position and then you own it over years ... It's not a trade, you own it for a purpose.”

Fink's remarks reflect a growing shift in how some of the world's largest investors are approaching bitcoin. While the asset's price remains volatile, institutional interest — particularly from sovereign funds managing national wealth — signals confidence in the asset's long-term resilience. 

Fink, who once dismissed bitcoin, has gradually become one of its most prominent institutional advocates. Under his leadership, BlackRock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has drawn billions in assets since its debut in early 2024 has become the asset manager's most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF).

At the DealBook event, Fink again emphasized bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against growing government debt and inflation. “I believe there is a big, large use case for it,” he said, framing the asset less as a vehicle for speculation and more as a way to protect against currency debasement.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is ushering in a new form of federally regulated crypto trading, having encouraged its regulated platforms to open up leveraged spot digital assets products, which is set to begin next week with Bitnomial.



The Bitnomial exchange is regulated by the U.S. derivatives watchdog as a designated contract market (DCM), meaning this new activity will be launching in a fully regulated space, following strong encouragement from the federal agency — including direct meetings with Acting Chairman Caroline Pham to help the process along when the federal government was shut down for a prolonged period.



""Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets,"" Pham said in a statement. ""Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.""



The move, which Pham called a ""historic milestone,"" tracks recommendations from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which had issued a report this year setting out a crypto agenda for U.S. regulators. Pham said the CFTC is ""finally using our decades-long existing authority"" to initiate this trading.



Chicago-based Bitnomial set the launch for next week. It's one of several regulated DCMs at the CFTC, also including Coinbase, Kalshi and Polymarket.

""Leveraged spot crypto trading is now available under the same regulatory framework as U.S. perpetuals, futures, and options,"" said Luke Hoersten, Founder and CEO of Bitnomial. 

The company said that such trading on a DCM ""means all orders, retail and institutional, receive equal and fair treatment with no preferential routing, no information advantage, and equal access to liquidity.""

This was one of the first agenda items of the CFTC's so-called ""crypto sprint"" to implement the administration's pro-crypto policy goals. It was among Pham's priorities as she waited for her permanent replacement as chairman, which could be coming soon as the Senate advances the confirmation process for Trump nominee Mike Selig.



Pham has been planning to leave the agency when the new chairman comes in, leaving that person alone in what's meant to be a five-member commission. The White House hasn't yet provided any other nominees to fill out the leadership, so the next chairman will take over the crypto policy surge solo.



Among the other initiatives include a push for tokenized collateral that will include stablecoins, which is expected to happen early next year, and a broad rulemaking that inserts blockchain technology into a range of CFTC regulations.

One of the gaping holes in U.S. federal regulation of crypto is that bitcoin and other major digital assets are considered commodities, but the CFTC doesn't have broad authority over spot market manipulation. So, the bulk of crypto trading is outside the  authority of any federal regulator, except in matters of fraud and market manipulation. 

Congress had set out to give the CFTC its spot-market powers in legislation that aims to fully regulate the crypto markets. But Pham had argued that the CFTC already had some limited authority to allow for leveraged activity on its futures exchanges.

by Alan Boyle on Dec 4, 2025 at 10:52 amDecember 4, 2025 at 11:24 am

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is thinking about expanding into the final frontier for data centers, and his efforts to follow through on that thought reportedly turned into talks with Stoke Space, a rocket startup headquartered just south of Seattle.

Altman looked into putting together the funding to invest in Stoke Space, with an eye toward either forging a partnership or ending up with a controlling stake in the company, according to an account published by The Wall Street Journal. The discussions reportedly began this summer and picked up in the fall, but are said to be no longer active.

Such a move would open up a new front in Altman's competition with SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who has talked about scaling up Starlink V3 satellites to serve as data centers for AI applications. “SpaceX will be doing this,” Musk wrote in a post to his X social-media platform.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the Blue Origin space venture, has voiced a similar interest in orbital data centers — as has Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Google is partnering with Planet Labs on a space-based data processing effort known as Project Suncatcher.

The tech world's appetite for data processing and storage is being driven by the rapidly growing resource requirements of artificial intelligence applications. Altman addressed the subject on Theo Von's “This Past Weekend” podcast in July. 

“I do guess that a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time,” Altman said. “But I don't know, because maybe we put them in space. Like, maybe we build a big Dyson sphere on the solar system and say, ‘Hey, it actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.'”

Citing unidentified sources, the Journal said Altman has been exploring the idea of investing in space ventures to follow through on that thought. Kent, Wash.-based Stoke Space, which is working on a fully reusable rocket called Nova, reportedly became a focus of Altman's interest. 

Nova is expected to have its first launch in 2026. Just this week, Celestis announced that Stoke Space would use Nova to send cremated remains and DNA samples into deep space for Celestis' “Infinite Flight” mission in late 2026.

Much has changed on the AI frontier in recent weeks. OpenAI is facing a strong challenge from Google and its Gemini chatbot — and this week, Altman ordered OpenAI to refocus urgently on upgrading ChatGPT, its flagship AI platform. Such down-to-earth market concerns may have been one of the factors putting Altman's space aspirations on hold.

A spokesperson for Stoke Space said the company would not comment on the Journal's report.

There's another Seattle-area space venture that may well offer the kind of play that Altman is looking for: Redmond, Wash.-based Starcloud is developing its own platform for AI data centers in space. Like Stoke Space, Starcloud went through the startup accelerator program at Y Combinator, which Altman ran for a time before he became OpenAI's CEO.

Last month, Starcloud had its first test satellite launched into space with an Nvidia data-processing chip on board. The startup is already partnering with a Colorado-based company called Crusoe to offer limited GPU processing capacity in space by early 2027.

California regulators have released revised rules that would allow companies to test and eventually deploy self-driving trucks on public highways.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, opened a 15-day comment period for the proposed revisions that ends December 18.

California is home to numerous companies developing and testing autonomous vehicle technology in the state. And while robotaxis have become commonplace in the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles, autonomous trucks are absent because regulations ban any driverless vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds from testing on public roads.

The agency, which has considered lifting the ban for a couple of years now, released a draft of the proposed changes in 2024. The final proposed revisions were released Wednesday.

The revised regulations cover a few areas beyond self-driving trucks, including language that appears to give law enforcement the power to issue traffic tickets to driverless vehicles — an issue that has received more attention as Waymo has expanded its commercial robotaxi operation in the state. 

The self-driving trucks component is by far the most contentious. The revisions reflect feedback received during the initial public comment period this spring, the agency said.

The proposal was met with enthusiasm by companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, many of which are based in California, but test on highways in other states like Texas. Companies like Aurora Innovation and Kodiak AI eventually want to use self-driving trucks to carry freight along commerce-heavy freeways across states. 

“The California DMV's latest draft regulations show real progress toward creating a regulatory framework for driverless trucks in the state and unlocking coast-to-coast autonomous operations,” Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, said in an emailed statement. “These proposed regulations are a critical step towards bringing autonomous trucks to California freeways in 2026, a milestone that will enhance road safety and grow the economy.”

The Teamsters Union, which has fought to protect truck drivers, is unmoved. 

“Our position remains the same, we are opposed to the deployment and testing of this technology on our roads,” Shane Gusman, the legislative director for Teamsters California, told TechCrunch. “The changes that are made don't change our position.”

Gusman noted that the Teamsters will fight the proposed revisions. It's also lobbying for passage of AB 33, a bill currently on the state Senate floor, which would require a human safety operator behind the wheel of any heavy duty autonomous truck.

The DMV's revised rules would require self-driving truck companies to go through a phased permitting process, mirroring current regulations applied to light-duty autonomous vehicles like robotaxis. Companies would first receive a permit to test with a human safety operator behind the wheel. The DMV issues separate permits for driverless testing and deployment.

Manufacturers would be required to conduct testing for a minimum number of miles prior to applying for a driverless testing permit and a deployment permit, under the DMV rules. For instance, self-driving truck companies would need to complete a minimum of 500,000 autonomous test miles — 100,000 of which must occur in the intended operational design domain in California — before it will receive a driverless permit.

The DMV also proposed revising rules that would affect light-duty autonomous vehicles. For instance, the regulations would expand the frequency and type of data reported to the department during testing and deployment and require companies to update plans on interacting with first responders on a more regular basis.

These are much easier to measure, scale, and remember. There are very few contexts where minute differences matter, and I don't think you're going to find a material crossover figure between those that want recipe help and those that are working on the kind of stuff where it matters.

reply

Another thing: although not strictly metric, but European recipes also use tablespoon and teaspoon as measurements for smaller volumes, so no need to convert this.Just my two cents, other than that very nice work!!

And the numbers kept changing even when the scale was empty.

One aspect that I've been really wrestling with is how can we make the end user experience of seeing a recipe better, while still providing meaningful income to the recipe creators who labor so much to share their stuff with us. I'd be interested in your thoughts on this. That to me would be the very meaningful, positive change: that end users get a better experience, and creators get paid. That's been my overarching goal and motivation.

The linked recipe is a great example.  The 1/2 teaspoon in step 1 is never modified regardless of the scale of the recipe.Also scale should go below 1 (like .5).

Also scale should go below 1 (like .5).

growing up, we had the old red/white gingham Betty Crocker cookbook where the scaled measurements were written in the book. the instructions never had any of the measurements in them. based on that, it just feels natural to the point of adding the scaling into the instructions seems overly complicated. just took a look at couple of other recipe examples, and they all leave out the measurements in the instructions.

1. I'll often use the ingredients list (and quantities there) before cooking to ensure that I have everything I need ahead of time. Depending on what ingredient it is, I might not mise en place it. In those cases, a step that says ""add ingredient"" would require me to go reference the list in the beginning, losing a bit of context.2. It's not often, but I've followed a few recipes that require a particular ingredient in 2 different steps in different amounts.

This page probably does not have the standard recipe attributes that are needed for parsing the recipe.I am adding a fallback mechanism for such cases. The text will be parsed using LLM like ChatGPT.Should be released by tomorrow. Cheers!

I posted the first version of OnlyRecipe here about four years ago [1], and the response was incredible. The feedback in that thread shaped a lot of what I wanted to build next. That initial momentum proved that the core problem (ads, life stories, and clutter on recipe blogs) needed a solution.Progress since then has been slower than I hoped — I had some health issues and was building on and off — but I kept coming back to this project because I genuinely love working on it. I've been working on the project on and off, fitting development in whenever I could. This post represents a huge personal milestone.Here's what's new after all this time:Import from Videos: Import directly from TikTok, Instagram, Youtube and Facebook videosImport from Handwritten recipes: Import from handwritten notes and screenshotsUnit Conversion: A highly-requested feature. Instantly convert US Customary (cups/oz) to Metric (grams/ml) for any extracted recipe.Grocery Lists: Consolidate ingredients from multiple saved recipes into a single, clean shopping list.Meal Plan: Plan your weekly meals in advanceControls: Full recipe editing, PDF export, printing, and cross-device syncMobile-First Design: While the web view (linked above) is great for quickly seeing the result, the mobile apps have dedicated native controls for cooking mode (e.g., screen stay-awake, timers, and offline access).In-App Browser: Directly import from any site within the app and many more...To see these features in action quickly (small gif/videos), check it out on the landing page [2]The link above is a deep link to a live demo on the web app.I'd love to hear your thoughts on the new utility features and the performance of the parser!

There are many learnings:1. The most unexpected thing that I learned was the absolute nightmare it is to set up subscriptions.I initially thought it would be a simple task. I started off with writing APIs and webhooks for Play store and App store.But then as I got into the specifics things got complicated very quickly.The combinations of subscriptions (monthly/yearly, AI and non-AI), cancellations, cross device subscription sync, how to handle trials, how to manage subscription states of users, and then when users upgrade, that's another  few cases to handle.There were just too many cases to handle.I then just used a third-party provider (RevenueCat). They have handled all the complexities beautifully.2. Supabase self-host is another nightmare in itself. Just the sheer amount of configs needs (through the .env file) is insane. They have intentionally made it so difficult to configure.3. Setting up SMTP and sending emails is actually a very tiring and cumbersome process. AWS SES is just too much work. Mainly the domain reputation (emails always landing in spam) and also there are not many providers that give a generous trial.

Reminds me that there are limitations to volumetric displays—namely that, since you have no idea where the viewer is located, there is no backface culling you can perform. So it seems to work best for ""cutaway"" views.I'd like to see one in person. Might be ""magical"" — the video only kind of hints at this.

Call it anec-data but all my banking apps work in GrapheneOS, and I have several installed. There is one that reduces functionality if SafetyNet fails (have to do the 2fa flow every time I restart the app, can't set as a trusted device and notifications don't work) but it still works to access my account.That said... I haven't tried to use NFC payments and do carry around a secondary iPhone 15 as my ""business phone"" these days that pretty much just has payment/banking apps on it, just in case one bank or another decides to suddenly nuke their app on my main phone...

I replaced that phone with a new one and didn't bother setting up the fingerprints. It doesn't seem to bother me too much and maybe there's some small security benefit to not having the biometric authentication enabled.

reply

We really need a more foolproof technical solution for this if general purpose computing on the mobile phone is to be preserved. Perhaps some type of a remote control scheme to operate on a ""slave"" device. Failing that, if I do need one of such apps needing ""strong"" integrity, I'd probably look into getting an iPhone for those.

reply

It's crowdsourced and therefore incomplete but https://plexus.techlore.tech/ has reports of compatability with the complete absence of Google Services or a replacement like MicroG.Here in Switzerland my experience is that the big banks like UBS and the cantonal banks tend to work, while the smaller things like McDonald's and my credit card providers tend to break because they have nonsense Play Integrity requirements.

It requires that the card issuer support Fidesmo though. Many here do but I'm not sure what it's like elsewhere.

I don't understand how this works, why/how are a carrier lock and a device lock related? Shouldn't one be a lock on the baseband chip and the other on the main firmware?

reply

For years, carrier lock on iOS devices was simply a software switch. In a lot of devices, still, if you have an unlocked boot loader you can run patched baseband firmware that doesn't care that it hasn't been told the magic numbers to unlock itself.

reply

Unlocking the bootloader will also of course let you eliminate the carrier's bloatware that they get paid to install and load onto it, including the things that they shoved all the way into the Android “non-disableable” list.Tracfone called this “cellphone trafficking” all the way since the 90s when people would buy their loss leaders, flash ‘em, and flip ‘em to third world markets for top dollar.https://stopcellphonetrafficking.com/

The opposite is pretty much true when it comes to security I am generally forced to use an apple device since I can be relatively sure that my keys will be safe (not including state sponsored actors, at that point I would have bigger problems).Now something for the market to actually solve would be poor hardware security in general making locked bootloaders serve no purpose, having strong built-in security at the SOC would diminish the advantages gained with locked down systems and would allow us to have BYOK without compromising on the general populations security.

The horrors of AI's environmental impact may extend beyond Earth as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks into launching data centers to space.

Altman was reportedly considering investing billions into Stoke Space, a Seattle-based startup that's developing a reusable rocket, to gain a controlling stake in the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The talks between Altman and Stoke took place over the summer and picked up in the fall. Although no deal has been made yet, Altman intended on either buying or partnering with a rocket company so that he would be able to deploy AI data centers to space.

More than 5,000 AI data centers currently exist in the United States, a number that's expected to increase exponentially over time. These massive facilities are already putting a strain on the country's electricity grid, but it's only going to get worse from here.

An AI Data Center Is Coming for Your Backyard. Here's What That Means for You

The electricity demand of AI data centers are projected to see a 50% increase by 2027, and as much as 165% by 2030, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. Companies such as OpenAI are pouring billions into building new high-capacity facilities to meet the growing demand of artificial intelligence, but even the executives behind big tech realize that there is a limit to how many data centers they can build on Earth.

“I do guess a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time,” Altman said during a recent podcast interview, Wired reported. He did, however, offer an alternative solution. “Maybe we put [data centers] in space,” he said. “I wish I had, like, more concrete answers for you, but like, we're stumbling through this.”

By deploying data centers to space, Altman is envisioning the facilities feeding off of the Sun's energy through solar panels. Altman had also previously suggested building a Dyson sphere to harness energy from the Sun and feed the growing demand of AI data centers. It's clear that he is overly fixated on finding a solution to the growing data centers problem within the vastness of space.

It's not clear whether OpenAI will reach a deal with Stoke Space, which is hoping to compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket with its own fully-reusable, medium-lift vehicle called Nova. Altman's investment in Stoke would also likely further fuel his feud with SpaceX's founder Elon Musk, which began over their disagreement on the future of OpenAI. By entering the business of space, Altman could just hit two birds with one stone.

Those of us who were using Twitter widely 15 years ago probably remember this. In 2011, a post suggesting that Detroit build a statue to RoboCop went viral, with the then-mayor of the city even chiming in. Peter Weller, the star of RoboCop, even released a video about it. Like many moments on the internet, though, for most of us, that was it. But in Detroit, the fight continued, and this week, after almost 15 years, the RoboCop statue is finally on display.

You can see the statue in all its glory below, courtesy of the Detroit Metro Times, which broke the story.

 ♬ original sound – Detroit Metro Times 

 

Clearly, this is awesome and something that is long overdue. Few cities are as synonymous with fictional heroes as Detroit is with RoboCop. Rocky Balboa has a statue in Philadelphia, of course. The Ghostbusters were New York guys. The Karate Kid is all about the San Fernando Valley. There are others too, but it's not a long list.

It did, however, take a very long time for this to happen. The reasons for the delay are numerous, and again, the Detroit Metro Times has a fantastic piece about it from 2021. You should definitely head over there and read it, but basically it's a whole other story of heroism, as artists and interested parties teamed up over the years to make it happen, battling cancer and red tape along the way. The statue was actually completed around that time, but it took four more years for it to find a permanent home. Which it finally has.

That permanent home is in the Eastern Market section of Detroit, Michigan, at 3434 Russell Street. I know if I ever find myself in Detroit, that's going to be one of my first stops. What about you?

As for RoboCop, not only has he now been immortalized as a statue, but he may soon return to pop culture prominence. Amazon Studios has been working on bringing the character back as a TV show for a few years, and presumably, that's still in the works.

Are there other fictional characters that are city-specific and deserve this kind of treatment? Let us know below.

A 24-week telehealth program combining long-acting anti-obesity medications (AOMs) with tailored virtual behavioral support lead to meaningful weight loss and blood pressure reductions among individuals with overweight or obesity.

“Combined telemedicine with virtually delivered lifestyle interventions for obesity is a viable option for improving access to clinically significant outcomes, although longer-term outcomes should be assessed,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Leslie J. Heinberg, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Cleveland. It was published online in Obesity.

The single‑arm design lacked a control group, preventing separation of AOM effects from those of the behavioral intervention. Significant medication shortages during this study led to missed doses, potentially attenuating results. Findings may not have generalized to individuals lacking access to remote care or medication coverage.

This study received funding from WW International Inc. Four authors disclosed relationships including receipt of research funding, employment, shareholdings, and consultancy roles with WW International.

A multinational survey revealed significant gaps in psoriasis care, where less than half of patients understood the potential future effects of the disease, and most dermatologists and primary care practitioners (PCPs) agreed that psoriasis could have negative long-term effects on patients' lives.

""There is evidence that the potential future impact of psoriasis, or CLCI is not well considered/incorporated into psoriasis assessment in practice worldwide, and many clinicians do not prioritise clearance of high-impact areas,"" the authors wrote, highlighting the importance of ""education for all people with psoriasis, dermatologists and PCPs to build awareness of the need to assess and monitor all elements that contribute to CLCI in the individual.""

The study was led by Raymond Matthews, Dermatology Centre, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust and Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, Manchester National Institute for Health and Care Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, England. It was published online on November 22, 2025, in Dermatology and Therapy.

The study did not collect information on disease severity from participants with psoriasis, limiting the analysis of CLCI burden based on disease severity. The selection process may have introduced bias, as participants were randomly requested to complete the survey and may not have fully represented the overall psoriasis population. The frequency of medical appointments varied widely, and it was unclear which physicians were primarily responsible for managing patients with psoriasis. The financial incentive for completing the questionnaire may have led to the self-selection of people with a higher CLCI burden. Additionally, recall bias may have occurred because participants might not have accurately remembered specific details from prior appointments.

The study was funded by AbbVie. All except two authors reported receiving grants from or serving as consultants for AbbVie and various other organisations. One of them reported serving as an editorial board member and another as an editor-in-chief of Dermatology and Therapy. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

Time to vasopressor initiation from the first hypotensive episode was not significantly associated with 90-day mortality or vasopressor-free days in patients with septic shock, according to a new study. The median initiation time was 2.68 hours, and the 90-day mortality rate was 34%.

""In this large cohort of septic shock patients, time from first hypotensive episode to vasopressor initiation was not found to be associated with 90-day mortality or vasopressor-free days,"" the authors wrote. ""Whether there is heterogeneity in response to time to vasopressor initiation among select groups of patients remains unknown and needs continued investigation,"" they added.

The study was led by Lauren Page Black, MD, MPH, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago. It was published online on November 04, 2025, in Annals of Emergency Medicine.

The study was limited by its retrospective, observational design, preventing the establishment of causality. The dynamic nature of septic shock management and fluid responsiveness were not fully captured. Data were restricted to Florida facilities, reducing generalizability, and residual confounding may have further affected the results.

The study was supported by the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network, funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; OneFlorida+ Cancer Control Alliance, funded by the Florida Department of Health's James and Esther King Biomedical Research Program; Université de Franche-Comté and Translational Science Institute, funded by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; and awards from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

A digital, noninvasive home‑monitoring system — integrating home spirometry, smartwatch data, and medical feedback — showed promise for managing pediatric asthma. Nocturnal heart rate monitoring was associated with asthma control and may serve as a promising noninvasive marker for deterioration. 

“These advances [remote alerts, optional monitoring, and minimal burden] signal a shift toward individualized, technology-driven approaches for early detection and quantitative control assessment,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Casper E.W. Gijsen, Care and Public Health Research Institute, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands. It was published online on November 11, 2025, in Scientific Reports.

The study was conducted over a short period during spring and summer; therefore, it may not have captured seasonal variations in asthma symptoms. It used a single-cohort design without a control group. Additionally, participation was voluntary, which likely introduced selection bias toward individuals more motivated than the general population.

No funding was reported for the study. The authors reported having no competing interests.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is invaluable in the medical world. But despite all the good it does, there is room for improvement. One way to enhance the sensitivity of MRI is called dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), where target molecules for imaging are modified so they form clearer images when scanned with an MRI machine. But this technique requires some special crystalline materials mixed with polarizing agents which are difficult to create. For the first time, researchers including those from the University of Tokyo demonstrate the use of molecules called fullerenes as polarizing agents. Their new method can make DNP targets sufficient to yield far greater clarity when imaged with an MRI machine, with potential benefits in various medical applications.

If you're lucky enough to have never visited the inside of an MRI machine before, then you are still probably familiar with them: enormous ring-shaped things which engulf a person and noisily scan them to create detailed 3D images for diagnostic purposes. Since their mainstream introduction to the medical world over four decades ago, MRI machines have allowed clinicians and researchers to use 3D data for various diagnostic and research purposes. But as with every machine, there are constant upgrades proposed to improve some aspect or other, whether it's size, cost, noise, functions or abilities.

A typical MRI works by creating a large magnetic field. This forces the protons of water molecules in the body or sample to align. The machine then emits radio waves which knock these protons out of alignment, so that they spring back into alignment again under the force of the magnetic field. As they realign, the protons give off a telltale radio signal which the machine detects and uses to identify the kind of tissue the signal came from. But as you may have already picked up, this means that typical MRI machines are limited to the detection of samples rich in water. So, researchers sought a way to broaden the scope of what the machines can detect, and this is where new research from the Department of Chemistry comes in.

An established way to improve the detail and information content of MRI images is to use chemical targets in the patient or sample. DNP works this way, but requires agents to polarize the target molecules, and that in turn usually requires extremely cold, or cryogenic, temperatures, and high magnetic field conditions. But we demonstrated an easier way to polarize targets. Our work shows that by using specially designed molecules called fullerenes, we can boost polarization rate to 14.2% in a sample of disordered, glasslike material. This level is high enough for biological applications where a threshold of 10% is the minimum desired; otherwise, polarized molecules decay too quickly for their signals to yield useful images.""

Professor Nobuhiro Yanai, Department of Chemistry

Fullerenes, also known as buckyballs, are 3D geometric lattices of carbon atoms, which have attracted researchers' attention as they can be modified in different ways to create functional materials. In this case, Yanai and his team added certain modifications to fullerenes which prevented their rotations such that they would stay polarized. When placed in a sample, electrons from these fullerenes transfer their spin polarization to the nuclei of nearby atoms, and it's this polarization that translates into stronger signals for the imaging sensors to detect. And all the researchers need to do to coax their special fullerenes, called trans-3a isomers, to do this is by shining a certain kind of light on them.

""The polarization of the targets is done outside the body. After polarization, the sample is dissolved, and the fullerene, which could be harmful, is removed before injection into a hypothetical patient,"" said graduate student Kieta Sakamoto. ""Because this method, triplet-DNP, avoids the need for a liquid helium coolant, it can run on much simpler, lower-cost equipment. It also makes it possible to bulk-polarize diagnostic chemical probes like pyruvate or anticancer drugs that conventional MRI cannot detect. Our next goal is to develop biocompatible matrices so we can hyperpolarize such medically important molecules. We plan to demonstrate high-sensitivity MRI in animal models first. If those experiments succeed and clinical trials follow, we expect this technology could reach real medical settings in about 10 to 20 years.""

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States is expected to face a significant shortage of OB-GYNs in the next five years. It's vital for women to have access to highly trained health care providers for all stages of their lives, from the first menstrual cycle to menopause and beyond. Certified nurse-midwives offer this kind of care, but most Americans don't realize it.

A new survey by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center reveals 93% of people think midwives only deliver babies and are surprised to learn they can be a trusted partner in all aspects of women's health.

We take care of women across the lifespan. We are highly trained and we're highly skilled. We can take care of you even if there is something more complex about you or your health.""

Michaela Ward, APRN-CNM, a certified nurse-midwife, Ohio State Wexner Medical Center

The Ohio State survey of 1,006 Americans shows only 1 in 5 are aware midwives can provide women's annual gynecology exams. The survey found that while some services, such as pregnancy and birth support and water births were identified correctly as midwife services by over half of adults, other services, like medication management, menopause care and annual women's health exams are known by far fewer.

Among those lesser-known services, there are no significant differences by gender, meaning both men and women are equally unaware of the full breadth of women's health services provided by midwives.

Survey respondents' knowledge of women's health services provided by midwives:

Pregnancy and birth support (93%)

Water births (69%)

Medication management, including birth control (26%)

Menopause care (23%)

Annual women's health exams including pap smears and STI testing (20%)

C-sections (13%)

Don't know (1%)

Ohio State has 17 certified nurse-midwives on staff, the largest midwife program in central Ohio. Maternal fetal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology specialists are only a phone call away from midwives to provide support and care to patients with complex pregnancies.

""If I need to consult with one of our physicians at Ohio State, I can call them right away and discuss the patient's case,"" said Ward. ""We all work together to provide the best care possible for our patients.""

Mauricio Pochettino made sure to reiterate that the U.S. men's national team is bigger and “more important” than any one player ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

The Stars and Stripes' manager did not call out Christian Pulisic by name, but his bold statement only fueled recent controversy surrounding the AC Milan winger, who came under fire for his commitment to the USMNT. 

Pulisic, along with a long list of the biggest American stars, skipped last summer's Gold Cup, leaving Pochettino with a squad largely of MLS and other unproven players typically overlooked for the likes of the USMNT captain, Weston McKennie, Folarin Balogun and Antonee Robinson.  

Although the team only managed a runners-up finish after falling 2–1 to Mexico in the final, the experience helped shape the culture Pochettino was intent on fostering with the national team. 

“The badge, the federation, the flag is more important than any name, and I think we proved that if you have good players ... you can perform and maybe achieve what you want,” Pochettino said on the U.S. Soccer Podcast from the 2025 U.S. Soccer Summit. 

“We had to face situations we never expected,” assistant manager Jesús Pérez added. “But that gave us opportunity to reveal things and to give opportunities to other [players] in different scenarios and now that's the moment that ... makes the team feel that the badge is the most important. 

“If you want to play for this team, you have to deserve to play.”

After skipping the Gold Cup, Pulisic returned to the USMNT for the September international break. The 27-year-old struggled to have an impact in the team's 2–0 defeat to South Korea, but then bounced back with an assist in the Stars and Stripes' 2–0 win over Japan.

Fitness concerns limited Pulisic to only a cameo appearance off the bench against Ecuador during the October international break, before he was forced to withdraw against Australia due to a hamstring injury.

The captain recovered in time for the November window, but he made the decision to priortize his full recovery, with Pochettino and the USMNT's support. The Stars and Stripes went on to defeat Paraguay and Uruguay in two statement victories.

With matches against Portugal and Belgium coming in March, Pulisic will hope to return with a bang to help the USMNT find its best form ahead of the 2026 World Cup on home soil. He will also no doubt be eager to finally silence the noise surrounding his commitment to the national team.

The human rights organization is demanding concrete protections for workers, athletes, fans, and journalists attending the tournament next summer

FIFA president Gianni Infantino and U.S. president Donald Trump have gone out of their way to emphasize the importance of security ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Fans, both local and foreign, have been told they need not fear criminals. But the fans and workers who attend the tournament may instead fear federal agents who, since the start of the Republican's second administration, have roamed the country — often with their faces covered and without any identifying insignia — looking for people to detain and deport.

On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) revealed that an asylum seeker had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on the day of the Club World Cup final, this past July 13, and later deported, raising serious concerns ahead of next summer's tournament. “The World Cup cannot be a way to entrap Latino fans. It would be the worst perversion of the idea of football as the beautiful game,” warns Minky Worden, HRW's Director of Global Initiatives.

But that perversion, as it turns out, had already made its appearance in the stands. While President Trump attended the VIP box at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium to enjoy the decisive match between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain last July, two children — ages 14 and 10 — were sitting in their seats among more than 80,000 spectators, but they were alone. Minutes earlier, their father had been arrested in the parking lot of a nearby mall. The minors decided to enter the stadium, encouraged by their father, because they all believed they would reunite once the misunderstanding was cleared up.

Police had initially detained him to issue a citation for improperly flying a small drone to take photos and videos. But they then brought him inside the stadium for further questioning and ultimately handed him over to ICE custody, despite the fact that his young children had no other guardian and that he had a valid work permit while his asylum claim was pending. The man — whose name and nationality have been withheld for fear of reprisals both in the United States and in his home country — spent three months in a New Jersey immigration detention center called Delaney Hall. In October, he chose voluntary deportation, unable to withstand the terrible conditions any longer and wanting to protect his family.

“This is not an isolated case,” Worden says. “The data we've amassed indicates that the risk for FIFA across 78 matches in the United States is huge.” According to information from the Deportation Data Project analyzed by HRW, between January 20 and July 29 of this year, immigration authorities made 55,749 arrests in areas where World Cup matches will be played. On top of that, in recent days and weeks the Trump administration's anti-immigrant and xenophobic rhetoric has hardened even further, and the White House is not ruling out raids during the World Cup.

On Wednesday, Trump ally Andrew Giuliani, the White House representative on the FIFA working group and son of the former New York mayor, addressed the case highlighted by HRW at a press conference. “As for the illegal individual who was detained, he was violating a temporary flight restriction with an anti-UAS — with a drone, I should say — so obviously that's in line with what the president has said about wanting to ensure that these games are safe and secure. There will be no tolerance for people flying their drones around these stadiums during the matches,” he insisted, leaning on the drone violation and avoiding any mention of the two minors left without their legal guardian.

Last week, HRW sent a letter to Infantino — obtained by EL PAÍS — informing FIFA of the ICE arrest near MetLife Stadium over the summer and requesting information about measures and protocols to protect migrants and minors during the tournament. They also asked whether FIFA had received guarantees from the Trump administration. So far, FIFA has not responded directly to HRW's letter, though it has said that the arrest in question is not its responsibility because it occurred in an area separate from the stadium — the adjacent parking lot — and they have no record of anyone with the detainee's name purchasing a ticket. The family says they bought the tickets on the secondary market.

Just days before the official draw for the largest World Cup in history, HRW's revelation joins a call from a coalition of human rights groups led by the Sport & Rights Alliance urging respect for the rights and freedoms of those attending the tournament next summer. “Workers, athletes, fans, and communities make the World Cup possible,” said Andrea Florence, executive director of the Sport & Rights Alliance. “The 2026 World Cup is the first to begin with human rights criteria embedded in the bidding process. But the deteriorating human rights situation in the United States has put those commitments at risk.” The coalition's statement, released 200 days before the tournament begins, underscores the growing attacks and persecution of immigrants in the United States, as well as FIFA's cancellation of anti-discrimination messages and the threats to press freedom.

For HRW's Worden, the situation of Haitians in the United States encapsulates the issue. Last week, the Trump administration ended Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, which had allowed hundreds of thousands of Haitians to live in the U.S. for decades. “In the context of the World Cup, this is extremely alarming because the Haitian national team has qualified for the tournament for the first time in 52 years. So many Haitians whose legal status changed overnight may go to cheer for their team without knowing they could be at risk of deportation.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- FIFA chief of global football development Arsene Wenger has defended the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, saying it ""is the right amount"" for a World Cup.

The 2026 edition of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico will be the first that will have 48 teams, after the previous seven editions had 32.

There has been concern that such an increase will make the tournament unwieldy and dilute the quality. But former Arsenal manager Wenger said he is in favor of the increase.

- FIFA referees' chief supports VAR use on corner kicks
- What to know about the 2026 FIFA World Cup format
- One thing to know about confirmed 2026 World Cup teams pre-draw

Speaking at a panel alongside FIFA chief football officer, and former U.S. women's national team head coach Jill Ellis ahead of Friday's World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center, Wenger said, ""I believe that 48 teams is the right number. It's less than 25% for 211 countries who are affiliated to FIFA. That means one team out of four has a chance to participate. That means still 75% of the teams are not there.""

As for the possible dilution of quality, Wenger pointed to the recently contested FIFA U17 World Cup, which also had 48 teams.

""I'm quite optimistic, because to qualify you need to be beat the teams of your confederation, and that's a sign of quality, it's just down to results,"" Wenger said.

""The teams are not there by coincidence because they've been invited. [They're] here because they've beaten some teams in their confederation, but have a quality, and you look at the playoffs now, the quality of the players and the quality of the teams that we played there. So I'm optimistic about that.

""We had the same question to answer at the U17 World Cup and we were positively surprised [at the quality].""

Heading into the tournament, there are also questions about the quality of the pitches, as well as how teams will cope with temperatures that will likely exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Wenger said that FIFA had learned a lot of lessons at the Club World Cup, which was held in the U.S. last summer.

Unlike in previous tournaments, the venues and kickoff times for the 2026 edition won't be released on the same day as the groups are drawn -- with FIFA instead hosting an event on Saturday to reveal the full match schedule.

""We are quite confident that the quality of the pitches will be perfect because for two months before the competition there's no games played on the pitches,"" Wenger said.

""We learned a lot about how to protect better the teams after the draw, and on Saturday we have the places where the games will be played and as well the timing of the games and we consider a lot the best possibilities for the teams to be protected from heat and as well for the players where we have hydrating moments during the game but could be decided before the game.""

In terms of who he expects to do well, Wenger said that England will be among the favorites, but that France is a ""super favorite"" due to its depth.

""[England], they're always near there to win it; semifinal, quarterfinal and final. And they have to make a step. They have the quality to do it.

""I still believe in Europe personally, by trying to be as objective as possible, that France is a super favorite just for one reason: It's a country that has more quality strikers than any team in the world.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Lionel Messi airs 2026 World Cup ‘hope' with Argentina but rules out meeting with Spain & Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal in Finalissima","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/lionel-messi-2026-world-cup-hope-argentina-spain-barcelona-wonderkid-lamine-yamal-finalissima/bltae03559e344faf24","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:40:02 GMT","

Lionel Messi has aired his 2026 World Cup “hope”, with there still a chance that he will grace that competition, but has ruled himself out of a meeting with Spain and Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the next Finalissima. Argentina are hoping to have their talismanic captain available for the defence of a global title next summer, but will be without him if a clash with the reigning champions of Europe is confirmed.

Messi inspired his country to World Cup glory at Qatar 2022, allowing his historic medal collection to be completed. The all-time great is now 38 years of age and plying his club trade in the United States with MLS Cup finalists Inter Miami.

He has conceded that a winter break may leave him short on sharpness for FIFA's flagship event next summer, with MLS action resuming in the spring, but has stopped short of telling national team boss Lionel Scaloni that he will not be available.

Quizzed again on whether he intends to grace another World Cup, Messi told ESPN: “I hope I can be there. I've said before that I'd love to be there. At worst, I'll be there watching it live, but it will be special. The World Cup is special for everyone, for any country - especially for us, because we live it in a completely different way.”

He went on to say of piecing together plans for another shot at football's ultimate prize: “The truth is we've been talking about it. He [Scaloni] understands, and we've discussed it a lot. He always tells me that he would like me to be there in any role. We have a relationship of great trust and we can talk about everything.”

While Messi is expected to form part of Argentina's World Cup squad, he is likely to miss a showdown with Spain - who have 18-year-old sensation Yamal at their disposal - which has been pencilled in for late March 2026.

Asked if he will play in Finalissima, Messi - who captured that trophy back in 2021 when beating Italy at Wembley - said: “No, to be honest, no. It's not even confirmed if it will be played. They don't even know if it will happen. But being honest, having a pre-season in the middle changes everything for me.

“It's like starting a new season from scratch, and having a pre-season in the middle will help me a lot because European players arrive to finals with a ton of matches in their legs, like always. Except for Qatar, which was midseason, and many felt better because they had less load. I think the same will happen to me.”

Whether Messi figures or not, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner concedes that Argentina will find it difficult to go back-to-back in the World Cup-winning stakes. He said of that challenge: “I think we have a great group and we're going to try again. After that, small details can leave you out.

“Any national team can complicate things, you hit the post and you're out, or you lose on penalties. Even though we won on penalties, we were superior in the game against the Netherlands and against France, and still ended up going to penalties. We had the beast, [goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez] 'Dibu', who helped us win, but you can also go to penalties and lose.

“It's very difficult to win a World Cup. It's something that is lived differently: as a spectator, as a player, and as a fan. Now, seeing the group, I'm sure they will fight. Winning took a huge weight off our shoulders. Playing without that pressure is a relief, but at the same time it doesn't guarantee anything, because everyone wants to beat the world champion. There are very good national teams -- Spain, France again, England, Brazil, who haven't been champions for a while and want to win again, and also Germany.”

Argentina will discover their 2026 World Cup group stage opponents when that draw takes place on Friday. Messi will be an interested observer there, as he readies himself for an MLS Cup final showdown with Vancouver on Saturday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Despite being dropped by the senior Red Bull team earlier this season, Liam Lawson has done enough to stay with Racing Bulls in 2026.

Liam Lawson admits that securing his seat on the 2026 Formula 1 grid is ""probably more relief than anything right now"" ahead of the final race of the season in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The 23-year-old Kiwi will again compete with Racing Bulls next season, where he will be joined by F1 rookie Arvid Lindblad, with Isack Hadjar taking Yuki Tsunoda's spot at Red Bull alongside Max Verstappen.

""It's probably more relief than anything right now. It's also nice going into this weekend knowing, I can't really remember the last time I had that,"" said Lawson on media day ahead of the final race of the season.

""I'll try and enjoy the weekend a little bit but I think it's very positive and exciting to go into next year and spend the off-season with a proper plan.""

Lawson confirmed he found out his future ""just after the race in Qatar"", with Racing Bulls Team Principal Alan Permane the one to break the good news to his driver.

Lawson has endured a mixed 2025 campaign, one which began with two races in the senior Red Bull squad before being demoted back to Racing Bulls after struggling for performance.

Over the 21 Grands Prix since, Lawson has finished in the points seven times with a best result of P5 in Baku, all of which has helped Racing Bulls to sixth in the Constructors' Championship.

When asked if he thought his Red Bull demotion happened for a good reason, with Tsunoda now left without a race seat in 2026, Lawson replied: ""I definitely think about that phrase a lot and I always try and tell myself that sometimes, in normally the bad moments.

""I think at the start of the year obviously I was having a lot of those thoughts with what was going on but at the same time it's hard to say that now because I think to be in this sport we all believe in ourselves. You couldn't be here if you thought that somebody was better than you.

""I would have liked to have thought that with the right amount of time I would have got my head around it, honestly. I don't even remember them [two races with Red Bull] they were so short.

""I do think there are a lot of things that happened this year that have made me a lot stronger and I've learnt a lot from.""

DuBois follows his co-anchor John Dickerson, who will leave CBS at the end of the year.

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


CBS Evening News co-anchor Maurice DuBois will exit CBS News later this month, as newly-minted CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss and CBS News president Tom Cibrowski plot an overhaul of the evening newscast.


	DuBois announced the move on his Instagram, writing that his last day at the anchor chair will be Dec. 18. DuBois has been with CBS for more than two decades, mostly as an anchor at its flagship New York station WCBS.




	“It has been the Honor of a Lifetime. 21 years altogether, including my time at WCBS-TV in New York City,” DuBois wrote. “What a privilege! To be welcomed into your homes night after night, delivering the news / meeting extraordinary people and telling their stories. I'll leave filled with gratitude, cherished relationships and amazing memories. A couple weeks to go; until then, see you on The CBS Evening News every night at 6:30.”

	DuBois' exit follows a similar move by his co-anchor John Dickerson, who announced his looming exit in October. Both joined the newscast earlier this year in an attempt to overhaul the newscast, which has been stuck in third place behind ABC World News and NBC Nightly News for years. 


	“Maurice has long represented what we do best at CBS News and Stations,” Cibrowski said in a statement. “For more than two decades, he has delivered the day's biggest stories from our studios in New York and in the field. Later this month, Maurice will leave the network. We are grateful for his significant contributions, at both CBS News New York and the CBS Evening News. Maurice is deeply valued and respected as a journalist ​by all of us and we wish him much success. It is my hope that we can work together again.  We will have more details on the next chapter of CBS Evening News in the near future.”

Scott Wolf's temporary restraining order against his estranged wife, Kelley Wolf, has been dropped. 

A Utah judge reportedly granted the “Party of Five” star's request to dismiss the temporary protective order against his wife following a hearing on Wednesday.

As part of the ruling, the case has been dismissed and any protective orders previously issued will now be considered void, according to People.

Scott's rep as well as his attorney didn't immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

Scott recently included Kelley in a birthday tribute to their son Miller, 13, despite their messy divorce battle. 

The actor, 57, shared pictures of their youngest son over the years on Instagram, including one of Kelley hugging him from behind.

“A TEENAGER now. Fastening our chin straps for this one,” he wrote in part.

In October, he also publicly wished Kelley a happy 49th birthday on Instagram.

The positive updates came after Kelley entered a treatment center for her mental health in September, then was transferred to another rehab and mental health facility on Oct. 14 to continue receiving treatment, People reported. It was her second time in a month after she checked into an Arizona rehab on Sept. 7, only to confirm to Page Six two days later that she had exited and was staying in a hotel.

After she left rehab for the first time, she claimed her weight dropped to 97 pounds and insisted she was “not crazy.”

“I am going to be very clear. I need to be respected and given peace. I am not crazy,” she said via her Instagram Stories.

She went on to claim, “I have no record. I do not abuse drugs or alcohol.”

The “Real World: New Orleans” star also told her followers, “I have lost everything. I am malnourished. Treated like a crazy woman.”

Scott filed for divorce from Kelley on June 9 after 21 years of marriage. Later that month, he filed a restraining order against Kelley, after she was placed in an involuntary psych hold.

Kelley was then arrested for harassment in August before being banned from contacting her estranged husband and their three kids: son Jackson, 16, Miller, and daughter Lucy, 11.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Like creator Kurt Sutter, you too should ditch The Abandons","https://www.avclub.com/the-abandons-review-netflix-tv","Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Netflix's The Abandons is misguided nonsense, a show that takes itself so relentlessly seriously that it verges on parody. It's remarkably easy to see the disastrous production issues that led to creator Kurt Sutter leaving the series. The drama thinks it's Deadwood but plays more like Westworld, with simplistic cosplay instead of genuine period detail and characters who are two dimensional if they have any personality at all. And it's telling that generally charismatic and accomplished performers like Gillian Anderson and Lena Headey get stuck in its mud.   

Sutter, the creator of Sons Of Anarchy and one of the formative voices for The Shield, brings his brand of macho tough talk to the Old West in this show set in the Washington Territory in 1854. The Abandons centers two families of very different backgrounds and social standing in its take on the Hatfields and McCoys. On one end of town is Constance Van Ness (Anderson), the matriarch of the most admired clan in the area, a power player whose empire continues to expand across the region until it runs into Fiona Nolan (Headey), who refuses to give into Constance's ploy for her land. Fiona has her own makeshift family of “abandons,” adopted children who are loyal to her until the end, which may come sooner rather than later. 

Of course, Constance and Fiona have their allies, mostly of their own kin. The prince in Constance's empire is Garret (Lucas Till), but her daughter Trisha (Aisling Franciosi) refuses to play a background role, carving her own identity in this dark corner of the country. From his introduction, it's clear that eldest son Willem (Toby Hemingway) is going to be a problem as he's sketched as the kind of toxic power figure who takes what he wants, when he wants it, until he runs into somebody unwilling to give up something.

Countering the Van Ness family are the outcasts of Nolan's clan, which include kindhearted Elias (Nick Robinson), undervalued Albert (Lamar Johnson), loyal Lilla Belle (Natalia del Riego), and faithful daughter Dahlia (Diana Silvers). When Willem rapes Dahlia, the Nolans take action, which leads to a missing Van Ness, an investigation, and a cover-up. As Constance searches the region for her MIA son, a shockingly small number of subplots play out over seven short episodes. (Some are closer to a half hour than a full.) There's a constant sense that The Abandons is a sketch of an idea, with characters and a setting in search of a story. And the Nolan vs. Van Ness battle is the foundation on which too little is ultimately built.

The one subplot that gets a bit of traction is the inevitable Romeo and Juliet arc for Elias and Trisha. Robinson is charming enough, but it's Franciosi who gives by far the top performance from the main cast, finding heartbreaking truth in what is clearly a doomed romance. To be fair, Sutter & co. surround their ensemble with some welcome character actors, including Brian F. O'Byrne, Marc Menchaca, Michael Greyeyes, Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers, Michiel Huisman, and, best of all, Ryan Hurst, whose fate on Sons Of Anarchy remains a core memory for fans of that show. It's a drama that's so boring that just seeing people like Hurst, Menchaca, Greyeyes, and even a surprising Patton Oswalt makes for a welcome escape from the tedium. 

﻿

What's most stunning about The Abandons is how much its talented leads can't figure out their characters, which is likely because of the tumultuous production that saw Sutter leave the show with an episode left to film. This led to reshoots and a complete restructuring of the premiere, which was originally 100 minutes long. A show that was announced as 10 episodes shrank down to seven, and while productions can often overcome this kind of thing, you can see these woes in so much of this final product. Characters are inconsistent, the storytelling is choppy, and the performances are shallow. 

When even Anderson can't find anything to play other than an angry whisper, you know she just wasn't getting what she needed to find this character. Sutter has written strong female characters before—Katey Sagal, who also appears here briefly and is Sutter's wife, was great on Sons—but he can't find the root of Constance Van Ness. Almost no one in this show has a believable backstory. It doesn't help that The Abandons has the nerve to end on what is basically a cliffhanger, exploding in violence before refusing to reveal the impact of those choices. Viewers could have been patient with a show this lethargic if it paid off, but this Western just cuts to black in a way that will likely leave them more furious than excited about a follow-up. 

It almost feels like someone at Netflix looked at the trucks of money being brought in by the Taylor Sheridan universe and thought that the man behind an FX hit about a loyal clan would be the perfect fit to find a little of that Yellowstone spirit. This certainly makes sense on paper. But The Abandons, unfortunately, didn't find a creative spark beyond its commercial origins.

Tara Reid reiterated her claims that she was allegedly drugged at a Chicago hotel despite police investigators finding no video evidence that the actress' drink was tampered with.


	In late November, Reid came forward with allegations that, after meeting a “very successful influencer and YouTuber,” her unfinished drink at the hotel bar was drugged when she went outside to have a cigarette. Reid said she was later hospitalized for eight hours with no memory of what happened after consuming the drink.


	“The last thing I remember was drinking that drink and seeing a couple sitting next to us,” the actress said. “The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital around 8 hours or more later not knowing where I was or anything that happened. I completely blacked out with no recollection of anything.”


	The Rosemont Police Department confirmed that they opened an investigation into the incident, the findings of which were announced earlier this week. “While video surveillance showed Tara Reid at the hotel bar, at no time did video show anyone tampering with or adding something to her drink,” police said.

	











	While the investigation continues without video evidence, Reid reasserted her claims in a statement to People following the police report. “Bottom line is no one ends up in the hospital incapacitated for over 8 hours after a drink,” the actress said. “I believe I was drugged. Something happened to me.”


	Reid also said that waking up in the hospital with no memory of how she got there was the “scariest feeling I have ever felt,” and that the “horrifying” incident is “severely affecting” her “mental health.”  “I cannot sleep over this it's a very scary feeling not knowing what happened to me,” Reid told People.

	Reid's initial account claimed that, while she was outside smoking, a napkin was placed over her unattended drink, which she found suspicious. However, police said the napkin was placed there by a bartender.  “We can confirm that a bartender covered her drink when she left the bar which is standard practice for bartenders to do,” police said.


	The investigation continues pending chemical results from Reid's hospitalization. “At this time there is no criminal act that has been committed and there is no one we are currently investigating,” police added. “While we do not have any evidence that a drink was tampered with, it is a good reminder to never leave a drink unattended.”

Jenni Rivera's youngest son, Johnny López, always wanted to revive La Gran Señora with a full banda reimagining. But when Rolling Stone named the 2009 album one of the Best Albums of the 21st Century earlier this year, he knew it was time to give it to the people.


	Tonight, Rivera's estate will release the 2025 banda edition of La Gran Señora, featuring hits like “Ya Lo Sé” and “No Llega El Olvido” — this time backed by full banda arrangements on every track, just as she performed them live. The release arrives ahead of the 13th anniversary of Rivera's tragic death on Dec. 9, 2012, in a plane accident.


	“Over the last two years of her life, she performed many of the songs from that album live with a banda, but she never had the chance to record them in the studio,” López tells Rolling Stone. “They carried a different impact and allowed her to sing them in the style she felt most comfortable with. Now, 16 years later, we have her full Banda version of the album for listeners to enjoy and experience.”

	











	López served as the creative director for the album, aiming to honor the essence of his mom's original recordings while incorporating new production and instrumentation that felt more aligned with her style of performing them.

	“I want to make it clear we never have the intention of ever releasing anything musically using AI,” López wrote on X ahead of the album's release. “Any Jenni recordings that are released by us will always be 100% authentic.”

	











	He tapped Luciano Luna as a producer for the project and even added small tidbits — like her iconic phrases “¿Y me estás oyendo, vieja pioja?” on “La Gran Señora” — that weren't on the original recording. López also added “Yo Soy Una Mujer,” featuring previously unreleased audio recorded by Rivera back in 2008. The album also includes Rivera's Spanglish cover of Latino country star Freddy Fender's “Before the Next Teardrop Falls,” mixing both banda with the country essence of the original song with the sound of steel guitar.

As a music fan I'm so l excited for the fact that this album will have physicals 😍Pre-Order goes live this Friday! pic.twitter.com/bCTkkzrzIp


	“Many thanks to my brother Johnny López, who believed in this project from the very beginning,” says Jacqie Rivera, who heads Jenni's estate. “He is, without a doubt, her number one fan, and his dedication has been invaluable every step of the way.”

	López says he approached the album in the same way Rivera did her last album, Joyas Prestadas, which she released as both a “pop” and “banda” version. The album also follows 2023's Misión Cumplida, which included Rivera's unreleased covers and a collaboration with her daughters Chiquis and Jacque on “Pedacito de Mi,” one of her unfinished recordings.


	“My biggest dream for it is that it causes another Banda wave. It has that potential,” López told Rolling Stone at the time, with Chiquis adding: “The banda queen is back, baby!”

	If you're not headlining the Super Bowl (and you don't want to even think about going up against Bad Bunny), you should plan a big concert a little bit before the Super Bowl. Post Malone will do just that with a Bud Light–sponsored gig billed to Post Malone & Buddies on Feb. 6, two days before the big game, at Fort Mason in San Francisco, according to Billboard, which did not confirm the identities of Post's buddies. The Super Bowl (and Bad Bunny's halftime show) will take place on Feb. 8 about an hour away from Posty's show, so fans could ostensibly hit up both.


	The more exciting news for everyone who can't afford such extravagances is that Malone is promising new music by then. The artist told a Billboard reporter that he would “a hundred percent” play new tunes at the show. “We've been working very, very diligently on new music,” he said. “And we have 45 songs. It's just a matter of finishing said songs. And the schedule has been so very busy. So we're working and working, but there will be new music by then… Allegedly.”

	











	Then he prevaricated in a way Oasis' Gallagher bothers would appreciate: “Allegedly a hundred percent maybe, definitely,” he said.

	Last year, the artist sang “America the Beautiful” before the Super Bowl in Las Vegas. This year, around the Super Bowl in New Orleans, he headlined YouTube's Tailgate Concert and a Bud Light Backyard concert. Post Malone mostly recently performed at the halftime show of a Cowboys-Chiefs game on Thanksgiving.

	











	In an admission that would surprise nobody, Post Malone also told Billboard that given the chance of headlining the Super Bowl halftime show, y'know, the really big concert, the one Bad Bunny is doing this year, he “would love to.”

Lovers of romantasy rejoice! All six seasons of MTV's Teen Wolf are now streaming on Netflix. The supernatural dramedy about a teen boy who gets bitten by a werewolf and must learn to control his new powers while also navigating the perils of high school dominated Tumblr in the 2010s. Created by Jeff Davis (Criminal Minds), the series launched the careers of Dylan O'Brien (The Maze Runner), Tyler Hoechlin (Supergirl), and Arden Cho (KPop Demon Hunters). Keep reading to refresh your memory of the hairiest show of the decade before jumping into your rewatch.

Solve word, logic, and visual puzzles based on Stranger Things

Stream the entire series now.

There are six seasons of Teen Wolf. Seasons 1, 2, and 4 are 12 episodes each, while seasons 3, 5, and 6 are 20 episodes each. The 20-episode seasons were divided into two halves, which often aired months apart and had separate, distinct story arcs.

It's Scott. Scott McCall is the titular teen wolf. 

In the idyllic town of Beacon Hills, California, nothing interesting ever happens — until half a body is found in the woods. Scott McCall (Posey), a normal teenage boy who just wants to make first string on the lacrosse team, and Stiles (O'Brien), his goofy best friend, can't pass up the opportunity to investigate Beacon Hills's greatest mystery. As the two wander the woods looking for the crime scene, they're separated, and Scott ends up in a precarious situation — at the bottom of a steep ravine without his inhaler. Before he can figure out how to save himself, a large wolf comes out of nowhere and bites him. Scott makes it out of the woods alive but with a massive wound in his side.

The next day, Scott's worried about how his injury will affect lacrosse tryouts, but then strange things start happening to his senses: He can hear a phone conversation on the other side of the building, he can smell a forgotten piece of gum in Stiles's jacket, and he can even see better. By the time tryouts roll around, Scott surprises everyone — including Stiles — with his amazing speed and reflexes. His impressive performance even catches the eye of the new girl, Allison Argent (Reed). When she invites Scott out on a date, it seems that Scott's life is finally coming together. The only problem? The party is on the night of a full moon. When Scott experiences unexpected bloodlust after dancing with Allison, he drives off to go through his first transformation alone, only to be lured into the woods by Derek Hale (Hoechlin), a local loner whose family died in a fire about 10 years ago. Derek, also a werewolf, senses Scott about to turn and reluctantly volunteers to be his mentor. 

Scott resists Derek's offer, convinced Derek is responsible for turning him, but eventually accepts Derek's help so he can resume his normal high school life. In return, there's only one thing Derek wants from Scott: to help him find the people responsible for killing his family — his pack — in that fire a decade ago. 

The color of each werewolf's eyes denotes their place in the hierarchy. Red eyes mean that a werewolf is an Alpha, yellow eyes signify a Beta, and blue eyes denote a werewolf who's marked by guilt after taking an innocent life.

In Teen Wolf, danger comes from all sides. Over the course of the series, Scott and his friends fend off both human and supernatural threats, which only seem to grow stronger over time. Here are the series' major villains:

Crystal Reed (Allison) left the series after Season 3 to pursue other acting opportunities, so no, Scott and Allison are not endgame. She's referred to as Scott's first love throughout the series, though he does eventually fall in love again with Kira (Cho), a kitsune who moves to Beacon Hills later in the series. 

Yes, Scott's lovable best friend is the only fully human member of the Beacon Hills pack — even after he's possessed by the Nogitsune. When the series ends, he does the most normal thing in the world: go to college.

Tyler Hoechlin (Derek) also took a break from the show to pursue other acting opportunities after Season 4, but he returns in Season 6 as a recurring guest star. Derek faces several near-death experiences in the first four seasons, but he survives and leaves Scott in charge of the Beacon Hills pack. Derek's story is continued in 2023's Teen Wolf: The Movie.

Teen Wolf is inspired by the film of the same name starring Michael J. Fox, but the MTV show and the 1985 movie do not share any kind of continuity. In both, the main character is a teen werewolf named Scott, and he has a human best friend named Stiles, but that's it. The series contains a vast wealth of lore and world-building, as well as an emphasis on horror that goes beyond the scope of the original film, which is strictly a comedy.

Yes, after the series ended in 2017, Jeff Davis made Teen Wolf: The Movie, which continued the Hale family storyline and brought back fan favorites like Allison Argent. Teen Wolf: The Movie premiered in 2023.

Teen Wolf is set in the fictional city of Beacon Hills, California.

An animal bite turns a high schooler into a werewolf whose newfound supernatural abilities make him a star athlete – and majorly complicate his life.","{'href': 'https://www.netflix.com', 'title': 'Netflix'}","other"

            Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands announced their withdrawals Thursday from next year's Eurovision Song Contest after organizers decided that Israel will be allowed to compete.
    


            Organizers of the pop music spectacle, which draws millions of viewers globally, met earlier Thursday to discuss Israel's participation, amid calls for the country to be excluded over the war in Gaza and threats from some members to boycott.
    


            Members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the primary organizer of the event, decided not to hold a vote on Israel's participation but said that “targeted changes” should be introduced to improve neutrality.
    


            Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was “pleased” with the EBU's decision and thanked all those who “stood up for Israel's right to continue to contribute and compete at Eurovision.” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was “ashamed” of the countries boycotting the contest.
    


            The Eurovision meeting was held at the Geneva headquarters of the EBU, a group of public broadcasters from 56 countries, to consider new rules unveiled last month to limit governments and third parties from disproportionately influencing voting.
    


            In the talks, EBU members “backed a set of targeted changes to the Eurovision Song Contest rules designed to reinforce trust, transparency and the neutrality of the event,” a statement from the union said.
    


            “This vote means that all EBU Members who wish to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,” it added.
    


From diplomacy to soccer, Israel is becoming a pariah on the global stage



            Several nations have expressed concerns over Israel's participation in the competition due to its war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023, cross-border attack into southern Israel. The conflict has killed more than 70,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health.
    


            Israel's public broadcaster KAN is reported to have continued with its preparations for the 2026 competition and was expected to present its position on possible disqualification at Thursday's meeting, Reuters reported.
    


            If members had not agreed on the new safeguarding changes, a vote on Israel's participation could have been held, the EBU said. If a vote had been held, an absolute majority would have been required for an exclusion to pass.
    


            “A large majority of Members agreed that there was no need for a further vote on participation and that the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 should proceed as planned, with the additional safeguards in place,” the EBU statement said.
    


            Last month, competition director Martin Green said the “neutrality and integrity of the Eurovision Song Contest is of paramount importance to the EBU, its members and all our audiences. It is essential that the fairness of the contest is always protected.”
    


            He added that they were taking “clear and decisive steps to ensure the contest remains a celebration of music and unity.”
    


            The move to allow Israel to remain in the competition prompted some countries to announce boycotts, with Spanish public broadcaster RTVE announcing Spain's “withdrawal” from the contest following the EBU decision. Spain is one of the so-called Big Five who make the largest financial contributions to the contest.
    


            Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ confirmed in a statement that it “will not participate in or broadcast” the contest. Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said its decision not to participate followed “a careful process in which information was gathered from a wide range of stakeholders.”
    


            “Avrotros concludes that participation under the current circumstances is incompatible with the public values that are essential to us,” it said.
    


            The Eurovision Song Contest, which started in 1956, is a famously eccentric festival in which artists from dozens of countries battle for the annual musical crown. Last year's contest was watched by 166 million people, 3 million more than the previous year, according to the EBU.
    


            It has sought to put music ahead of politics, but pro-Palestinian demonstrators have protested at the last two contests in Switzerland and Sweden.
    


            This is not the first time world events have become a divisive issue for the competition. The EBU banished Russia from participating following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            “Israel belongs in the Eurovision Song Contest,” German Minister of State for Culture Wolfram Weimer previously told Reuters. “There must be no ESC without Israel.”
    


The good, the bad and the raunchy: All 26 Eurovision songs, ranked from worst to first



            Arriving for talks Thursday, Nicolau Santos, president of Portuguese broadcaster RTP, told Reuters: “Yes, we will have a very, I suppose, interesting discussion (on Israel's participation). So, we have to wait for the end of the meeting.”
    


            “Eurovision is becoming a bit of a fractured event,” Paul Jordan, a Eurovision expert who goes by the moniker Dr. Eurovision, told the Associated Press. “The slogan is ‘United by Music,'” he added. “Unfortunately it's disunited through politics.”
    


            Last week, Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meini-Reisinger reiterated the contest's long-standing claim to be a space of political neutrality. Addressing the planned boycott of the 70th edition of the event in 2026 by a handful of nations, she insisted the contest was “not an instrument for sanctions” in a post on X and appealed to European partners to find ways to “improve the situation in Israel and Gaza” together.

Trump's Second Term:

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth exposed sensitive information when he sent details of a pending military strike from his personal phone, according to a Pentagon watchdog investigation into the “Signalgate” saga that gripped the White House earlier this year.

The Pentagon inspector general determined that Hegseth had the authority to declassify the information he'd sent — which was originally labeled “secret” — but that his use of a personal cell phone risked compromising sensitive information about the upcoming attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen, it said in a report released Thursday.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Serge Cannasse

 December 04, 2025  

Electronic cigarettes have gained attention as an aid to smoking cessation, and some experts consider them an option alongside established treatments. Guidance remains cautious, however, because these products are not advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women or minors.

With limited robust clinical evidence on nicotine e-cigarettes, the French-speaking Society for Smoking Cessation convened an internal expert panel to assess the available data and determine whether a consensus could be reached. The findings were published in Archives of Public Health.

The panel used a fast-track Delphi method to evaluate whether experts could reach an agreement on key statements about nicotine e-cigarettes. In two rounds, experts rated every statement on a 1-9 agreement scale, with higher scores indicating stronger agreement. After reviewing the aggregated feedback from the full expert panel, they could adjust their ratings, and each proposal was re-evaluated and rescored. Over a total period of 40 calendar days, consensus was defined as a median score of 7 or more on the 1-9 scale, with an interquartile range ≤ 3.

The 87 participating experts were drawn from varied clinical backgrounds; although not all were physicians, they had extensive hands-on experience in tobacco-dependence care.

The main proposals agreed upon regarding the role of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation are as follows.

No consensus has emerged for minors, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, or people in the preoperative or postoperative period. Experts advised pregnant or breastfeeding women who already vape to continue when the risk for relapse is high.

A strong agreement supports the need for national guidance that defines the role of e-cigarettes in cessation and specifies monitoring for adverse effects. Short-term effects, such as oral irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, are well described, whereas long-term effects remain uncertain because of limited follow-up.

Experts also agreed that future guidance should differentiate between e-cigarettes made by tobacco companies and those made by independent manufacturers.

The panel did not reach a consensus on where these products should be sold. Retail outlets offer wide access but little expert support, whereas pharmacies provide professional counseling but have limited availability.

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Ahead of an all-important title decider in Abu Dhabi, F1.com looks back at the championship contenders' seasons in numbers.

After a season filled with various twists and turns, the three-way battle for the 2025 Drivers' Championship will finally be decided at this weekend's finale in Abu Dhabi.

Lando Norris remains in the lead of the standings, but McLaren's decision to keep the Briton and his team mate Oscar Piastri out on track during an early Safety Car phase in the Qatar Grand Prix – making them the only cars to do so – ultimately backfired for both, allowing Max Verstappen to take victory and in the process overtake Piastri for P2 in the championship.

The gap between Norris and Verstappen now stands at only 12 points entering into the final race of this 24-round calendar, with Piastri also only 16 points adrift of the leader – but who will leave the Yas Marina Circuit with the highest tally and thus the title?

Ahead of a decisive weekend ahead, we've been taking a look at how each of the championship contenders' seasons compare in terms of those all-important numbers…

Norris – 7
Verstappen – 7
Piastri – 7

Incredibly, all three drivers have achieved the same number of Grand Prix victories during the campaign, with Norris, Verstappen and Piastri each standing on the top step of the podium on seven occasions. Mercedes' George Russell is the only other driver to triumph, having done so on two occasions.

The spread of those wins for the title contenders, however, looks somewhat different. After kicking off the campaign with P1 in the Australian Grand Prix, Norris' next victory did not arrive until Round 8 in Monaco, before the Briton got into his stride as the season progressed by sealing a further five victories.

Piastri, meanwhile, collected the majority of his successes earlier in the year, and he remains the only driver to score a hat-trick (achieved across Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Miami). His most recent first place in a Grand Prix came at Round 15 in the Netherlands.

Verstappen is perhaps the most fascinating example here, however. The Dutchman snatched two wins in the first half of the campaign (at Suzuka and Imola respectively), but a dip in performance for the team resulted in him slipping backwards in the fight at the front.

But a resurgent second half of the season saw the four-time World Champion embark on a stunning run, claiming five wins since his triumph at Round 16 in Italy. Now just one more all-important victory is up for grabs – but who will seal what could be a title-deciding win?

Norris – 7
Verstappen – 7
Piastri – 6

Once again, the championship hopefuls are practically on equal terms here, with Norris and Verstappen each claiming seven pole positions in 2025 while Piastri is only one down with a total of six. The other drivers to start from the front slot of the grid have been Russell (twice) and Charles Leclerc (once).

In terms of the success rate from these poles, Norris has converted five into a victory, while Verstappen and Piastri have each done so on four occasions.

As is the case with wins, most of Piastri's pole positions were achieved in the first half of the campaign – with the exception of Qatar. For Norris and Verstappen, the P1 slots have been more evenly spread through the season.

Norris – 17
Verstappen – 14
Piastri – 15

Championship leader Norris has the most rostrums under his belt, having taken to the podium 17 times. Two of the occasions where he did not finish within the top three were due to retirements, while his P2 in Las Vegas was nullified when both McLaren cars were disqualified for a technical infringement.

Piastri has so far scored a total of 15 podiums through the season. Across the first 16 rounds, the Australian notably crossed the line with a top-three result at 14 of these races. However, a trickier run recently saw him finish off the rostrum at six weekends in a row before making his return with his second place in Qatar.

Verstappen's tally is only one behind, the Red Bull driver having achieved 14 trips to the podium in 2025 – half of which have been victories. Since the campaign resumed in Zandvoort following its summer break, Verstappen has not finished outside of the top-three, with his current run standing at nine rostrums in a row.

Norris – 2
Verstappen – 2
Piastri – 1

When it comes to the six Sprint events held in 2025, Norris, Verstappen and Piastri are responsible for all but one triumph – the exception being Lewis Hamilton's win for Ferrari at the season's first 100km dash in China.

Norris triumphed in Miami and Sao Paulo, while Verstappen took the spoils at Spa-Francorchamps and the Circuit of The Americas – the latter proving a nightmare outing for McLaren, with both cars eliminated in a Lap 1 melee.

Piastri, meanwhile, had to wait until Qatar for his Sprint success, the Australian converting pole into a win as he previously did in the same event back in 2023.

As these numbers have alluded to, the Drivers' Championship standings have changed quite dramatically throughout the season. Norris initially held the lead until Round 5 in Saudi Arabia, where Piastri took over; at this early stage of the season, the Australian led by 10 points from Norris and 12 from Verstappen.

Norris' retirement in Canada – after colliding with Piastri – saw the gap between the team mates open up to 22 points, with Verstappen 43 points adrift of Piastri. And after Round 15 in Zandvoort – in which Norris retired due to a mechanical issue and Piastri scored his most recent Grand Prix win to date – the latter was 34 points ahead of Norris and a whopping 104 points clear of Verstappen.

But a tough run for Piastri – coupled with an impressive resurgence for Verstappen – saw the margins close. Victory for Norris at Round 20 in Mexico saw the British racer retake the championship lead from Piastri, with Verstappen then only 36 points behind the leader.

A double disqualification for McLaren in Las Vegas then put Verstappen on equal points with Piastri, meaning both were 24 points away from Norris – and the papaya squad's backfired strategy in Qatar resulted in Verstappen leapfrogging Piastri to now sit just 12 points adrift of Norris. Piastri, meanwhile, remains in contention 16 points behind his team mate.

The points deficits might have ebbed and flowed throughout the campaign, but the numbers that matter the most are those that will play out when the chequered flag falls in Abu Dhabi…

2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026

Ahead of the all-important title decider in Abu Dhabi, we asked our writers to share their predictions on what might unfold at the Yas Marina Circuit.

Anticipation is building ahead of the 2025 season finale in Abu Dhabi, where the Drivers' Champion will be crowned following a thrilling 24-race campaign. But will it be Lando Norris, Max Verstappen or Oscar Piastri who leaves the Yas Marina Circuit with the title? Our writers – Lawrence Barretto, Chris Medland, David Tremayne, James Hinchcliffe and Alex Jacques – have shared their predictions for what might unfold at this weekend's championship decider…

Lawrence Barretto (F1 Correspondent & Presenter): For the first time in 15 years, the championship is going to the wire with three still in contention, and in my view it is exactly what this year's sensational Formula 1 campaign deserves.

I'm sure reigning World Champion Max Verstappen will make it interesting – and he's my pick for the race win. But I think Lando Norris, who dominated last year's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, is still the favourite for the title as he's the only one in control of his own destiny, given he leads by 12 points.

And while he's had a difficult two races leading up to this weekend, I think he'll find a way to get over the line for a maiden title.

Whatever happens for Verstappen, this has been his best season ever in my eyes. He should have been out of the fight ages ago (he was 104 points behind after Zandvoort) after Red Bull's mid-season slump, but he's found a way to hang in there.

Oscar Piastri is the outsider, which is remarkable given he led by 34 points after the Dutch Grand Prix. His bounce back to form in Qatar means he definitely can't be counted out – but I feel like he's got just a bit too much to do to snatch the lead back when it counts.

Chris Medland (Special Contributor): I'm still not quite sure how we've ended up here, with a three-way fight at the final round. It looked like an all-McLaren championship battle was possible until the end of the season, but what Max Verstappen and Red Bull have managed to achieve is pretty remarkable.

Still, for all of the focus on McLaren's errors in Qatar, or the disqualification in Las Vegas, the main factor I'm taking away from both races is that the car is still extremely quick, and this championship would actually be over right now but for the skid block issues 10 days ago.

The way Verstappen and Red Bull have closed in will really put the pressure on McLaren this weekend – and, if given even half a chance to snatch the championship, you know Verstappen will take it – but McLaren don't need to do anything special with their car to give Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri everything they need to win the title.

Last year there was a different type of pressure relating to the Teams' Championship, but Norris was faultless all weekend and given a top-three finish is all that he needs, I can see a repeat where Norris puts his car on pole and gets the job done.

David Tremayne (Hall of Fame F1 Journalist): After McLaren's strategic snafu in Qatar, F1 gets – for the first time since 2010 – a three-horse showdown in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.

Even though Lando Norris' 24-point pre-Qatar lead has been slashed to just 12 over Max Verstappen, with Oscar Piastri another four further back, the odds still favour the Englishman. He will become World Champion, cut and dried, if he finishes third, regardless of where either Max or Oscar finish.

Fourth or fifth would also do – which might be handy if Mercedes are strong – but only if somebody other than Max wins. Ditto sixth or seventh, provided neither Max nor Oscar wins. In extremis, he could still pulI it off with eighth, provided Max doesn't finish in the top two or Oscar doesn't win.

In other words, he could stroke it if necessary, but trying to do that often backfires and I'd expect him to be as sharp and hungry as he possibly can be and to fight for the win.

No matter how nonchalant the reigning champion is – and that's genuine – you'd better believe he wants to be the first man since Michael Schumacher to win five titles in row… And on Qatar form he'll be a huge threat to McLaren's aspirations. Equally, Oscar feels he is owed a victory after last weekend left him “speechless” just after he'd rediscovered his mojo.

Back in 2010 Ferrari focussed totally on Mark Webber in the race in Abu Dhabi, but as Red Bull refused to favour the Australian via team orders, Sebastian Vettel in the other Red Bull snuck through to beat his team mate and Fernando Alonso.

That marked only the third time in history that the eventual champion was the man who only led the points table after the final round (the others being John Surtees in 1964 and James Hunt in 1976). Might Max match that little bit of history too?

Like the baddie in a pantomime, fans are looking at him and yelling the warning to Lando: “He's behind you!” But unlike Ferrari 15 years ago, McLaren are only too aware of the threat the third man poses. How they deal with that, while trying to balance their 'papaya rules' without tripping over themselves in that well-meaning but risky process, may ultimately determine who walks away wearing the 2025 crown.

James Hinchcliffe (IndyCar Race Winner and Analyst):  I don't think anyone, at any point of the season, would've realistically thought we would have a genuine three-way title fight coming into the final round.

I also don't think anyone saw a scenario where Mclaren – a team that locked up the Teams' title with six races to go – would not be 1-2 in the Drivers' battle coming into Abu Dhabi. Yet here we are. On the brink of one of the greatest comebacks – or most phenomenal fumbles – in sporting history.

All three drivers have been superb this year and each have a strong case for being a deserving champion in 2025. You can go back and point out races for each where points were lost or gained, but all that is irrelevant now. Now, it all comes down to this one race.

That said, when you look at the numbers and play out the scenarios, my prediction is a Lando Norris title. He only needs a podium to secure the title and he has only been outside the top three at the flag twice in the last eight Grands Prix, with one of those being the Baku horror show.

Throw in the fact that Yas Marina is a lower grip track than Qatar and recent trends show the lower the grip, the bigger the advantage he has over Oscar Piastri in the sister car. I still think Max Verstappen can, and likely will, win the race, but Lando has enough in the pocket to bring home the title.

Alex Jacques (F1 TV Commentator): I'm delighted we're getting a three-way title fight for the first time in 15 years, and history tells us the last two times this has happened, the driver in third in the standings at the start has claimed the title by the end of the day. It was Kimi Raikkonen in 2007 and Sebastian Vettel in 2010.

That's about the most hopeful line I can write for Oscar Piastri fans. In Formula 1's ultra reliable age, the Australian driver realistically needs contact between his other two title rivals to have a chance - not impossible, but unlikely given Lando Norris doesn't need to win.

I expect whoever takes pole to win the race and, given Max Verstappen seems to be feeling zero pressure, it's most likely to be him. Despite Verstappen's heroic comeback, I think he'll just fall short as I can't see Norris missing the podium, so my prediction is we'll be watching the first McLaren Drivers' title since 2008 on Sunday with Norris claiming his first championship.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Clue, a scripted adaptation of the classic murder mystery board game, has found a home. The hourlong project, from writer/executive producer Dana Fox (Wicked: For Good) and director/executive producer Nicholas Stoller (You're Cordially Invited), has landed at Peacock for development. 


	Sony Pictures Television and Hasbro Entertainment took Clue out in October. As Deadline reported at the time, to get prospective buyers in the spirit, the pitch material was sent to them in Clue‘s signature manila envelope and was accompanied by a copy of the board game. The project garnered interest from multiple platforms, ultimately going to Peacock.

	The deal makes sense for both sides. Clue is believed to be a murder mystery with comedic overtones in the vein of Rian Johnson's Knives Out franchise and his Peacock series Poker Face. While Clue was in the marketplace, it was revealed that Poker Face would not be returning to Peacock for a third season, so the game board adaptation could presumably become its successor, serving that audience on the NBCUniversal streamer. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Meanwhile, Peacock being a domestic-only platform allows Sony TV to retain and exploit international rights to the series, making this a financially beneficial proposition for the indie studio.


	Inspired by the beloved game, Clue brings a modern twist to the colorful cast of iconic characters. When a group of strangers are invited to an eccentric billionaire's murder mystery night to solve the famous questions — who, where and with what — they quickly discover that nothing is what it seems to be, and the stakes are even higher than life or death.

	











	Fox is writing and will serve as showrunner; Stoller is set to direct. The two executive produce alongside Hasbro Entertainment's Head of TV Gabriel Marano; Margy Love of Fox's company Foxy, Inc.; and Conor Welch of Stoller's banner Stoller Global Solutions.


	Stoller recently re-upped his Sony TV overall deal, extending his tenure at the studio to a decade. Fox recently entered into an overall deal with the studio and also is working on a U.S. adaptation of the Israeli romantic comedy series Save the Date under Sony TV's new pact with Keshet International.


	The scripted Clue adaptation, as well as an unscripted Clue series which was recently greenlighted by Netflix, both stem from the 2024 deal Sony signed with Hasbro for the film and TV rights to the murder mystery game.


	There are six characters in the classic edition of the game – Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, Miss Scarlett, Mrs. White, Mr. Green and Colonel Mustard — six weapons — candlestick, wrench, lead pipe, rope, dagger and revolver — and nine rooms — hall, study, ballroom, billiards room, dining room, kitchen, lounge, conservatory and library. The player's goal is to determine who committed the murder, with which weapon, and in which room.


	Since Clue was launched in 1949, the board game has sold more than 150M copies. It was adapted into the 1985 movie starring Tim Curry. An animated Clue series with Story as executive producer was in development at Fox several years ago; it didn't move forward.


	Fox is a co-writer executive producer on Wicked and Wicked: For Good. In TV, she executive produces Netflix's upcoming Little House On the Prairie reboot. Fox is repped by UTA and Myman Greenspan Fox. Love is repped by Myman Greenspan Fox.


	Stoller is co-creator, exec producer and co-showrunner on Sony TV's Apple TV+ series Platonic and recently co-developed and exec produced the studio's Hulu series Goosebumps. He has the film Judgment Day starring Will Ferrell coming up at Amazon MGM Studios. Stoller is repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham.
