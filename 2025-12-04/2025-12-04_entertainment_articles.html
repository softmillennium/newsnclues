                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The hourlong project, from writer/executive producer Dana Fox (Wicked: For Good) and director/executive producer Nicholas Stoller (You're Cordially Invited), has landed at Peacock for development. Sony Pictures Television and Hasbro Entertainment took Clue out in October. The project garnered interest from multiple platforms, ultimately going to Peacock. Peacock & Sky Confirm They Are Developing First Comedy Co-Production The deal makes sense for both sides. Clue is believed to be a murder mystery with comedic overtones in the vein of Rian Johnson's Knives Out franchise and his Peacock series Poker Face. While Clue was in the marketplace, it was revealed that Poker Face would not be returning to Peacock for a third season, so the game board adaptation could presumably become its successor, serving that audience on the NBCUniversal streamer. Meanwhile, Peacock being a domestic-only platform allows Sony TV to retain and exploit international rights to the series, making this a financially beneficial proposition for the indie studio. When a group of strangers are invited to an eccentric billionaire's murder mystery night to solve the famous questions — who, where and with what — they quickly discover that nothing is what it seems to be, and the stakes are even higher than life or death. Fox recently entered into an overall deal with the studio and also is working on a U.S. adaptation of the Israeli romantic comedy series Save the Date under Sony TV's new pact with Keshet International. There are six characters in the classic edition of the game – Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, Miss Scarlett, Mrs. White, Mr. Green and Colonel Mustard — six weapons — candlestick, wrench, lead pipe, rope, dagger and revolver — and nine rooms — hall, study, ballroom, billiards room, dining room, kitchen, lounge, conservatory and library. The player's goal is to determine who committed the murder, with which weapon, and in which room. Since Clue was launched in 1949, the board game has sold more than 150M copies. It was adapted into the 1985 movie starring Tim Curry. An animated Clue series with Story as executive producer was in development at Fox several years ago; it didn't move forward. In TV, she executive produces Netflix's upcoming Little House On the Prairie reboot. Love is repped by Myman Greenspan Fox. He has the film Judgment Day starring Will Ferrell coming up at Amazon MGM Studios. Stoller is repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Pictures & Walter Hamada‘s 18hz have preemptively acquired The Littles, a new horror short from American Horror Stories producer and bestselling author Andrew Duplessie, for feature development, with Duplessie set to expand his work as writer-director. Written, directed and produced by Duplessie, The Littles recently premiered to a sold-out audience at New York Comic Con, with star Violet McGraw in attendance. The short follows 11-year-old Juliet, who in stubbing her toe on a loose floorboard, unwittingly sets off a series of mysterious events. As she investigates, Juliet finds herself pulled into a chilling, otherworldly encounter — one that will unravel the secrets of her home and alter her reality forever. Integrating live-action with stop-motion animation from The Nightmare Before Christmas alum Anthony Scott, the short also stars Janel Parrish (Pretty Little Liars), and Dominic Sherwood (Shadowhunters). I've always loved the art of stop motion especially when it's combined with horror, and the response to this short has been truly inspiring. I can't wait to work with 18hz to expand this universe and show the rest of the world what lurks beneath their floorboards.” He began writing by posting stories on Instagram, building a large following and later writing the viral story “Mystery Dog,” which has amassed over 100 million views on YouTube. He is represented by Anonymous Content and attorney Miles Metcoff of Yorn, Levine, Barnes. Recently reupping its production pact with Paramount, Hamada's 18hz is next set to see the release of its Johannes Roberts horror film Primate on January 9. Formerly a DC Films chief and New Line Production EVP, Hamada first signed with the studio in November 2022. Recently producing New Line's It films and Matt Reeves' The Batman, his upcoming slate includes an untitled horror film from director André Øvredal, as well as the films Familiar and Suffer Little Children from Caye Casas and Rodrigue Huart, respectively.

Meanwhile, Combs pretended he was personally paying for the extravagant funeral, Kirk Burrowes said in Sean Combs: The Reckoning, which premiered Tuesday. “He was gonna make the funeral be a recoupable charge to Biggie in death,” Burrowes said. “Sean, doing a big show looks good on him. But he's not gonna tell the world that Biggie was gonna pay for it.” The Notorious B.I.G (real name Christopher Wallace), was shot to death in Los Angeles on March 9, 1997 — just six months after his West Coast friend turned rival Tupac Shakur was similarly gunned down in Las Vegas. (Wallace's murder remains unsolved, while known L.A. gang leader Duane “Keefe D” Davis is set to stand trial next year for his alleged role in Shakur's death. On March 18, 1997, thousands of fans packed the streets to pay their respects to the Brooklyn rapper, as a hearse with his coffin inside rolled through the borough.

'” A few months later, Burrowes was fired. And when it came to a Rolling Stone cover opportunity in 1997, Combs advocated for himself while Burrowes pushed for Wallace. “I was telling Sean, ‘Let's make it Biggie. You still have a chance [for a cover in the future],'” Burrowes previously told Rolling Stone. I need to be on the cover of Rolling Stone.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The following year, Lopez was spotted sporting an infinity tattoo on her ribcage with Affleck's name. The tattoo design features an infinity symbol with an arrow shooting through it — both Lopez and Affleck's names written along the infinity lines. Affleck also got a tattoo at that same time: two crossed arrows with both of their initials. The ink appeared to be completely gone, though later photos revealed it was just covered with makeup. Fast forward to May, however, and her backless dress at the AMAs suggested that J.Lo had begun the removal process. According to an anonymous commenter on Deuxmoi, Lopez chose to replace her existing design with a hummingbird “in place of his name.” The snarky replies ensued, saying, “This is why you don't get someone's name tattooed on your body,” and “Hell no to Bennifer 3.0.” In an Instagram post, Lopez shared a video from a performance this past summer; the tattoo, albeit faded, still exists. Could she be in the process of lasering it off? Fans will get a better idea once the “Dinero” singer begins her upcoming residency, “Jennifer Lopez: Up All Night Live in Las Vegas,” on Dec. 30, 2025, at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.</p>

Post Malone will do just that with a Bud Light–sponsored gig billed to Post Malone & Buddies on Feb. 6, two days before the big game, at Fort Mason in San Francisco, according to Billboard, which did not confirm the identities of Post's buddies. The Super Bowl (and Bad Bunny's halftime show) will take place on Feb. 8 about an hour away from Posty's show, so fans could ostensibly hit up both. The more exciting news for everyone who can't afford such extravagances is that Malone is promising new music by then. It's just a matter of finishing said songs. And the schedule has been so very busy.

There's a deep connection in the breathing we hear, a physical harmony these unseen singers share as they connect with their own bodies too. and what looks like female anatomy is actually supposed to depict Christ's wound with various tools of his torture and punishment placed around it. But the sexual connotations are entirely deliberate, of course; to believe in Jesus is to be promised a life reborn, yet the vulva is where life itself begins. With such a charged and curious start, it soon becomes clear that Urška Djukić's directorial debut isn't just another Catholic schoolgirl coming-of-age story. For one thing, it's softer than you might expect, more tender than shameful, although it can be unpredictable too, often driven by a wild and lustful energy. Before we meet Lucija (Jara Sofija Ostan), her whispers creep in first while the image of Christ's wound lingers, hushed and secret with a religious fervor. Saliva, a yawn, even the sound of hair being twirled crackles with intensity thanks to Julij Zornik's stark sound design. It's intense to the point of discomfort, which is about right if I recall even a fraction of what it feels like to experience puberty firsthand. Related Stories Who Better to Host IndieWire Honors Than Vinny Thomas, Patron Saint of Pigeons at Pride? ‘The Abandons' Review: Kurt Sutter's Dumped Netflix Western Is a Badly Distilled Family Drama That potential for turbulent change is hastened when Lucija and a fellow student named Ana-Maria (Mina Švajger) end up on a special choir trip together for a week in Northern Italy. The convent they stay in is gorgeous, complete with a thick olive tree Lucija can't stop gazing at in the courtyard. That is, until one of the semi-clothed workmen and his thick muscles catch her eye. The once-sheltered Lucija is suddenly thrust into a heady mix of intense choir rehearsals and barely suppressed longing, plus candid games of truth-or-dare and even spin-the-bottle after lights out, which stirs something else in her connection to Ana-Maria. Tensions simmer throughout their convent visit, thrumming just barely below the surface. And it's there in the tangle of hormones the choir girls must navigate once they're thrust in such close quarters together. To do so in such a strictly religious environment heightens every feeling, the churning mass of erotic charge that Djukić embodies in sanctified imagery throughout. Even when the film toys with cliche, as it does with multiple time-lapse montages of flowers in bloom, it's still in keeping with Lucija's viewpoint, to which Djukić becomes so perfectly attuned. Few films in recent memory have so perfectly captured a queer sexual awakening on the precipice of possibility, almost overwhelmed with the tantalizing prospects that this new adult world has to offer. From the singing to the silence that comes when Lucija's lost in thought and desire, Djukić expertly crafts a tangible atmosphere of yearning that aches with youthful restlessness. So too does Ostan who navigates Lucija's emerging libido with a wide-eyed innocence on the tipping point of something revelatory and even ethereal. Švajger is just as good playing her more popular friend Ana-Maria whose flirtatious posturing belies the truth of her age and experience. What could have been a standard mean girl role is anything but in Djukić's delicate, capable hands. Because “Little Trouble Girls” might be deliberately adolescent in its outlook, but the result speaks to a maturity rarely found in teen features of its ilk, as tight in its focus as it is dreamy in its longing for epiphanies of both a physical and spiritual nature. As such, Slovenian cinema has found a promising new voice in Djukić whose choirgirl debut prioritizes the force and power of young female voices all too often silenced by patriarchal institutions. Kino Lorber will release “Little Trouble Girls” in NYC on Friday, December 5. It will open in Los Angeles on Friday, December 12.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pop star and “American Idol” alum Lauren Spencer Smith is about to appear in a Hallmark Christmas movie — and it's one she inspired. On December 7, 2025, Hallmark Channel will premiere its original movie “Single on the 25th” starring network fan-favorites Daniel Lissing and Lyndsy Fonesca, with a cameo by Spencer Smith, whose 2022 song of the same name inspired the rom-com. “I was over the moon,” she said of learning her song had inspired a new movie and that she would be in it. I'm so excited because Christmas is my favorite holiday.” “Honestly, every Christmas, me and my friends watch Hallmark Christmas movies,” Spencer Smith beamed, “so I'm so excited that one that I will be a part of will be part of that tradition going forward.” Fonesca plays Nell, whose family cancels their holiday plans at the last minute, leaving her to try making the most of her week alone. But after an unexpected run-in with her neighbor Cooper, played by Lissing, the proud bachelor gives her some tips on enjoying single life during the holidays. During the shoot, Spencer Smith told Hallmark, “My experience on set so far has been amazing. You know, the lead actors just feel like family and friends. While her song “Single on the 25th” is a tear-jerker that “everyone can relate to,” Spencer Smith told Hallmark she loves that the movie dives deeper into the story and has a “happy ending.” Spencer Smith was eliminated after her first at-home performance, along with eight other contestants. By the summer of 2022, Spencer Smith had two massive hits with “Fingers Crossed” and “Flowers,” which has over 47 million views on YouTube. She eventually signed a record deal with Republic and Island Records, and a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music. Spencer Smith released her sophomore album, “The Art of Being a Mess,” in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Lopez's business attire probably wouldn't fly with your HR department. The singer chose a chocolate-brown power suit for The Hollywood Reporter's 2025 Women In Entertainment Gala on Wednesday, but it wasn't exactly one you could wear in the workplace. Designed by Harith Hashim, the look featured a blazer and pencil skirt that hit at mid-calf. While the skirt was tailored to an office-appropriate length, the blazer boasted a plunging neckline with a draped collar shawl, revealing J.Lo's cleavage. In keeping with the ‘80s suiting vibes, Lopez held a Tyler Ellis brown croc envelope clutch in one hand, layered Bulgari Tubogas chokers around her neck and tortoiseshell sunglasses over her eyes. Lopez is no stranger to a plunging neckline, having worn one of the most iconic deep V necks with her history-making 2000 Grammy Awards Versace gown. Back in October, the 56-year-old performer also chose a Hashim design. This tailored-with-a-twist look included a camel-toned pencil dress with wide fur cuffs. The singer is gearing up for a Las Vegas residency, beginning with her first concert on Dec. 30. On Tuesday, she shared a decidedly more daring look, throwing it back to a sequin flame bra and thong that she wore during her World Pride performance in Washington, DC, last summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent years, Chris Harrison has been living his own happily-ever-after down in Austin, Texas with his wife, former “Entertainment Tonight” host and producer Lauren Zima. That gig ended, though, after he sat down for an inteview with former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay. Now, she's opened up about the infamous interview during the Tuesday, December 3, episode of “Love It or Leave It Presents: Bravo, America!” podcast. For some background, “[i]n 2021, Lindsay interviewed longtime Bachelor and Bachelorette host Harrison, 54, while she worked as correspondent for Extra,” according to Us Weekly. Lindsay brought up the drama of contestant Rachael Kirkconnell's attendance at a southern antebellum party while she was in college. When the issue was brought up during Harrison's interview with Lindsay, he “slammed the criticism and defended Kirkconnell as a victim of cancel culture. … Harrison was subsequently let go from the show, which led to a falling out between him and Lindsay.” And Chris was there to promote, nobody even knows — some drink maybe. So it was a perfect storm,” Lindsay said of the interview. It was the PR of that drink company, so there's no one to stop him and say, ‘You're going the wrong way.' “He was just showing his true self, but I was sitting back, like, I know this to be you, the audience doesn't. I'm just shocked that you have the audacity to be saying this,” Lindsay recalled. I said, ‘Put the whole thing on YouTube, unedited,'” she continued. It's the first thing on my desk this morning. After the interview sparked a buzz, Lindsay says Harrison got in touch. He still didn't get it until somebody said something and apologized. During Lindsay's podcast interview, she was asked by host Jon Lovett if Harrison would end up losing his “Bachelor” gig if the incident happened today. I think he thought that for himself,” she said. “If it had not happened in February of 2021 that's when cancel culture was heightened.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

Since completing his breakout drama series “Sons of Anarchy” in 2014, Kurt Sutter has had a hard time finishing what he starts. Despite initially blaming Disney for “creative scrutiny” so over-the-top he “feared for the creative future of storytelling,” Sutter's first foray outside of FX hasn't gone any better. Netflix's “The Abandons,” a period Western about two rival families warring over land in the mid-1850s, didn't even finish production with its creator, writer, and showrunner still on board. Sutter left his own series with just three weeks left in production amid reports that his initial 100-minute pilot caused Netflix executives to question the show's direction.

And yet, context aside, “The Abandons” often feels like standard-fare streaming slop: Shallow arcs are stretched past their breaking points, clichés are deployed faster and more freely than bullets in a shootout, and the talented leads are mainly there to convince viewers what they're saying is worth taking seriously. (Or, even more cynically, to make things easy on Netflix's vaunted algorithm. “If you liked Gillian Anderson in ‘Sex Education'...” please don't watch “The Abandons.”) Anderson stars as Constance Van Ness, a wealthy widow whose lucrative mining operation drives the local economy. Ruthless and respectable, Constance is the face of early American capitalism: a woman so blinded by her wealth she'll order people killed in the morning and then spend her evening arguing the land she's after isn't about money; it's a matter of “survival.” This land is known as Jasper Hollow, an expansive ranch near Constance's mines that Fiona Nolan (Lena Headey) currently calls home. Now, she lives there with her grown, adopted children, Elias (Nick Robinson) and Dahlia Teller (Diana Silvers), Albert Mason (Lamar Johnson), and Lilla Belle (Natalia Del Riego). When the story begins, Constance has been harassing Fiona for more than a year. For instance, one morning Fiona wakes to discover her cattle is out of their pen and being steered by masked cowboys toward a cliff. Constance prioritizes her own family over anyone and anything else. She cares about the community only as far as it continues to support her economic “needs,” and her only way forward in life is via perpetual expansion. Fiona puts her family first, too, but to her — an Irish immigrant invited in by strangers — family is an inclusive status that's earned rather than inherited. Constance, for the most part, is a cartoon villain lent legitimacy by Anderson's commanding presence (although anyone with an ear for accents won't find her performance quite as convincing). So why are there contradictory scenes emphasizing her kindness and generosity, like when she finds the local kids a proper school teacher? They don't fit next to the many more scenes of her torturing and murdering people (including young women), and the rest of her arc doesn't justify an understanding of Constance any deeper than the black hat she often sports. Who's to say, but it's a sin of omission that strikes too often, rendering the ensemble flat and bizarre rather than sturdy and complex. Other perplexing abnormalities include an abrupt scene where Headey's antiheroine starts shouting at God so suddenly you nearly miss the blasphemy; Patton Oswalt popping up just long enough for you to think, “Hey, is that Patton Oswalt?” before he disappears sans explanation; then there are the sparsely populated battles, mixed metaphors, and inconsistent levels of violence. At one point, a horse and rider jump over a ravine, and the rider is pulled to safety, but the horse just… vanishes. You have to assume the poor steed fell to its death, but not a word is lent toward confirming as much, let alone a shot of the fallen stallion. You can almost hear the accountants arguing over which special effects shots they're willing to pay for. As the credits roll, it's easy to imagine an executive sighing and saying, “Welp, good enough.” Yet looking back now, with a few hours hindsight, the series doesn't feel all that unique. Sutter's show, if you can still call it that, is demonstrably worse than plenty of recent television, but it's not markedly inferior to a number of programs whose creative team sticks around from start to finish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, in “radical self-awareness” news: Tim Meadows damn well knew, going into the release of his 2000 Saturday Night Live-based comedy movie The Ladies Man, exactly how popular the character of smooth-talking lover Leon Phelps was—and wasn't. “I knew how popular the character was,” Meadows said in a recent podcast interview about his career. It wasn't even A Night at the Roxbury popular.” The movie is probably 90 percent what we wanted it to be.” It did make significantly more than some more serious SNL flops like Stuart Saves His Family and It's Pat, in the grand, depressing pantheon of Saturday Night Live movies, but there are a pretty huge number of things—streaming charity marathons, tiny island nations, especially industrious magpies—that have brought in more money than It's Pat.) In the interview, Meadows—who's currently starring in CBS's new sitcom DMV, and had a recent, very fun turn in Peacemaker—talks about hiding the Ladies Man voice for years from his SNL colleagues, having never really sought out the pressure of a recurring character despite ultimately serving for 10 years on the series. “I thought of it as something that if people found out about, I would get arrested,” Meadows joked about the voice and character of Leon Phelps. “So it was like a deep, secretive thing that I kept hidden.” Recommended1Medieval Europe was fascinated by this Christian king in Central Asia2Rob Mac and Noah Hawley are loading up a Far Cry TV show3What's on TV this week—Stranger Things' final season, Blossoms Shanghai4Keep Thanksgiving on track this year with these family-perfect multiplayer games5Carol asks the tough questions in a hilarious and heartbreaking Pluribus6Final fight(s): The 25 best beat-'em-up games7Spoiler Space: Was Wicked changed for good?8R.I.P. : Jmail has made reading the Epstein emails easier than ever</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karly Hartzman and MJ Lenderman get about halfway through his song “Wristwatch” when someone in the crowd at Third Man Records' Blue Room tries to sing along. “I got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome,” Lenderman sings, and a voice from the audience harmonizes loudly—well, loudly enough to be captured by 1955 Scully lathe—on those last two words. Lenderman released Manning Fireworks just two weeks before this show in September 2024, and a tidal wave of raves and profiles is still crashing around him, shining a spotlight on every aspect of his life, including his recent breakup with Hartzman. Lenderman's Himbo Dome boast is hardly a moment at all, but in this case merely a lyric delivered against an electric guitar strum—the definition of anticlimactic. These few seconds demonstrate the shortcomings of Live at Third Man Records, for which Hartzman and Lenderman strip their songs down to the bones. They pare away the defining traits of both Wednesday and the Wind—crunching guitars, weeping pedal steel, and pounding drums—but they neglect to add anything particularly compelling in their place. There are some moments that hit hard with a ragged kind of glory: when their guitars get tangled up on “She's Leaving You,” when their voices veer off in different directions on “TLC Cage Match,” when Hartzman puts some English on the word “fuckin'” in “Feast of Snakes.” But she and Lenderman run through it all at a slack dirge, with every song played at roughly the same tempo and most of them losing steam as they proceed. That is unexpected and wildly disappointing, considering that they are two of the most distinctive songwriters and bandleaders working today, colliding a range of left-of-center influences—Vic Chesnutt, Drive-By Truckers, John Prine—into songs that traffic in skewed imagery and complex ideas. Lenderman can be sly and evasive, favoring second-person pronouns that sound accusatory even after you realize he's usually talking to himself. Hartzman is much more traditionally confessional, almost always writing in first person as she traces complicated scenarios across multiple storylines (similar to the Truckers' Mike Cooley). They open this Blue Room set with 2018's “How Do You Let the Love Into the Heart That Isn't Split Wide Open,” and the song is barely even a minute of them singing that long title. Assembling a set short enough to fit on two sides of a record, they draw from the darker corners of their small catalog, mixing in Wednesday songs with Lenderman songs. There are two tracks from their 2021 EP Guttering, one non-album single based on a Harry Crews novel, and one from Lenderman's 2021 solo album Ghost of Your Guitar Solo. That vaults-clearing approach, however, lends Live at Third Man Records a finality that the duo perhaps didn't intend and the music can't uphold. Even more than a year later, it's impossible to ignore everything that was happening around this show. Just six months earlier, Hartzman and Lenderman ended their six-year romantic relationship, officially breaking up in a bar in Kyoto. Was it a relief to share their secret? Did it add new complications to their professional lives? Live at Third Man Records arrives freighted with unbearable weight, but their set gives nothing away. When Hartzman tells the audience they're going to play a few numbers even after they stop recording, she adds, “I'ma talk probably a lot more when I know it's not going to be permanent.” No doubt that's the better set, the unrecorded one—when they can shed all that weight and everybody can sing along.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every so often, an outsider manages to repurpose the tools of hip-hop with enough style and charisma to render questions of authenticity totally irrelevant: “Ginseng Strip 2002,” “Pop the Glock,” “Gucci Gucci”. This is music that can make you feel invincible for just under three minutes, a song as fizzy and intoxicating as its namesake drink. Effie has been making pop music for the better part of five years, though her early work, which was both slicker and more subdued, had far less personality. This may have been due in part to her choice in producers; pullup to busan 4 morE hypEr summEr it's gonna be a fuckin moviE is her first release working exclusively with the kinetic Korean-American producer kimj. After working extensively with American artists including NBA Youngboy, Rod Wave, Che, and glaive, kimj is now extending his reach into the emerging Korean hyperpop scene, producing for artists like the Deep. He draws a great deal of inspiration from PC Music—specifically A.G. Cook's production—a sound that admittedly feels a bit stale in the post-BRAT era. But his colorful, chaotic beats seem to draw Effie out of her shell. She could sound almost clinical on previous releases: demure melodies, clean production, a touch of Auto-Tune. While she initially adopted a detached, enigmatic posture (she cites Drain Gang as an early inspiration), these days, she sounds more like a flippant child of pop culture who's equally fluent in Korean sensibilities and American hip-hop technique. Rapping in Korean on songs like “More Hyper,” she slides into different flows and fills the gaps in kimj's chiptune barrage with squealed ad-libs that recall Young Thug. Effie sang and rapped largely in English until recently; she told Dazed earlier this year that she finds it challenging to sound fluid in her native tongue due to Korean's syllabic structure. On these new songs, however, she seems to unlock a previously unseen nimbleness. Now, lines that begin in English sometimes end in Korean and vice versa; she makes stitching different languages and cadences into a single flow sound effortless. pullup to busan 4 morE hypEr summEr it's gonna be a fuckin moviE only runs about 13 minutes, but Effie manages to cover an impressive amount of ground in that time. She coins a new way to bum a smoke on the wobbly, playful “CAN I SIP 담배,” (which translates to “Can I sip the cigarette?”), punctuating her bars with gasps. “LET'S FIND A GOOD MANAGER” is bouncy and shot through with sunny optimism: hyperpop meets pop-punk. The Korean music industry has achieved worldwide domination through brutal efficiency, producing an endless stream of impossibly slick, endlessly digestible pop—the sort of music that PC Music artists were cheekily imagining a decade ago. While Effie and kimj are clearly influenced by both of those camps, their end goal doesn't seem to be either an imitation or a critique. With these six songs, they present a vision of what Korean pop could become: conversant instead of extractive in its relationship to hip-hop, texturally abrasive, mildly sleazy in the mold of blog house.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ashlee Vance, author of one of a couple of Elon Musk biographies floating around out there—and specifically the SpaceX-focused Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, And The Quest For A Fantastic Future—has popped up on social media this week to state that a planned HBO adaptation of the series has now formally “died” at HBO. The series was initially announced to be in development back in 2020, when Musk was in a different, arguably less-immediately-impactful-to-a-regular-person phase in his campaign to be the main character of a planetary dystopia. (We're talking two years before he bought Twitter, for instance, in case it's all turned into a time slurry slowly drizzling through your heads the way it has for us.) At the very least, it was a period of time where HBO could be forgiven for thinking they were signing on—with Channing Tatum in a producing role—for a show about some flavor of visionary, and not that guy who turns meme names into actual programs for chopping the United States' foreign aid budget into pieces. I imagine it would have been a massive hit.” Suggesting that people are afraid to make a project about Musk now, Vance noted that the rights to his book have now reverted to him, in case any TV studios with hagiography in their hearts and cash burning a hole in their pockets want to bite. Interestingly, while HBO hasn't commented directly on Vance's post, Deadline does quote sources who actually say the project was passed on by the network a few years back, making it less clear why the author, who's also apparently producing projects on brain-computer interfaces and OpenAI—guy has a type, we'll give him that—is opening up about the whole thing falling apart now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Singer, songwriter, producer and director: the multihyphenate talents of Taylor Swift cannot be ignored. With eyes on a full-length film directorial debut, Swift has cut her teeth on many of her music videos. Since 2019, the “Fate of Ophelia” star has directed 14 of her own videos – three with partners and the other 11 completely solo. Her albums Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights, Red (Taylor's Version), The Tortured Poets Department and The Life of a Showgirl all feature her masterminded visual creations. And she's been heavily awarded for her efforts. Of her five MTV VMA Video of the Year wins, four of them were for videos where she sat in the director's chair – “You Need to Calm Down,” co-directed with Drew Kirsch, All Too Well: The Short Film, “Anti-Hero” and “Fortnight” feat. (Her win for “Bad Blood” was under the helm of Joseph Kahn.) And “The Man” – her first solo directorial experience – took home Best Direction, as did All Too Well, “Anti-Hero” and “Fortnight” at MTV's venerable show. Scroll below for our ranking of Swift's self-directed videos. (Not included in this list are the home or concert-footage-based videos that she directed throughout her career like “I'm Only Me When I'm With You” from 2008, “The Best Day” from 2009 and 2021, “Christmas Tree Farm” from 2019, “Cardigan (Cabin in Candlelight Version)” from 2020 and “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” from 2024.) Album: LoverYear: 2019Co-Director: Dave MeyersTaylor let go of the serpentine Reputation era by literally exploding a snake into butterflies at the beginning of the video for what would be Lover's first single. Co-starring a game Brendon Urie as both foil and mirror to Swift's difficult but lovable protagonist, the colorful and bright visuals – and special effects galore – enhance the saccharine, bubble gum pop of the track. Ultimately, she finds her way back home to the cozy comfort of the sweater that launched a thousand cardigans. This time, there's company – including a witchlike coven that Swift would transfer to the Eras stage and a sweet love story for the ages. – Swift's ode to LGBTQ allyship bursts with rainbow-colored sass and pride. Dressed in drag, Taylor upends criticisms thrown at successful women in this lamentation on those double standards, successfully subverting the commentary she's received through the years. (With a cute, meta appearance as her director-self, asking the male lead – also her – if he can be more likeable.) Album: Speak Now (Taylor's Version)Year: 2023Metaphorically challenging the state of Swift's masters at the time, “I Can See You” finds Taylor Lautner, Joey King and Presley Cash breaking the singer out of a vault in a museum with plenty of audacious thrills. In a preview of her Showgirl aesthetic, this Cinderellian tale sees “house wench” Taylor oppressed by her wicked stepmother (Laura Dern) and stepsisters (Este, Danielle and Alana Haim), only to find strength through her fairytale-esque godmother (Dita Von Teese), who teaches Swift how make the whole place shimmer. Well, she ghosts him, obviously – a diamond's gotta shine. Swift prances around in the aesthetically retro clip, questioning the preconceived notions about her value in a relationship. All, she just wants to “stay in that lavender haze” – the dreamy happiness of content – with her partner, played by transgender activist and model Laith Ashley. Post Malone and Swift's chemistry quietly sizzles in the grandiose “Fortnight” that follows the progression of a tortured poet. (And in a fabulous nod to The Dead Poets Society, Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles appear as mad scientists experimenting on the troubled heroine.) Featuring a hilarious imagining of what her funeral – starring Mark Birbiglia, John Early as her sons and Mary Elizabeth Ellis as her daughter-in-law – would look like, the video ends with the three Swifts sharing a bottle of wine. With a gorgeous, mid-century modern appeal, Swift depicts a beautiful ode to devotion, floating through longing and anxiety while building the foundation that houses their passions and intimacy. (Although, she would burn it down during the Eras tour.) After the spark of a flame ignites, the one-take shots of “Ophelia” race through exqusitely drawn evolutions of showgirls – a model for the painting that takes its inspiration from the Friedrich Heiser canvas of the title character (itself inspired by the Milias rendering), a burlesque performer, a go-go dancer, actresses, Busby Berkeley starlets, Vegas performers, and of course, modern pop stars – an elevated and impressive feat of filmmaking. Timeless and bittersweet, Swift captures the feelings of a situationship to end all situationships – with Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien portraying a couple who weren't built to last.
