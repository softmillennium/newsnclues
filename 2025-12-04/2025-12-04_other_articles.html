                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All six seasons of MTV's Teen Wolf are now streaming on Netflix. The supernatural dramedy about a teen boy who gets bitten by a werewolf and must learn to control his new powers while also navigating the perils of high school dominated Tumblr in the 2010s. Keep reading to refresh your memory of the hairiest show of the decade before jumping into your rewatch. Solve word, logic, and visual puzzles based on Stranger Things There are six seasons of Teen Wolf. The 20-episode seasons were divided into two halves, which often aired months apart and had separate, distinct story arcs. Scott McCall is the titular teen wolf. In the idyllic town of Beacon Hills, California, nothing interesting ever happens — until half a body is found in the woods. Scott McCall (Posey), a normal teenage boy who just wants to make first string on the lacrosse team, and Stiles (O'Brien), his goofy best friend, can't pass up the opportunity to investigate Beacon Hills's greatest mystery. Before he can figure out how to save himself, a large wolf comes out of nowhere and bites him. Scott makes it out of the woods alive but with a massive wound in his side. The next day, Scott's worried about how his injury will affect lacrosse tryouts, but then strange things start happening to his senses: He can hear a phone conversation on the other side of the building, he can smell a forgotten piece of gum in Stiles's jacket, and he can even see better. By the time tryouts roll around, Scott surprises everyone — including Stiles — with his amazing speed and reflexes. When she invites Scott out on a date, it seems that Scott's life is finally coming together. When Scott experiences unexpected bloodlust after dancing with Allison, he drives off to go through his first transformation alone, only to be lured into the woods by Derek Hale (Hoechlin), a local loner whose family died in a fire about 10 years ago. In return, there's only one thing Derek wants from Scott: to help him find the people responsible for killing his family — his pack — in that fire a decade ago. Red eyes mean that a werewolf is an Alpha, yellow eyes signify a Beta, and blue eyes denote a werewolf who's marked by guilt after taking an innocent life. In Teen Wolf, danger comes from all sides. Over the course of the series, Scott and his friends fend off both human and supernatural threats, which only seem to grow stronger over time. Crystal Reed (Allison) left the series after Season 3 to pursue other acting opportunities, so no, Scott and Allison are not endgame. She's referred to as Scott's first love throughout the series, though he does eventually fall in love again with Kira (Cho), a kitsune who moves to Beacon Hills later in the series. Tyler Hoechlin (Derek) also took a break from the show to pursue other acting opportunities after Season 4, but he returns in Season 6 as a recurring guest star. Derek faces several near-death experiences in the first four seasons, but he survives and leaves Scott in charge of the Beacon Hills pack. Derek's story is continued in 2023's Teen Wolf: The Movie. In both, the main character is a teen werewolf named Scott, and he has a human best friend named Stiles, but that's it. The series contains a vast wealth of lore and world-building, as well as an emphasis on horror that goes beyond the scope of the original film, which is strictly a comedy. Teen Wolf is set in the fictional city of Beacon Hills, California.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "View" airspace has been breached once again. From sonic phantoms and unknown entities to the echos of alleged backstage yeller Taraji P. Henson's voice, The View's storied airspace is a breeding ground for chaotic invasions — and, at the start of the holiday season, the program's atmosphere has once again been breached by a flying object that attacked Whoopi Goldberg. On Thursday's broadcast, as the 70-year-old EGOT-winning actress and her cohost Sara Haines attempted to spread holiday cheer with a special toy segment, a pair of unidentified flying objects hovered over their heads. Haines tried to reach up and touch one of the objects, which glistened with green, yellow, and red lights as it swirled around in the air. Apparently sensing potential impending discord, the Whoopi Goldberg War Room™ sprung into action as its commander grabbed ahold of one of the objects before tossing it back into the air and swiftly ducking to avoid its swift flight (all while holding a stuffed cow in her hand). "When they lower themselves, and here's how we turn it off..." the guest said, before Haines gave an update on the battlefield excursion playing out in front of her. Goldberg then retrieved the object and returned to join Haines, with them slathering dolls in Play-Doh and shoveling tiny marshmallows into their mouths for a game that tasks players with using a set of tiny arms to feed themselves. Goldberg once got up from the table to confirm that a dead alien was, in fact, dead as the show displayed an alleged alien body on a giant screen behind the cohosts. Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter. "They're already here," Goldberg told the actor calmly. They've been here for quite some time."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural has rotten luck when it comes to spinoffs. The backdoor pilot for Supernatural: Bloodlines quite fairly didn't lead to a full series, the backdoor pilot for Wayward Sisters quite unfairly didn't lead to a full series, and when a spinoff did finally get off the ground with The Winchesters, it was canceled after a single season. At this point, it would be fair to ask whether Supernatural as a premise works without Sam and Dean Winchester. While that viewpoint certainly has merit, one could also argue that Supernatural hasn't always put its faith in the right spinoffs. Wayward Sisters had a lot of support behind it, but was never picked up, while The CW went ahead with The Winchesters despite confusing canon changes at its heart. Better Call Saul tied directly into Breaking Bad in an ingenious way that complemented both shows, whereas Yellowstone has thrived by making each release distinct. After years of trial and error, Supernatural apparently falls into a weird awkward gap between those two approaches. Bloodlines' city setting removed any trace of Supernatural from its DNA, whereas Wayward Sisters and The Winchesters were essentially Supernatural without Sam and Dean. While nothing ever came of it, Supernatural creator Eric Kripke once mentioned how the show's writers shared vague dreams of a Samuel Colt spinoff (via Starpulse), citing how Sam and Dean's story already felt like a modern-day western. The Old West vibe would have maintained the tone and feel of Supernatural's main show (unlike Bloodlines), but by virtue of being set 200 years earlier and featuring totally different characters, would feel a lot more unique than Wayward Sisters or The Winchesters. As a period piece, The Winchesters' 1970s timeline wasn't far enough from Sam and Dean's era to create a profound difference. Sure, the lack of cellphones helped, but the spinoff still enjoyed modern conveniences like cars and payphones, as well as a pop culture backdrop rooted in music and movies we still love today. Going back to the 1830s with Samuel Colt, viewers would have witnessed a very different society of monsters fighting a very different society of horse-riding hunters. With very little known about Colt and hunters generally in the 1800s, a prequel series would have reveled in its own corner of the Supernatural timeline almost entirely free from restrictions and potential lore contradictions. Having said that, Supernatural did lay some tantalizing groundwork for a larger story involving Samuel Colt. Exactly who this hunter was remains unclear, although Samuel himself is a possibility. And because two centuries separate the Winchester brothers from Samuel Colt, a Colt spinoff could introduce major new villains and monsters defeated long before the 21st century. Wayward Sisters and The Winchesters were both somewhat limited in that regard, with the latter's Akrida feeling too much like a rug-pull to succeed. The future of Supernatural remains unclear, especially after another failed spinoff. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A volcanic eruption in 1345 may have kicked off a series of events that led to the Black Death sweeping through medieval Europe. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The bubonic plague pandemic, more commonly known as the Black Death, reached Europe in 1347 and quickly affected Italian port cities. Their research was published Thursday (Dec. 4) in the journal Communications Earth & Environment. When combing through contemporaneous historical accounts, the researchers noticed reports of reduced sunshine, increased cloudiness and a dark lunar eclipse, all independently reported by observers in parts of Asia and Europe between 1345 and 1349. All of these astronomical and weather phenomena could be attributed to a large-scale volcanic aerosol layer, which has been known to cause cold spells as the sulfate aerosols reflect sunlight back into space. Paleoclimate data gave the researchers a clue: High amounts of sulfur in polar ice cores suggested one or more eruptions of a previously unknown volcano around 1345. "We cannot say very much about the volcanic eruption," Bauch said. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The researchers also looked at tree-ring data from around Europe and discovered that the summers of 1345, 1346 and 1347 were much colder than normal while the autumns were much wetter, causing soil erosion and flooding. "This initiates the typical infection cycle," Bauch said. Importing grain after several years' worth of volcano-induced climate change therefore prevented a Mediterranean-wide famine but also introduced the Black Death into Europe, the study authors proposed. —Single gene may help explain the plague's persistence throughout human history —Mass grave of plague victims may be largest ever found in Europe, archaeologists say —Earliest known strain of plague could have come from a beaver bite "But it happened how it did — with a 'plague infrastructure' of rodents and insect vectors already established — because local reservoirs had already been established." Even though the Black Death resulted from a rare confluence of environmental and social factors, it's important to gain a better understanding of the causes of past pandemics, the researchers wrote, because "the probability of zoonotic infectious diseases to emerge and translate into pandemics is likely to increase in both a globalised and warmer world."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ‘Paranormal Activity' franchise is officially set for a major resurgence, with horror veteran James Wan joining the production team for a new feature film. This high-profile collaboration, announced following the merger of Wan's company, Atomic Monster, with producer Jason Blum's Blumhouse, signals a significant push to revitalize the iconic found-footage series. The project, which Paramount Pictures will co-finance, co-produce, and distribute, is being treated as a theatrical priority for all parties involved. James Wan expressed his long-standing admiration for the first film. “I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying. I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise,” said Wan. Meanwhile, Jason Blum highlighted that this collaboration was a direct result of the Blumhouse-Atomic Monster merger. “Diving in with James for this exciting rebirth of the franchise that started it all for Blumhouse is exactly what we dreamed of,” Blum stated. He confirmed he would be “actively involved with him to introduce this new chapter,” which follows the seven previous films, the most recent being Next of Kin in 2021.

When it comes to molecules fundamental to life, we usually focus on the nucleotide bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil, which are the fundamental units of DNA and RNA. Of those 22, only 14 have been found in stuff from outer space – until now, possibly. They also report tentative detections of tryptophan, a pretty important amino acid. A form of vitamin B3 has previously been detected in the Bennu sample, which gives credence to this new detection. Tryptophan is pretty fragile, so it is not a big surprise that it has not been found before in meteorites. The delicate collection of 121.6 grams (4.3 ounces) of material by OSIRIS-REx might have kept this and other dainty molecules safe. Coincidentally, the sample came back to Earth on September 24, 2023. Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speculation is mounting over what the public might learn from the '3I/ATLAS' and broader UAP records, marking a potential moment of clarity in a decades-long mystery. According to reports circulating online this week, US President Donald Trump could be preparing to release key public statements concerning the '3I/ATLAS' files and a collection of confidential UAP records. According to a post shared on X by @3IATLAScoinX, sources close to the president suggest he believes the American public 'deserves full transparency' regarding various confidential issues. The post claims that Trump has recently renewed his focus on sensitive documents and might move to release them. The X post makes it clear that Trump might disclose key details from the 3i/ATLAS files, yet it gives no information on what these files cover. Though no formal account of the files exists, backers and online analysts say they contain data linked to national security and intelligence programmes. There are growing claims that Donald Trump is preparing to make significant statements regarding the 3i/ATLAS files.According to sources, Trump believes the American public deserves full transparency about several highly classified matters.At the same time, he is reportedly… pic.twitter.com/19gG8OVOSX Such documents might include 'radar data, pilot accounts, and analytical reports' concerning sightings that the US military could not fully explain. The post concludes by noting that 'all signs suggest that major disclosures could be on the horizon,' positioning the possible release as part of a broader effort to be transparent about long-classified information. In the footage, Trump confirms that pilots have approached him to describe unusual aircraft. He is quoted as saying, 'You jet pilots that say they saw something, and they said we saw things, sir, that were very strange, like a round ball," he said. Trump remarked that he is often asked about unidentified aerial phenomena, noting, 'I get that question as much as almost any question. Do you think that we have aliens coming? I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.' Trump also referred to theories suggesting that some sightings near US military ships might be foreign aircraft. However, Trump countered this by saying several people he had spoken to were convinced they had witnessed something genuinely unusual. He said, 'I did interview, let's say three or four guys, solid beautiful people. He then highlighted the famous 2004 incident involving retired Navy Cmdr. David Fravor reported a very fast-moving object off the San Diego coast. He added that the proof shared by pilots is more than just spoken accounts. Despite the X post claiming that Trump is planning major releases, neither he nor his campaign has officially verified any upcoming declassifications. The president has previously discussed UAP sightings, yet precisely what any future disclosures would cover remains unclear. Even so, the convergence of the X post, Trump's latest remarks, and growing interest in military sightings has fuelled high anticipation among enthusiasts and transparency advocates. The actual release of the ATLAS files or UAP records remains uncertain, but current online activity suggests a significant reveal is widely expected.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You need a specific piece of gear to trip the light fantastic across these ethereal bits of psychic energy, but the boots do more than just let you use psychic platforms. They're one of Samus' most essential upgrades. The good news is that you can't miss Prime 4's Psychic Boots. Unlike some other Metroid games, you get Samus' power-ups in a set order. And there's no risk of taking a wrong turn and passing by the boots, as the first few major areas you visit on Viewros are entirely linear. The bad news is that those first psychic platforms will remain tantalizingly out of reach for a little while yet. Ignore those platforms for now, and press on through Fury Green. Fight your way through the factory's generator towers, claim your Vi-o-La, and then at the end of your first visit, you'll encounter the nefarious AI construct Xelios. These are basically Metroid's traditional Space Boots with a psychic twist. They let you double jump like the Space Boots always do, and you can walk on psychic platforms with them. Psychic platforms manifest as little wisps of purple energy initially, and you can't walk on them. There's no time limit, so you're free to linger and plan your next move if need be. But just as important is the fact that, despite having "psychic" in the name, these are very much just Samus' traditional Space Boots. You can double-jump by pressing B after jumping the first time and reach areas that would otherwise be inaccessible, so don't forget that.
