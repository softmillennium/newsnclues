                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google Cloud announced Thursday a multi-year partnership with artificial intelligence coding startup Replit, giving the search giant fresh firepower against the coding products of rivals, including Anthropic and Cursor. Under the partnership, Replit will expand usage of Google Cloud services, add more of Google's models onto its platform, and support AI coding use cases for enterprise customers. Google will continue to be Replit's primary cloud provider. In September, the startup closed a $250 million funding round that almost tripled its valuation to $3 billion, and said it grew annualized revenue from $2.8 million to $150 million in less than a year. And new data from Ramp, a fintech company that also tracks enterprise spending on its platform, found that Replit had the fastest new customer growth among software vendors. Google, meanwhile, is adding new customers and spending faster than any other company on Ramp's platform. Put those together, and you get a clearer picture of why both companies see opportunity. Vibe-coding emerged as a phenomenon earlier this year after AI models became more adept at generating code using only natural language prompts, allowing users with little experience in programming to use AI to create functioning code and potentially full applications. Anthropic announced on Tuesday that its product Claude Code hit $1 billion in run-rate revenue. The coding startup Cursor, in November, closed a funding round that valued it at $29.3 billion, while also announcing it reached $1 billion in annualized revenue. Replit, which bills itself as an easy-to-use product for non-developers, could help drive Google Cloud adoption among enterprises, and expand the reach of its AI efforts beyond traditional engineers. Google is riding on the momentum of its new top-scoring model, Gemini 3. Shares of Alphabet have risen more than 12% since its debut.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beta Technologies posted its first quarterly results on Thursday since the stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. The electric aircraft maker, which went public last month, reported revenue of $8.9 million, more than double the $3.1 million from a year ago. "As a newly public company, we remain firmly grounded in what makes BETA unique—our simple, stepwise approach, our vertical integration and our focus on designing and manufacturing the complete electric aviation ecosystem to meet the needs of customers around the world," CEO Kyle Clark said in a statement. The Amazon-backed company is establishing itself as another player alongside rivals Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation in the small but competitive electric vertical take-off and landing, or eVTOL, space. Air taxi manufacturers are vying to gain approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which launched the eVTOL Integration Pilot Program, or eIPP, in September. Beta is applying to the program with state partners, including North Carolina, Michigan and Ohio, to host its commercial aircraft operations as soon as next June. "We have flown more than twice as many miles than anybody else in this industry," Clark said. "That real-world flying gives us the ability to go into these eIPP opportunities with a mature type of certification product with a ton of reliability." The company is currently working on military and cargo operations before focusing on passenger applications. During the quarter, aircraft engine supplier GE Aerospace agreed to invest $300 million in Beta and co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for both defense and civil use. "The eIPP program is meant to augment America's drone dominance and that is a military interest as well as a civil interest," Clark said. "Partnership with dual-use aircraft like ours, with the military and civil applications, is a big part of this." The company also worked with Hartzell Propeller to land certification during the quarter, becoming the first FAA-certified propeller specifically designed for advanced air mobility aircraft. The achievement marks another step closer to obtaining Type Certification, or approval of aircraft design, for Beta's H500A electric engine. "To take something as big and new as a primary propulsion electric motor that other people are buying, that we're using in our own aircraft — we're flying all over the world in — and be in the final steps to Type Certification is a huge validation point," Clark said. Beta announced earlier this week an up to supply deal with air taxi company Eve Air Mobility. Eve agreed to purchase Beta's electric pusher motors, which could potentially equate to as much as $1 billion over 10 years. Clark said during an earnings call that the deal contributed to a component backlog of over $1 billion. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount Skydance is calling foul on how Warner Bros. In a letter reviewed by CNBC, Paramount attorneys told Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav that Paramount was questioning the "fairness and adequacy" of the process, which officially launched in October. This week, Paramount, Netflix and Comcast submitted second-round bids to acquire some or all of Warner Bros. "It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder," reads the letter from attorneys at Quinn Emanuel. "We specifically request and expect this letter will be shared and discussed with the full board of directors of WBD." In particular, Paramount's letter calls out reports that WBD's management appears to favor Netflix's offer. All three companies submitted higher bids than their initial offers, the people told CNBC. As of Thursday morning, Netflix was the leading bidder based on how WBD is valuing the offers, people familiar told CNBC. Comcast executives, for their part, continue to be disciplined in the company's offer as to not anger shareholders by taking on additional debt and risking its balance sheet, according to people familiar with that company's thinking. Comcast leadership has previously said that its bar for M&A is generally high. "Please be assured that the WBD Board attends to its fiduciary obligations with the utmost care, and that they have fully and robustly complied with them and will continue to do so," the company said in its response to Paramount. While first-round bids arrived in mid-November, Paramount has been vying to acquire the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery — which includes its streaming service HBO Max, film studio Warner Bros. and a portfolio of cable TV networks like TNT and TBS — since September, CNBC previously reported. Discovery rebuffed three offers made by Paramount, the last of the those for $23.50 a share, before launching a formal sale process to beckon other buyers, CNBC previously reported. Discovery had begun the process of splitting its company into two — Warner Bros., the streaming and studio businesses which would be led by Zaslav, and Discovery Global, the cable TV networks division that would be run by current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. Paramount and its advisors have viewed WBD's contact with them as more obstructionist rather than constructive, two of the people said. Before the sale process, Zaslav had been known to tell colleagues that Amazon's Prime Video or Netflix would likely be interested suitors in Warner Bros. In the letter, Paramount asks the WBD board if reporting that WBD management has "chemistry" with Netflix management is accurate. Paramount is seeking confirmation, according to the letter, of whether Warner Bros. Discovery appointed an independent special committee of disinterested members of its board to steer the sale process and consider offers. "If not, we strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders," the letter reads. Dear Mr. Zaslav: We write on behalf of Paramount Skydance Corporation ("Paramount", "we" or "us") to express our serious concerns about the fairness and adequacy of the bidding process for a potential combination with Warner Bros. It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder. We specifically request and expect this letter will be shared and discussed with the full board of directors of WBD. We have recently seen reporting in the U.S. and foreign media that gives serious cause for concern. The German newspaper Handelsblatt recently reported on a meeting that reportedly took place in Brussels between Gerhard Zieler, President of WBD's International Business and a direct report to WBD's Chief Executive Officer, who "arrived with a three-person team," with the E.U. Commission Vice President Hena Virkkunen, to discuss the potential merger prospects for WBD. Discovery could lead to excessive media concentration," and that the E.U. Commission would consider intervening in a potential merger with Paramount for this reason. While this report is concerning in itself, this is not an isolated report regarding purported WBD resistance to a combination with Paramount. Additional reporting since the submission of revised bids on December 1 has indicated that WBD's "board has really warmed to" a transaction with Netflix due to the "chemistry between" WBD management and Netflix management. We have come to you first to inquire whether this reporting is accurate, and to engage in a productive discussion with you around any actual or perceived issues that it may reflect. Paramount has a credible basis to believe that the sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management's potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation as a result of the economic incentives embedded in recent amendments to employment arrangements. These concerns are amplified by indications of director bias and beholdenness to others whose interests may not align with the stockholders', and the fact that alternatives involving only certain WBD assets are being prioritized notwithstanding their heightened regulatory risk and potential to deprive stockholders of consideration for the entirety of WBD's enterprise value. Further, as you know, Paramount agreed to certain standstill arrangements in exchange for the opportunity to participate in a truly competitive and unbiased bidding process. Paramount did not bargain for WBD to foster, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a tilted and unfair process. We believe that all parties to this process should have a shared desire for, and will mutually benefit from, an unimpeachable transaction process. As we assume you agree, even discounting the accuracy of any media reports, just the appearance of a flawed process imperils any potential transaction that might result and may undermine the potential value maximization to WBD stockholders from any prospective transaction. If not, we strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders. Engaging with WBD throughout this process, we have been encouraged by the enormous potential from a combination of our entities. But at this point we must insist on assurances and steps taken to ensure that a truly fair and independent process is being conducted, both for Paramount's benefit and in the interest of WBD's stockholders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article appeared in CNBC's Inside Alts newsletter, a guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments, from private equity and private credit to hedge funds and venture capital. CNBC's 15th annual Delivering Alpha investor summit last month brought together some of the biggest names in investing to answer some of the top questions surrounding the alternatives industry. Here are the highlights from our conversations with General Atlantic Chairman and CEO Bill Ford, Coatue Management founder and portfolio manager Philippe Laffont, Ares Management co-founder and CEO Michael Arougheti, and JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management CEO Mary Erdoes. The comments are edited for clarity and length. The Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments. So, if you don't understand what Oracle is doing, what Google is doing, what Microsoft is doing, you really can't invest in the private market. So even if we're not making investment decisions on the public side, we have to be pretty fully aware of what they're doing and that's how we synthesize it into our decision-making. On one hand, you could say, OK, maybe we're at an advantage, because we know both about publics and privates. On the public side, it's not only [that] you have to believe in the future, but you have to think, is it already priced in or not? Like when Oracle goes from [$50 per share] to $350, at $350 it's like, maybe the idea is already priced [in] and on the private side, because usually things take longer, you have to be more right, you have to be more patient. You have to be active in your companies, you have to support the founders or the CEOs a lot. So I would say that if you can do both, great, but they're definitely different skill sets. Sometimes I'm happy to be involved in both. Ford: The nice thing about private is ... I think this tech cycle plays out over a longer period of time. Sometimes the public markets are more demanding for shorter-term performance. Laffont: I personally think that the IPO market is totally broken – like beyond repair, as measured by the fact that 20 or 30 years ago, there were so many more IPOs than today. We were talking earlier this year, there's been almost none. So I find it's a little bit unfair. I do think that it's going to get fixed purely through competition more than through regulatory action, because when private assets get tokenized, the byproduct of being tokenized is you, in essence, become public, because now you could trade at a premium to the price of the token, you could trade at a discount to whatever the token price was issued. And so all these people that are tokenizing private assets, in essence, it's making them public. Ford: I'm a little more optimistic about the IPO market. I think we've had an exit recession in private markets for the last three-plus years, and some of that was regulatory, some of it was just some of the trends that Philippe was talking about. But I think we started to see some green shoots around the IPO market this year, and it was just unfortunate that the wind was taken out of our sails a little bit when we had the government shutdown. There were a lot of high-quality companies on file, ready to go, that would have gone public in Q4 [and] I think build some momentum going into '26. I think it will come back in '26. I think ... while the balance may have shifted toward privates, I think there's a desire among public investors to have high-quality companies come public. Arougheti: Whenever you talk about retail access to any investment product … you have to focus on fiduciary duty, and you have to make sure that they understand what they're buying. Now I also believe that sometimes we don't give the everyday investor enough credit for just how smart they are. … As a capital markets practitioner, I just think any time we can increase access to the individual investor to investment products that will help them through their wealth creation and retirement is a good thing. There's no reason why the retail investor should not have access to institutional-quality product, as long as it's structured the right way and they're well advised. But when you see what alternatives can do mixed in with a traditional 60/40 portfolio, it's a wonderful thing, and you're going to see a continued increase in retail buying of alts, because it delivers a better investment outcome in most portfolio constructions. Erdoes: And that's exactly why the current administration is changing the rules on these things, so that you can think about having them in 401(k) accounts, that you can think about them in the Invest America accounts that will come for the children's future, so that they can participate in 99% of the companies out there in the United States of America that are not public. And so why should it be that just institutions get to invest in the things that are not public? And so there's great value to be found. How do we give that access while properly risk-managing it? There just should be no such thing as a public markets-only portfolio for almost anyone in the world, if you can risk-manage it; it should be a public-to-private continuum. That's how you should think about it and how you invest that money is just right-sizing it, risk-managing it and making sure that everybody has access to these companies. Arougheti: I think the unlock is when you go through cycles. ... What the semiliquid structures actually do is allow you to own these assets through a cycle, to capture all of the value creation. And ironically, when the market is going through volatility or a downturn, there is no liquidity at the price that you want it. The retail investor has been trained for generations: don't lever yourself and be liquid because when things get bad, you need to be able to sell. And I think what we're now seeing, and I think it's why we're seeing the market smoothing the ownership of these assets – you're almost structuring out the bad behavior, because people are doing a better job understanding the liquidity and how much they can give up and get paid. Erdoes: And the sophistication of evergreen funds, interval funds, things that can last through time, we were just talking about some assets that we share and own.

Such oversight would "drag this industry into a halt" and would "create a national security concern," he said.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is slated to vote today. On the docket: whether to change its longstanding recommendation that babies gets the hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth. While it's unclear how the committee will rule, any change to the recommendation would have major impacts within public health. Some experts caution that doing away with the decades-old recommendation could lead to a higher rate of chronic infections in children.

After more than 40 years of studying AI, UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell hasn't mellowed. The man who co-authored "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach," the world's most authoritative textbook on AI, now spends up to 100 hours a week trying to avert what he sees as a historic crisis — one that could leave almost the entire global population without work. Russell said political leaders are "suddenly staring 80% unemployment in the face" as AI systems accelerate toward replacing abilities once reserved for the highest-skilled humans. "AI systems are doing pretty much everything we currently call work," he said. That includes fields once believed to be safe from automation. He suggested that sectors once considered safe — from driving and logistics to accounting, software engineering, and even medicine — are likely to be swept up in the coming wave of automation. While Andrew Yang has warned AI could wipe out 40 million US jobs in the next decade, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has predicted up to half of entry-level white-collar roles could disappear within five years. Others, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun, Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist, believe AI will transform work rather than erase it. "Pity the poor CEO whose board says, 'Unless you turn over your decision-making power to the AI system, we're going to have to fire you because all our competitors are using an AI-powered CEO and they're doing much better.'" "I think what a CEO does is maybe one of the easier things for an AI to do one day," Pichai told the BBC last month. HP, IBM, Salesforce, and Klarna have also cited AI as a factor in sweeping layoffs or workforce reductions announced over the past year. Russell believes that even if AI advances safely, the bigger challenge may be psychological. Humans derive purpose from striving, problem-solving, and contributing to others, he said. "We need to figure out what is the next phase going to be like," he said, and "how in this world do we have the incentives to become fully human, which I think means at least a level of education that people have now and probably more."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's more than 30% drop from its record high underscores the volatility that has come to  characterize the cryptocurrency. Moves from previous cycles not only show how the current price swings are all part of bitcoin's normal operating pattern but also how they may often precede a rally, according to figures compiled by CoinDesk Data for CNBC. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped to a low of around $80,000 late last month before staging a rally and falling again this week. When bitcoin dropped to under $81,000, that represented an approximately 36% fall from its all-time high of around $126,000 hit earlier in October. As of Thursday, bitcoin was trading at over $93,000, according to Coinmetrics, a roughly 26% decline from its record high. These price swings may seem large but they are normal in relation to bitcoin's history. Bitcoin's price movement is often referred to in "cycles." Generally, the bitcoin cycle refers to a four-year pattern of price movement that revolves around a key event known as the halving, a change to mining rewards that is written in bitcoin's code. In the current cycle, bitcoin has already weathered a 32.7% pullback from March to August 2024 and a 31.7% decline between January and April 2025, according to CoinDesk Data. "Looking at previous cycles, volatility of this magnitude appears consistent with long-term trends," Jacob Joseph, senior research analyst at CoinDesk Data, told CNBC. During the 2017 cycle, there were drawdowns of around 40% twice that year and then a 29% decline in November before bitcoin reached a new record high in December. There was a more than 55% correction between April and June 2021 as China banned bitcoin mining. The asset then rallied to a new high in November that year. "While deeper mid-cycle corrections have certainly occurred, nearly all of them — aside from the mining-ban-drop in 2021 —  took place within a broader bullish structure, often holding above key technical levels such as its 50-week moving average," Joseph said. That effect is still being felt, according to Lucy Gazmararian, founder of Token Bay Capital. "[It was the] biggest liquidation event in crypto's history and that takes quite a few weeks to see the fallout from that and for the market to consolidate," Gazmararian told "Access Middle East" on Thursday. "It also coincided at a time when there's a lot of concern that we are reaching the end of a bull market … so that has increased the levels of fear out there in the market." In the past, when the bull market ends and there is a period of depressed prices, often dubbed a "crypto winter," bitcoin has tended to sit 70% to 80% below its all-time high. But concern about this coming to pass is weighing on investors' minds. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta has been hit with an EU antitrust investigation over its use of AI features in WhatsApp, as the European bloc continues to ramp up challenges to US big tech giants. The probe will examine whether Meta's new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp may breach EU competition rules, Brussels said in a statement Thursday morning. A new policy announced by Meta in October prohibited AI providers from using a tool allowing businesses to contact customers via WhatsApp when AI is the main service offered, the European Commission said. While businesses may still use AI tools for functions like customer support, the bloc was concerned the new policy might "prevent third party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (EEA)," it added. "The claims are baseless," a WhatsApp spokesperson told CNBC in a statement, adding that the app's application programming interface (API) was not designed to support AI chatbots and "puts a strain on our systems." "The AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations and operating systems," the company added. It comes months on from the Commission fining Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.45 billion) for breaching antitrust rules around online advertising. In April, Apple was fined 500 million euros after being found to have breached anti-steering obligations. The same month, Meta was hit with a 200 million euros fine for breaching obligations to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data. There are no dates set for the antitrust investigation to close, but previous cases have run on for years. "We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully of this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors," said the bloc's Commissioner for Competition Teresa Ribera. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously threatened the EU with an investigation that could lead to tariffs for imposing fines and regulation on the country's tech giants. "As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand," he said following the EU's Google fine in September.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to change a longstanding recommendation that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first. But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. "We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that," Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. But the jab is "an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks," Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. "I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine," said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations. Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. "They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo," Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. "If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages." Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. "The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases," Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time.

In late October, the US Treasury announced sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producers. The changes sent seaborne shipments from these companies down 42%, to about 1.7 million barrels a day. However, Russia's total oil exports slipped by just 100,000 barrels per day after the sanctions came into effect. This means that Russia rapidly rerouted shipments through smaller, non-sanctioned producers. Even so, the steady flow of barrels masks a far deeper financial squeeze. The revenue collapse stems from a combination of a stronger ruble and sagging Brent prices, widening discounts on Russian crude as buyers demand steeper price cuts to offset the risk of sanctions. The divergence between stable exports and collapsing revenue has major implications for Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. But even as Russia boosts weapons production and ramps up defense spending, the money flowing in to support that buildup is shrinking. Despite those attacks, Brent prices have barely moved, suggesting markets remain unconvinced that Russian supply is in immediate danger — a dynamic that keeps global prices low and Russia's revenues even lower. An end to the war in Ukraine appears elusive nearly four years after Russia's full-scale invasion, despite renewed diplomatic attempts.</p>

Melinda French Gates has a message for the ultrawealthy: Give more money away. In a Tuesday interview with Wired, Gates spoke about the Giving Pledge, a movement she started in 2010 with her ex-husband, Microsoft's cofounder Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett, the chair of Berkshire Hathaway. French Gates said that some of the people who signed the Giving Pledge, which encourages billionaires to donate a significant portion of their wealth, have been giving money at a "massive scale." She said those who have amassed "enormous amounts of wealth" have benefited from the US's education system, regulatory environment, and venture capital system. French Gates is worth $17.2 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. "And I believe to whom much is given, much is expected, and they should be giving back more, far more than they are." She did not name specific billionaires in the interview. Its signatories include Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle's technology chief Larry Ellison, and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman. She now runs Pivotal Ventures, a group of philanthropic organizations focusing on women's issues. French Gates' comments in the Wired interview echo those of singer Billie Eilish during her acceptance speech at the WSJ Magazine Innovator Awards in October. No hate, but yeah, give your money away, shorties."</p>
