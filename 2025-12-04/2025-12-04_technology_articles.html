                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is thinking about expanding into the final frontier for data centers, and his efforts to follow through on that thought reportedly turned into talks with Stoke Space, a rocket startup headquartered just south of Seattle. Such a move would open up a new front in Altman's competition with SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who has talked about scaling up Starlink V3 satellites to serve as data centers for AI applications. “SpaceX will be doing this,” Musk wrote in a post to his X social-media platform. Google is partnering with Planet Labs on a space-based data processing effort known as Project Suncatcher. Altman addressed the subject on Theo Von's “This Past Weekend” podcast in July. “I do guess that a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time,” Altman said. “But I don't know, because maybe we put them in space. Such down-to-earth market concerns may have been one of the factors putting Altman's space aspirations on hold. There's another Seattle-area space venture that may well offer the kind of play that Altman is looking for: Redmond, Wash.-based Starcloud is developing its own platform for AI data centers in space. Like Stoke Space, Starcloud went through the startup accelerator program at Y Combinator, which Altman ran for a time before he became OpenAI's CEO. Last month, Starcloud had its first test satellite launched into space with an Nvidia data-processing chip on board. The startup is already partnering with a Colorado-based company called Crusoe to offer limited GPU processing capacity in space by early 2027.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I've written about a few Bluetooth speakers in my day, but this one—this one, dear readers—is more than meets the eye. Like Robosen's previous Transformers (this sick Bumblebee one, for example), Soundwave fully auto-converts from ass-kicking robot to ordinary object and vice versa. Unlike the others, however, Soundwave adds an audio twist, doubling as two things you may actually want to use. The first fun and useful thing you can do is tap into Soundwave as a Bluetooth speaker. Robosen doesn't list any technical information about the actual speaker system but claims that it's “high quality,” so for now we'll have to trust that it doesn't sound like you're listening to tunes on speakerphone in 2004. The other rad thing Soundwave does is that it doubles as an actual, functional cassette player, which is not only a nice nod to the prevailing audio format at the time Transformers was released (1984 for any trivia geeks out there), but also weirdly trendy given the resurgence of physical formats and nostalgia in modern audio hardware. Robosen says the front buttons are functional, too, meaning you can do fun tape stuff like record your voice in addition to fast forward, rewind, and play/pause by pushing real buttons. Outside of all the neat audio stuff, Soundwave is (like Robosen's previous robots) also a dutiful and surprisingly complex homage to Transformers. In keeping with the whole sound thing, Robosen tapped one of the series' original actors, Frank Welker, who voiced lots of characters, including Soundwave. Another nice addition is the ability to recognize voice commands, which is great if you don't feel like getting up off the couch to turn your $1,000+ Transformer into a cassette player. Robosen says that altogether, Soundwave understands 48 voice commands, including “convert,” “hello,” and “attack,” which can all be activated by saying, “Hey, Soundwave.” No guarantee that these voice commands work any better than your Amazon or Google-powered smart speaker, but no worries if they don't; you can always use the included app to make Soundwave do your bidding instead. Robosen has rolled out preorders for Soundwave with an introductory price of $1,000. If you do decide to pull the trigger on your own audio Decepticon, Robosen units will supposedly ship in April 2026. Here's YOUR chance to tell us which gadgets were the best. Might as well rename November to Game-vember since there was so much great gaming hardware announced. Imagineering's entertainment robots get cuter and cuddlier as they become more advanced, so surely there's nothing to worry about.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle-based startup Otto announced the wide release Thursday of its AI-powered travel assistant — Otto the Agent — in a bid to bring a concierge-level experience and personalization to business travelers. The platform has been in closed beta for nine months. GeekWire first reported about its stealthy operations in August 2024. Founded by longtime travel industry veterans, Otto was incubated and spun out of Seattle-based Madrona Venture Labs, the former startup studio associated with Madrona. “The goal here is to mimic or create as good or better an experience than the best ever executive assistant, to help you book your business travel,” said founder and CEO Michael Gulmann, who spent nearly a decade at Expedia Group in various leadership roles, and also worked at business travel management giant Egencia. Steve Singh, managing director at Madrona who co-founded business expense software giant Concur, is executive chairman of Otto. Otto is built to learn and understand an individual's travel habits — airline and hotel preferences, seat choices, loyalty programs, and even nuanced needs like finding rooms that avoid train noise or finding hotels with rooftop bars. Otto can also connect to a traveler's calendar and proactively detect upcoming trips and suggest itineraries before the traveler asks. Barney Harford, former CEO of Orbitz Worldwide and former COO of Uber, called Otto “a glimpse into the future,” saying that after using it for several months it knows his business travel preferences “and has simplified the shop and book process down to just a couple of minutes.” Harford is an investor in Otto. Beyond flights and hotels, a clear next step in Otto's development will be the addition of car rentals and dinner reservations — things an executive assistant “back home would be helping with when you're on the road,” Gulmann said. “The reality is, most people don't have an EA,” he added. “A little bit of the genesis of the company was, I was fortunate enough to have an EA at Expedia for a long time, once I got to a certain level, and it was amazing.” Through a partnership with travel management company Direct Travel, Otto is also launching upcoming pilot programs with two companies Gulmann could not yet name. Gulmann said innovating around travel again was the “last thing he thought he'd get back into” but a lot has changed since Expedia and others came along to displace human travel agents in the 1990s. So, not tiny, but nowhere near the developer and engineer horsepower that Expedia or Booking.com have. But yet, I think we're going a lot faster than they are now.” Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta is launching a new centralized support hub for Facebook and Instagram users, the company announced on Thursday, adding that its prior support options haven't “always met expectations.” Within the hub, users will find tools to report an account issue, recover an account they've lost access to, and get answers via AI-powered search and an AI assistant. The new AI assistant being tested is designed to offer more personalized help with things like account recovery, managing your profile, or updating your settings. The company claims that its use of AI systems is helping protect users' accounts, noting that account hacks have decreased by over 30% globally across Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, Meta says that AI has helped it avoid disabling accounts by mistake more than ever before and has sped up the appeals process when mistakes occurred. A portion of these users are threatening or engaged in legal action, particularly when losing their accounts has real-world impacts on their businesses or livelihoods. The situation has now gotten so bad that an entire Reddit forum was set up this year to help people who are suing Meta over their disabled accounts. Meta believes the new hub could address these kinds of problems, saying that it will centralize account recovery options and offer a more streamlined account recovery experience with clearer guidelines and simpler verification. And it will connect users with other tools to secure their account, like running a security checkup, setting up two-factor authentication, or adding a passkey. While Meta claims the new hub will make things easier on its users, simply the act of moving around where settings and help are found can lead to confusion. Over the years, Meta has regularly relocated key areas like its account settings, data management tools, and privacy features, ostensibly to make things easier for users. But the constant changes also mean that users can't remember where to find things in the app, as they're often not where they were found before, and various menus and navigation have changed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yes, he dreams of a future where anyone in the US can get a working smartphone—complete with cellular coverage and data—without revealing their identity, even to the phone company. But to call such anonymous phones “burners” suggests that they're for something illegal, shady, or at least subversive. The term calls to mind drug dealers or deep-throat confidential sources in parking garages. With his new startup, Merrill says he instead wants to offer cellular service for your existing phone that makes near-total mobile privacy the permanent, boring default of daily life in the US. I think it's not controversial to say the vast majority of people want that.” Phreeli, as in, “speak freely,” aims to give its user a different sort of privacy from the kind that can be had with end-to-end encrypted texting and calling tools like Signal or WhatsApp. Those apps hide the content of conversations, or even, in Signal's case, metadata like the identities of who is talking to whom. The only piece of information the company records about its users when they sign up for a Phreeli phone number is, in fact, a mere ZIP code. That's the minimum personal data Merrill has determined his company is legally required to keep about its customers for tax purposes. By asking users for almost no identifiable information, Merrill wants to protect them from one of the most intractable privacy problems in modern technology: Despite whatever surveillance-resistant communications apps you might use, phone carriers will always know which of their customers' phones are connecting to which cell towers and when. Carriers have frequently handed that information over to data brokers willing to pay for it—or any FBI or ICE agent that demands it with a court order After that, he spent another 15 years building and managing the Calyx Institute, a nonprofit that offers privacy tools like a snooping-resistant version of Android and a free VPN that collects no logs of its users' activities. “Nick is somebody who is extremely principled and willing to take a stand for his principles,” says Cindy Cohn, who as executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has led the group's own decades-long fight against government surveillance. “He's careful and thoughtful, but also, at a certain level, kind of fearless.” Nicholas Merrill with a copy of the National Security Letter he received from the FBI in 2004, ordering him to give up data on one of his customers. “I started to realize that if I controlled the mobile provider, there would be even more opportunities to create privacy for people,” Merrill says. “If we were able to set up our own network of cell towers globally, we can set the privacy policies of what those towers see and collect.” So he's created the next best thing: a so-called mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, a kind of virtual phone carrier that pays one of the big, established ones—in Phreeli's case, T-Mobile—to use its infrastructure. Signing up a customer for phone service without knowing their name is, surprisingly, legal in all 50 states, Merrill says. Anonymously accepting money from users—with payment options other than envelopes of cash—presents more technical challenges. To that end, Phreeli has implemented a new encryption system it calls Double-Blind Armadillo, based on cutting-edge cryptographic protocols known as zero-knowledge proofs. Through a kind of mathematical sleight of hand, those crypto functions are capable of tasks like confirming that a certain phone has had its monthly service paid for, but without keeping any record that links a specific credit card number to that phone. Phreeli users can also pay their bills (or rather, prepay them, since Phreeli has no way to track down anonymous users who owe them money) with tough-to-trace cryptocurrency like Zcash or Monero. Phreeli users can, however, choose to set their own dials for secrecy versus convenience. To get a SIM card, they can give their mailing address—which Merrill says Phreeli will promptly delete after the SIM ships—or they can download the digital equivalent known as an eSIM, even, if they choose, from a site Phreeli will host on the Tor anonymity network. Phreeli's “armadillo” analogy—the animal also serves as the mascot in its logo—is meant to capture this sliding scale of privacy that Phreeli offers its users: Armadillos always have a layer of armor, but they can choose whether to expose their vulnerable underbelly or curl into a fully protected ball. Even if users choose the less paranoid side of that spectrum of options, Merrill argues, his company will still be significantly less surveillance-friendly than existing phone companies, which have long represented one of the weakest links in the tech world's privacy protections. All major US cellular carriers comply, for instance, with law enforcement surveillance orders like “tower dumps” that hand over data to the government on every phone that connected to a particular cell tower during a certain time. They've also happily, repeatedly handed over your data to corporate interests: Last year the Federal Communications Commission fined AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile nearly $200 million for selling users' personal information, including their locations, to data brokers. (AT&T's fine was later overturned by an appeals court ruling intended to limit the FCC's enforcement powers.) Many data brokers in turn sell the information to federal agencies, including ICE and other parts of the DHS, offering an all-too-easy end run around restrictions on those agencies' domestic spying. That's the promise we're going to massively overdeliver on,” says Merrill. “I don't think there's any way we can mess that up.” Merrill's not-entirely-voluntary decision to spend the last 20-plus years as a privacy diehard began with three pages of paper that arrived at his office on a February day in New York in 2004. An FBI agent knocked on the door of his small internet service provider firm called Calyx, headquartered in a warehouse space a block from the Holland Tunnel in Manhattan. When Merrill answered, he found an older man with parted white hair, dressed in a trench coat like a comic book G-man, who handed him an envelope. The first and second paragraphs told him he was hereby ordered to hand over virtually all information he possessed for one of his customers, identified by their email address, explaining that this demand was authorized by a law he'd later learn was part of the Patriot Act. Then the agent departed without answering any of Merrill's questions. He had in fact been handed a so-called National Security Letter, or NSL, a rarely seen and highly controversial tool of the Bush administration that allowed the FBI to demand information without a warrant, so long as it was related to “national security.” If he were, Merrill thought, why not just get a warrant? The bureau, he told Merrill, had then retaliated by putting him on the no-fly list and pressuring employers not to hire him. “I wish I could say that we reassured him with our expertise on the NSL statute, but that's not how it went down,” Jaffer says. Merrill, meanwhile, knew that every lawyer he showed the letter to might represent another count in his impending prosecution. “I kind of assumed someone could just come to my place that night, throw a hood over my head, and drag me away.” Phreeli will use a novel encryption system called Double-Blind Armadillo—based on cutting edge crypto protocols known as zero-knowledge proofs—to pull of tricks like accepting credit card payments from customers without keeping any record that ties that payment information to their particular phone. Despite his fears, Merrill never complied with the FBI's letter. That fight would last 11 years and entirely commandeer his life. “This was a time when so many people in his position were essentially cowering under their desks. But he felt an obligation as a citizen to speak out about surveillance powers that he thought had gone too far,” says Jaffer, who represented Merrill for the first six years of that courtroom war. “I felt too much weight on my shoulders,” he says. Instead, the Patriot Act itself was amended to reign in NSLs' unconstitutional powers. In the meantime, those years of endless bureaucratic legal struggles had left Merrill disillusioned with judicial or even legislative action as a way to protect privacy. “The third way to fight surveillance is with technology,” he says. So, just after Merrill won the legal right to go public with his NSL battle in 2010, he founded the Calyx Institute, a nonprofit that shared a name with his old ISP but was instead focused on building free privacy tools and services. The privacy-focused version of Google's Android OS it would develop, designed to strip out data-tracking tools and use Signal by default for calls and texts, would eventually have close to 100,000 users. It ran servers for anonymous, encrypted instant messaging over the chat protocol XMPP with around 300,000 users. The institute also offered a VPN service and ran servers that comprised part of the volunteer-based Tor anonymity network, tools that Merrill estimates were used by millions. As he became a cause célèbre and then a standout activist in the digital privacy world over those years, Merrill says he started to become aware of the growing problem of untrustworthy cellular providers in an increasingly phone-dependent world. He'd sometimes come across anti-surveillance hard-liners determined to avoid giving any personal information to cellular carriers, who bought SIM cards with cash and signed up for prepaid plans with false names. Some even avoided cell service altogether, using phones they connected only to Wi-Fi. “Eventually those people never got invites to any parties,” Merrill says. So why not a phone company that only collects minimal personal information—or none—from its normal, non-extremist customers? Only last year, he finally raised $5 million, mostly from one angel investor. The Z in Zcash stands for “zero-knowledge proofs,” a relatively new form of crypto system that has allowed Zcash's users to prove things (like who has paid whom) while keeping all information (like their identities, or even the amount of payments) fully encrypted. For Phreeli, Wilcox suggested a related but slightly different system: so-called “zero-knowledge access passes.” Wilcox compares the system to people showing their driver's license at the door of a club. The magical properties of zero knowledge proofs, he says, would allow you to generate an unforgeable crypto credential that proves you're over 21 and then show that to the doorman without revealing your name, address, or even your age. The result, Merrill says, will be a user experience for most customers that's not very different from their existing phone carrier, but with a radically different level of data collection. As for Wilcox, he's long been one of that small group of privacy zealots who buys his SIM cards in cash with a fake name. “I don't know of anybody who's ever offered this credibly before,” says Wilcox. Even so, enough tech companies have pitched privacy as a feature for their commercial product that jaded consumers may not buy into a for-profit telecom like Phreeli purporting to offer anonymity. But the EFF's Cohn says that Merrill's track record shows he's not just using the fight against surveillance as a marketing gimmick to sell something. But there's little doubt that some of the company's customers will use its privacy protections for crime—just as with every surveillance-resistant tool, from Signal to Tor to briefcases of cash. Phreeli won't, at least, offer a platform for spammers and robocallers, Merrill says. Even without knowing users' identities, he says the company will block that kind of bad behavior by limiting how many calls and texts users are allowed, and banning users who appear to be gaming the system. “If people think this is going to be a safe haven for abusing the phone network, that's not going to work,” Merrill says. But some customers of his phone company will, to Merrill's regret, do bad things, he says—just as they sometimes used to with pay phones, that anonymous, cash-based phone service that once existed on every block of American cities. “The pendulum has swung so far in favor of total information awareness,” says Merrill, using an intelligence term of the Bush administration whose surveillance order set him on this path 21 years ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington state regulators ordered Seattle-based cryptocurrency company Coinme to stop transmitting money for customers in the state, alleging the startup improperly claimed more than $8 million in customer funds as its own income. The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) announced Monday that it issued a temporary cease-and-desist order and statement of charges against Coinme, which lets people buy crypto with cash at kiosks nationwide and says it runs the largest crypto cash network in the world. DFI said Coinme improperly treated more than $8 million owed to customers on unredeemed crypto “vouchers” as company income. The agency said Coinme did not adequately disclose how and when it would recognize those unredeemed amounts as revenue and failed to turn unclaimed funds over to the state as required under Washington's unclaimed property laws. DFI also alleged that Coinme failed to maintain required financial reserves, filed inaccurate reports, and listed an inactive customer support phone number on vouchers for several months last year. “When our investigations reveal serious violations, we will take appropriate action.” Coinme pushed back on the allegations, calling it an accounting dispute over a discontinued product. “Following professional guidance, we treated unredeemed voucher payments the same way major retailers treat unredeemed gift cards — a widely accepted accounting practice,” Ben Enea, Coinme's chief compliance officer, said in a statement. Under the temporary order, existing Washington customers can still withdraw their assets but no new business is permitted. The company, which raised $10 million in 2021, was licensed by Washington state in April 2014 and soon after launched its first “Bitcoin ATM.” It now operates cryptocurrency kiosks through partnerships with MoneyGram and Coinstar. Coinme said it has requested an administrative hearing to contest the order.

The company confirmed a delay, citing "product optimizations and enhancements." Asus' ROG Matrix RTX 5090 card has been in the news quite often recently, almost universally due to its gigantic size, specs, and corresponding price tag at a clean $4,000. It's not a good day for Asus' halo graphics card, though, as a report has come in that the company is temporarily halting all sales of the Matrix 5090 due to a manufacturing quality issue. The information provided by Asus offers no details on what the issue is, but it's worth keeping in mind that it might be serious enough to block the sale of a $4,000 card. Additionally, Asus is apparently outright replacing the cards, so it's unlikely that the problem is something cosmetic like mistakenly-stamped PCBs. There's also no estimated date for delivery of the fixed cards, at least as far as Inet.se knows, though all of them remain sold out. It's not likely that buyers will have to wait a long time, considering how much of an egg-in-face moment this is for Asus. Nevertheless, standing by one's product is a good thing, and a buyer shelling out $4,000 for one of these will rightfully demand absolute perfection. The statement provided by Inet.se to its customers reads as follows: "I am contacting you regarding your order for the ASUS GeForce RTX 5090 32GB ROG Matrix Platinum 30th Anniversary Edition. ASUS is currently working on a replacement version without these issues, but at this time there is no estimated date for when a new copy will be available. It's hard to imagine what the actual problem might be. German overclocker der8auer remarked during his teardown that the liquid TIM application was sub-par for such an expensive card, as Asus didn't place an actual solid barrier holding the liquid metal in place, and instead opted for a ring made of thermal paste. Having said that, he tested the card without issues, and there have not been any reports of problems from other reviewers. Back in February, a user had a blown capacitor on his Astral 5090 take out both the card and his motherboard. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

My brother was visibly nervous at the thought of flying the buzzing, expensive, 360-degree drone hovering in front of him—especially once I told him my drone kit sent to me for review cost $2,000. (There are cheaper bundles, but I'll talk about pricing later.) His movements were slowed by winter cold as he took off his glove and gripped the Antigravity A1's single-hand controller. I gave him a short rundown of how to fly, what buttons to hit, and slipped the A1's bug-eyed headset over his eyes. He couldn't see his own hands while his view was filled with a global, 360-degree image streaming from the drone. Despite his initial fumbling, in mere minutes, he was flying at top speed, abandoning all pretenses and enjoying what is likely the most unique drone we've seen in years. “This is way easier than I thought it would be.” Professionals may get more or less use out of it depending on what they want. What I'm talking about is a drone that's odd in every possible way. You don't have to use any buttons to control the A1 (there are a few physical toggles for turning and elevation), but flying requires pointing in a direction, pulling the trigger, and letting the drone follow your lead. You don't so much capture one image through the drone's sensor but everything surrounding the cameras thanks to its 360 lenses. Despite that, 2025 is an awkward time for stateside drone operators, as the most popular drone maker, DJI, is on the edge of being yanked out of the U.S. market entirely come Dec. 23. If you've never taken to the air with a zippy, unmanned aircraft system, the skies are still a wonder to navigate. Not only is the A1 an incredibly accessible flyer that will inevitably upset traditional drone pilots, but it's also a whole new category for drones with its 360-degree cameras. It starts at $1,600 for the standard bundle, which includes the drone, headset, controller, and a single battery for flying. Opting for the $1,900 Explorer bundle will get you a case to hold all your various drone parts plus an extra three batteries and a charging hub. Antigravity also has a set of propeller guards and replacement drone lenses for sale. Either way, the A1 will demand an investment in time, money, and all your wayward charging cables. I first got hands-on time with an early version of the drone back in August, and yet the company has made huge strides in controls, menus, and usability in the short time since then. To call this a first-gen product would be ignoring just how much batshit engineering has gone into this amalgamation of AR (augmented reality) headset and drone. The Vision Goggles is relatively light, but it comes with a snug fit. It has two knobs at the bottom to set the PPD, or pixels per degree, which each user will need to twist to fine-tune how clear the screen UI will appear. Inside, it uses two pancake lenses with 1-inch micro OLED displays, each at a 2,560 x 2,560 resolution. It's a combination of Meta Quest 3-like optics with updated visuals pushing it closer to an Apple Vision Pro or Samsung Galaxy XR. The drone stitches the images from the two lenses, and you won't ever see any drone parts in your view, save for rare scenes when taking off or touching down. We flew the drone well over 500 yards away on a clear day in Calvert Vaux Park in lower Brooklyn, and we didn't experience any lag or streaming disruptions. Antigravity says its low-latency OmniLink 360 transmission system is the secret to clear video, and in my own tests that proved mostly true. However, that doesn't mean you'll always have such clear visuals in areas with more interference. The A1 routinely warned there was some kind of magnetic disruption in the area, even though we stood in an empty field for more than two hours. It gave me the same warning at home and in Gizmodo's office, so I'm not quite sure what it was detecting. That round exterior screen will show any users looking at your face what you're currently seeing. Plus, when you flip up both the antennas, you'll look like the classic Japanese bug-faced superhero Kamen Rider. Still, if you were looking for a fun device, there are few things more entertaining than an evil eye that shows onlookers what your drone is currently spying on. The entire concept behind a 360-degree camera is that users don't need to do anything but hit the record button for the sake of capturing all angles of your antics. The one complication is that users then need to manually pick out their best shots in the edit room. When you stick the same technology on a drone, it takes on a whole new life with its own share of considerations. The A1 drone itself isn't that big or heavy. It weighs in at about 249 grams, or about 0.54 pounds with the regular battery, though it's closer to 291 grams, or 0.64 pounds, with the high-capacity battery. That's the scale of most drones and it's light enough you don't need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Its size reminds me first of the DJI Air 3S, which I spent some time with close to a year ago. Sure, that may not sound that big, but consider you also need to have the controller and goggles with you to fly the A1, and you'll be weighed down a little more on any adventures. Once you have your headset on, you'll have nothing but memory to hit any of the necessary controls. The headset takes you through a set of hands-on tutorials for all the various button layouts, but even then I was often stuck taking off it off to see what I was doing. Even if the controller had a better layout, it would still be constrained by the inherent drawback of this drone's design when there are no other control options, either with your phone or a traditional dual-stick controller. However, after I installed everything, pushed through several firmware updates (which became a pain of desperately connecting and reconnecting the drone), registered my drone, and thumbed through all the lengthy tutorials, taking to the skies was a far easier exercise. Holding down the trigger puts the drone into gear, and steering it merely requires pointing in a new direction. This means you can be looking anywhere in the drone's field of view but be flying in a completely different direction. This is why my brother took very little time to understand the drones controls. In addition to regular flying, there are preset flying patterns if you want to do a orbit shot or even set a predrawn flight path. While these features are more important on non-360 camera drones, the fact you have to use the headset and controller to select these options anyway makes them less useful than if there were other control options. Like your typical DJI drone, you can set the A1 to Normal, Cinematic, and Sports flying. With the toggle in “S” mode, the drone can reach a top speed of 35.8 mph, or 16 m/s, though it slows to a crawl of 6.7 mph, or 3 m/s, in “C” mode. In my tests of the pre-production drone back in August, the A1 would slow down every time I attempted a sharp turn. In this new version, I didn't experience any of those same issues. Taking it through a small obstacle course made up of jersey barriers and threading the drone through a small copse of trees didn't require any fine manipulation. At least the A1's object avoidance sensors did a good job at keeping me out of range of trees. It will still struggle to detect thin branches, which may prove a hazard if you plan to shoot in the woods. In the drone's menus, you can also enable an first-person view, or “FPV” mode, that is supposed to offer a more familiar experience to people who have flown other first-person drones. In this mode, you can also enable a “Virtual Cockpit” that will create a badly rendered 3D dragon underneath you. The A1 isn't made to complete any fancy tricks like a barrel roll or somersault. The A1 tries to split the difference between a consumer-level “just for fun” drone and a more professional-minded quadcopter built for people who plan to do some proper filmmaking. It's easily one of the most fun drones you can buy today, one that you can effortlessly share with friends. Insta360's class-leading X5 360-degree camera is still one of the best around despite GoPro and DJI trying to knock it off its throne. If you thought that the Antigravity A1 would simply be an X5 strapped to a drone, it was never going to be that simple. While the number of people who use an 8K TV is infinitesimally small, you actually want to capture 360 footage at such a high resolution. Otherwise, you'll have options for capturing 5.2K footage at up to 60 fps. Both the headset and drone each have a slot for a microSD card, though the drone itself does have an extra 20GB of internal storage just in case. The A1 can accept cards as large as 1TB, which should be enough for all casual and most professional drone flyers. That's a larger aperture than the f/2.0 on the X5, though it won't make too big a difference in terms of depth of field. In my footage, I would see some strange artifacts and occasionally notice close-up objects distort when I finally had the chance to take a gander at the final footage. The drones also include a small menu option to enable a feature for enhanced AI stitching, though that doesn't impact the final footage. That could still pose a problem for any amateur cinematographer. Any visual distortion could lead to messy post-production cleanup work. For an example, watch the family that came to visit me during one of my flights. And if you plan to shoot in low light, the A1 may not be the best one for it. It's essentially the same software as Insta360 Studio, which is to say it's simple enough to use even for a complete amateur. I also played around with some of the transitions, like one that creates a “tiny planet” effect by zooming out through the fisheye lens. I didn't do any post-processing work to make each video look better, but with a mix of 8K and 5.2K footage, you can see the difference in base quality. Any 8K footage will inevitably look better on a 360-degree camera. Antigravity Studio crashed several times as I attempted to export footage. It may be a result of beta software on Windows, so I can't get too riled up about it. However, it does point to a common problem among 360-degree cameras. If you simply want to upload your cool drone shots to TikTok or Instagram, it will inevitably take more effort than a more traditional camera or drone. The Antigravity app supposedly allows users to share their footage right from the drone and complete some easy highlight reels akin to what you can do in the GoPro Quik app. The less expensive standard bundle only comes with three regular flight batteries. The regular batteries are rated for approximately 24 minutes of flight time, while the high-capacity versions will let you go for closer to 40 minutes. I went out into my tests with four high-capacity batteries. Running the drone near-continuously and shooting at 5.2K, I blew through three whole batteries in a little less than two hours. When each battery reaches around 15%, the drone will initiate an automatic return-to-home landing. Still, it was enough for a fun outing with friends, even if it required close to 30 minutes of charging with the included Charging Hub. Antigravity likely wanted to make the hub fit inside the carrying case, which I'll add is a very handy inclusion since you'll need to carry the headset, controller, and drone with you everywhere. Whether the promised 24 minutes of battery life (likely less when recording at 8K) is good enough for you depends on how you plan to use it. The Antigravity A1 is desperate to split the difference between what's merely a fun drone and something any regular flyer will want to have on hand. A DJI Avata 2 Fly More Combo that includes three batteries, a case, controller, and headset, retails anywhere between $1,500 to $1,800 on Amazon depending on how many accessories you want. (Of course, that's before all DJI drones are effectively banned in the U.S.) This drone is not a simple commitment, despite how easy it is to use after you get used to its odd controls. Sure, it could be a toy you take out to impress your friends or family, but the A1 is better as a device you use to explore your environment. You can truly get a sense for the scale of a place through the ability to look everywhere around you. And there's truly nothing else like it that I've personally experienced. Even as a first attempt, the A1 manages to clear that bar, despite some occasional issues with the end footage. So if you're looking for the most unique drone you can get in the U.S. (especially considering DJI has effectively stopped launching drones stateside thanks to Uncle Sam's protectionist policies), you don't have to look further than this one.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It appears that AMD's Ryzen 9000 (codenamed Granite Ridge) series, renowned for delivering some of the best CPU performance out there, currently remains unaffected by rumored price hikes. Two industry sources that wish to remain anonymous, one from one of the largest U.S. distributors, have informed Tom's Hardware that there have been no indications of impending price adjustments for Ryzen processors, and no evidence suggests such changes are imminent, contrary to recent rumors. The computer hardware industry has been under significant scrutiny due to sustained demand for DRAM and NAND, driven by artificial intelligence, which has affected both availability and pricing of consumer hardware components. Following recent price increases for Radeon graphics cards, AMD has been the subject of considerable attention amid rumors of an alleged price increase for Ryzen processors. According to our sources, the manufacturer has not implemented any Ryzen price hikes thus far. Unlike SSDs, graphics cards, or memory, processors are less susceptible to price fluctuations caused by NAND shortages. It is increasingly difficult to find affordable memory in stock, whether for upgrades or building a new system. Therefore, it is reassuring to know that AMD's Ryzen processors, which are excellent for gaming and productivity, should remain available at reasonable prices, at least for now. The current top three best-selling processors at retailers such as Newegg and Amazon are all Ryzen models. It is evident that AMD's Ryzen processors are progressively capturing a larger share of the gaming market, resulting in a challenging situation for Intel. The company's latest Core Ultra 200S (codenamed Arrow Lake) processors are unable to compete with AMD's Ryzen products effectively. AMD would be wise to uphold its existing pricing strategy for Ryzen processors, even if this results in a marginal decrease in profits, given the current uncertain landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI research lab Anthropic's not slowing down in its efforts to snap up enterprise clients. The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic's large language models to Snowflake's platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base. “Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake's co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company's enterprise AI service. “Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It's a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” That same week, Anthropic struck a partnership with IBM to bring some of its LLMs into the latter's software products. Anthropic's enterprise success isn't surprising as the company's models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Journalist Olivia Nuzzi's new book, American Canto, was released Tuesday and has been widely panned, even by Nuzzi's fans in the mainstream press. But if you're tempted to buy the book just to search for the juiciest gossip about national figures, we've got some bad news. Nuzzi doesn't use the actual names of the most controversial figures in the book, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A search for “Kennedy” will get you just one hit: A reference to President John F. Kennedy. But Nuzzi's choice does create some hilarious moments of attempted obfuscation. For example, Nuzzi repeatedly refers to a “South African tech billionaire.” There is indeed more than one of those in the proximity of American politics (Peter Thiel was born in Germany but raised in South Africa and Namibia before moving to the U.S., David Sacks was born in Cape Town), but it quickly becomes clear who Nuzzi is referring to. See if you can guess which South African tech billionaire Nuzzi is talking about when she uses the phrase South African tech billionaire three times in a single paragraph: He moved with certain imprecision and on what appeared a delay. His assertion was echoed by many actors in our age of insincerity. If Nuzzi's description wasn't specific enough for you, maybe the next few lines will help: “The most insane thing is, you sit in a seat and there is no steering wheel nor foot pedals. It takes a while to enjoy just sitting as if you're in your lounge, while driving to your destination,” she said. Not as something that anyone can actually buy, but still, it's a word we've heard before. Donald J. Trump appears dozens of times, even if “South African tech billionaire” is put in brackets right beside Trump's name in a quote for some reason. After the existence of that relationship was made public, she was let go from New York magazine and spent the next year writing American Canto. She was also recently hired to be the West Coast editor of Vanity Fair. Another reference to the South African tech billionaire was arguably more scandalous than the others, but it's still easy to figure out who she's talking about. He said he had been warned about her by the South African tech billionaire with whom she had reportedly had a drug-fueled sexual encounter while she was married to a different tech billionaire, but by the time he received the call that informed him she was “crazy,” it was too late. That vice presidential candidate was Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Elon Musk denied having an affair with Shanahan while she was still married to Brin in tweets from 2022, though the part about it being a “drug-fueled” encounter wasn't mentioned in the press at the time. The biggest problem with American Canto is that Nuzzi seems to be an unreliable narrator. At one point, she claims that she doesn't care about breaking news and considers it a burden. If that's the case, she chose not only an odd profession but a peculiar way of pursuing that profession. Nuzzi's skill has always been gaining proximity to people who are making news. People aren't reading her work to hear her describe Trump's hair in myriad ways, as she does in the book. They're reading because she has a knack for getting close to people who have real power. And it turns out that this proximity comes with a pretty heavy price tag. If Nuzzi's former fiancé Ryan Lizza is to be believed, Kennedy wasn't the only politician she had an inappropriately personal relationship with. Lizza has been delivering a drip-drip of stories on his personal blog over recent weeks and alleges Nuzzi also became close with former congressman Mark Sanford, a Republican who briefly ran for president in 2020. He was fired from the New Yorker in 2017 over sexual misconduct allegations, according to the New York Times. And Lizza is clearly trying to milk his association with Nuzzi for all it's worth. He ended “Part 3” of his serialized narrative by teasing the idea that he had special knowledge of something that had happened during the assassination attempt on President Trump in the summer of 2024. Readers would learn in Part 4 that whatever scandalous thing had been said about the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, was lost to history because some audio tape had been destroyed. That cheap stunt alone should make anyone skeptical of the claims Lizza is now pumping out. So go ahead and grab a copy of American Canto if you're really that interested.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RTX 50 series users can now gain access to GPU-accelerated PhysX effects in supported titles. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nvidia has taken a U-turn as it is bringing back support for 32-bit GPU-accelerated PhysX games on RTX 50 series GPUs, after it silently discontinued the tech earlier this year in February. In a recent press announcement for the latest GeForce Game Ready drivers, the company has confirmed that it is adding custom support for top-played PhysX-accelerated games, offering full performance on the latest RTX 50 series GPUs, in line with existing support on previous generation GPUs. PhysX is one of Nvidia's oldest technologies, originating in 2004 when the company acquired Ageia. By the late 2010s, PhysX adoption slowed significantly as more flexible, cross-platform physics solutions emerged. One of the biggest limitations was its reliance on CUDA, which tied it exclusively to Nvidia GPUs and restricted it from competing hardware, consoles, and mobile devices. Nvidia also gradually dropped support for certain features, leading some developers, such as Warframe's team in 2018, to move to custom frameworks built on or inspired by PhysX. The latest Game Ready driver update also brings game optimizations for the upcoming Winter Offensive update on Battlefield 6 ahead of its December 9th release. Nvidia says that gamers can expect average frame rates to increase by 3.8 times, enabling up to 460 frames per second on desktops, and 310 frames per second on RTX 50 series laptops at 4K ultra settings with DLSS 4, Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution enabled. Alternatively, you can download and use the Nvidia app, which can automatically detect your hardware and install the latest driver for you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Notably, this move doesn't affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won't be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API. “As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. “This is why we are investigating if Meta's new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said. If Meta is found guilty of breaching EU's antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company. WhatsApp, for its part, called the EU's claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies' chatbots. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.” You can contact or verify outreach from Ram by emailing ram.iyer@techcrunch.com.

Intel has decided to retain its networking and communications (NEX) unit rather than proceed with a sale after completing an internal evaluation of strategic options for the division. The move reverses earlier consideration of spinning out or selling the business, as the company believes it can extract more money selling actual products or platforms rather than as a business unit. We remain focused on delivering for customers and creating long-term value." Although NEX is certainly less known than Intel's CPUs for client or data center computers, as well as some other products that carry the five-letter badge, the unit is one of the crown jewels in Intel's portfolio. In addition to hardware, NEX has a significant software portfolio that runs on this equipment to handle traffic scheduling, security features, and remote administration. When Intel sells a CPU for a PC, it can bundle it with an Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi controller, whereas a data center Xeon processor can be bundled with three Ethernet chips, an IPU, and accompanying software, maximizing Intel's content and earnings per system. Given Intel's woes in client and data center markets, NEX is barely growing, so selling it off could have potentially provided Intel with billions of much-needed cash. However, after Intel secured a financing package that includes $8.9 billion from the U.S. government in exchange for an 8.9% take, plus $2 billion from SoftBank Group and $5 billion from Nvidia, Intel concluded that keeping the NEX unit delivers more value than a transaction at this stage. Intel does not report NEX results separately: in Q1 2025, the company reorganized by integrating NEX into its Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center and AI (DCAI) segments, then updated its reporting structure accordingly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Louisiana Department Of Wildlife And Fisheries (LDWF), typically responsible in part for overseeing wildlife reserves and enforcing local hunting rules, has assisted United States immigration authorities with bringing at least six people into federal custody this year, according to documents WIRED obtained via a public record request. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. According to the documents, LDWF signed a memorandum of agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in May, which gives the wildlife agency the authority to detain people suspected of immigration violations and to transfer them into ICE custody. Since then, at least six men entered ICE custody after coming into contact with or being detained by LDWF officers. The documents also indicate that at least one “joint patrol” took place in a Louisiana wildlife management area in which LDWF agents were accompanied by officers with Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard. As of December 3, exactly 1,205 agencies have partnered with ICE through the 287(g) program. (An additional eight agencies are currently pending approval from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security.) The LDWF is one of just three state wildlife agencies—the others being the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources—that have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, according to public ICE records. CBP did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment. The LDWF answered questions about one particular incident, but did not respond to WIRED's complete request for comment. She also said that the number of men WIRED asked about, seven, constituted “too large a query,” adding, “We'll need you to narrow it down.” Per a LDWF “After Action Report” obtained by WIRED, three men were taken into a federal custody after the agency conducted a joint patrol on August 11 with five US Coast Guard officers and an unknown number of CBP agents in Lake Borgne, which is in Louisiana's sprawling Biloxi Marsh Complex. Despite this, it says that “the federal partners were able to identify and detain 3 subjects for immigration issues,” adding that “all arrestees were transported by Federal agencies to detention centers.” It's unclear why these individuals were singled out, but all three appear to have Hispanic last names. “After this operation, CBP has reason to believe that future patrols will be beneficial and productive,” the report reads. In an August 22 email obtained by WIRED, LDWF regional captain Tim Fox says that CBP wanted to organize future patrols “on a less formal basis.” It's unclear whether a less formal patrol would still produce a paper trail. According to a later LDWF incident report, the agency arrested three additional people in October, all of whom were taken into ICE custody. When asked to show their weapons, they showed the officers a pistol, an AR-15, several magazines, and a few dozen rounds of ammunition. The two men who fired weapons were issued three civil citations, while the one who didn't was issued two. “Due to the unknown immigration status and them possessing firearms, we made contact with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI),” the report reads. A HSI agent reportedly told LDWF that one of the men had a final removal order, one had “pending” immigration proceedings, and one man had legal parole to be in the US. Upon arrival, the report claims, “The ICE Officers made several phone calls and they decided to take custody of all three subjects.” All three men were placed in handcuffs and escorted to the ICE officers' vehicles. It's unclear if any of these men were deported, but based on information in the report, none of them appear to currently be in ICE custody, according to the agency's detainee locator. In response to WIRED's public record request, LDWF also included an incident report filed on October 6. The report describes a man who allegedly littered “roofing shingles, nails and other assorted building materials” near Cypress Lake for which he was issued one civil citation for “gross littering.” It notes that the man didn't speak English, but “was cooperative during this investigation” with the help of a translator. The incident report says that the man had “unverified citizenship,” but it does not specify whether he was taken into ICE custody. “LDWF has no further information regarding Mr. Garcia's current status or location,” the spokesperson said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In fact, dental anxiety has an official name, odontophobia, and it's a real problem, because it keeps people from maintaining their dental hygiene. One dentist is on a mission to ease people's odontophobia by addressing one of the triggers—the terrible sound of dental drills. “Originally, I was doing research on dental materials, but I realized that almost no one—not even dentists—was tackling this sound problem scientifically,” Yamada said in a statement from the Acoustical Society of America. The team used a supercomputer to run large-scale aeroacoustics simulations. Aeroacoustics is the study of sound created by airflow and its influence. “Our research showed that just making the drill quieter isn't enough to make the sound less unpleasant,” Yamada said. “What really matters is improving its sound quality.” Yamada and her colleagues also investigated the psychological effect of the dental drill's sound with children and adults (imagine volunteering to listen to dental drills more than you already have to!). The drill's nightmarish sounds can reach almost 20 kilohertz, and they revealed that younger individuals felt the sound to be louder and more unpleasant than adults. “This indicates that children's fear of dental sounds is not merely psychological but also physiological in nature,” Yamada explained. “Children truly hear these sounds differently, so their fear of dental treatment is a genuine sensory response, not just imagination.” In other words, your children are justified in pretending to be sick on the day of their dentist's visit. They'll have to strike the right balance between performance and safety to get the dental industry on board, because a drill that is simply quieter isn't necessarily an effective one. “Moving forward, we hope to work with dental manufacturers through industry–academia partnerships, progressing toward commercialization after completing the necessary regulatory and durability testing,” Yamada said.

Not only can it repair enamel—something that normal toothpastes can't do—it's sustainable, too. With no antibiotics or modern dentistry, persistent ear and tooth infections were the norm for Viking-era residents of modern day Sweden.</p>
