                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Double-tap controversy: Senior lawmakers are receiving classified briefings from the admiral who Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said ordered a follow-up strike on an alleged Caribbean drug boat. The House Intelligence Committee chair expressed confidence in Hegseth, while a top Democrat described his meeting with military officials as “troubling.” •  Trump stands by Hegseth: President Donald Trump said he'd support releasing video of the second strike and stood by his secretary of defense, as Hegseth faces bipartisan backlash for the strikes and use of the Signal app. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are traveling to the US for ongoing peace talks, a source told CNN. • DC pipe bomber probe: Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a man accused of planting pipe bombs near the RNC and DNC headquarters before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has been federally charged with using an explosive device. The years-long investigation is still ongoing, Bondi said, adding that investigators were still executing search warrants and that more charges could be brought against Cole. She slammed former President Joe Biden's Justice Department for failing to make an arrest sooner, saying that the “cold case languished for four years.” “Let me be clear, there was no new tip, there was no new witness, just good, diligent police work and prosecutorial work,” Bondi said. Nearly a dozen Democratic lawmakers sent letters today to executives from seven companies — including Amazon, Apple and Meta — asking for more information about their donations to President Donald Trump's planned ballroom, including whether they were seeking “favorable treatment from the federal government.” “And while this Department of Justice may not be enforcing any laws against Trump's benefactors, corporations need to know we are watching closely. The chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee issued a fierce defense of the September double-tap strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean, following a briefing with Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Dan Caine. Asked what he saw reviewing video of the second strike, Cotton told reporters, “I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat, loaded with drugs bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight.” Cotton also told reporters Admiral Bradley “was very clear” he was not given an order to “kill them all” or not give quarter. “Admiral Bradley was very clear that he was given no such order, not to give no quarter or to kill them all. He was given an order that, of course, was written down in great detail, as our military always does,” he said. Trump said Wednesday the newly signed compact would include a “permanent ceasefire, the disarmament of non-state forces, provisions for refugees to return to their homes, and justice and accountability for those who have committed illegal atrocities.” A key tenet of the agreement is that it will open up some of the region's critical minerals for the US government and American businesses as well as energy cooperation, a Trump administration official said. Trump also touted bilateral agreements the US is signing with each country to “unlock new opportunities for the United States to access critical minerals.” First lady Melania Trump announced that seven more Ukrainian children allegedly abducted by Russia have been returned to their families, heralding what she has described as “unwavering” dedication to the effort, despite some concerns from advocates. She added, “In close partnership, my representative and I have provided humanitarian support from the United States to enhance the reunification initiative's outcome. My hope is that, ultimately, our collective efforts will lead to broader regional stability.” Remember: Trump announced earlier this year that she was working through direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with backchannel meetings and calls with the Kremlin on the issue, touting the release of eight Ukrainian children in October. Rep. Mike Rogers, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, did not share any information from the briefing and told CNN he was “running late for a meeting.” Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN, “yes,” he's pushing for an additional briefing with the full committee, but Smith did not provide further information, saying he would instead release a statement. Sen. Roger Wicker, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also declined to comment on the briefing, saying “I'm going to withhold comment at this point.” Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley will continue to brief top lawmakers throughout the day. And I think that arguably, you look at the prior administration, I don't think there's any question about that,” he said when asked if it was appropriate for Hegseth to continue to lead the department after the DOD Inspector General found he endangered troops though his actions. He was pressed by CNN if the country would be even safer if someone other than Hegseth, who has been battered by controversy, was in charge, but he didn't directly answer. “The Signalgate issue, I think, everybody's acknowledged was a mistake. “But again, he serves at the pleasure of the president, and I think as I observe what's happening both here at home and around the world, I think our country and our world are safer places because of this administration's leadership.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth risked compromising sensitive military information that could have endangered US troops and jeopardized mission objectives in March when he used Signal to share details about an upcoming operation targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen, the unclassified version of a report by the Pentagon's Inspector General released on Thursday confirms. Specifically, the unclassified Inspector General report concludes that Hegseth violated Department of Defense regulations both by sending the information to a Signal group chat that included other top Trump officials, and a reporter, and using his personal phone to do so, according to the report. On Wednesday, CNN first reported details of the classified version of the IG report, which was sent to Congress Tuesday evening. The unclassified version confirms that Hegesth declined to sit for an in-person interview with the IG as part of its investigation and, in written responses, asserted that the information did not require classification before it was shared, citing his broad authority as Defense Secretary. House Intelligence Chairman Rick Crawford told CNN that he is “confident” in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after receiving a classified briefing from Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley about US military strikes in the Caribbean. “I feel confident and have no further questions of Hegseth,” Crawford told CNN. Crawford said he thought the second strike was justified and that it is his “understanding” that Bradley ordered the second strike. “We shouldn't be surprised when we send folks to do a mission, when they do their mission,” Crawford added. But Himes concluded after reviewing video of the incident that “you have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, were killed by the United States.” “Any American who sees the video that I saw, will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors – bad guys, bad guys, but attacking shipwrecked sailors. Now there's a whole set of contextual items that the admiral explained. “People will someday see this video, and they will see that that video shows, if you don't have the broader context, an attack on shipwrecked sailors,” the congressman said. He said the admiral said there was no “kill them all” order and there was not an order to grant no quarter. Himes said he thinks the video should be released publicly. The US military has killed at least 83 people in strikes that have destroyed 22 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels, beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review due to a classified Justice Department finding. CNN and other outlets have reported that after an initial strike on a boat killed some of the crew and appeared to disable the ship, the military determined there were survivors and ordered at least one additional strike, according to sources. Trump revived a playbook carried out in Afghanistan for his campaign targeting alleged drug boats. The US spent more than a decade carrying out attacks, known as “signature strikes,” based on similar rough intelligence profiles as part of its drone campaign in the Middle East. More than two months after a reported double strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean, lawmakers are set to question a career Navy SEAL with over 30 years of military experience about the attack. A source familiar with Bradley described him as stoic, meticulous, and “very level-headed.” He has largely approached the idea of speaking with Congress positively and with an understanding that this is what the job requires, the source said. The admiral, who now leads US Special Operations Command, had carried out “thousands of strikes over his career,” the source familiar said. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly said he has a “stellar reputation” and said any decision to carry out a follow-on strike is the fault of the culture fostered by Hegseth, as well as President Donald Trump. Read more about the admiral in our full article here. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seize the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine “in any case,” including by military means, according to state media. One of the Kremlin's biggest demands has been for Ukraine to surrender territory in the Donbas region, which has been annexed but not yet conquered by Russia. Ahead of a summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Thursday, Putin gave an interview with India Today, in which he said Russia would “liberate Donbas and Novorossiya in any case — by military or other means,” according to Russian state media TASS. Putin also described his meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, about a plan to end the war on Tuesday as lasting a long time since both parties had to “go through each point of the peace proposals,” according to TASS. Putin said Russia did not agree with some of the points of the US-brokered proposal, but that it was a “difficult task.” He reiterated Russia's demands that Ukraine withdraw its troops from Donbas and “refrain from military action,” according to TASS. Today, the leaders of both countries are set to meet with Trump and then each other. Peace talks are gaining momentum following a lengthy meeting in Moscow on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Those talks were “very useful, constructive, and highly substantive,” but a “compromise option was not found,” Russian foreign policy adviser and Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said. A day later, Trump told reporters: “President Putin had a very good meeting yesterday with Jared Kushner and with Steve Witkoff. I can't tell you, because it does take two to tango.” Zelensky said Wednesday that Umerov and Hnatov will “begin preparations for a meeting with the envoys of President Trump in the United States.” President Donald Trump says a massive show of force from the US around Venezuela is “much beyond” a pressure campaign on his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro, as he weighs next steps after saying strikes on the alleged drug targets in the country would start “soon.” And I think you're going to see it very soon on land,” Trump said yesterday. The US military has amassed roughly 15,000 troops and more than a dozen warships in the region, and Trump has been briefed on a range of options, including targeted strikes on Venezuelan government and military facilities, or potentially a more direct attempt to oust Maduro. The US military has already struck a string of boats that it alleges are carrying drugs, killing 83 people since the first attack in September. That attack is coming under growing scrutiny after a followup strike — or so-called double-tap — was ordered following an initial hit that did not kill everyone on board. And Trump said his administration would release video of the second strike Today, Bradley will face questions from Congress over that strike as bipartisan criticism from lawmakers grows, with particular concerns over its legality.

Fox News Digital spoke with Sandra Awodele, the creator behind COI Traveler, about what Americans should be wary of ahead of their summer travels to Mexico. The State Department renewed its "do not travel" advisory for Venezuela. Without edits, the travel advisory was reissued Wednesday, with the State Department citing a myriad of high risks related to crime, terrorism, detention and poor health infrastructure. "All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately," the advisory says. In 2019, the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Venezuela, closing its embassy. It says it no longer has the ability to provide emergency services or consular assistance to U.S. citizens in the country. The State Department has renewed its "do not travel" warning for Venezuela. Officials state that tourists have a very high risk of being detained if they even accidentally step a few feet over the border. "Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, are common in Venezuela," the advisory reads. "Travelers face [an] increased risk [if] using unregulated taxis from the Maiquetia Simón Bolívar International Airport and using ATMs in the area," it also notes. Dangerous Colombian terrorist groups operate in Venezuela's border areas with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana, the advisory points out. If tourists are detained, the U.S. is generally not informed about the detainee, who will be cut off from any communications and subject to "inhumane" torture, according to the State Department. If tourists are detained, the U.S. is generally not informed about the detainee, who will be cut off from any communications and subject to "inhumane" torture. Officials warn of severe beatings, prolonged restraint in stress positions and waterboarding, according to former detainees and independent human rights organizations. Any American with plans to travel to or from Venezuela should not rely on government assistance and should create a "proof of life" plan prior. "We're knocking out drug boats right now at a level that we haven't seen," President Trump said Wednesday. "Very soon we're going to start doing it on land too." While the Department of Transportation prohibits airlines from providing U.S.-Venezuela flights, Venezuela is full of dramatic landscapes that attract tourists. For example, Canaima National Park in Salto Angel is home to the world's tallest uninterrupted waterfall, and Los Roqyes Archipelago is touted for its white sand and turquoise waters. The renewed advisory comes as President Trump ramps up his campaign against narco-terrorism. "We're knocking out drug boats right now at a level that we haven't seen," Trump said Wednesday. "Very soon we're going to start doing it on land too." He repeated his claim that Venezuela "sent us killers, murderers … drug dealers at the highest level … gang members and people from their mental institutions." Ashley J.

Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right, walks to a meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, in Washington. U.S. Navy Adm. Frank M. Bradley walks to a meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, in Washington. U.S. Navy Adm. Frank M. Bradley, accompanied by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right, walks to a meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — A Navy admiral told lawmakers Thursday that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as Congress scrutinizes an attack that killed two survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters near Venezuela. Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley “was very clear that he was given no such order, to give no quarter or to kill them all. He was given an order that, of course, was written down in great detail,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, as he exited a classified briefing. Cotton defended the attack, but a Democrat who also was briefed said that while there was no “kill them all” order from Hegseth, he was still deeply concerned by video of the second strike. “What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,” Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters. “You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel were killed by the United States.” Bradley was joined at the Capitol by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for sessions that came at a potentially crucial moment in the unfolding congressional investigation into how Hegseth handled the military operation in international waters near Venezuela. Lawmakers want a full accounting of the strikes after The Washington Post reported that Bradley on Sept. 2 ordered an attack on two survivors to comply with Hegseth's directive to “kill everybody.” Legal experts say the attack amounts to a crime if the survivors were targeted, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are demanding accountability. While Republicans, who control the national security committees, have not publicly called for those documents, they have pledged a thorough review. President Donald Trump has stood behind Hegseth as he defends his handling of the attack, but pressure is mounting on the defense secretary. Also on Thursday, the Defense Department's inspector general released a partially redacted report into Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app in March to share sensitive information about a military strike against Yemen's Houthi militants. About a month after the strike, he was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. His military career, spanning more than three decades, was mostly spent serving in the elite Navy SEALs and commanding joint operations. His latest promotion to admiral was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate this year, and Democratic and Republican senators praised his record. “I'm expecting Bradley to tell the truth and shed some light on what actually happened,” said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, adding that he had “great respect for his record.” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., described Bradley as among those who are “rock solid” and “the most extraordinary people that have ever served in the military.” But lawmakers like Tillis have also made it clear they expect a reckoning if it is found that survivors were targeted. “Anybody in the chain of command that was responsible for it, that had vision of it, needs to be held accountable,” he said. Obtaining that information, though, will largely depend on action from Republican lawmakers — a potentially painful prospect for them if it puts them at odds with the president. What remains unclear — and what lawmakers hope to clarify in their briefing with Bradley — was who ordered the strikes and whether Hegseth was involved, one of the people said. Republican lawmakers who are close to Trump have sought to defend Hegseth, standing behind the military campaign against drug cartels that the president deems “narco-terrorists.” “I see nothing wrong with what took place,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., as he argued that the administration was justified in using war powers against drug cartels. For critics of the campaign like Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the pressing questions about the legality of killing survivors are a natural outgrowth of military action that was always on shaky legal ground. He said it was clear that Hegseth is responsible, even if the defense secretary did not explicitly order a second attack. Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Today's meeting: Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are meeting today, the first of two days, and are expected to vote around 2:30 p.m. ET on a major change to the childhood vaccination schedule. Dr. Robert Malone, the ACIP vice chair running Thursday's meeting, called it an “audio/visual harmonization” problem as new voting language couldn't immediately be put up on slides, before calling for a short break to sort things out. “We really need to know what we're voting on,” a voice over the livestream said as the committee, some of whom were joining remotely, took a pause. In response to a social media post from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy that criticized his scheduled participation in ACIP presentations on the childhood vaccine schedule, lawyer Aaron Siri challenged the Louisiana doctor and lawmaker to a debate about vaccines. “Bring your evidence and let's have a long form public debate where we each get 10 minutes to go back and forth on each major vaccine topic,” Siri posted on X. The VICP provides a way for people who have rare but serious side effects from vaccinations to receive compensation from pharmaceutical companies without those manufacturers being found negligent. It has been a target of US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who pledged in July to “fix” it, a move Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco who focuses on vaccine issues, said “serves a broader anti-vaccine agenda.” “It's really important to keep in mind that the US is an outlier in recommending a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine compared to other high-income nations,” said Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, who was recently appointed acting director of the US Food and Drug Administration‘s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and attended the ACIP meeting as an ex officio member. “There are only a couple of other Western nations that still employ birth dose for hepatitis B,” Dr. Robert Malone, vice chair of ACIP said in a video created by the nonprofit MAHA Action and shared on social media. Universal vaccination of infants has been recommended in the US since 1991. For babies born to mothers who test negative for hepatitis B, most wealthy countries reviewed by the CDC still recommend vaccination during infancy. However, experts say countries that have delayed the birth dose for babies born to moms who screen negative have key differences with the US — including universal health care for their citizens — that have informed their policies. Changing US policy to align with countries that have different demographics and needs would be shortsighted and risks eroding decades of progress in eliminating a serious infection that can cause cancer and death, they say. “Countries with at-risk recommendations typically have much smaller populations, often a fraction of the US population, and have health care systems that support constant screening, testing and care coordination,” Dr. Michelle Goveia, who is a former epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC who is now executive director of global medical and scientific affairs at Merck, said in a comment at the meeting. “In contrast, US health systems face significant challenges in identifying people living with hepatitis B, making the diagnosis of maternal infection and subsequent vaccination of newborn systematically more difficult and likely to lead to congenital infections.” According to the CDC analysis, no other country in the world that has had a universal birth dose has ever reverted from a universal to selective recommendation. Studies casting doubt on the need for hepatitis B vaccination and its safety were quoted out of context, and the proposed language for voting on vaccine recommendations “is inappropriate,” Goldman added. He compared the nature of the recommendation that all babies receive a dose at birth with one he might make as a physician for other health decisions, such as whether patients should get a colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer. The evidence shows colonoscopy reduces incidence of cancer,” Goldman told CNN. “You are wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter,” he said. “The best thing you can do is adjourn the meeting and discuss vaccine issues that actually need to be taken up.” In another departure from past practices, the CDC vaccine committee heard a presentation from Dr. Cynthia Nevison, a research associate at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she is an atmospheric scientist. “This is someone with no hepatitis B expertise and a well documented anti-vaccine bias. They could not find an expert to present on this?” wrote Dr. Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California at San Francisco and a vaccine policy expert who was posting about the meeting on social media. In her presentation, Nevison, who introduced herself as a contractor to the CDC, suggested that hepatitis B infections had never been a real threat to infants. “There's very little evidence that horizontal transmission has ever been a significant threat to the average American child, and the risk probably has been overstated,” Nevison said. Instead, she said the decline in cases in this age group “had to be [due to] other measures.” She said other measures that may have been driving down hepatitis B infections, including better screening of blood products used for transfusion, safer dialysis and the adoption of safer sex practices due to the AIDS epidemic. In 1984, the CDC first recommended vaccination of infants born to mothers who tested positive for hepatitis B. Four years later, in 1988, the CDC first recommended hepatitis B screening for all pregnant women. After an acute hepatitis B infection, many adults clear the virus. But acute infection can lead to chronic hepatitis B, which is linked to increased risk of liver cancer, organ failure and cirrhosis, or scarring over the liver. Infants and children who are infected with hepatitis B are more likely to develop chronic disease, including about 90% of infants and 30% of children ages 1 to 5. It is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who's not infected. Certain medical conditions, behaviors and other factors increase an individual's risk of acquiring hepatitis B — including injecting drugs and sexual activity — but anyone can get it. The hepatitis B virus can also be passed easily during childbirth from a pregnant woman to child during either a vaginal delivery or C-section. The latest data from the CDC shows that there were about 2,200 newly reported cases of acute hepatitis B in 2023, but estimates suggest that the actual number of cases was more than six times higher — closer to 14,400. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that WHO estimates that 254 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection, with about 1.2 million new infections each year. There is no treatment for acute hepatitis B, but there are some medications that can be used to treat chronic cases. There is no cure but treatment for chronic hepatitis B can be lifelong. The best way to prevent hepatitis B infection is vaccination. Most people who have hepatitis B were infected as infants or young children when their immune systems were not fully developed. Currently, it is recommended that all infants get vaccinated shortly after birth. Universal vaccination against hepatitis B was first recommended for infants in 1991, and the strategy has been credited with cutting the number of hepatitis B infections in kids from about 18,000 cases a year to an estimated 20 cases a year now. Anti-vaccine activists, including HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have long questioned the necessity and safety of this vaccine, despite decades of evidence supporting it. The virus spreads through bodily fluids — drug use and sex can increase risk. However, many people do not know they are infected. On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy incorrectly claimed that the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine was linked to higher risk for autism and suggested that the recommendation was made to drive profits for pharmaceutical companies. And you can pass through maternal transmission, but every mother that goes to the hospital in this country is tested for it. At the committee's September meeting, CDC scientists reviewed recent studies showing that an estimated 12-16% of pregnant women are not screened for hepatitis B during pregnancy, and fewer than half of infants born to mothers infected with hepatitis B are identified through prenatal screening. Women are typically tested during their first three months of pregnancy. t's possible to miss maternal infections if a woman catches the virus after she's tested for it. Maternal testing also doesn't protect babies from being exposed to other positive family members or caregivers. Infectious disease experts say vaccinating every baby provides a critical safety net to catch those at risk when maternal screening misses. Cassidy, who struggled openly with his pivotal vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary, linked to the meeting's agenda and specifically cited a Friday presentation by Aaron Siri, an attorney Cassidy said “makes his living suing vaccine manufacturers. He is presenting as if an expert on childhood vaccines.” Siri, who's worked closely with Kennedy and served as his personal lawyer during Kennedy's presidential campaign, has handled a number of vaccine-related cases, particularly challenging vaccine requirements. A managing partner at the law firm Siri & Glimstad LLP, Siri is scheduled to open Friday's ACIP meeting with a presentation about the childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule. Since then, a dedicated working group was formed to examine those issues in greater depth. Malone said that he was “not able to disclose the nuance of that work group, but it is quite diverse in membership and represents a full spectrum of opinion regarding hepatitis B vaccination.” He underscored that the primary mission of ACIP is to provide independent advice to the CDC director, and said that his hope was that the committee approach today's meeting “with seriousness, clarity and a willingness to challenge our own prior assumptions as its credibility depends on our commitment to a deliberative, transparent, evidence-based process.” Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O'Neill is serving as acting director of the CDC. He assumed the role after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired Director Dr. Susan Monarez earlier this year. This is the third meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices since HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. — who has long questioned the safety of vaccines while downplaying their benefits — abruptly dismissed all 17 of its sitting members in June. This week, the reconstituted committee lost its chair, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who was appointed to a new role within HHS: chief science officer for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. During the last meeting, Kulldorff broke an important tie vote when the committee deadlocked 6-6 over a proposed recommendation that people should get a prescription from their doctor before they could get a Covid-19 vaccine, a shift that would have made it more complicated for people who wanted the shots to get them. That brings the total number of voting members to 11. Malone was an early researcher of mRNA technology and has suggested that Covid-19 vaccines cause cancer — something regulatory agencies say is not the case. Malone also served as a paid expert witness in an antitrust lawsuit over Merck's measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, testifying that plaintiffs compensated him at a rate of $350 per hour. CDC vaccine advisers selected by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, will vote Thursday on whether to change that recommendation, although the strategy nearly eradicated hepatitis B cases among children. Anticipated votes posted online late Wednesday suggest “individual-based decision-making, in consultation with a health care provider” for a “birth dose” of the hepatitis B vaccine when parents have tested negative for the virus or whose status is unknown. For babies not receiving the birth dose, “it is suggested that the initial dose is administered no earlier than 2 months of age,” it says. VOTE 1: ACIP recommends a birth dose of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin for infants born to women who test HBsAg-positive. ACIP recommends individual-based decision-making, in consultation with a health care provider, for parents deciding whether to give the HBV vaccine birth dose to infants born to women who are HBsAg-negative or whose HBsAg status is unknown. Parents should consult with health care providers and decide when or if their child will begin the HBV vaccine series. For those not receiving the HBV birth dose, it is suggested that the initial dose is administered no earlier than 2 months of age. Footnote: Parents and health care providers should also consider whether there are risks, for example, such as a household member is HBsAg-positive or when there is frequent contact with persons who have emigrated from areas where Hepatitis B is common. VOTE 2: When evaluating the need for subsequent HBV vaccine dose in children, parents should consult with health care providers to determine if a post-vaccination anti-HBs serology testing should be offered prior to subsequent HBV vaccine dose administration. Serology results should determine whether the established protective anti-HBs titer threshold of ≥10 mIU/mL has been achieved. The cost of this testing should be covered by insurance. The members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices were handpicked by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, after he abruptly fired the 17 sitting members earlier this year. The agenda for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting — which runs today and tomorrow — includes a vote about hepatitis B vaccines for newborns, and more discussion on ingredients and timing for vaccines on the childhood schedule.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luigi Mangione appears in court alongside his attorneys Karen Friedman Agnifilo, left, and Marc Agnifilo for an evidence hearing, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — Minutes after police approached Luigi Mangione in a Pennsylvania McDonald's, he told an officer he didn't want to talk, according to video and testimony at a court hearing Thursday for the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Although some video and accounts of police interactions with Mangione emerged earlier in this week's hearing, Thursday's session brought new glimpses of the lead-up to his Dec. 9, 2024, arrest in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Police had been told that a customer at the McDonald's resembled the much-publicized suspect in Thompson's killing, but a pair of officers initially approached Mangione with a low-key tone, saying only that someone had said he looked “suspicious.” Asked for his ID, he gave a phony New Jersey driver's license with a fake name, according to prosecutors. Moments later, after frisking Mangione, Officer Joseph Detwiler stepped away to communicate with dispatchers about the license, leaving rookie Officer Tyler Frye by Mangione's table. What brings you up here from New Jersey,” Frye asked, according to his body-camera video. Asked what the suspect had said, Frye testified Thursday: “It was something along the lines of: He didn't want to talk to me at that time.” Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law officers and items — including a gun and a notebook — they allegedly seized from his backpack. Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years. The hearing, which started Monday and could extend to next week, applies only to the state case. But it is giving the public an extensive preview of some testimony, video, 911 audio and other records relevant to both cases. Police interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he'd been in New York recently and other questions, including: “Why are you nervous?” Officers tried to play it cool and buy time by intimating that they were simply responding to a loitering complaint and chatting about his steak sandwich. Still, they patted Mangione down and pushed his backpack away from him. About 15 minutes in, they warned him that he was being investigated and would be arrested if he repeated what they had determined was a fake name. The video also provided glimpses of officers searching his backpack, a matter that will likely be explored further as the hearing proceeds. Mangione's lawyers argue that his statements shouldn't be allowed as trial evidence because officers started questioning him before reading his rights. They say the items from his backpack should be excluded because police didn't get a warrant before searching it. Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet detailed their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Federal prosecutors have maintained that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there was nothing dangerous inside, and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest. Many criminal cases see disputes over evidence and the complicated legal standards governing police searches and interactions with potential suspects.</p>

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to discuss President Donald Trump's closure of Venezuela airspace amid rising tensions and former President Biden's defense of his Afghanistan withdrawal as national security concerns rise. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif, will not run in Texas and has chosen to remain in the Golden State to run in the newly gerrymandered 48th Congressional District, Fox News has learned. A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that Issa's friends and congressional colleagues asked him to consider running in Texas after Prop. 50 passed in California, but the Republican has decided to fight it out in California and expects to have President Donald Trump's full support. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Issa confirmed his decision to run in California despite his district being significantly reshaped toward a Democratic advantage. "I'm thrilled to set the record straight and here's the truth: Texas House members and residents of that state did ask if I would consider running there following Gavin Newsom's historically corrupt gerrymander," Issa said. "I appreciate the opportunity, but California is my home. Rep.

Issa currently represents California's 48th Congressional District — but the lines of the district will temporarily shift in several future contests because voters passed Proposition 50 last month. During a radio interview on Wednesday's episode of "The Mark Davis Show," Issa indicated that he had considered the possibility of running in Texas's 32nd Congressional District. The lawmaker noted that he was slated to meet with Trump on Wednesday. Issa said during the interview that he needs to go where he can be most useful. Rep.

Day 4 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar

Day 4 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar: Star Birth in the Lobster Nebula. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope recently imaged a region where the radiation and winds from a group of superhot infant stars are blasting and sculpting dense clouds of surrounding dust. This brilliant star cluster, called Pismis 24, lies about 5,500 light-years away, near the core of the Lobster Nebula.

See the full advent calendar here, where a new image will be revealed each day until December 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands announced their withdrawals Thursday from next year's Eurovision Song Contest after organizers decided that Israel will be allowed to compete. Organizers of the pop music spectacle, which draws millions of viewers globally, met earlier Thursday to discuss Israel's participation, amid calls for the country to be excluded over the war in Gaza and threats from some members to boycott. Members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the primary organizer of the event, decided not to hold a vote on Israel's participation but said that “targeted changes” should be introduced to improve neutrality. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was “pleased” with the EBU's decision and thanked all those who “stood up for Israel's right to continue to contribute and compete at Eurovision.” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was “ashamed” of the countries boycotting the contest. The Eurovision meeting was held at the Geneva headquarters of the EBU, a group of public broadcasters from 56 countries, to consider new rules unveiled last month to limit governments and third parties from disproportionately influencing voting. From diplomacy to soccer, Israel is becoming a pariah on the global stage Several nations have expressed concerns over Israel's participation in the competition due to its war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023, cross-border attack into southern Israel. Israel's public broadcaster KAN is reported to have continued with its preparations for the 2026 competition and was expected to present its position on possible disqualification at Thursday's meeting, Reuters reported. If members had not agreed on the new safeguarding changes, a vote on Israel's participation could have been held, the EBU said. “A large majority of Members agreed that there was no need for a further vote on participation and that the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 should proceed as planned, with the additional safeguards in place,” the EBU statement said. He added that they were taking “clear and decisive steps to ensure the contest remains a celebration of music and unity.” Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said its decision not to participate followed “a careful process in which information was gathered from a wide range of stakeholders.” “Avrotros concludes that participation under the current circumstances is incompatible with the public values that are essential to us,” it said. The Eurovision Song Contest, which started in 1956, is a famously eccentric festival in which artists from dozens of countries battle for the annual musical crown. It has sought to put music ahead of politics, but pro-Palestinian demonstrators have protested at the last two contests in Switzerland and Sweden. The EBU banished Russia from participating following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “Israel belongs in the Eurovision Song Contest,” German Minister of State for Culture Wolfram Weimer previously told Reuters. Arriving for talks Thursday, Nicolau Santos, president of Portuguese broadcaster RTP, told Reuters: “Yes, we will have a very, I suppose, interesting discussion (on Israel's participation). “The slogan is ‘United by Music,'” he added. Last week, Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meini-Reisinger reiterated the contest's long-standing claim to be a space of political neutrality.

In the past week, Trump has said he wants to permanently pause immigration from poor countries and he has singled out Afghans and Somalis for particular contempt. The Republican president is also overseeing the signing a peace agreement between Rwanda and Congo on Thursday at an event with leaders from a host of foreign countries and he is expected to be honored for his peacemaking efforts by FIFA, international soccer's governing body, during the World Cup draw. “Right there at the most fundamental level, you have a president who represents everything that the World Cup does not stand for,” Van Hollen said. But Andrew Giuliani, the executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told foreign reporters Wednesday that “there is a fictional narrative out there that the president is not welcoming to foreigners to come into the United States” and he dismissed concerns about Trump's rhetoric. “He's a New Yorker like me; sometimes we say things that are a little different than polished politicians say,” Giuliani said. Trump's administration is preparing to expand a travel ban enacted in June. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday that she plans to recommend a “full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.” The ban bars entry to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries, and there are heightened restrictions for visitors from seven others. The ban includes exceptions for World Cup athletes, coaches, “persons performing a necessary support role” and their immediate relatives. Fans, a major source of tourism revenue for any World Cup event, from those banned nations cannot enter. Iran has said it will boycott the draw at the Kennedy Center after visas were denied to key members of its delegation. But its soccer federation says the coach, Amir Ghalenoei, will be there with one or two staff members to ensure Iran's seat is not left vacant. Federation spokesman Amir-Mahdi Alavi told YJC.ir, a news agency affiliated with Iran's state TV, on Wednesday that Ghalenoei's attendance was purely technical and did not amount to walking back the federation's protest. The visa denials came despite assurances earlier this year by Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president who has close ties to Trump and is a frequent White House visitor. In October, he told reporters at a European Football Clubs assembly in Rome that “there will be no issues with regard to visas obviously for the participating teams and delegations and so on. And we are working on something for fans, hopefully some good news will come out very soon.” Rep. Darin LaHood, who has participated in multiple FIFA task force meetings at the White House this year and is one of Capitol Hill's most avid soccer fans, pointed to shortened visa wait times as proof of the administration “wanting to make this work and wanting people to come here.” “I think sports and the World Cup transcends politics,” said LaHood R-Ill. He said FIFA will be part of a new public relations campaign featuring soccer legends emphasizing the welcoming nature of the United States. “I think you'll start to see that after the draw and things are set.” The State Department has deployed more than 400 additional consular officers to handle global visa demand, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that in about 80% of the world, travelers to the U.S. can get a visa appointment within 60 days. A new system, “FIFA Pass,” allows those who have purchased World Cup tickets through FIFA to get expedited visa appointments. Yet there have been very visceral reminders of how the administration's immigration crackdown could interfere with World Cup events. Asked on Wednesday about the possibility of immigration raids at World Cup matches, Giuliani told reporters that Trump “does not rule out anything that will help make American citizens safer.” “But the show doesn't go on without the fans being able to come and cheer their team on in person.”</p>

Virginia (2002), the Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional to execute offenders with an intellectual disability. Next Wednesday, however, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a new case, Hamm v. Smith, which tests whether the Court's current Republican majority wishes to retain this limit on capital punishment. The most likely outcome in Hamm is probably a decision giving states more leeway to execute people with marginal claims that they are intellectually disabled — “borderline” cases where clinicians might disagree on whether the offender should be diagnosed with an intellectual disability. But at least some members of the Court have signalled that they would like to go much further. In Bucklew v. Precythe (2019), five Republican justices seemed to endorse a radical reshaping of the Court's approach to the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments.” For about six decades, the Court has held that this amendment “must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Thus, as a particular punitive practice became less common and less accepted within modern American society, it stood on increasingly dubious constitutional ground. In Bucklew, however, Justice Neil Gorsuch's majority opinion ignored this “evolving standards of decency” framework, instead suggesting that courts must ask whether a particular punishment had fallen out of favor “by the time of the founding.” While that distinction might seem esoteric, the implications are breathtaking. Among other things, this historical approach would likely lead the Court to overrule past decisions holding that the Constitution forbids excessive punishments for relatively minor crimes. It also doesn't help that the death row inmate at the heart of Hamm's claim that he is intellectually disabled is genuinely marginal. Joseph Clifton Smith was sentenced to death for a 1997 robbery and murder. Courts hearing Atkins claims are supposed to apply the clinical definition of intellectual disability, and one of three factors that clinicians look at when diagnosing an intellectually disabled patient is their IQ score. Broadly speaking, clinicians look for an IQ of 70 or below when diagnosing such a disability. Under current law, the fact that Smith has never scored below 70 on an IQ test is not fatal to his claim that he has an intellectual disability. A recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders warns that someone “whose IQ score is somewhat above 65–75 may nevertheless have such substantial adaptive behavior problems…that the person's actual functioning is clinically comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score.” Thus, despite Smith's IQ scores, the lower federal courts that heard Hamm determined that Smith is intellectually disabled based on his “significant deficits in social/interpersonal skills, self-direction, independent home living, and functional academics.” But Hall was also a 5-4 decision, and the majority included retired Justice Anthony Kennedy and the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom were replaced by Trump appointees. It's also safe to say that Smith's Atkins claim is far from a slam dunk. The tools that clinicians use to diagnose mental disorders are often imprecise, in part because they do not need to operate with mathematical precision. The actual differences between a child who has an IQ of 69 and a child with an IQ of 71 are quite small, and both children may be given nearly identical education plans while they are still in school — regardless of whether each is diagnosed with an intellectual disability. But, because Atkins sets up a rigid binary between people who are intellectually disabled (and thus cannot be executed) and people who are not (and thus can be executed), Smith's life depends on very small distinctions. To some extent, Hamm turns on a real tension within the Court's current decisions applying Atkins. On the one hand, while Atkins did hold that executing intellectually disabled offenders is unconstitutional, it gave the governments in states where the death penalty is still legal a fair amount of leeway in how they implement this holding. More recent decisions, however, insist that states must follow clinical standards when determining which offenders are intellectually disabled. These rulings also warn that states must not be given too much control over this determination. “If the States were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished,” Hall warned, then “the Court's decision in Atkins could become a nullity.” Before Gorsuch joined the Court in 2017, the Court's internal fights over Atkins frequently turned on this tension between deferring to states and ensuring that death penalty states use clinically rigorous standards. He argued that courts should look at “laws enacted by state legislatures” in death penalty states to determine whether states may use a particular method to determine if someone is intellectually disabled. Under Alito's approach, each state should be allowed to decide how it determines who is intellectually disabled, unless a state uses a highly unusual method that is rejected by nearly every other state where the death penalty is legal. Yet, while Alito's approach would likely enable states to undermine Atkins, Alito at least attempts to fit his preferred rule within the broader “evolving standards of decency” framework that the Court has applied in Eighth Amendment cases since the mid-20th century. Alito's position is that courts should determine what these evolving standards are by looking at how pro-death penalty states actually apply the death penalty. In Bucklew, however, Gorsuch took a much more radical approach. Bucklew asked whether states may use a particular method of lethal injection that can cause inmates to feel a great deal of pain before they die. Though Gorsuch did name some execution methods, such as “disemboweling” or “burning alive” which he does think are unconstitutional, he wrote that these methods are not allowed because “by the time of the founding, these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become ‘unusual. '” Thus, the question was not whether a particular punishment is cruel and unusual today, but whether it was considered cruel and unusual nearly 250 years ago. Dissenting in Atkins, for example, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that only “severely or profoundly” intellectually disabled people are protected against execution. Hamm, in other words, does not simply threaten constitutional protections for people with intellectual disabilities. It is unclear whether the Court actually has five votes to bring about such a revolution. Trump is using a tragedy to stop immigration applications from 19 countries. His administration is now openly advancing a worldview built by white nationalists in the 2010s. NRSC v. FEC is likely to give big donors even more influence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) will introduce articles of impeachment against War Secretary Pete Hegseth over the follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean. Thanedar will unveil the articles of impeachment during a press conference on Thursday morning at Union Station. Thanedar said on Monday that Hegseth should be impeached. “Pete Hegseth is utterly incompetent, totally reckless, and a serious threat to US national security. A later comment in response to a Hegseth post about the boat strikes, which was seemingly intended by the secretary to be humorous, said, “Nothing funny about committing war crimes!” President Donald Trump, even as others within the Republican Party express skepticism about Hegseth, has justified the secretary's actions as within a war context. “I think you're going to find that this is war, that these people were killing our people by the millions, actually, if you look over a few years” Trump said. “I think last year we lost close to 300,000 people were killed. Hegseth said Tuesday that he did not “stick around” to see the second strike. “I watched that first strike live,” Hegseth said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. So I didn't stick around for the hour and two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive sight exploitation digitally occurs, so I moved on to my next meeting.” If convicted, the person impeached is removed from office. The Michigan lawmaker introduced articles of impeachment against Trump in April.</p>
