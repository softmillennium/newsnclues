                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Certified nurse-midwives offer this kind of care, but most Americans don't realize it. A new survey by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center reveals 93% of people think midwives only deliver babies and are surprised to learn they can be a trusted partner in all aspects of women's health. Michaela Ward, APRN-CNM, a certified nurse-midwife, Ohio State Wexner Medical Center The Ohio State survey of 1,006 Americans shows only 1 in 5 are aware midwives can provide women's annual gynecology exams. The survey found that while some services, such as pregnancy and birth support and water births were identified correctly as midwife services by over half of adults, other services, like medication management, menopause care and annual women's health exams are known by far fewer. Among those lesser-known services, there are no significant differences by gender, meaning both men and women are equally unaware of the full breadth of women's health services provided by midwives. Survey respondents' knowledge of women's health services provided by midwives: Annual women's health exams including pap smears and STI testing (20%) "If I need to consult with one of our physicians at Ohio State, I can call them right away and discuss the patient's case," said Ward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is invaluable in the medical world. But despite all the good it does, there is room for improvement. One way to enhance the sensitivity of MRI is called dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), where target molecules for imaging are modified so they form clearer images when scanned with an MRI machine. But this technique requires some special crystalline materials mixed with polarizing agents which are difficult to create. Their new method can make DNP targets sufficient to yield far greater clarity when imaged with an MRI machine, with potential benefits in various medical applications. If you're lucky enough to have never visited the inside of an MRI machine before, then you are still probably familiar with them: enormous ring-shaped things which engulf a person and noisily scan them to create detailed 3D images for diagnostic purposes. Since their mainstream introduction to the medical world over four decades ago, MRI machines have allowed clinicians and researchers to use 3D data for various diagnostic and research purposes. But as with every machine, there are constant upgrades proposed to improve some aspect or other, whether it's size, cost, noise, functions or abilities. But as you may have already picked up, this means that typical MRI machines are limited to the detection of samples rich in water. An established way to improve the detail and information content of MRI images is to use chemical targets in the patient or sample. DNP works this way, but requires agents to polarize the target molecules, and that in turn usually requires extremely cold, or cryogenic, temperatures, and high magnetic field conditions. But we demonstrated an easier way to polarize targets. Our work shows that by using specially designed molecules called fullerenes, we can boost polarization rate to 14.2% in a sample of disordered, glasslike material. This level is high enough for biological applications where a threshold of 10% is the minimum desired; otherwise, polarized molecules decay too quickly for their signals to yield useful images." Fullerenes, also known as buckyballs, are 3D geometric lattices of carbon atoms, which have attracted researchers' attention as they can be modified in different ways to create functional materials. In this case, Yanai and his team added certain modifications to fullerenes which prevented their rotations such that they would stay polarized. When placed in a sample, electrons from these fullerenes transfer their spin polarization to the nuclei of nearby atoms, and it's this polarization that translates into stronger signals for the imaging sensors to detect. After polarization, the sample is dissolved, and the fullerene, which could be harmful, is removed before injection into a hypothetical patient," said graduate student Kieta Sakamoto. "Because this method, triplet-DNP, avoids the need for a liquid helium coolant, it can run on much simpler, lower-cost equipment. Our next goal is to develop biocompatible matrices so we can hyperpolarize such medically important molecules. We plan to demonstrate high-sensitivity MRI in animal models first. If those experiments succeed and clinical trials follow, we expect this technology could reach real medical settings in about 10 to 20 years."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Vadim Jucaud's lab at the Terasaki Institute has introduced a new organ-on-a-chip platform that recapitulates age-dependent immune responses, offering a more accurate testing bed for evaluating cancer vaccine performance in older adults, the population most affected by cancer and often overlooked in traditional preclinical testing. Yet, despite its clinical importance, age-related immune decline is seldom incorporated into vaccine development pipelines. Current 2D culture systems are unable to capture these complex age-specific immune responses, thereby limiting their predictive value towards clinical translation. To address this need, Dr. Vadim Jucaud's research team at the Terasaki Institute developed a lymph node paracortex-inspired organ-on-a-chip platform that models key steps in cancer vaccine immune responses, which are characterized by antigen presentation, antigen-specific T cell activation, and downstream tumor-specific cytotoxicity. By comparing immune responses from young and older lymphocytes, the lymph node on-a-chip platform captures functional differences that naturally emerge with age. Notably, these age-dependent differences were detectable only with the lymph node on-a-chip system, underscoring its ability to reveal biologically relevant immune variations that traditional 2D cultures cannot. This work introduces our lymph node on-a-chip platform for cancer vaccine testing. Unlike traditional 2D models, this advanced system replicates age-related immune responses, which is critical because older adults face the highest cancer risk and often have diminished immunity. By accurately modeling these conditions in vitro, our platform enables more reliable insights into cancer vaccine performance, therefore accelerating development and improving outcomes." Dr. Vadim Jucaud, Principal Investigator and Assistant Professor, Terasaki Institute By more accurately reflecting the biology of aging, this novel platform offers a valuable tool for understanding how immunosenescence influences cancer vaccine efficacy.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

What to do if you have a low exam score or a "red flag" on your application for medical school or residency? 

The first and most important thing that you can do is to be honest and upfront about this. You want to explain what actually happened and give a little bit more background to have them understand why that exam score might be lower than you had hoped. 

The second most important thing that you can do is to show reflection and growth. I want you to not only explain what happened, but also how you reflected on the experience and now are growing and going to be a better doctor for it. 

Bringing it full circle is the best way that you can explain a red flag on your interview.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Edith Cowan University (ECU) have developed a new tool to evaluate fear avoidance behavior following a concussion. The tool, aptly named the Fear Avoidance after Concussion Tool (FACT), consists of a questionnaire that can be completed within five minutes, under the supervision of a health care provider. ECU Masters by Research student Mr Liam Sherwood noted that if fear avoidant behaviour could be recognised early, following a concussion, it could enable targeted management for individuals who are at risk of persisting post-concussion symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating, low moods, headaches and sleep disorders. Mr Sherwood noted that early support and education can make a significant difference for people experiencing persisting post-concussion symptoms. These approaches focus on helping individuals understand their condition and build confidence in managing it themselves, reducing the impact that fear avoidance can have on their recovery. ECU Senior Research Fellow Dr Myles Murphy said existing tools used to assess fear avoidance after a concussion were originally designed for other types of injuries, meaning many of the questions asked of patients weren't relevant to their experience. All of these perspectives, as well as those from expert healthcare professionals, were used to design something that not only makes sense to the patient, but is also relevant to their injury and recovery." Mr Sherwood noted that the questionnaire consists of 28 items, taking around five minutes to complete. The short nature of the questionnaire allows clinicians to use FACT during their consultation period, without concern that it would take up too much time. Work is now being done to use the FACT in larger, clinical populations before we can start the work on implementing this tool into clinical practice."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Overreliance on generative AI risks eroding new and future doctors' critical thinking skills, while potentially reinforcing existing data bias and inequity, warns an editorial published in the online journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine. GenAI tools are already being widely used amid few institutional policies and regulatory guidance, point out the authors, who urge medical educators to exercise vigilance and adjust curricula and training to mitigate the technology's pitfalls. The use of AI is now used in a vast array of different tasks, but along with its burgeoning potential comes an increasing risk of overreliance on it and a host of potential issues for medical students and trainee doctors, note the authors from the University of Missouri, Columbia, USA. ● automation bias-uncritical trust of automated information after extended use ● Deskilling-blunting skills, which is especially important for medical students and newly qualified doctors who are learning the skill in the first place and who lack the experience to probe AI's advice Critical skills assessments that exclude AI need to be designed, using supervised stations or in-person examinations-especially important, for bedside communication, physical examination, teamwork, and professional judgement-suggest the authors. And trainees also need to know how to evaluate their intended performance and potential biases over time, they emphasize. "Enhanced critical thinking teaching is especially needed, which can be achieved by building cases where the AI outputs are a mix of correct and intentionally flawed responses…. Learners would then accept, amend, or reject, and justify their decision with primary evidence- based sources," suggest the authors. Regulators, professional societies, and educational associations around the globe also need to play their part, by producing and regularly updating guidance on the impact of AI on medical education, urge the authors. They conclude: "Generative AI has documented and well-researched benefits, but it is not without pitfalls, particularly to medical education and novice learners.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers engineered an injectable silica-based scaffold that trains the immune system to attack S. aureus on medical implants, cutting bacterial load dramatically and even clearing infection entirely in some animals. Study: Scaffold vaccination for prevention of orthopedic device infection. In a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers investigated whether scaffold vaccination can mitigate or prevent infections associated with orthopedic devices. Staphylococcus aureus is the leading global cause of bacterial mortality, responsible for over a million deaths every year. Medical implant devices elevate the risk of S. aureus infection, with orthopedic device infection being particularly devastating due to the need for extended antibiotic treatment and revision surgeries. Vaccination could be an attractive strategy for individuals requiring device implantation. However, multiple vaccine trials have failed to prevent S. aureus infection after surgery. The authors previously developed an alternative vaccine platform based on a biodegradable, injectable scaffold of mesoporous silica rods, which contain aligned nanopores for delivering granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to recruit dendritic cells (DCs). Scaffold vaccines with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from Escherichia coli provide mortality benefit upon Enterobacter infection, suggesting PAMPs may induce broad immunity. In the present study, researchers investigated whether scaffold vaccination can prevent or mitigate staphylococcal infections associated with orthopedic devices. Mice received a subcutaneous injection of saline (naïve), scaffold containing chemokine and adjuvant (scaffold no-antigen), bolus vaccine (containing chemokine, antigen, and adjuvant in saline), or scaffold vaccine (containing chemokine, antigen, and adjuvant) on day 0. Spleens from the vaccine scaffold group were nearly three- and two-times as heavy as those from the naïve and scaffold no-antigen groups, respectively. There was a trend towards an increase in the number of cluster of differentiation 11c-positive (CD11c+) cells, typically representing DCs, at the injection site in the scaffold vaccine group. Spleens from the scaffold vaccine group had significantly more CD11c+ cells, a majority of which (>72 %) co-expressed major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), a marker of DC activation. Furthermore, the scaffold vaccine group had significantly higher combined levels of serum cytokines associated with the T helper 1 cell (Th1) phenotype, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-1β, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), compared to the naïve group. IFN-γ expression was measured as a surrogate for antigen-specific Th1-mediated response. Notably, the scaffold vaccine group showed significantly greater IFN-γ expression compared to the bolus vaccine group. Further, vaccinated animals were challenged with S. aureus orthopedic device infection on day 35. Other groups were challenged with 1,000 colony-forming units (CFUs) of S. aureus Xen29. Two weeks later, only the untreated group exhibited persistent weight loss relative to uninfected controls. All infected groups showed higher anti-S. aureus total immunoglobulin G (IgG), with scaffold vaccination resulting in substantially higher anti-S. aureus titers than the scaffold no-antigen, untreated, and uninfected groups. Animals were euthanized on day 49 to harvest implants and collect biofilm-embedded microbes. No bacteria were recovered from the uninfected group. Notably, a subset of scaffold-vaccinated mice exhibited no detectable bacteria on the implant, suggesting potential sterilizing immunity in some cases. In addition, the reduction in bacterial load with scaffold vaccination represented an approximately 2.4-log (roughly 250-fold) decrease relative to untreated controls, indicating a large magnitude of protection. The team investigated whether scaffold vaccination would protect against different strains of S. aureus. Sera from scaffold vaccine recipients had total IgG with significant binding against all tested strains. Further, non-vaccinated mice and scaffold vaccine recipients were challenged with implants inoculated with the MRSA strain, NRS699lux, instead of Xen29. Mice were vaccinated with bolus IsdB, scaffold IsdB, or the PAMPs-based scaffold vaccine and challenged with Xen29 infection. Scaffold vaccination with either PAMPs or IsdB as the antigen was superior to bolus IsdB in reducing bacterial burden. Scaffold vaccination with S. aureus Xen29 PAMPs as the antigen was well tolerated, successfully eliciting Th1-associated immunity and decreasing bacterial burden in mice with orthopedic device infection. Its protective effect was generalizable to another S. aureus strain. Moreover, scaffold vaccination based on a protein antigen alleviated infection. Overall, scaffold vaccination may facilitate more robust immunity in cases where conventional bolus vaccines have been ineffective. Scaffold vaccination for prevention of orthopedic device infection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research team led by the Medical University of Vienna has shown that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in women with gestational diabetes can reduce the risk of a newborn with above-average birth weight. The participants were randomly assigned to either the study group with continuous real-time glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) or the group with intermittent self-monitoring of blood glucose via finger pricks (SMBG) and were cared for according to guideline-compliant treatment standards until delivery. Early diagnosis and consistent treatment can significantly reduce this risk.The evaluation of birth data in the study shows a clear advantage of continuous glucose monitoring: only four percent of women in the rt-CGM group gave birth to an above-average weight child (LGA = Large for Gestational Age), compared to ten percent in the control group. Continuous glucose monitoring via a sensor placed under the skin allows patients to check their blood sugar levels at any time. This enables them to make specific adjustments to their lifestyle or insulin therapy, which can have a positive impact on the course of their pregnancy." Christian Göbl, study leader, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, MedUni Vienna/University Hospital Vienna However, it was noticeable that in both study groups there were more newborns with below-average birth weight (small for gestational age, SGA). This could indicate that very strict sugar management could also influence the risk of insufficient foetal growth - and requires further investigation, according to the researchers.In any case, our results suggest that real-time glucose monitoring systems can improve pregnancy care - especially for women who benefit from more intensive therapy," emphasizes first author Tina Linder (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, MedUni Vienna/University Hospital Vienna).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The risk of sudden cardiac death is higher both for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, according to a large study published in the European Heart Journal today (Thursday). The increase in risk is especially noticeable among younger adults. Sudden cardiac death is when someone dies suddenly and unexpectedly due to a problem with their heart. It is generally rare in young and seemingly healthy individuals. The research also shows that people with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy on average, and that a proportion of this reduction is due to sudden cardiac death. The researchers looked at all 54,028 deaths in the country over that year and used death certificates, hospital discharge summaries and autopsy reports to identify all sudden cardiac deaths. By combining this with records of which people had type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes or neither, the researchers were able to compare rates of sudden cardiac death between the three groups. The difference in risk was greatest in younger adults, with people under 50 who have diabetes having a seven times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. The research also showed that the average life expectancy was 14.2 years shorter for people with type 1 diabetes and 7.9 years shorter for people with type 2 diabetes. Sudden cardiac death was responsible for 3.4 of the years lost in people with type 1 diabetes and 2.7 in people with type 2 diabetes. We found that sudden cardiac death occurs more frequently in people with diabetes across all age groups, and that sudden cardiac death has a substantial impact on the shortened life expectancy in individuals with diabetes. While sudden cardiac death risk increases with age for everyone, the relative difference is most pronounced when comparing younger people with diabetes to their peers in the general population. This is an observational study, meaning that we can see a link between diabetes and sudden cardiac death, but we cannot prove that one causes the other. There are probably several reasons behind this link, and these may differ by age. Having diabetes predisposes people to ischaemic heart disease, which is a key mechanism. In addition, diabetes-specific factors such as hypoglycaemia and cardiac autonomic neuropathy may increase the chances of an irregular heartbeat and sudden cardiac death. A key limitation of this study is that it focuses on deaths in 2010, before widespread use of newer glucose-lowering therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. We therefore cannot assess how these treatments may have influenced sudden cardiac death in more recent years." People who are known to have a very high risk of sudden cardiac death can be fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, so researchers say the next step could be to identify subgroups within the diabetes population who might benefit from preventive strategies, and to study how to lower the risk for people with diabetes. In an accompanying editorial, Dr Hanno Tan from Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands and colleague said: "Despite significant advances in cardiovascular medicine, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a challenge for prevention and treatment due to its unpredictable nature and high fatality rate. "In this issue of the European Heart Journal, Skjelbred et al expand upon these previous studies, furthering our understanding of the relationship between diabetes and SCD. "Of particular interest is the finding that the diabetes-associated risk of SCD was higher among younger individuals than among older individuals. "[…] studies have been initiated to develop systems that may autonomously detect SCA and call the emergency number, e.g., through the use of wearables such as smartwatches. Such solutions may have particular relevance for type 1 diabetes patients, because the proportion of unwitnessed SCA events is higher in these patients than in the general population. Thus, type 1 diabetes patients may derive particular benefit from these solutions. "[…] we may be able to reduce the burden of SCD in diabetes patients with the use of personalized treatment interventions that aim at preventing SCA and/or improving SCA treatment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is an inherited retinal disease leading to severe vision impairment from early infancy, affecting 2-3 out of every 100,000 newborns. LCA is caused by variants in certain genes from which proteins essential for retinal cell function and survival are made. Mutations in over 20 different genes can cause LCA and in each of those genes, hundreds of different changes, known as genetic variants, can occur. Importantly, while some of these genetic variants are benign and do not compromise function, other variants cause dysfunction or complete loss of function. Further, for some of these variants, which are called variants of uncertain significance (VUS), it is currently not known if they are disease causing or benign. The research team of Robyn Jamieson from Children's Medical Research Institute, University of Sydney, Australia have now set up a lab-based testing platform to classify VUS in retinal organoids, which are small 3D structures of retinal cells resembling the human retina. The work was published recently in Stem Cell Reports. The retinal organoids were grown from immature stem cells taken from a LCA patient with known pathogenic variants in the gene RPGRIP1, and from a second patient who carried a VUS in the same gene. Organoids from both patients had distinct abnormalities such as less light-sensing photoreceptors and altered gene expression. Having identified these "biomarkers" of RPGRIP1-related LCA in the retinal organoids, Jamieson's team went one step further and inserted the RPGRIP1 VUS into healthy retinal organoids. Further, by reintroducing a healthy RPGRIP1 gene into the retinal organoids these disease-mediated changes were reversed. This new platform can be used to classify new VUS in RPGRIP1 and other LCA genes, enabling clinical genetic diagnosis. Ultimately, the gained knowledge may help to develop targeted therapies for LCA patients and will inform decision-making and genetic counselling for at-risk populations.
