                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026 The 2025 Formula 1 season reaches its conclusion this weekend in exciting style, with three drivers still in contention to clinch the World Championship – but what do the odds say about who might come out on top in Abu Dhabi? Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet. Lando Norris arrives as the championship leader at the Yas Marina Circuit; however, he struggled in the previous two rounds amid a disqualification in Las Vegas and fourth place in Qatar. Team mate Oscar Piastri, meanwhile, produced his best weekend since Monza last time out. The Australian starts with seven victories in his portfolio this term. He was 104 points adrift of the leader before Monza, but starts this weekend in second place, only 12 points away from Norris. Verstappen is the in-form driver on the grid, boasting nine consecutive podiums between Zandvoort and Lusail with five of those results being victories. Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli continues his impressive run at the backend of the campaign, producing two podiums in three races. He held onto fourth spot until the 56th lap in Qatar, when an error nudged him off track, giving Norris a gap to pass him. The Italian is showing that he can consistently deliver, and offers value for money for a top-three performance. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc also can't be written off at this venue, having stood on the rostrum in his last three visits to the UAE Capital. He's also remarkably consistent, averaging 4.0 in his past 10 appearances. One driver who has also found his rhythm is Carlos Sainz. Alex Albon also remains a contender for a top six, despite last achieving the feat in the Netherlands. He's collected five top-six results across the campaign, better than any of his midfield rivals. Double World Champion Fernando Alonso crossed the line in seventh in the last round, his fourth such result this year. Red Bull number two Yuki Tsunoda starts the weekend ahead of Albon and Alonso in the betting, but he's only cracked the top six once this year and is a better option for a top 10 outing in the final round. Over in the Racing Bulls pen, Isack Hadjar is worth a look, after finishing as one of the first six cars three times this year. From youth to experience, Nico Hulkenberg was unlucky in Qatar, just clipping Pierre Gasly and crashing out. Speaking of Gasly, the Alpine senior drove well all weekend and showed immense promise until the contact with Hulkenberg. He's registered five top-10s this year, but only one in the previous 10 races. Another rookie who has excelled late in the year is Haas' Ollie Bearman, but Qatar didn't go according to plan. He eventually retired from the race, leaving Doha point-less. Bearman's team mate Esteban Ocon struggled at Lusail, but he's been reliable of late, posting a 50% top-10 return in four starts. Verstappen and Piastri desperately need a win if they have a shot of leapfrogging Norris for the title. Norris clocked the fastest time on Saturday last year at this venue and proceeded to win the race, and the papaya driver is tied with Verstappen on seven Pirelli Pole Position awards this year. Elsewhere, Russell has proudly captured two poles this year, but both of them were on street circuits or at the minimum hybrid layouts. Mercedes contributed one to the cause, through Russell in Singapore, but other than that, it's been all Red Bull. The Milton-Keynes garage has taken home five team trophies in the last eight races, all thanks to Verstappen. They are also seeking to end their campaign on a hat-trick. Ferrari have faced a challenging season this year, but we can't ignore their history at this venue, as the squad from Maranello have delivered a podium-performing vehicle since 2021 in Abu Dhabi. Can they finally come right and grab the chequered flag? If Verstappen wants a fifth title, he'll need to seal victory in Abu Dhabi and hope Norris finishes outside of the top three. Norris' team mate, Piastri, has more ground to make up. Prices are correct at the time of publication but can fluctuate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tsunoda 'not fully feeling it yet' after news he will not race for Red Bull in 2026 Having joined forces 12 months ago in Abu Dhabi, the Leclerc brothers will once again be team mates at Ferrari in the weekend's first practice session. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will once again be joined by younger brother Arthur in Free Practice 1 for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, taking the seat of Lewis Hamilton for the one-hour session. Arthur Leclerc will take over Hamilton's SF-25 and fulfil Ferrari's final mandated rookie driver session this year, with Dino Beganovic and Antonio Fuoco having previously driven for the team in FP1 sessions this year. "Charles and I are very happy to be driving again together in FP1. It's very exciting to be in a car on the other side of the garage from him," said Arthur. "From a technical point of view, driving the car on track is always useful for us drivers who mainly support the team with our work in the simulator back in Maranello. "In terms of physical preparation, I've worked mainly on my neck, which is where you most feel the G forces, and I also did a lot of cardio work," he said. "On the technical side, obviously I worked a lot in the simulator to be as well prepared as possible. "My job will be to provide useful feedback on what we are testing and gather as much data as possible to improve the correlation between the performance on track and the results we see in the Maranello simulator."</p>
