The token is selling off with the rest of crypto but holding key support zones as traders wait for signs of stabilization in risk assets. It has lagged Bitcoin on the way up this cycle, giving the tape less euphoria but also less excess to unwind. Against that backdrop, we ran Ethereum through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT. Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform Signal snapshot: MACD turning positive, RSI deeply oversold Still, broader AI price prediction says that Ethereum could reach $28,230.61 by 2030. New users can earn up to $400 in rewards by completing short educational lessons and making their first qualifying trade. MACD has climbed back toward its signal line after a multiweek slide, reflecting early signs of regained momentum.

EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium Analysts note that ETH has traded with less leverage and less speculative excess than BTC this cycle, which can help cushion sharp drawdowns. The model captures oversold conditions alongside a structurally intact fundamental story anchored by L2 growth and steady on-chain usage. For now, ETH could trade in a wide range defined by macro volatility. Any sustained move back toward $3,000 will depend less on crypto-specific catalysts and more on whether global risk appetite finds its footing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TD Cowen analysts lowered their price target for Strategy shares on Wednesday, citing the volatility of the Bitcoin treasury leader's stock price and incremental shareholder dilution as key factors. Strategy's shares recently changed hands around $188, per Yahoo Finance, down about 24% over the last month. Earlier this week, Strategy signaled that it had raised $1.44 billion to maintain a cash reserve. However, the company has issued $7.7 billion worth of preferred shares this year, as its go-to move has become a less effective way to grow its Bitcoin holdings per share. “Shoring up liquidity during times of stress is always prudent, in our view, and we believe all Strategy stakeholders are materially better off,” they wrote. Benchmark Is Bullish on Strategy Even as Stock Plunges Amid Possibility of Selling Bitcoin A lower stock price for Strategy has led to more dilution than the investment bank previously forecast. Along those lines, the analysts said Strategy's heightened volatility warrants a lower earnings multiple, which was reduced to 5x from 9x. TD Cowen's latest estimate for Strategy's stock comes as some firms grow bullish. Earlier this week, investment bank Benchmark raised its 2026 price target to $705, for example. In a note, Benchmark Analyst Mark Palmer argued that Strategy's stock remains “one of the most powerful asymmetric vehicles in global markets” because of its unmatched ability to raise capital and benefit from Bitcoin's potential upside.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sovereign wealth funds were buying the dip in bitcoin BTC$93,325.36, according to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. That state actors have been buyers of bitcoin isn't news — Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company and Luxembourg's sovereign wealth fund are among those that have previously disclosed investments in the spot bitcoin ETFs. That SWFs were adding to positions as bitcoin plunged below the $90,000 level in recent weeks is notable though, as Fink continued: “They're establishing a longer position and then you own it over years ... Fink's remarks reflect a growing shift in how some of the world's largest investors are approaching bitcoin. Fink, who once dismissed bitcoin, has gradually become one of its most prominent institutional advocates. Under his leadership, BlackRock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has drawn billions in assets since its debut in early 2024 has become the asset manager's most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF). At the DealBook event, Fink again emphasized bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against growing government debt and inflation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is ushering in a new form of federally regulated crypto trading, having encouraged its regulated platforms to open up leveraged spot digital assets products, which is set to begin next week with Bitnomial. "Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets," Pham said in a statement. "Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve." Pham said the CFTC is "finally using our decades-long existing authority" to initiate this trading. It's one of several regulated DCMs at the CFTC, also including Coinbase, Kalshi and Polymarket. "Leveraged spot crypto trading is now available under the same regulatory framework as U.S. perpetuals, futures, and options," said Luke Hoersten, Founder and CEO of Bitnomial. Pham has been planning to leave the agency when the new chairman comes in, leaving that person alone in what's meant to be a five-member commission. Among the other initiatives include a push for tokenized collateral that will include stablecoins, which is expected to happen early next year, and a broad rulemaking that inserts blockchain technology into a range of CFTC regulations. One of the gaping holes in U.S. federal regulation of crypto is that bitcoin and other major digital assets are considered commodities, but the CFTC doesn't have broad authority over spot market manipulation. Congress had set out to give the CFTC its spot-market powers in legislation that aims to fully regulate the crypto markets. But Pham had argued that the CFTC already had some limited authority to allow for leveraged activity on its futures exchanges. Regulator That May Rule Over Digital Assets Pushing Toward Crypto Spot Trading UPDATE (December 4, 2025, 16:14 UTC): Adds more detail from the company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins, meanwhile, have spent most of this cycle stuck in a holding pattern—traders facing weeks of frustration, muted price action, and erratic capital rotations. But beneath this apparent calm, something is shifting. While Bitcoin displays parabolic strength, altcoins are quietly coiling for a potential breakout. Fresh technical readings now indicate that the broader altcoin market has slipped into a clear “buy zone,” hinting that accumulation at current levels could be a well-timed opportunity ahead of the next major move. Altcoin trading volumes have dipped below their yearly average, a pattern that has often signalled attractive accumulation phases in previous cycles. While market sentiment remains cautious, this decline in activity suggests traders may be quietly positioning for a broader altcoin recovery as volatility starts to compress. The chart shows a clear pattern: Whenever aggregated 30-day altcoin trading volume falls below the 365-day average, the market enters a cooling phase where traders reduce activity, sentiment turns cautious, and prices become compressed. Top 5 Altcoins to Consider Before a Potential Breakout Once the attention shifts back on altcoins, they are set to begin a strong rally. Historically, once the volume returns to Ethereum, altcoins see major recoveries, and a strong ETH price move triggers an Altseason. The ETH price has held well above key support zones around $3,800 to 4USDT,000, consolidating larger bases while staking and institutional interest increase. With major EMAs flattening and a base forming, Ethereum is poised for a breakout to new highs in the coming days. It has a very strong liquidity compared to the other altcoins and historically displayed faster recoveries after a volume compression. After earlier weakness near $120 to $150, the SOL price has begun stabilising and forming bullish chart patterns. Chainlink often leads to mid-cap breakouts in bullish cycles. It always shows relatively strong strength even during market corrections. LINK has shown strength in Oracle and data infrastructure demand, though somewhat muted compared to L1 tokens. Avalanche is positioned well for institutional adoption with subnet expansions and real-world asset integrations. This crypto is known for strong fundamentals, and after Polygon 2.0, the ecosystem has revamped aggressively. Altcoin volumes dipping below their yearly average have historically signalled the start of an accumulation phase, not the end of a cycle. If the broader bullish structure remains intact—and many indicators still suggest it does—this period may present one of the cycle's more strategic windows to accumulate high-conviction altcoins. While breakouts may not happen immediately, volume trends suggest the setup is building. For investors positioning for 2025, selective DCA into strong assets like ETH, SOL, LINK, AVAX, and MATIC could offer compelling long-term opportunities.

Valour will offer locally listed exposure through existing Brazilian brokerage and custody rails as part of its international expansion beyond Europe, where it already lists ~100 ETPs. Following this news, DEFT has declined 4.74%, reflecting a moderate negative market reaction. Our momentum scanner has triggered 3 alerts so far, indicating moderate trading interest and price volatility. This price movement has removed approximately $25M from the company's valuation. TORONTO, Dec. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - DeFi Technologies Inc. (the "Company" or "DeFi Technologies") (Nasdaq: DEFT) (CBOE CA: DEFI) (GR: R9B), a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance  ("DeFi"), is pleased to announce that its subsidiary, Valour Inc., and Valour Digital Securities Limited (together, "Valour"), a leading issuer of exchange traded products ("ETPs") has received approval from B3 S.A. – Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão ("B3") to list four digital asset exchange traded products ("ETPs") via BDR on ETP. The products will provide Brazilian investors with locally listed, BRL-denominated exposure to Valour's leading digital asset ETPs via the same brokerage and custody rails they already use for equities and ETFs. Valour currently offers approximately 100 digital asset ETPs across Europe and continues to operate the largest selection of digital asset ETPs globally, listed on major venues including Spotlight Stock Market (Sweden), Börse Frankfurt (Germany), SIX Swiss Exchange (Switzerland), London Stock Exchange (England) and Euronext (Paris and Amsterdam). This provides diversified digital asset exposure within regulated, exchange-traded market rails. The approval to list BTCV, ETHV, XRPV and VSUI on B3 via BDR on ETP represents a key step in Valour's international expansion strategy, which includes Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and other developing regions globally. Brazil marks Valour's first major foothold outside of Europe, with B3 serving as a regional hub for equities, ETFs and an increasingly broad suite of digital asset-linked products and derivatives. According to Chainalysis' 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index, Brazil now ranks 5th worldwide, reflecting rapid growth in both retail and institutional usage. This surge in activity is taking place under a maturing regulatory framework. 14,478/2022) and subsequent decrees have formally recognised crypto assets, appointed the Central Bank of Brazil as the primary regulator of virtual asset service providers, and introduced new rules in 2025 that extend financial-sector standards and AML/CTF requirements to crypto intermediaries. Against this backdrop, Valour's regulated, exchange-traded BDR on ETPs on B3 aim to provide Brazilian institutions with institutional-grade access to digital assets, combining transparent on-exchange pricing, local settlement and familiar governance standards. We believe Brazilian institutional and retail investors want regulated, exchange-traded access to digital assets, and our ETP platform is designed precisely to meet that need." "Across Europe, Valour has built the world's largest shelf of digital asset ETPs, and we see similar demand patterns beginning to emerge in Brazil," said Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour. "By providing local listings of our core ETPs, we offer Brazilian investors product exposure which over time, we expect to grow to support additional Brazilian listings, structured products, and solutions tailored to the region's rapidly developing investment market." As the first Nasdaq-listed digital asset manager of its kind, DeFi Technologies offers equity investors diversified exposure to the broader decentralized economy through its integrated and scalable business model. This includes Valour, which offers access to one hundred of the world's most innovative digital assets via regulated ETPs; Stillman Digital, a digital asset prime brokerage focused on institutional-grade execution and custody; Reflexivity Research, which provides leading research into the digital asset space; Neuronomics, which develops quantitative trading strategies and infrastructure; and DeFi Alpha, the Company's internal arbitrage and trading business line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a series of enforcement notices and practice recommendations to several public authorities after identifying significant failures to comply with the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000. This work has led to targeted interventions where organisations have not met their statutory duties. The ICO remains firmly committed to driving greater transparency and ensuring public authorities are held accountable for upholding the public's right to information. “Those making FOI requests should do so, knowing that they will receive a response in a timely manner with adequate advice on any next steps that can be taken. “The recent action taken against these public authorities demonstrates our firm approach to FOI and accountability, particularly in tackling systemic transparency issues. “In the new year, we will review the impact of this approach to assess whether it has driven improved compliance. The ICO yesterday announced that they will be scrutinising how popular mobile games played by children in the UK protect their online privacy. But our goal is always broader: to raise standards across entire sectors. That means choosing the right regulatory tools to hold decision-makers accountable, set clear expectations, and secure lasting improvements. We have issued an enforcement notice to South Wales Police (SWP) over serious delays in handling subject access requests (SARs). We have fined Carmarthenshire sole trader Bharat Singh Chand £200,000 for sending almost one million spam texts about debt solutions and energy saving grants. Today we've launched a consultation on our approach to how charities can use new rules that allow greater use of electronic marketing when engaging with supporters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's trend turns bullish after reclaiming $3,100 | Credit: Derek Fenech Ethereum (ETH) price has broken past $3,100 again, just days after speculation spread that it could slide below $2,500. Additionally, the move appears to have transformed the previous resistance into support, with indicators suggesting that ETH could continue to rise higher. On Nov. 21, the price slipped to $2,653, a level it had not touched in months. At the time of writing, the 4-hour chart indicates that Ethereum's price has broken above a key resistance level, suggesting that buyers are regaining control. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. Supporting this improvement, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has climbed above the zero signal line, confirming a return of buying pressure. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed a bullish crossover for the first time since Nov. 22, indicating that momentum is turning upward. With these developments in place, ETH's price may soon retest the $3,394 resistance level. Under sustained buying pressure, ETH's price might advance toward $3,902, marking a significant recovery from recent lows, especially after the finalization of the Fusaka upgrade. Outside of the technical setup, institutional activity is also turning favorable for Ethereum. Just yesterday, BlackRock accumulated approximately $53 million worth of ETH. Data from Arkham shows that Tom Lee has also added  $150 million worth of ETH to his stash. “Crypto prices have fallen relentlessly even as fundamentals, measured by wallets, onchain, fees or tokenizatio, have moved forward So risk/reward is attractive for $BTC and $ETH,” Lee stated  on Dec. 1. When liquidity pools form in this manner, the price tends to gravitate toward them. Therefore, if the cryptocurrency maintains this current structure, Ethereum's price could be drawn toward this zone in the coming sessions. At the same time, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) has turned positive, indicating that buyers are gaining control over market direction. If this trend continues, ETH's price could breach the resistance at $3,541. A successful move above that level would open the door for a push toward $3,876, where the next significant resistance cluster sits. Sustained bullish pressure and rising volume would increase the likelihood of this scenario unfolding. In that case, ETH's price may retrace toward $2,403, revisiting lower support as the market resets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moonie NFT USD (MNYUSD) has remained unchanged at a price of $2.687992e-06. This flat performance occurs amidst non-existent trading volume and despite an impressive year high of $3e-06. As of today, MNYUSD has not experienced any price movement, staying fixed at $2.687992e-06. With no trading volume reported, it's an unusual situation that raises questions about market interest in this NFT-backed digital asset. Forecasts can change due to macroeconomic shifts, regulations, or unexpected events affecting the crypto market. Meyka AI, a cutting-edge financial platform, points out that such lack of activity can precede significant moves in either direction once liquidity returns. Despite these declines, the current price has stabilized just below its 50-day and 200-day averages of $3e-06, suggesting a potential support level if volume were to rise. This long-term view indicates optimism if the asset can overcome its current challenges. Current technicals, such as RSI and MACD at 0.00, signal no movement, reflecting MNYUSD's static state. The seven-year forecast for MNYUSD suggests a potential price of $0.0005484566649282696, though this is subject to change with market dynamics and interest. While MNYUSD remains stable, investment decisions should consider market dynamics, trading volume, and long-term forecasts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crunchfish today announces the publication of a new whitepaper, Immediate vs. Deferred Offline Modes - A Comparative Analysis for CBDC and Digital Payment Ecosystems, offering a detailed assessment of the two leading approaches to offline digital payments. As the world moves toward digital money, offline capability has become essential for resilience, inclusion, and payment continuity. But how offline payment is implemented makes all the difference. This whitepaper analyses the two dominant offline payment modes. The whitepaper highlights why Deferred Offline Mode, where digitally signed payment instructions (IOUs) are exchanged and settled upon reconnection, delivers superior security, scalability, and interoperability compared to hardware-dependent Immediate Offline Mode. This whitepaper shows that Deferred Offline Mode offers a secure, scalable path for central banks and commercial payment networks to deliver cash-like reliability without the systemic risks of transferring hardware-bound value tokens in offline mode. Crunchfish's Digital Cash solution provides exactly this capability as a ready-to-implement Layer-2 solution for central banks and commercial payment networks” says Joachim Samuelsson, CEO, Crunchfish. This information was provided by the above for publication on 4th December 2025 at 08:30 CET. Västra Hamnen Corporate Finance AB is the Certified Adviser. The solution is designed for banks, payment services, and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Crunchfish Digital Cash augments payment systems by offering resilience in case of lost internet connections or server failures. 251203 - Crunchfish Releases New Whitepaper Comparing Immediate vs Deferred Offline Payment Modes CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.
