The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Admiral Alvin Holsey's shock departure in October, less than a year into his three-year post as the head of the U.S. Southern Command, came as a direct result of pressure by Hegseth, Pentagon officials said. “Having [Holsey] leave at this particular moment, at the height of what the Pentagon considers to be the central action in our hemisphere, is just shocking,” said Todd Robinson, former assistant secretary for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs. When Holsey first took over Southern Command, Hegseth effectively demanded full compliance from the 60-year-old military official. Then, in March, Hegseth was suspicious that Holsey was leaking plans for the military to “reclaim” the Panama Canal, as President Donald Trump had commanded. This lines up with other publications' reports that Holsey had disagreements over the campaign. Expert opinion has repeatedly vindicated those reported concerns, with human rights and military legal experts saying that the strikes amount to murder, breaking both international human rights and domestic law. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Der Spiegel quotes leaked call in which European leaders voice doubts about Washington's approach to peace talks Der Spiegel said it had obtained an English summary of Monday's call, featuring what it said were direct quotations from European heads of government in which they expressed fundamental doubts about Washington's approach to the talks. Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, reportedly added that the Ukrainian leader needed to be “very careful”. Even the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte – who in public is very complimentary of Trump – reportedly said he agreed with Stubb “that we need to protect Volodymyr”. Der Spiegel said it spoke with “several” participants of the call, who confirmed it took place, and two of them reportedly said the remarks were “accurately reproduced”. Last month, Washington presented a 28-point proposal to halt the war in Ukraine, drafted without input from Ukraine's European allies and criticised as too close a reflection of Moscow's maximalist demands. The pair spent five hours in talks with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin and Witkoff is due to meet Ukraine's national security council chief, Rustem Umerov, in Miami on Thursday. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said in parliament on Thursday that an imposed peace would be “disastrous” not only for Kyiv but also Europe's security. He called on European nations not to let up in their support for Ukraine. “A dictated peace would be disastrous for Europe … because a Ukraine which is militarily beaten or potentially even defeated at the negotiating table (or) destabilised domestically through Russian influence, would put Europe's security at risk,” Pistorius said. In a guest column for the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Merz argued for the use of frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine, and said Europe appeared to be largely on its own in protecting its interests. “The question of European independence is being decided today, when our security interests are under threat. And it will be decided by whether we rise to this challenge,” he said.</p>

Please make this work possible with a quick donation. Two immigration detention centers in Florida have gained notoriety for inhumane conditions since Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, in close alignment with President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant agenda, has rapidly scaled up mass detention in the state, and a report released Thursday detailed how human rights violations at the two facilities amount to torture in some cases. Amnesty's report described unsanitary conditions, with fecal matter overflowing from toilets in detainees' sleeping areas, authorities granting only limited access to showers, and poor quality food and water. Some of the treatment amounts to torture, the report says, including Alligator Alcatraz's use of “the box” — a 2×2 foot “cage-like structure people are put in as punishment” — which inmates have been placed in for hours at a time with their hands and feet attached to restraints on the ground. At Krome, detainees have been arbitrarily placed in prolonged solitary confinement — defined as lasting longer than 15 days — which is prohibited under international law. The report elevates concerns raised in September by immigrant rights advocates regarding the lack of federal oversight at Alligator Alcatraz, with nearly 1,000 men detained at the prison having been “administratively disappeared” — their names absent from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's detainee locator system. “The absence of registration or tracking mechanisms for those detained at Alligator Alcatraz facilitates incommunicado detention and constitutes enforced disappearances when the whereabouts of a person being detained there is denied to their family, and they are not allowed to contact their lawyer,” said Amnesty. One man told Amnesty, “My lawyers tried to visit me, but they weren't let in. I was never able to speak with them confidentially.” At Krome, detainees described overcrowding, medical neglect, and abuse by guards when Amnesty researchers visited in September. The Amnesty researchers were given a tour of relatively extensive medical facilities at Krome, including a dialysis clinic, dental clinic, and a “state-of-the-art” mental health facility — but despite these resources, detainees described officials' failure to provide medical treatment and delays in health assessments. Four people — Ramesh Amechand, Genry Ruiz Guillen, Maksym Chernyak, and Isidro Pérez — have died this year while detained at Krome. “It's a disaster if you want to see the doctor,” one man told Amnesty. In line with the Trump administration, DeSantis and Republican state lawmakers have sought to make Florida “a testing ground for abusive immigration enforcement policies,” said Amnesty, with the state deputizing local law enforcement to make immigration arrests and issuing 34 no-bid contracts totaling more than $360 million for the operation of Alligator Alcatraz — while slashing spending on healthcare, food assistance, and disaster relief. “They represent a deliberate system of cruelty designed to punish people seeking to build a new life in the US,” said Fischer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin is welcomed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi upon the Russian leader's arrival in New Delhi on Thursday.GRIGORY SYSOYEV/AFP/Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in New Delhi on Thursday to start a two-day state visit, and India and Russia both said they want to boost mutual trade and expand the variety of items in transactions. Putin's first visit to India in four years aims to increase sales of Russian oil, missile systems and fighter jets and broaden business links between the countries beyond energy and defence equipment, amid U.S. pressure on India to move away from Moscow, which is waging war in Ukraine. Bilateral trade eased to US$28.25-billion in April–August, 2025, reflecting a decline in crude oil imports following punitive tariffs on Indian goods and sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. At the same time, India is looking for new destinations to increase exports of its goods hit by a punishing 50 per cent tariff imposed by Trump, half of that over India buying Russian oil, which Washington says helps finance Moscow's war in Ukraine. Russia wants to import more Indian goods to balance bilateral trade, which is currently heavily skewed toward energy, Deputy Kremlin Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin told a business conference in New Delhi. “This is not a momentary story, but a strategic choice in developing relations” between the two countries, he said, adding that India's share in Russian imports does not exceed 2 per cent. Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said New Delhi wants to diversify exports to Russia and increase sales of automobiles, electronics goods, data-processing equipment, heavy machinery, industrial components, textiles, and foodstuffs. “Russia has a huge demand for a wide range of industrial goods, consumer products, presenting multiple untapped opportunities for Indian businesses,” Goyal told the conference. “We need to bring more diversity in our trade basket. We need to make it more balanced between Russia and India. Russian Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut said Russia was prepared to increase imports of shrimp, rice, and tropical fruits from India. She mentioned that Russian firms were also interested in Indian food-processing equipment. India is the world's largest exporter of shrimp, and Lut noted that it was possible to increase India's share in Russian imports of shrimp, currently at 20 per cent. India was the biggest supplier of shrimp to the U.S. but Trump's tariffs have badly hit exports, causing a decline in shipments and forcing companies to seek alternative markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amnesty International finds immigrants at Florida facility were shackled and left outside in metal cage for up to a day The human rights group said migrants held at the state-run Everglades facility, and at Miami's Krome immigration processing center operated by a private company on behalf of the Trump administration, continue to be exposed to “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” rising in some cases to torture. I saw a guy who was put in it for an entire day.” Molly Best, press secretary to Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis, told the Guardian the Amnesty report was “nothing more than a politically motivated attack”. In fact, running these allegations without any evidence whatsoever could jeopardize the safety and security of our staff and those being housed at Alligator Alcatraz,” she said. DEM has also previously denied any mistreatment of migrants held awaiting deportation from the remote camp. Despite those claims, the camp, which opened in July following a boastful visit from Donald Trump, quickly earned a reputation for harsh conditions including alleged human rights abuses and denial of due process. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges, one whose husband has close ties to DeSantis, blocked the closure ruling. Amnesty International's report details allegations at “Alligator Alcatraz” of “unsanitary conditions, including overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into where people are sleeping, limited access to showers, exposure to insects without protective measures, lights on 24 hours a day, poor quality food and water, and lack of privacy”. It said: “People interviewed shared that access to medical care is inconsistent, inadequate, or denied altogether, placing individuals at serious risk of both physical and mental harm. People reported being always shackled when they were outside their cage.” That center was notably the subject of a separate July report by Human Rights Watch, who alleged detainees were shackled with their hands tied behind their backs and made to kneel to eat food from styrofoam plates “like dogs”. Amnesty documented what it said were delays in intake procedures, overcrowding in temporary processing areas, inadequate and inaccessible medical care, “alarming” disciplinary practices including the use of prolonged solitary confinement and challenges in access to legal representation and due process. Other arriving detainees were forced to sleep for several days on a bus with no toilet facilities or air conditioning, Amnesty said, until space could be found inside. Day-to-day operations at Krome are provided by the for-profit Akima Global Services LLC, which signed a $685m contract with ICE last year during the final months of Joe Biden's presidency. “It operates outside federal oversight, without the basic tracking systems used in ICE facilities,” the report said, claiming that some detainees ended up there after multiple transfers between facilities in short order, making it impossible for their families or legal representatives to know their whereabouts. “The absence of registration or tracking mechanisms for those detained facilitates incommunicado detention and constitutes enforced disappearances.” Amnesty's report concludes with a number of recommendations, including a call for Florida to close “Alligator Alcatraz” and end all agreements and cooperation with federal immigration authorities. “The treatment of people inside these immigrant detention centers is cruelty, hard stop. Federal and state officials must act immediately to end this human rights crisis.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seize Ukraine's Donbas region “by military or other means,” digging in on one of his key demands as Ukrainian officials prepare for more peace talks that have yet to yield a deal. Putin arrived in New Delhi on Thursday where he will be hosted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two days after a meeting at the Kremlin with a US delegation led by special envoy Steve Witkoff. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are traveling to the US on Thursday, where they have been invited to hold talks with their American counterparts on a plan to end Moscow's war, a Ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. Ahead of the Modi summit, Putin gave an interview with India Today, in which he said Russia would “liberate Donbas and Novorossiya in any case – by military or other means,” according to Russian state media TASS. One of the Kremlin's biggest demands is for Ukraine to surrender territory in the Donbas region, which Russia has illegally annexed but not yet fully conquered. As Russia doubles down on these territorial demands, which Ukrainian officials continue to reject, the path towards any compromise seems increasingly unclear. In Putin's description of his Tuesday meeting in Moscow with Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, he said Russia did not agree with some of the points of the US proposal, but that it was a “difficult task.” He reiterated Russia's demands that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the Donbas and “refrain from military action,” according to TASS. “I can't tell you, because it does take two to tango.” Both sides have remained coy about any progress they made in this latest round of negotiations, which have been ongoing since a 28-point plan drafted by the Trump adminstration was leaked in late November. Several points in that plan were widely seen as concessions to Russia and contained ideas that had previously been rejected by Ukraine and European officials. Only small details from these meetings have been released, such as Putin's aide and foreign policy advisor Yury Ushakov acknowledging that they discussed territory in the meeting on Tuesday, “without which we do not see a solution to the crisis.” Putin sends Trump's messengers packing, with eyes on a geopolitical win He added that some points in the American proposals “look more or less acceptable,” while others “do not suit us.” These talks comes four days after a previous high-level meeting between US and Ukrainian officials that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as “a very productive and useful session where … additional progress was made.”</p>

NEW DELHI, December 4. /TASS/. Russia's Ministry of Economic Development is ready to assist Indian airlines in obtaining permits for flights to Russia, Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said.

"We are ready to assist Indian carriers in obtaining flight permits to Russia," he said at the Russia-India Business Forum.

Currently, only 15 flights per week operated by a Russian airline connect the two countries, the minister noted. To compare, there are 221 flights per week between Russia and China, and 369 flights per week from the UAE during the winter. From both countries, 12 foreign airlines operate flights to Russia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Mraiche's company, MHCare, had been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of procurement contracts from Alberta Health Services.PAUL SWANSON/The Globe and Mail It's not unusual for business owners to forge ties with governments, but there are rules around conflicts of interest when it comes to procurement. In February, 2025, an Alberta senior public servant stepped forward with allegations of political interference in the awarding of large health contracts. These allegations prompted investigators, auditors and opposition politicians to look closely at the ties between Premier Danielle Smith's government and an Alberta businessman, Sam Mraiche. Mraiche's company, MHCare, had been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of procurement contracts from Alberta Health Services. A Globe and Mail investigation found that the connections between Mr. Mraiche, purchasing officials, and senior Alberta political figures have existed longer – and are more extensive – than previously reported. Today, Carrie Tait, a reporter with The Globe's Calgary bureau, and Tom Cardoso, an investigative reporter with The Globe, are on the show to talk about their investigation into the ties between a serial entrepreneur and the Alberta government.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The proposals on a Ukrainian settlement brought by American envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are based on agreements reached during the Russia-US summit in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted in an interview with India Today. He also noted that Washington proposed breaking a 28-point peace plan drafted by the United States into four separate packages and discussing them that way. It lasted "five hours," as each point should be discussed in detail. The proposals on a Ukrainian settlement brought by American envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are based on agreements reached during the Russia-US summit in Alaska: "What our US colleagues brought us was based one way or another on our agreements from my meeting with [US] President [Donald] Trump in Alaska, as we discussed these issues at the meeting in Anchorage." US President Donald Trump is sincerely trying to find a consensus solution to the Ukrainian problem, but that "is no easy feat." There were issues during work on the peace plan for Ukraine on which no consensus was reached, "but it is difficult work. While a 28-point peace plan drafted by the United States earlier is still valid and being discussed, Washington proposed breaking it into four separate packages: "They just broke these 28 or 27 points into four packages. And they proposed discussing these four packages with us. Moscow proposed that Kiev pull back Ukrainian armed forces from Donbass, which would have avoided any military confrontation, but Ukraine opted to continue hostilities: "We immediately told Ukraine, the Ukrainian troops: the people do not want to live with you, they held a referendum and voted for independence — withdraw your troops, and there will be no military actions. Russia will liberate Donbass and Novorossiya either by military or other means: "It all boils down to this: either we will liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories and stop fighting there." Europeans need to engage in the work on a Ukrainian settlement, not hinder it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Caram, who has traveled to Ukraine more than 20 times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, said the gesture deeply moved her. "He did tell me, in our meetings, that he would help me in some way, but I didn't imagine he would do it like this," she said, according to a news report published on Dec. 2. Although Pope Francis consistently condemned the violence of Russia's invasion, his legacy in Ukraine was strained by several controversial remarks about the war. In 2024, he urged Ukraine to show "courage" and "raise the white flag" to negotiate with Moscow — a comment widely criticized in Kyiv. In the same interview, Caram also spoke about her meeting with the newly elected Pope Leo XIV, whom she described as reserved but direct. She recounted spending nearly an hour with him in August to discuss her work in Ukraine—far longer than many senior clergy received, she added. Caram said Leo XIV is "a pope who speaks little, observant, cautious, and prudent," yet "when he does speak, he tells things clearly." Pope Leo XIV — formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost — was elected to lead the Catholic Church on May 8, following the death of Pope Francis. President Volodymyr Zelensky attended his inauguration Mass on May 18, later calling the new pontiff "a symbol of hope for peace." Their meeting focused on the return of Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia and broader humanitarian concerns. Zelensky has expressed support for such an initiative, while Russian officials have rejected the proposal. Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. Successful strikes by Ukraine's military intelligence agency destroyed a Russian MiG-29 fighter jet and an Irtysh radar system in Russian-occupied Crimea, the agency said. Russia, Belarus and Iran have voted against the resolution. Fifty-seven countries, including China, India and Brazil, abstained from voting. Russia has centralized volunteer drone units like Rubikon into a professional system that is eroding Ukraine's early edge in UAV warfare and threatening its front lines. Putin's trip to India tests how far New Delhi will go to protect its ties with Moscow while pressure mounts from Ukraine, Europe and the U.S. "He did tell me, in our meetings, that he would help me in some way, but I didn't imagine he would do it like this," Dominican nun Lucia Caram said.

By Ayaka Kaji and Kensuke Fukushima / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers High-end fashion brands taking part in Paris Fashion Week, which was held from Sept. 29 to Oct. 7, vied for excellence in their attempts at sustainability. Ninety percent of new pieces presented by U.S. fashion brand Gabriela Hearst at Paris Fashion Week for Spring/Summer 2026 were made with leftover fabric recycled from previous seasons. British label Stella McCartney presented a collection featuring groundbreaking materials, such as dresses made with plant-based artificial feathers and denim that absorbs and neutralizes pollutants contained in exhaust gases. Equipment and furnishings used at the runway shows during fashion week are actively recycled to reduce environmental impact. For example, Chanel will donate 4,500 tote bags made from fabric used for decorations at the brand's runway show in Paris to a charity organization. What is behind these efforts is criticism of the fashion industry for taking mass consumption and disposal of clothing for granted. Environment Programme, the fashion industry produces 92 million tons of textile waste every year. On the other hand, just 8% of all apparel used recycled material in 2023. To deal with the problem, the Fashion Pact, a framework for multinational companies to reduce the environmental burden of fashion, was launched in 2019, led by French President Emmanuel Macron and presided over by Kering, a major French group of luxury brands. The law prohibits luxury fashion brands and others from disposing of dead stock products. Based on the law, an “eco score” labeling system for clothes, which quantifies the environmental cost of each item by giving it a score, was launched in October 2025. French fashion brand Agnes b., another regular participant in Paris Fashion Week, started using QR codes on the tags of clothes sold at its Paris stores in October. The French parliament this year passed a law regulating “ultra-fast fashion” — mass-produced, extremely cheap garments from China and other countries — which do not meet environmental standards. Clothes made from recycled fabric or other eco-friendly material require more time and effort to produce and tend to prove costly. Even environmentally concerned consumers may feel reluctant to pay a fortune for them, which hampers the spread of eco-friendly fashion. “One effective measure is to reduce the prices of products by introducing a tax break system and subsidies for environmentally conscious companies,” said Shinichi Shuto, a professor in marketing at Bunka Fashion Graduate University. Japan is lagging behind the efforts of countries in Europe. To address this, the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry and the Environment Ministry set up a panel for building a resource circulation system for textile products in 2023. Meanwhile, about 560,000 tons of clothes were discarded by businesses and homes. Garments recycled as second-hand clothes or for other purposes remained at about 170,000 tons. Goals in the road map include a 25% reduction in clothing waste from homes compared to the 2020 level by fiscal 2030, and recycling 50,000 tons of discarded clothing into new materials annually. Since clothing products are often made from blended fabric comprising various materials, textile recycling is slow to progress for technical and financial reasons. Japanese apparel companies venturing into the European market face the risk of being kicked out unless they take appropriate measures that are compatible with local environmental regulations. Uniqlo Co., which is proactively working on the issue, collects and reuses its clothes and has made it a goal to change about 50% of materials it uses to those with lower greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal 2030. “If there's a standardized public system for clothes, such as the one for plastic bottles, recycling of clothes will have a better chance of taking root in society,” said Yoshiko Ikoma, the chairman of Japan Ethical Initiative, an organization promoting ethical consumption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Markle is in intensive care after undergoing emergency surgery, his son has said. The Duchess of Sussex's father was rushed to hospital on Tuesday after he was taken gravely ill at his home in the Philippines. “I took dad to a hospital close to our home and they did various scans and the doctors said his life was in imminent danger,” his son Thomas Jnr told the Daily Mail. I would ask everyone around the world to keep him in their thoughts.” Mr Markle, who has been estranged from his daughter since her wedding to the Duke of Sussex in 2018, has been in poor health for several years. He said his daughter was furious with him when he posed for paparazzi pictures on the eve of her wedding and previously said his “only wish is to see my grandchildren before I die”. He suffered two heart attacks just before Meghan's wedding at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, which prevented him from flying from Los Angeles to London to be by his daughter's side. Mr Markle later suffered a stroke in 2022 which left him unable to speak for months. “He is literally fighting for his life,” Thomas Jnr added. Mr Markle's daughter Samantha, 61, said she believed the strain of the past few years had taken its toll on her father and made him more fragile. I am praying that he is strong enough to survive this,” she said. “My father has been through two heart attacks, a stroke and an earthquake.</p>
