                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The WTA editions will begin Monday, December 8.After four hours and 25 minutes of pure cinema in Suzanne Lenglen, all Arthur Fils could do was scream.“This is Paris, right?” he cried to 15,000 of his fellow Frenchmen and women, who had just pushed, pulled, cheered, and serenaded him to the most thrilling victory of his young career. A superlative athlete who was already being touted as the future of French tennis by his mid-teens, he had quickly collapsed under those expectations in his first two trips to Roland Garros, losing in the opening round both times.

A superlative athlete who was already being touted as the future of French tennis by his mid-teens, he had quickly collapsed under those expectations in his first two trips to Roland Garros, losing in the opening round both times. Fils was just 20 years old, but the moment felt like it had been a long time coming for him. A superlative athlete who was already being touted as the future of French tennis by his mid-teens, he had quickly collapsed under those expectations in his first two trips to Roland Garros, losing in the opening round both times. Tennis fans savored the thought of this version of Fils playing on his home turf in Paris. When he landed in same section of the draw as top seed Jannik Sinner, the anticipation ratcheted up even more.First, though, he had to make it through a deceptively difficult second-rounder against Jaume Munar. The 28-year-old Spaniard knew all about living up to expectations; once upon a time, he had been seen as a possible successor to Rafael Nadal. While that obviously didn't pan out,  Munar had finally grown comfortable with his own game after a decade on tour, and would finish 2025 at a career-high No. 36.The atmosphere was electric as these two walked into Lenglen on a sunny afternoon, and the pro-Fils chants started early. Fils and Munar put on a lively, feisty, highly physical all-court duel, and the Frenchman won each set in a tiebreaker.

Fils and Munar put on a lively, feisty, highly physical all-court duel, and the Frenchman won each set in a tiebreaker. Then, in a matter of minutes, the bottom fell out for Fils. Fils blamed a back injury, but Munar wasn't buying it. “Everyone knows his timeout was due to cramps,” he said.Whatever the ailment, Fils' descent continued into the fifth. When he went down 1-3, he bashed a ball into the stadium's upper deck.Did that moment of rage-venting save him? Fils was a new man after that. In the next game, he wore Munar down with corner-to-corner forehands, as he had early on, and leveled the set at 3-3. The good version drilled fearless forehand winners and flapped his arms for more noise from the crowd. The gassed version had trouble standing up. When he did, he was liable to send an overhead careening toward the stands.Serving at 4-4, the gassed Fils went down 0-40. That—and some helpful hissing of his opponent from the fans—was just enough to get him over the finish line. Fils won the last point with a net-cord that set up his 69th and final winner.

The crowd really push me to win this match.”“This is my best match of all time,” he said of his 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 win.Did the crowd push Fils a little too far? He was forced to withdraw from the tournament before his next match, and he would play just one event the rest of the year.Hopefully, Fils will be back in 2026 and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis' biggest stars didn't just let their racquets do the talking in 2025. To look back on a memorable season, we're counting down some of the biggest winners in the press conference room and on the microphone—and Frances Tiafoe takes the top spot in our countdown for the stinging one-liner he delivered that cut through that cloud of controversy that marred his quarterfinal loss at Roland Garros.Most viral moments: When Frances Tiafoe and Coco Gauff walked onto court without racquets2025 proved to be a challenging year for the fan-favorite American, but an up-and-down season was decidedly on the upswing when he put together his deepest-ever run at Roland Garros in June. Previously dubbing clay-court seasons of prior years "an eye-roll situation," Tiafoe teamed with Tommy Paul to make recent history for the U.S. in Paris, as two American men were among the eight quarterfinalists for the first time since 1996.But the good feelings quickly evaporated for both in that round: A physically-hampered Paul won just five games against eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, while Tiafoe was bundled out in four sets by Lorenzo Musetti—but only after the Italian was spared a sticky exit himself.

The moment came two years after doubles player Miyu Kato was defaulted from a Roland Garros match after hitting a ball girl, a decision that caused controversy given the apparently accidental nature of the hit.
