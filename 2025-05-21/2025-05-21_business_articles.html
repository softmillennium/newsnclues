                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The artificial intelligence boom has sent energy demand soaring. Some of the supercomputers sucking up all that power are helping to find new energy sources. Fusion energy is the process of forcing two hydrogen atoms to combine and form one helium atom, which releases huge amounts of power. Until now, the technology was too difficult to deploy commercially. But this old concept has brand new potential. Type One Energy, a startup based in Tennessee, claims to have proven that fusion energy will be able to produce electricity in the next decade. "It's going to create heat that's going to boil water, make steam, run a turbine and put fusion electrons on the power grid on a 24/7 reliable basis," said Type One Christofer Mowry. "Things have really accelerated remarkably over the last five or six years," Mowry said. Dozens of other companies are working on different approaches to fusion energy, but Mowry said Type One is so far the only one with the proven stellarator technology to implement at existing power plants. It will soon be tested with the Tennessee Valley Authority. "With Type One Energy solutions, we expect outsized return potential," said Nicola Sauvage, president of TDK Ventures. "Fusion is no longer science fiction, and Type One Energy's technology is catching up fast to the vision of this low-cost, continuous green energy." Type One is also backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Centaurus Capital, GD1, Foxglove Capital, and SeaX Ventures, and has raised a total of $82.4 million. The power source has no long-term radioactive waste, and, according to Mowry, can't be weaponized. But for handling AI, it could be a critical solution. Fusion energy can be deployed anywhere, whether it's next to a data center or near a large industrial park that needs clean, reliable energy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Wednesday that the company hasn't seen any signs of consumers tightening their wallets in the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Jassy's comments came during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, which was held virtually on Wednesday. "We have not seen any attenuation of demand at this point," Jassy said during a question-and-answer portion of the meeting. "We also haven't yet seen any meaningful average selling price increases." Amazon and other retailers continue to digest the impact of Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Amazon pointed to "tariffs and trade policies" as one of several factors that could make its guidance for the current quarter subject to change. Rival retailer Walmart warned last week that consumers could start seeing price hikes from tariffs later this month and in June. Target said Wednesday it will likely need to hike prices on some items, while Home Depot said it expects to maintain its current pricing levels. Amazon faces significant exposure to the levies through its retail unit, which sources some goods from tariff-hit China. Jassy said last month the company made some "strategic forward inventory buys" to stock up on goods and is "pretty maniacally focused" on keeping prices low for shoppers. Some third-party sellers, which account for roughly 60% of products sold, have increased prices on certain items, while others have opted to keep prices steady, Jassy said Wednesday. All of the resolutions, which Amazon recommended investors vote against, were rejected. Vote totals are expected to be released soon after the meeting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI said on Wednesday that it's buying Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for about $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal that includes its current stake in the company. The company said that io is merging with OpenAI, while Ive and his "creative collective" called LoveFrom will stay independent. In a blog post on Wednesday from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive, the pair said that io was founded a year ago by Ive, along with Apple alumni Scott Cannon, Tang Tan and Evans Hankey, who briefly took over Ive's role at Apple after he departed. "The io team, focused on developing products that inspire, empower and enable, will now merge with OpenAI to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco," the post said. The purchase is by far OpenAI's largest and comes weeks after the company agreed to buy AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3 billion. Prior to that, OpenAI acquired analytics database company Rockset for an undisclosed sum in 2024. The New York Times reported last year that LoveFrom's clients pay the firm up to $200 million a year and that its designers at the time were working on projects for Christie's, Airbnb and Ferrarri. Airbnb said in 2020 that Ive was consulting with the company on hiring and future products. Ive is responsible for designing Apple's most iconic products, including the iPod, iPhone, iPad and MacBook Air. He also helped design Apple's new Cupertino headquarters, called Apple Park, a project that began in 2004 with the campus officially opening in 2019. News of the acquisition comes as OpenAI, which was recently valued at $300 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank, is rushing to stay ahead in the generative AI race, where competitors including Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI are investing heavily and regularly rolling out new products. Part of staying ahead in that race includes shoring up its hardware operations. To further its hardware ambitions, OpenAI hired the former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses initiative in November to lead its robotics and consumer hardware efforts. Caitlin "CK" Kalinowski wrote in an announcement at the time that the role would "initially focus on OpenAI's robotics work and partnerships to help bring AI into the physical world and unlock its benefits for humanity." Also late last year, OpenAI invested in Physical Intelligence, a robot startup based in San Francisco, which raised $400 million at a $2.4 billion post-money valuation. The startup focuses on "bringing general-purpose AI into the physical world," per its website, and it aims to do this by developing large-scale artificial intelligence models and algorithms to power robots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft said Wednesday that it broke down the Lumma Stealer malware project with the help of law enforcement officials across the globe.The tech giant said in a blog post that its digital crimes unit discovered over 394,000 Windows computers were infected by the Lumma malware worldwide between March 16 through May 16. The Lumma malware was a favorite hacking tool used by bad actors, Microsoft said in the post. Hackers used the malware to steal passwords, credit cards, bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. Microsoft said its digital crimes unit was able to dismantle the web domains underpinning Lumma's infrastructure with the help of a court order from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. "Working with law enforcement and industry partners, we have severed communications between the malicious tool and victims," Microsoft said in the post. "Moreover, more than 1,300 domains seized by or transferred to Microsoft, including 300 domains actioned by law enforcement with the support of Europol, will be redirected to Microsoft sinkholes." Microsoft said that other tech companies like Cloudflare, Bitsight and Lumen also helped break down the Lumma malware ecosystem. Hackers have been buying the Lumma malware via underground online forums since at least 2022, all while developers were "continually improving its capabilities," the blog post said. In one example of how criminals used Lumma, Microsoft pointed to a March 2025 phishing campaign in which bad actors misled people into believing they were part of the Booking.com online travel service. These cyber criminals used the Lumma malware to carry out their financial crimes in this scheme, the company said. Additionally, Microsoft said that hackers have used the Lumma to attack online gaming communities and education systems, while other cybersecurity companies have noted that the malware has been used in cyber attacks targeting manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other related critical infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta is expanding the ranks of its lowest-rated employees in their midyear performance reviews, months after it laid off nearly 4,000 employees whom it labeled low performers. It's telling managers to put more employees in its "below expectations" tier, the lowest performance bucket, during this year's midyear performance reviews, according to a memo shared on Meta's internal forum on May 14, which was viewed by Business Insider. The expanded range includes employees who have already left the company as part of "nonregrettable attrition," Meta's term for staff considered noncritical to operations, including those who resigned or were dismissed for underperformance. It added that "there will be no company-wide performance terminations, unlike earlier this year," and that leaders are expected to manage the performance of their reports. Managers can select employees for performance cuts based on criteria including a "below expectations" rating in their midyear review, if they were formally disciplined within the past six months, or if they had an "employee relations" case in the first quarter. Those cases are when an employee was on a plan to manage their performance. The change comes just months after Meta laid off nearly 4,000 employees — about 5% of its workforce — over their performance. Internal documents seen by BI earlier this year suggested such layoffs could become an annual fixture, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling staff he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and move faster to "move out low-performers." The new midyear targets echo a move Meta made at the end of 2022, when it roughly doubled the share of employees placed in its lowest performance categories during annual reviews. As with the current midyear cycle, that figure included employees already marked for nonregrettable attrition. The repeated tightening of performance review criteria underscores Meta's effort to reshape its workforce following years of overhiring. Meta executives have increasingly used performance management as a mechanism to streamline teams and cut costs. Meta's human resources leaders have emphasized a need to "move faster" in managing out underperformers so that new, stronger talent could be brought in. Meta's move mirrors a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are sharpening their focus on performance, while doubling down on artificial intelligence investments. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it would cut about 6,000 roles — roughly 3% of its global workforce — in an effort to trim layers of middle management and boost the ratio of coders to noncoders on projects. At Google, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees late last year that the company had reduced its top management ranks by 10% as part of an efficiency push.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok Shop employees in the US are bracing for layoffs after the company told staffers to work from home Wednesday ahead of "organizational and personnel changes," per a memo viewed by Business Insider. The moves are expected to impact employees who work in US operations and global key accounts, a team that works with large brands. Employees began receiving emails that their roles were affected on Wednesday morning. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok's US e-commerce business has been off to a rocky start this year, as sales have slumped amid global tariffs and broader economic uncertainty. Employees previously told BI that daily US sales from foreign sellers, many based in China, where tariffs skyrocketed in April, contributed to a broader sales drop-off on the platform starting in late March. TikTok's coming personnel changes follow a round of job cuts in April when it restructured its e-commerce governance and experience team, BI previously reported. TikTok Shop's growth in the US is a big priority at ByteDance, which sees hundreds of billions in annual sales on its Chinese sister app, Douyin. But even before its more recent sales slump, the US e-commerce business failed to meet many of its performance goals in 2024, company leaders told staffers during a February all-hands. Over the past year and a half, TikTok has shaken up its leadership structure across the company, giving greater oversight to some Chinese and Singaporean leaders in departments including Shop. TikTok's US future is up in the air, subject to the outcome of a divest-or-ban law that requires ByteDance to give up majority ownership of its US app. TikTok has until June 19 to find a new owner, though President Donald Trump may extend that deadline.</p>

A dinner on Thursday in Washington — billed as the “Most Exclusive Once in Lifetime Invitation” — is the latest and boldest spectacle Bill Zanker has launched for Donald Trump.

Since Zanker co-authored a 2007 book with Trump, they've had a number of splashy collaborations, including a crowdfunding site and a series of non-fungible tokens featuring superhero versions of Trump, with events for some of the largest holders at Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Owners technically weren't allowed to resell the vehicle for a year — Tesla said that if they did, it could sue for damages and blacklist the owner from buying future Teslas. Two Cybertruck owners — one who owns the all-wheel-drive model and the other who has a top-of-the-line Cyberbeast variant — shared the estimated trade-in values that Tesla offered them after they requested a quote. Despite a difference in mileage of more than 10,000 miles, both vehicles showed a similar depreciation rate of about 37% to 38%. After driving 19,623 miles with the vehicle, his trade-in estimate came in at $63,100, a roughly 37% depreciation. The owner received a trade-in estimate of $78,200, representing about a 38% decrease in value in eight months of ownership. In other words, the final amount Tesla is willing to credit to the owner could end up being less. The EV news website Electrek reported earlier on Tesla beginning to accept Cybertruck trade-ins. Vehicles famously begin to depreciate as soon as owners drive them off the lot, but Tesla's trade-in estimates give a glimpse into how the company values used Cybertrucks at a time when some car dealers have shared struggles to sell used models. Kelley Blue Book estimates that new cars depreciate about 30% on average over the first two years and lose an added 8% to 12% each year after that. But it's important to note that EVs tend to depreciate at a higher rate as used models have increasingly hit the market amid the EV buying slowdown in recent years. An iSeeCars study that analyzed more than 800,000 5-year-old used cars sold from March 2024 to February 2025 found that EVs lost the most value, depreciating 58.8% in five years. The study found that trucks and hybrids retained the most value, with trucks losing 40.4% of their value in a five-year period. Still, the rates that Cybertruck owners shared appear steeper than similar models such as Rivian's all-electric 2023 R1T, which depreciated about 29% in the past two years, according to Kelley Blue Book. Not all Tesla models depreciate at the same rate. While depreciation rates can vary based on several factors, including market conditions and mileage, the Cybertruck's decline in value has come amid wider pressures on the brand. With political backlash over Tesla CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the White House DOGE office, Cybertruck owners have faced harassment and vandalism. Some owners have expressed interest in selling their vehicles, with one telling BI earlier this year that he returned his Cybertruck soon after purchasing it because of concerns about his kids getting bullied. Despite Musk saying Tesla had more than 1 million reservations prior to its release, a March recall filing disclosed that Tesla delivered fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks. BI also earlier reported that the automaker had scaled back Cybertruck production in recent months, dropping targets for several Cybertruck lines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with Vogue published on Tuesday, the Rhode Skin founder spoke about her childbirth and postpartum experiences. Bieber told Vogue that she struggled with postpartum body dysmorphia after giving birth. "When people talk about 'bouncing back' — ​back where, because my hips are wider, my boobs are actually bigger than they were before. She added that she fell into the cycle of looking up mean comments online about her appearance, only to end up feeling even worse about herself. It took her some time to accept that her body wouldn't look how it used to, she said. And then I had to go through that acceptance of, I'm not going back. So it's really about how do I want to move forward? Who do I want to be?" She said people speculating online that she was going through a divorce made it even worse. "I cannot even begin to explain it. It's a crazy life to live," she said. "Being postpartum is the most sensitive time I've ever gone through in my life, and learning a new version of myself is very difficult," Bieber said. New moms might deal with things like breast engorgement or vaginal bleeding, and some also experience postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety. Bieber isn't the only celebrity mom who has spoken about her postpartum experience. Lindsay Lohan said in a March 2024 interview that she doesn't feel pressured to "snap back" to her old body after giving birth. "I feel like everything always comes full circle again, so this is that moment, and this, too, shall pass," she said. In a March interview, Ashley Tisdale said that welcoming her second child was a chance to experience motherhood again since she felt "robbed" of her first experience due to postpartum depression, or PPD. A representative for Bieber did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.</p>
