This has led to a huge, angry backlash, part of the reason being that the young girl's mother, Jeneen Deal, is related by marriage to Vice President JD Vance's half-sibling, so she's part of a celebrity family. The couple — her parents — adopted her from China when she was 4, and they knew at the time that she had heart problems and was going to need a heart transplant. They've always taken her to Cincinnati because they believe that's the best place in their area for her to get care. Those of you who know the heart transplant field know that for kids, it's tough to get a heart. That's partly because many of the donors for adults come from car accidents, gunshots, swimming pool accidents, that sort of thing. Younger children, happily,are not as likely to die in circumstances where they then become cadaver organ donors, so the organs are very scarce. Well, the family says they don't want to vaccinate because it's against their religious beliefs. It's hard to know what those religious beliefs are because there are no major religions that oppose vaccination.All major religions — all that I'm familiar with — support vaccination as good for the individual to preserve their health and good for the community. What the hospital is doing in this situation has nothing to do with fights about whether a flu vaccine should be mandated or if schools can require vaccination.What's going on here is that when you get a heart transplant, you have to take immunosuppressive drugs immediately and for the rest of your life. They tune down your immune system and make you very vulnerable to infections such as the flu, and they make it very likely that you could die if you got the flu, COVID-19, or other infectious diseases that normally we might be able to survive without getting vaccinated. The hospital is trying to be responsible and say that they don't want her to die if they transplant her. It also makes good sense to say that we don't want to waste a scarce heart on someone who's likely to get sick when other people are waiting in the queue — other kids not related to JD Vance — who are vaccinated and will do better. I do think it's right to say vaccination, in this instance, is something that the hospital really wants to see.It's medically indicated for this girl and anybody else on a waitlist anywhere for a transplant. That's not the same and shouldn't be mixed up with fights about mandatory vaccination to get into school.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To effectively battle cancer, scientists must study the battlefield. Now, in a recent study published in Nature Communications, a multi-institutional research team including The University of Osaka has discovered some crucial intel: localized oxygen deficiency in the colon cancer microenvironment can promote tumor growth. Until recently, oxygen deprivation, i.e., hypoxia, was thought to suppress tumor progression. Understanding why this happens has become an urgent question in cancer research. We uncovered a surprising mechanism by which hypoxia may promote tumor growth, and it involves the formation of cells called inflammatory fibroblasts." The research team found that when oxygen becomes scarce in certain areas of a colon tumor, the surrounding fibroblasts (normally 'good' cells that support tissue structure) transform into harmful inflammatory fibroblasts. The altered cells release factors that help tumors grow, such as epiregulin. In addition, they release Wnt5a protein, which helps maintain a low-oxygen state by inhibiting new blood-vessel formation at the site of its release, thereby maintaining hypoxia. To validate the findings from the mouse model in human samples, the researchers pooled data from human samples obtained from patients with a healthy colon, colon cancer, and those with inflammatory bowel disease. "We found that the malignant transformation of fibroblasts and the induction of Wnt5a-secreting fibroblasts are commonly observed in both mouse models and human samples," says Akira Kikuchi, senior author of the study. This insight into the potential pathology of colon cancer and inflammation can provide the blueprints for a new cancer battle strategy: drug therapies that target Wnt5a-producing fibroblasts. As a result, fibroblasts are now being recognized as a key 'third' therapeutic target, complementing traditional treatments targeting cancer cells and immune cells. Additionally, the observed pathological changes of fibroblasts could also apply to chronic inflammatory disorders like inflammatory bowel disease, offering fresh insights into their mechanisms and potential new treatment strategies for these challenging conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent study, a research team from the Medical University of Vienna has gained new insights into post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and the relevance of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. The study, which was recently published in the journal Allergy, shows that PCS patients have altered inflammatory markers and a disturbed intestinal barrier, which could contribute to the development of post-viral fatigue. The researchers, led by Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber from MedUni Vienna's Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, analyzed data from a prospective observational study. In addition, blood, saliva and stool samples from PCS patients were analyzed. The results show that patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal complaints have an increased risk of developing PCS fatigue. At the same time, prominent changes were found in certain biomarkers. For example, PCS patients showed an increased LBP/sCD14 ratio and lower IL-33 levels, which indicates altered immune activation and a reduced intestinal barrier. In addition, there were increased IL-6 levels, which are considered a marker for systemic inflammatory reactions. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have long-term effects on the immune system and intestinal health that contribute to the development of PCS." Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber from MedUni Vienna's Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology She is co-director of the National Reference Center for Postviral Syndromes at MedUni Vienna. Monitoring gastrointestinal symptoms and biomarkers could help to identify at-risk patients at an early stage and develop targeted treatment strategies. This could be particularly important for the treatment of post-viral fatigue. "The identification of predictive markers for PCS could enable personalized prevention and treatment in the future," says Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since President Donald Trump released his 2026 budget blueprint in early May, calling for $163 billion in federal spending cuts, much of the attention has focused on his slashing of foreign aid and boosting of border security. But the proposal also holds important clues — amid some mixed messages — about the administration's approach to two pressing public health issues: mental health and addiction. Trump's proposal includes heavy cuts, totaling more than $22.6 billion, to three federal agencies that address these issues and suggests eliminating programs aimed at suicide and overdose prevention. The administration says this will streamline its efforts, but advocates, researchers, and public health practitioners worry this could make the death toll even worse. And this isn't even a full budget proposal. It's what people on Capitol Hill call a "skinny budget." It covers only discretionary spending that Congress authorizes each year, not larger entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those big-ticket items and many other details will be addressed in the administration's full budget, expected in the coming months. "You don't have it in enough detail to be able to really make assessments" about specific policies, said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president at the McDermott+ consulting firm and a longtime Republican Senate staffer. About two weeks before Trump released his skinny budget, a preliminary budget document for the Department of Health and Human Services was leaked, showing deep funding cuts and lists of programs slated for elimination. Here are three things that millions of Americans experiencing mental illness or addiction, and their loved ones, should watch as the process continues. She told KFF Health News that the president's budget will include an additional $95 million for other suicide prevention programs. Trump's skinny proposal calls for more than $1 billion in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the government's lead agency on all things related to mental health and addiction. This bucket of spending includes a variety of grant programs, in areas including children's mental health and homelessness prevention. Budget documents from the current fiscal year show some of the costliest programs under this title focus on suicide prevention, including 988 grants to ensure state and regional call centers have the capacity to handle the millions of calls and texts the crisis line receives, Garrett Lee Smith grants focused on preventing youth suicide, and Zero Suicide grants that help health systems develop comprehensive suicide screening and response protocols. Many people consider these programs vital given the country's ongoing suicide crisis. "Cutting this funding is going to be disastrous," said Paul Nestadt, a psychiatrist and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. "A lot of suicide prevention does take place at the state or even local level, but it's funded by federal programs." The skinny budget proposal says, "These programs either duplicate other Federal spending or are too small to have a national impact." Cauley did not respond to questions about where she got the 988 and suicide prevention funding numbers she cited or why they differ from what's noted in the skinny budget. Although it's fairly common to see discrepancies among an administration's various budget documents, attention to these documents — and concerns about differences — are heightened this year amid the Trump team's efforts to radically downsize the government and federal spending. "It's very confusing," said Laurel Stine, chief advocacy and policy officer with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. "We want to ensure that the 988 lifeline is safeguarded," but the only officially released budget document "doesn't speak to it at all." However, those grants are specifically aimed at caring for people with serious mental illness and cannot be spent on suicide prevention for the general public. The administration wants to cut certain tools used for preventing drug overdoses. Some advocates, clinicians, and researchers worry such actions could reverse the recent progress made on overdose deaths. "President Trump says that he wants to protect Americans from fentanyl," said Hanna Sharif-Kazemi, who works on federal affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy organization for people who use drugs. "But the plan that he has outlined in his budget proposal really doesn't match those words." The proposal refers to "harm reduction" efforts, including providing sterile syringes to people using drugs, as "dangerous activities" and suggests federal funds should not support them. But syringe service programs are among the most studied interventions and are proven to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis, without increasing crime or drug use. They also "do so much more than just give syringes," Sharif-Kazemi said, adding that they typically distribute naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, and connect people to resources for food, housing, and treatment, which help keep them alive. Without these programs, infectious diseases are more likely to spread and affect the broader community, said Nestadt, the Johns Hopkins professor. "Eliminating those programs is going to have terrible effects on the population of the United States, regardless of whether they're using opiates or not." Research cuts aimed at "DEI" could worsen disparities in suicide and overdose rates. These actions align with Trump's ongoing attacks on "diversity, equity, and inclusion" programs, which he calls "woke" ideology. Researchers say the proposed cuts, if enacted, could hamper efforts to address racial disparities in mental health and addiction that have become increasingly prominent. Although national overdose deaths dropped last year, rates have increased in many Black and Native American communities. Early in the covid-19 pandemic, when suicide rates decreased for white Americans, they trended in the opposite direction for Black Americans and other communities of color. But when trying to reach urban Black teens who have limited access to health care, "maybe it's a church" or barbershop, he said. Nestadt is currently working on a CDC-funded study in which he interviews the family and friends of Black youths who died by suicide to understand what led to that point and how it could be prevented. He worries his funding could be cut any day. Nothing in any Trump budget proposal is final. Lawmakers hold the power to determine federal spending. Although some advocates worry that congressional Republicans will simply accede to Trump's demands, Whitlock, the McDermott+ consultant, said, "Congress is always going to want to express its will, and this will be no different." Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) held up a packet of naloxone and said the government should amplify what works to decrease overdose deaths instead of shuttering SAMHSA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, NewsMedical speaks with Quanterix about blood spot testing for neurological applications. The most important practice learned after introducing multiple early technologies into regulated markets has been that interesting technologies create a starting point; developing a complete solution that scales globally requires the addition of standards, controls, sustainable training programs, and well-designed quality specifications. My role at Quanterix as Vice President of Product Management is to transform customer feedback into a detailed product description that can be developed and manufactured. The familiar blood draw performed during routine testing is considered “wet” and collected in tubes. While a routine process at this point, the resources required are significant: a trained phlebotomist, sterile device, intravenous puncture, cold chain transportation, and storage. DBS or DPS represents an alternative biocollection method where a much smaller volume of blood is extracted by finger or heel prick and blotted on a membrane. In preparation for analysis, the DBS/DPS is resuspended in liquid and extracted, providing the input to an analytical method. When you combine the reduction of cost and simplification of collection, shipment, storage with access to more patients, DBS/DPS offer tremendous potential advantages and open new opportunities that benefit the clinician, testing laboratory and patient. DBS/DPS remains in an early development stage but has made entry into the clinic. One example is the use of a Hepatitis C confirmatory, but not diagnostic testing. For the above reasons, nearly every blood-based test could benefit if converted from wet tube-based to dry spot-based. Neurodegenerative diseases could especially benefit from dry spot biocollection methods due to the large number of samples that may be required over the course of a 10-20 years of disease progression. DBS/DPS may offer a cost-effective means of monitoring patients with at-home collection followed by ambient shipment to a testing laboratory. The exponential interest in neurology blood-based biomarkers stems from the technical breakthroughs in testing brought about by ultra-sensitive protein quantitation. Blood-based biomarkers for heart and kidney disease reach sufficiently high concentrations that ultra-sensitive analytical methods are not required. The blood-brain barrier provides an important and highly protective environment that limits the availability of biomarker proteins to blood. In application breakthroughs, ultra-sensitive technologies such as Simoa® have demonstrated the ability to detect and quantitate minute amounts of highly informative neuronal biomarkers in plasma and serum. This, in turn, has created a positive feedback mechanism for biomarker discovery. Example biomarkers such as p-Tau 181 and p-Tau 217 were identified by mass spectrometry and subsequently quantitated by Simoa. With those success stories, the neuronal biomarker community is looking for more examples of early detection biomarkers. Within one year, in 2025, all four analytes of the Simoa Neurology 4-plex E assay kit( NfL, GFAP, AB40, Ab42) and p-Tau 217 were successfully measured in a dry plasma spot. Improvements in reproducibility, quantifiability, and standardization are still required, but the proof of concept has already been demonstrated. This is an extremely exciting time for the neurology research space. With an intravenous wet sample blood draw, sample volume is not typically limiting, and 100 uL is routinely provided as input to the assay. With dry blood/plasma spot, the challenge to detect a very small number of molecules increases because the sample available after capture and extraction is nearly ten to fifteen-fold less. The ultra-sensitivity of Simoa offers the possibility to extract exciting information on patient health from a single, cost-effective, and highly accessible drop of blood/plasma. Imaging technologies, such as PET, have provided invaluable metrics for diagnosis and clinical trial enrollment and endpoint criteria. Simoa ultra-sensitivity and DBS enable fundamental advancements to translate into scalable solutions that broadly improve human health. As exciting as it has been to witness the early measurement of neurology biomarkers from a DBS/DPS, the field is just getting started with multiple important milestones ahead. This could be done via improved analytical technologies such as Simoa, larger sampling volumes, more efficient plasma separation, or more effective extraction methods. Multiple controls are also required to monitor key steps in the process, inlcluding loading, plasma separation, extraction, and run controls. After adequate performance and controls are in place, standardization will be required to enable comparability across studies. There is a tremendous amount of work yet to be done. Despite different approaches amongst these devices to collection and separation of blood into plasma, every device requires an extraction step. The proteins once adsorbed to the membrane need to be re-solubilized, collected in a tube and prepared for analysis. The new Simoa dry blood extraction kit, which is based on work done at the University of Gothenberg, provides a simple, off-the-shelf solution for this key step. Early work with the kit has shown effective extraction of p-Tau 217, Nf-l, GFAP, Ab40 and Ab42 in a fashion fully compatible with Simoa analysis. With the clear potential to translate recent biomarker discoveries into scalable health care solutions, multiple groups will work collaboratively to improve the collection device, measure stability, refine extraction methods, improve analytical performance and establish calibrators. Together, we will work toward an RUO solution that iteratively evolves to meet the needs of clinical researchers. Quanterix is committed to partnering closely with researchers to learn how it can help at each step in that process. in Chemistry magna cum laude from Boston University and a Ph.D. from the University of California San Francisco.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, scientists have shown that an established blood-cleansing procedure could help rid the human body of tiny plastic particles, offering hope for new detox solutions amid rising global contamination. ​​​​​​​Study: Therapeutic apheresis: A promising method to remove microplastics? Much evidence suggests that in their degraded form, they have entered living organisms, including the human body. A recent article in the journal Brain Medicine reports on the feasibility of removing such forms of plastics using an established technique called therapeutic apheresis. Microplastics and nanoplastics are forms of plastic with greatest diameters of 1μm–5 mm and <1 μm in greatest diameter, respectively. MNPs may be byproducts of commercial production cycles involving goods like pharmaceutical formulations or cosmetics. They may also represent a degradation stage of waste plastic. Filters showed zero plastic particles before treatment. Prerinsed apheresis equipment tested clean, confirming detected particles came solely from patients' bloodstreams. MNP exist everywhere in the world, including marine and forest environments. Recent research hints strongly at their threat to human health and potentially links them to multiple health conditions. The scientific paper notes that due to current methodological limitations, it's often more precise to speak of MNPs or MNP-like structures, which may involve MNPs combined with other molecules like proteins, and that reports on MNP presence in tissues should be interpreted with some caution. These include cardiometabolic disease (such as stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome), cancer, infertility, dementia, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Such disorders may be triggered or accelerated by the presence of MNPs. For instance, some scientists postulate that MNPs taken up by adrenal gland tissue may disrupt the normal production of adrenal steroids like cortisol. This may explain why many viral infections are currently followed by chronic fatigue after clinical recovery. A further theory is that MNPs help carry infectious agents into cells and tissues. Currently, MNP exposure is unavoidable, leading researchers to investigate whether it can be effectively removed from the body. At present, this technique is used to remove certain blood components, such as cells or plasma proteins. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) has been dramatically more prevalent in recent years. This is associated with increasing air pollution by particles 10μm or less in size. In an earlier study by the same authors, ME/CFS patients reported a 70% improvement in symptoms after they received this therapy. It is important to note that this prior observation related to symptom improvement and did not specifically investigate MNP removal. Chronic fatigue cases spiked alongside PM10 pollution – A 2024 study connected ME/CFS surges to environmental particles ≤10 μm, mirroring the apheresis patient cohort's triggers. In the current study, 21 patients who had post-infectious ME/CFS were treated using two cycles of therapeutic apheresis, or more, using double filtration. The concentrated eluate was measured by a sophisticated analytical method called attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy. It's important to note that this analysis does not quantitatively measure MNPs; it only determines whether MNP-like particles are present or not. This revealed 14 types of substances or mixtures resembling MNP-like particles in the eluates from these patients, but not the prerinse fluid. Some of these particles were 200 nm in size or smaller. This might be due to the presence of polyamide 6, a synthetic polymer primarily produced as a fiber rather than a particle, which is manufactured as electrospun fibers <100 nm for some specialized applications. This spectroscopic method identifies the presence of polyamide bonds, though this may indicate the presence of proteins as well. This study reports for the first time a method that might potentially be used to remove MNP-like particles from the human body. Larger studies are required to validate this application. Moreover, the plasma MNP levels pre- and post-apheresis need to be measured quantitatively, along with eluate MNPs, in more than one apheresis cycle. The clinical effects of MNP removal from the body also need confirmation, and it must be emphasized that such effects are not yet established by this preliminary research.
