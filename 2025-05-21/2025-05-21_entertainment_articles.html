Sofia Coppola is recalling the moment she realized “The Virgin Suicides” was an iconic film — and it's all thanks to Leslie Mann and Maude Apatow. Coppola told i-D during the 25th anniversary of her 2000 directorial debut that she had no idea Gen Z was aware of the film until she was on set for her 2013 feature “The Bling Ring.” During production, actress Mann cited how her daughter was a fan of the film. (Coppola had previously confirmed to Vogue that Maude Apatow is fan.) Related Stories Cannes 2025 Palme d'Or Contenders Ranked: Who Could Win the Top Prize? When asked if “a fan or someone [has] come up to you and said something that's really left a mark about your work or the meaning that it's had on them,” Coppola cited her discussion with Mann. “I was working on a project with Leslie Mann and she said ‘My daughter loves your movie “The Virgin Suicides.”‘ This was maybe 12 years ago,” Coppola said. “I was like, ‘How does she even know about that? I was just really surprised, and it made me so happy.” I am very moved that girls today still connect to it. The film, despite grossing just under $5 million in the U.S. against a $9 million budget, later became a cult classic synonymous with the melancholic realization that teenage longing and ennui can extend into adulthood. The film went on to also influence the aesthetics of female-focused melancholic adolescent series, such as “Euphoria,” which stars Maude Apatow. Coppola previously told ELLE that she and lead star Kirsten Dunst have plans to mark the 25th anniversary of “The Virgin Suicides.” (Dunst and Coppola have reunited on features “Marie Antoinette” and “The Beguiled.”) “I think Kirsten [Dunst] and I will plan to do some screenings or something around it,” Coppola said of “The Virgin Suicides” turning 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump spent much of Wednesday's Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa rambling about disproven claims and conspiracy theories that white South African farmers are the victims of a genocide. Ramaphosa was not interested in indulging Trump's delusions about his country. When a reporter asked Trump what it would take for him to believe that there was no white genocide taking place in South Africa, Ramaphosa interjected to say that such a shift would require Trump actually “listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom he is good friends with, like those who are here.” Nevertheless, Trump has granted refugee status to over 50 white South Africans, and banned the government from participating in this year's G20 summit, which is set to be hosted by South Africa. The claim that South African whites — particularly white farmers and Afrikaners — have been the targets of systematic, genocidal, anti-white violence in post-Apartheid South Africa has existed for decades, and is an extension of global white genocide conspiracy theories. According to a data review by The New York Times, between April 2020 and March 2024, South African police reported 225 farm murders. “Fifty-three of the victims were farmers, who are usually white.” Trump seemed unmoved in Wednesday's meeting, at one point handing Ramaphosa — who repeatedly attempted to correct the president's narrative in as respectful manner as possible — a stack of printed articles he said were related to the murder of a white farmer. “It's in South Africa,” Trump replied, without stating a specific location.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sources tell Deadline that he's come aboard to co-star in Breakthrough, a psychological thriller penned by up-and-comer Zeke Goodman. Set in turn-of-the-millennium Southern California, the story follows an alienated young man who comes under the influence of a motivational guru, whose intoxicating charm masks his morally questionable methods of manipulation and his own concealed darkness. There's no director on the project yet, but it will be produced and financed by A24. In recent years, Johnson has been attaching himself to projects that show a different side to his capabilities as a performer, and Breakthrough is no different in that respect. Earlier this year, he set up Ripped, an adaptation of the short story by Joe Ballarini, at 20th Century Studios, with an eye to produce via Seven Bucks and potentially star. This isn't the only high-profile project he has there at the moment, as he's also set to star opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Emily Blunt in 20th's untitled Hawaiian crime pic to be directed by Martin Scorsese. Next up, Johnson will be seen playing MMA fighter Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine, a possible awards contender from director Benny Safdie that's slated for release October 3. Goodman is a multi-hyphenate writer, director and actor who started his career as the star of Amazon's I Know What You Did Last Summer reboot and their series reboot of Cruel Intentions. Both he and Johnson are repped by WME. Johnson is also represented by Gang, Tyre, Ramer; and Goodman by Lighthouse Management & Media and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.

Joey King is in negotiations to star alongside Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman in Practical Magic 2, Warner Bros.'s Pictures sequel to the 1998 movie. Bullock and Kidman are reprising their roles as witch sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, who in the original movie fight a family curse that dispatches the men with whom they fall in love.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday, three-year-old Trigg Kiser died following a drowning incident. According to local NBC affiliate 12 News, authorities responded to a call in Chandler, Arizona where they found the boy unconscious after being pulled out of a pool. “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the child's family and loved ones during this unimaginable time,” said Chandler Police spokesperson Sonu Wasu in a statement. Trigg was the son of Emilie Kiser, a 26-year-old Arizona-based mom and beauty influencer who has 3.6 million TikTok followers and 1.4 million Instagram followers. (Neither Kiser nor her representatives have issued a statement, and didn't respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.) People posted videos comparing footage from the news report to Zillow listings of Kaiser's house, insisting that the boy who drowned must have been her son. There were tearful videos where creators prayed for Trigg's wellbeing and others where people redoubled their investigative efforts to prove that Trigg was the boy who had drowned. TikTok creators pointed to the fact that Kiser (and many of her close friends who are also influencers) hadn't posted in days. Kiser is among the most popular mom creators on TikTok and has welcomed millions of fans into her family's life. Trigg was a regular staple in Kiser's content, as Emilie showed footage of her getting the young boy ready for the day, playing with him, or putting him down for a nap. The ones viewers form with mom creators can be particularly intense, according to Jess Rauchberg, an assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University. It feels like you're spending the morning with your best friend,” Rauchberg says. On Monday, news reports confirmed that Trigg had died. That didn't surprise Brandon Harris, a professor of social media analytics and production at the University of Alabama who studies parasocial relationships. “For better or worse, these content creators are public figures and celebrities at this point,” he says. “We can debate the limit of what the expectation of privacy should be but they have primarily made their wealth by making their lives accessible to other people.” And fans seem to expect that access even in the wake of unimaginable tragedy. There was also an outpouring of grief on social media, as viewers and fans struggled to understand the death of a boy with whom they had formed such a parasocial bond. Creators posted videos of themselves sobbing onto the camera. One video with hundreds of thousands of views offered the Kiser family a place to stay if they wanted to leave Arizona. Another account, which has now been deleted, posed as Emilie posting a tribute to her late son. The tragedy becomes so much more than just a family's grief or a community's grief when millions of people are now grieving with you,” Rauchberg says.

An unsubstantiated rumor that Emilie refused to have a pool fence installed because it wasn't aesthetically pleasing has been often repeated. They looked through her content, trying to pinpoint where she was when the drowning incident occurred. The TikTok videos addressing the Kaiser family tragedy largely fall into two categories: grieving Trigg or blaming his parents for his death. One mom creator posted a TikTok of herself overlaid with the words, “Anyone else questioning how much of their life they share online after seeing Emilie Kiser get ripped apart by the internet?” In another video, a creator who posts about being a mom in law school said, “I just want you guys to know this will be the last public video from me. The things that I've seen after someone going through the worst thing imaginable are vile and disgusting and I don't wanna share my life.

The false notes are rare in director Oliver Hermanus' affecting and dustily textured romance “The History of Sound,” written by Ben Shattuck from his own short story about men in love, together and apart, circa World War I and its aftermath. But for a queer love story starring two of the hottest, of-this-moment leading actors around — Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor — “The History of Sound” almost perversely denies your expectations of what a gay romance could be. The grandiose, sweeping emotional gestures toward repression and latent desire out of something like “Brokeback Mountain” are nowhere here, Hermanus instead following the lonesome Lionel (Mescal) around America's hidden corners and eventually into Europe for much of this melancholy mood movie. Related Stories Martin Scorsese to Be at the Center of Apple Docuseries ‘Mr. Scorsese' Michelle Williams Is Unsure If ‘Blue Valentine' Could Be Made Today: ‘I Don't Know If Anybody Could Work Like That Again' While “The History of Sound” suffers from some pacing issues and detours that turn up as dead ends, following Lionel's path as a budding ethnomusicologist collecting songs and sounds to record on cylinders, this is a lovely movie capable of wounding and haunting you. The Irish “Normal People” breakout and “Aftersun” Best Actor Oscar nominee seizes the opportunity for understated emotions that are a far cry from the swords and sandals of his most recent film and franchise debut, “Gladiator II.” “My father said it was a gift from God that I could see music,” says the older Lionel, played by a wistful Chris Cooper in 1980. “My father would play B minor, and my mouth would turn bitter.” Lionel is revealed to possess a kind of Nabokovian synesthesia that transforms his ear for sound and music into a kaleidoscope of feeling and mental process. They go to bed together in one of the film's demure nods at sex — I wouldn't call any of the lovemaking onscreen in “History of Sound” sex scenes per se, besides one scene involving Lionel's later relationship with a woman (Emma Canning). “The History of Sound” never comes out and says, “These men are gay!,” nor does it strain to depict self-inflicted and necessary repressions of queer men at the time. Though that's not to say that Hermanus' film — closer in tone to the South African director's 2019 portrait of apartheid-era pining, “Moffie,” than his 2022 looking-back-on-your-life Oscar bid “Living” — isn't about queer suffering. The two men eventually embark on an impromptu journey through the backwoods of Maine to collect American heritage songs sung by the local people, a kind of self-enterprise academic assignment whose aims and goals they aren't sure of just yet. But it gives Lionel and David time to spend together, in each other's arms naked in a tent, over a handful of nights and weeks, away from the rest of the world. “The History of Sound” is careful not to reveal too early or too explicitly how much David and Lionel are feeling for each other, though a trepidated departure at a train station tells you what you need to know: “See you next summer?” “Sure.” Lionel shakes in David's farewell embrace over what could be the last time they see each other. Shattuck's script and story more intimately follow Lionel on his own expedition into a sentimental education. In later years an established music teacher, he appears to have had some kind of fraught relationship or hook-up situation with a European protégé while teaching in shimmery, summery Italy, though the closest he's able to get to anyone other than David is his girlfriend Clarissa (Canning, in a short but sharp performance), a musician who wants Lionel to meet her parents. Clarissa's mother warns her to leave him, as Lionel seems to radiate only sadness and a secret within, David probably never not on his mind over the years. (Cinematographer Alexander Dynan gorgeously captures Lionel's chapter in Europe with all the glimmery tactile feel of a Luca Guadagnino movie, where moments trudging through the American middle-of-nowhere adopt a more muted palette.) Composer Oliver Coates, who coincidentally also provided the ethereal, regret-twinged music for “Aftersun,” writes an original folk score for this film that stands on its own, with Mescal also doing his own singing and evoking a Kentucky accent that's both boyishly earnest and tentatively coy. That's partially due to outside social forces that demand their love be kept private, behind closed doors or the canvases of a tent, but Hermanus and Shattuck aren't interested in piling on that context, which has already been explored in so many other movies more directly. And I speak on behalf of queer audience members such as myself when I say we are, at this point, over it anyway as a storytelling cue. “The History of Sound” is as plaintive and lilting as a piano note in minor key, never wallowing in its own misery but still keen to explore the psychic sensations, afterglow, and wreckage of a meaningful connection. The emotions flood and hit hard, though, in a final chapter in which Lionel encounters David's eventual wife Belle (Hadley Robinson, who gives a stirring monologue), who is restless and desperate for company and hopes Lionel will stay for just a little bit longer. There's a shot of a cigarette left to burn on its own in an empty kitchen that epitomizes Hermanus' patient gaze, never in a rush to move things (such as things like the course of love) along for the sake of narrative momentum. He just can't come out and say that, forced to live in a closet that “History of Sound” never identifies or addresses, and the film is better for it. The soundtrack takes a bracing hairpin turn when Joy Division's post-punk epic ballad “Atmosphere” jolts in, a shocking clash against the folk songs prior, songs that almost evoke Arthur Russell, the sound of a man alone in the woods with his thoughts, ruminating over his desires, where it all went wrong or was left unsaid. “Don't walk away in silence,” Joy Division's Ian Curtis sings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho's Brazilian movie The Secret Agent, which has been rumored to be a finalist for the Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or, is having its stateside rights scooped up by Neon. A theatrical release is in the works for this year. If the 1977-set political thriller takes home Cannes' big prize, it will give Neon a sixth consecutive Palme d'Or win following last year's Anora, Justine Triet's 2023 winner Anatomy of a Fall, 2022's Triangle of Sadness, 2021's Titane and 2019's Parasite. Out of that bunch, Anora and Parasite won Best Picture Oscars. The pic stars Wagner Moura, Maria Fernanda Cândido, Gabriel Leone, Carlos Francisco, Alice Carvalho and Hermila Guedes. He arrives in Recife during carnival week, hoping to reunite with his son but soon realizes the city is far from being the non-violent refuge he seeks.The film was produced by Emilie Lesclaux. It is a Cinemasópio, MK Productions, Lemming Film and One Two Films presentation. MK2 Films is repping foreign sales.The deal was negotiated by Neon's Sarah Colvin and Jeff Deutchman with MK2 Films' Fionnuala Jamison on behalf of the filmmakers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 American Music Awards will showcase a wide range of performers, from 22-year-old Benson Boone, who has back-flipped his way to stardom in the past year, to 80-year-old Sir Rod Stewart, who is set to receive a lifetime achievement award. This will mark Stewart's first time on the AMAs stage since 2004. She previously hosted in 2015, when she opened the show with a performance of her 1999 hit “Waiting for Tonight” leading into a dance medley of the year's biggest hits. Two other performers on this year's show are past AMAs hosts. Stewart co-hosted in 1989 with Anita Baker, Debbie Gibson and Kenny Rogers. As previously announced, Janet Jackson will receive the Icon Award, which recognizes an artist whose body of work has marked a global influence over the music industry. Gwen Stefani will perform a medley celebrating the 20th anniversary of her debut solo album Love.Angel.Music.Baby, including her Billboard Hot 100-topping smash “Hollaback Girl,” and a song from her newest album, Bouquet, which was released in November. Fresh from winning four awards at the 2025 Academy of Country Music Awards, country music star Lainey Wilson will perform. Breakout artist and first-time American Music Award nominee Benson Boone will perform his latest single, “Mystical Magical,” from his upcoming sophomore album American Heart, which is due June 20. Three-time American Music Award winner Blake Shelton will make his AMAs performance debut with a track from his new album, For Recreational Use Only, which was released on May 9. Tickets to the show are available now on Ticketmaster. Nominees are based on key fan interactions — as reflected on the Billboard charts — including streaming, album and song sales, radio airplay and tour grosses. The AMAs and Easy Day Foundation, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit organization committed to helping veterans transition to civilian life, will partner to present several in-show moments that celebrate veterans while raising funds for a variety of national and local organizations. The show will also livestream on Harmony, Penske Media's proprietary live streaming platform that can be viewed across Penske Media's owned and operated websites, including Variety, Rolling Stone, The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, WWD, Deadline, Vibe, IndieWire and Gold Derby. The AMAs have also identified additional presenters and participants, including Nikki Glaser, who hosted this year's Golden Globe Awards and has already been tapped to host next year's show. Here is a list of performers and presenters on the 2025 American Music Awards. Additional names will be added as they are announced. The American Music Awards are produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Penske Media Eldridge, a joint venture between Eldridge Industries and Billboard parent company Penske Media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Season 23 “American Idol” winner Jamal Roberts' victory on May 18, 2025, came with an undisclosed cash prize, an album development deal with 19 Recordings, and newfound fame. But the dad of three from Meridian, Mississippi, likely never imagined his win would also lead to country superstar Carrie Underwood naming a farm animal after him. On May 21, 2025, Underwood — who won the competition in 2005 and returned as a judge in 2025 — posted a series of adorable photos on Instagram of a newborn lamb at her Nashville farm, born the same day as the “American Idol” finale. We've got another new life around the farm! This little guy happened to be born on the day of the @americanidol finale, so we figured it would only be right if we named him Jamal!!! Fans and friends instantly swooned over the adorable newborn lamb and the name Underwood chose for him, with one fan writing, “Never in a MILLION years did Jamal Roberts dream that Carrie Underwood would name a lamb after him!! 😂 This takes dreams coming true to a WHOLE nother level!! Contemporary Christian artist Brandon Lake, who performed several times on season 23 of “American Idol,” excitedly commented, “JAMAL!! The “American Idol” social media team chimed in, “Already lookin' like a winner 🏆✨” “This is absolutely a perfect name,” one fan wrote, and another agreed, “Jamal is the perfect name for this cutie ! Given Roberts' penchant for wearing no shirt under his suits and vests, one fan quipped, “Jamal is sooooooooooo cute!!!! Good thing he wont need a shirt with that coat 🧥 Amazing Mama and baby.” “I gotta just love it because people are gonna have their opinions all over the world, but if you post and ghost, I ain't worried about it. Underwood shared her advice during the April 28 episode, as she was providing feedback to contestant Breanna Nix about not letting naysayers' voices get into her head. “I want to tell you all an important trick,” Underwood said. I don't hear or see any of it. Underwood acknowledged to Parade Magazine that social media is a necessity for artists building their fan bases and trying to gain exposure, but said it can also erode their sense of confidence. “Even when I was on the show 20 years ago, we had message boards,” she explained. But you had to seek it out a little more. Now, it's in your face no matter what you do. It's part of the deal because you want to gain fans and it's such a huge way to do that.” So becoming comfortable within yourself and what you do, putting it out there for people to see and looking at the people that you like to follow (is my advice).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year's installment will kick off with My Mom Jayne on Thursday July 17. The film, Hargitay's feature directorial debut, had its world premiere at Cannes and is set to screen at New York's Tribeca Festival in June before its HBO premiere in June. SummerDocs will also feature a screening of the coming-of-age documentary, Middletown, directed by Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss about a group of students and their renegade English teacher who made an investigative documentary that rocked their upstate New York community, on Aug. 29. Both screenings will take place at East Hampton's Guild Hall and be followed by conversations with HamptonsFilm co-chair Alec Baldwin and artistic director David Nugent. Mariska Hargitay Reveals Identity of Her Biological Father, Says She Was "Living a Lie My Entire Life" “Now in its 17th year, our SummerDocs Series continues to spotlight some of the most talked-about and buzzy documentaries of the season, and 2025 is no exception,” Nugent said in a statement. “The two films we've selected this summer have already generated outstanding audience response, and we're thrilled to share them with our East End audiences.” HamptonsFilm has also set the lineup for its free outdoor screenings on Wednesday nights throughout the summer at East Hampton's Herrick Park and Main Beach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ad was endorsed by more than 250 notable figures across music, film, sports and fashion. As attacks on reproductive freedom continue to rise in the United States, more than 250 public figures — including Harry Styles, Megan Thee Stallion and Olivia Rodrigo — have banded together to throw their support behind Planned Parenthood. In a letter published as a full-page ad in The New York Times Wednesday (May 21), the British pop star, Houston rapper and “Vampire” singer were just three of the hundreds of musicians, actors, designers, athletes and influencers who signed their names next to the statement “I'm for Planned Parenthood.” Addison Rae, Chelsea Cutler, Clairo, Cyndi Lauper, Del Water Gap, Gracie Abrams, Jack Antonoff, Jason Isbell, King Princess, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Maggie Rogers were also among the musicians who endorsed the message, as were Meghan Trainor, Phoebe Bridgers, Rebecca Black, R.E.M., Remi Wolf, Sara Bareilles, Sharon Van Etten, Sheryl Crow, Soccer Mommy, St. Vincent, Stevie Nicks and Tegan and Sara. In addition to aligning themselves with the nonprofit by adding their names, signatories also acknowledged that “Americans are losing more of our freedom to decide how we live our own lives” with their signatures. “1 in 4 people in the U.S. have been to a Planned Parenthood health center for care: birth control, cancer screenings, wellness exams, STI testing and treatment, abortion, gender affirming care and more,” continues a message accompanying the letter on Planned Parenthood's website. Other stars who signed include actors Pedro Pascal, Mikey Madison, Scarlett Johansson, Christina Ricci, Ellen Pompeo, Laura Dern, Melissa McCarthy, Laverne Cox and Natasha Lyonne, as well as Jimmy Kimmel, Karlie Kloss, Shonda Rhimes, Gloria Steinem, Trixie Mattel, Sofia Coppola and Cara Delevigne. “Every day, Planned Parenthood health center staff open the doors of health centers to ensure patients — no matter who they are — can get access to the essential health care they need,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement. The letter comes as reproductive rights are more at risk now than they've been in decades. Since re-entering the White House in January for his second term — two and a half years after Roe v. Wade was overturned — President Donald Trump's administration has enacted a number of policies restricting access to reproductive healthcare, cutting public health programs centered around reproductive healthcare and removing legal protections for reproductive healthcare clinics and providers, all within his first 100 days in office, according to a report by the Center for Reproductive Rights. It also comes about a month after Planned Parenthood rallied support while honoring Rodrigo at its 2025 Spring Into Action Gala in New York City on April 24. She added at the time, “My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.”</p>

Avery Tucker, formerly half of Girlpool, has shared a new song. “Big Drops” is Tucker's debut solo single, and he co-wrote and co-produced it with frequent A. G. Cook collaborator Alaska Reid. In a press statement, he described the song as “a story about loving and losing someone who is finding themselves time and time again overtaken by the big drop.” Watch the accompanying music video, directed by Lilliya Scarlett Reid, below.

Girlpool, the Los Angeles–based duo of Tucker and Harmony Tividad, broke up in 2022, a few months after the release of their final album, Forgiveness. Last year, Tividad shared the album Gossip, her first proper studio album.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Armed vocalist Tony Wolski said of the clip, which depicts two men fighting over a jet ski, “While we chase distractions and small comforts, we're pushed into endless competition with each other—often while those with real power take freely, right in front of us.” He added of the album: “It's music for a statistically wealthy population that somehow can't afford food or medicine—endlessly scrolling past vacation photos, gym selfies, and images of child amputees in the same feed. It reflects the dissociation required just to exist in that reality.” They'll be joined at all dates by fellow Michiganders Prostitute.
