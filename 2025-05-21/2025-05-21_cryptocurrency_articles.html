                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solaxy (SOLX), a project building a Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, has passed $38 million in raised funds, making it one of the largest meme coin presales of 2025. Yet Solana's rise has not been without friction, network congestion continues to plague the system during peak times. Solaxy aims to tackle this challenge head-on with its innovative solutions. Currently priced at $0.001728 per token, SOLX increases in value with every new presale stage, giving early participants an edge before exchange listings go live. With more users entering the Solana ecosystem, issues around network congestion and failed transactions are becoming increasingly evident. Solaxy aims to fix this issue with its upcoming Layer-2 scaling solution. Instead of having every transaction processed on Solana's mainnet, Solaxy plans to execute most operations off the main chain. Developers will be able to tailor dApps to suit their own unique needs, whether that's DeFi applications, NFT platforms, or high-traffic meme coin projects. This flexibility allows for broader use-case implementation beyond traditional blockchain limitations. Users can already view live testnet data, offering insight into how the full rollout may look. ClayBro, a crypto analyst and YouTuber with over 136,000 subscribers, has recently shared his optimistic outlook on Solaxy. According to ClayBro, Solaxy's strength lies in its dual appeal: it offers both a strong meme coin narrative and genuine utility. He emphasizes that most of the project's impressive $38 million presale raise took place during Q1 2025, a period many viewed as volatile and uncertain. This early traction is a strong indicator of investor confidence. As Solaxy prepares for broader adoption, ClayBro suggests that it could become a long-term player in the scaling solutions space, especially if it properly executes the current roadmap plans. The project currently offers an impressive 107% APY (annual percentage yield), allowing SOLX holders to earn passive income by locking up their tokens. At present, over 10.7 billion SOLX tokens have already been staked, a figure that continues to grow. This staking model not only encourages user engagement but also contributes to token scarcity and long-term ecosystem health. Momentum behind the Solaxy presale shows no sign of slowing. With over $38 million raised, demand is surging as investors look to secure their SOLX holdings before the price increases in upcoming stages. SOLX tokens are available for purchase through the official Solaxy presale website using ETH, USDT, BNB, or bank cards. Between its upcoming Layer-2 rollout, strong analyst sentiment, and attractive staking incentives, Solaxy is positioning itself as a standout presale of 2025. While no investment is without risk, Solaxy's development roadmap and community traction make it a project worth monitoring closely. Readers should do their own research before taking any action related to cryptocurrencies. The world's largest crypto reached $109,767 earlier today, giving it a market cap of over $2.17 trillion. Apart from the large-cap cryptos that made their moves, sectors like AI came out as one of the fastest-growing niches, now valued at $6.5 billion. This achievement follows record highs for Bitcoin and comes alongside increasing regulatory clarity, as evidenced by SEC Chair Paul Atkins' positive statements about his […] This expansion—achieved through acquiring a Cypriot investment firm—allows Kraken to offer perpetual and fixed-term crypto futures to retail and institutional investors across the European Economic Area.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Altman's blockchain project World Network has raised $135 million in a private token sale of its WLD token. The sale was to venture capital giants a16z and Bain Capital Crypto and will be used to fund network expansion, the team shared. WLD is higher by 14% on the news. “To meet increasing demand for Orb-verified World IDs and support the expansion of the World network throughout the U.S. and beyond, World Assets, Ltd. (a subsidiary of the World Foundation) sold $135M of WLD at market prices to two of the project's earliest backers, Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto. The WLD token was created at launch in July 2023,  and it currently has a market capitalization of $1.87 billion and is up 55% in the last month, according to CoinMarketCap. WLD though is down roughly 75% from its all time high. Until earlier this month, U.S. users were unable to use World's primary product, their orbs, a bowling ball-shaped device that scans a person's eyeballs to confirm their identity. Once they scan, users can access the World app and receive an airdrop of the WLD token, which can then be used in World's miniapps ecosystem. Margaux Nijkerk reports on the Ethereum protocol and L2s.

CoinMarketCap has unveiled its latest AI-powered assistant, CMC AI, that will serve up a set of predefined questions and answers on price movements, token fundamentals, and sentiment with a single click on all major token pages. This is a prime example of how AI agents and tech are shaping real-world experiences. We'll also suggest a similar AI agent token (MIND of Pepe) you can invest in to make the most of the upcoming AI investment era. The CMC AI interacts with a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI and feeds it a prompt that includes the latest price data of various tokens. For major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the answers are updated every 30 minutes. For other tokens, however, updates will roll out if the price moves more than 2% in an hour. The biggest benefit of CMC AI is that it reduces repeated search queries on these LLMs. For example, millions of investors would want to ask ChatGPT, ‘Why is the bitcoin price going up?' This leads to a lot of API calls and LLM running costs. With CMC AI, such repeated requests can be eliminated, resulting in large-scale cost savings. It's worth noting that CMC AI's initial rollout is only the first phase of CoinMarketCap's host of planned AI updates, which will gradually roll out throughout 2025. Upcoming features include trending market data on the CoinMarketCap homepage, custom question answers with conversational AI LLM tools, and personalized answers based on your watchlist, portfolio, and investment interests. AI agents are rapidly finding new applications and making their way into real-world scenarios. Don't mistake MIND of Pepe for just another AI assistant. It's a never-before-seen intelligent AI agent built from the ground up to identify the next cryptos to explode, i.e., cheap presale tokens poised for growth. $MIND will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X. Unlike typical AI chatbots that feel sterile and boring to talk to, however, $MIND will serve up a user-friendly and context-aware tone, engaging crypto degens like never before. We were blown away when we found out that MIND of Pepe has also been programmed to understand crypto-native lingo, prevalent memes, and the overall mindset of the crypto trading community. Once it's gathered the crypto community's varying opinions on different tokens, $MIND will use its cutting-edge hive-mind analysis system to deliver actionable trading insights to its token holders. It's worth noting that besides social sentiment, MIND of Pepe will also gather real-time on-chain activity and things like market data APIs to help it spot and connect everything relevant for the AI agent to offer good trading calls. In addition to being fully autonomous, MIND of Pepe will also be self-evolving. Seeing as $MIND will have access to CoinMarketCap, DexScreener, and Solana-specific metrics (like token creation, wallet activity, and early LP behavior), there's really no arguing that $MIND's own tokens could very well be in a pole position to become the next top trending cryptos. Luckily for you, the project is still in its presale. Each token is currently available for just $0.0037515, but interested investors should really hurry up because the presale will end in less than 10 days from now. Our MIND of Pepe's price prediction found it could easily be the next crypto to explode. According to our research, $MIND could reach $0.030 by the end of 2030. If this holds true, you could see a nearly 800x return on your investment. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With an ever-growing timeline of titles, spanning back further and further, it seems that some real gems may fall through the cracks. This type of interactive entertainment benefits tremendously from word of mouth, though, with players passing their recommendations on to each other, in the hope that a game might find its footing when that effect begins to snowball. Luckily, one well-respected critic and video game developer has pointed audiences in the direction of Ico, a fantastic game from 2001 which still hasn't garnered the attention that it so sorely deserves. So, this is a good opportunity to dive into why Hideo Kojima recommended this old-school title at all and how it has actually gone on to influence the video game industry in general. Ico might not be overly easy to find and play today, considering it was launched on the PlayStation 2, but retro gamers should absolutely hunt out this lost icon. Hideo Kojima, known for his work on Death Stranding, Metal Gear Solid, and Snatcher, has created quite the reputation. Because gamers and movie buffs alike look to the creator for his opinion on just about anything. His film reviews have become the stuff of legend at this point, with Kojima refusing to say anything at all about the movies he feels fail to live up to expectations. But if the developer gets behind a film, like Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, then the world is going to know about it. Well, back in 2001, Hideo Kojima got behind a video game that would soon fade into the history books, despite his love for the title. The game, as established, was Ico, and Hideo Kojima has named it as one of the greatest games ever made. In fact, Kojima was so heavily influenced by the title that he claims that it has actually impacted his own work, citing that the visuals in games like Metal Gear Solid directly draw from this gameplay experience. And he's not the only one to do so. Several other creators have also shared in this adulation for Ico and its visual palette, which is cinematically rich and always focused on narrative above all else. Ico has shaped a whole generation of designers, but it also had a profound impact on the team that worked on the game. Metal Gear Solid was a genre-defying work of video game artistry, and it still holds up as the most game-changing entry in Konami's iconic franchise. The studio was full of like-minded geniuses, all content to continue experimenting within their small area of the industry. A few notable names worked on Ico, including director Fumito Ueda, who also directed on Team Ico's two other notable releases, and producer Kenji Kaido, who also worked on the Tomba! Famous composer Michiru Ōshima put together the score for the game, having established himself in anime and on games like Legend of Legaia, and eventually The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. The team behind Ico is essentially full of significant talents who prove that they are so much more than the sum of their parts when they are brought together. Perhaps that's why Ico had such an effect on so many other storytellers. So, Hideo Kojima might have had some fond words to say about Ico, and the team behind the hit is of great value, but what about the forgotten PlayStation 2 game actually made it such a must-play experience? Well, Ico began with a stunning premise that saw players take control of the titular boy, after he is taken away to be sacrificed by a group of warriors. While exploring the castle he has been abducted to, Ico finds a girl called Yorda, who is also imprisoned here and somehow connected to the fortress itself. When it's revealed that the Queen won't let them escape because she believes she can live out a new life within Yorda, her supposed daughter, Ico, is forced to finally confront the forces of evil head-on. It's a story dripping in tension and drama, but one that also possesses real heart as Ico and Yorda build their bonds in the most difficult of situations. Narratively, this is a standout piece of work, but the development team always supported that storytelling with their own expert mechanics and visuals. Hideo Kojima shared some thoughts about being a creative online, and it has some fans wondering about his future in games. But there's real scope and ambition to the castle players explore, and a sense of world-building whenever a new area is accessed. The true strength of this title is its cinematic lighting, which adds grandeur to every scene, especially with complex key frame animation. Ico also relied upon classic platform level design, with intriguing puzzles to solve, and a third-person camera rig that always moved in unexpected ways. Ico's legacy is one of risk-taking and looking for ways to add wrinkles to a genre that perhaps had been seen a little too often. It excels in its mission, and it's no wonder that so many creatives feel that the legacy of the game is so powerful. Unfortunately, Ico was never a commercial hit, with the difficult PlayStation 2 game overlooked even at the time of its release. But the critics always smiled down upon its inventive spirit. In 2011, 10 years on from its release, an HD version of Ico was released on the PlayStation 3; a version of the game that should be a lot more accessible for modern audiences. The production of Metal Gear Solid almost came to a screeching halt. However, PlayStation has been particularly interested in its own history as of late, and perhaps Ico's role in that will be recognized again, despite it never quite forming the connection with audiences that developers hoped it would be able to cement. But players who are interested in the legacy of this title, its impact on the industry, and why it came to have such an effect on creators like Hideo Kojima should know that this title deserves a moment of their time. It has, without a doubt, one of the most moving finales to any video game, resulting in a truly satisfying encounter. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Franchises like Final Fantasy and even Pokémon are stepping away from turn-based combat, but new games are stepping in to fill the void. Some classic Sega Dreamcast games, including Sonic Adventure and Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers, are actually not that great.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond. Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold. Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether's ETHUSD price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade. This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher. ETH holders returning to profit after unrealized losses “provides meaningful financial relief for many holders, signaling a bullish outlook,” Glassnode explained in its latest report. Historically, during the early phase of a rally, holders in profit provided upward momentum by holding firm and attracting new investors. This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. As Cointelegraph reported, holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest. Despite Ether's recent outperformance, Glassnode analysts noted that the Active Realized Price still sits overhead around $2,900 and remains a key level that must be “decisively reclaimed to support continued improvement in investor confidence” in the altcoin. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades also said that ETH price must “convincingly break” out of the $2,400-$2,600 range before rising higher to confront high-timeframe resistance between $2,800 and $2,850. According to Ether's cost basis distribution data, investors hold approximately 2.27 million ETH at an average cost basis of $2,767, creating a potential resistance zone. This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Ether's upward momentum. From a technical perspective, ETH must flip the $3,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs above $4,000. ETH price dropped below this level in February, driven by risk-off sentiment following Trump's tariff measures. ​​One positive catalyst for the bulls could be continued demand from spot Ethereum ETFs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has set a new all-time high just nine days after the US and China closed a 90-day trade agreement, easing economic uncertainty and market jitters. Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high after a temporary trade agreement between the United States and China eased macroeconomic fears and boosted investor confidence. Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%. US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs were seen as the biggest macroeconomic threat to traditional equities and cryptocurrency markets in 2025. Bitcoin briefly fell to a year-to-date low of $74,434 on April 7, five days after Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, sending shockwaves across global markets, with the S&P 500 losing more than $5 trillion in value, its largest drop to date. Bitcoin started its recovery on April 9 after Trump's Liberation Day marked the “climax of uncertainty” for market participants, Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph at the time. Bitcoin kicked off May with a “near-flawless setup, catalyzed by a rare alignment of geopolitical de-escalation, improving regulatory optics and macroeconomic tailwinds,” according to Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex exchange. Russia and Ukraine “will immediately start negotiations towards a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” Trump said in a May 19 X post, summarizing his two-hour call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This revolutionary technology bridges the gap between NFTs and memecoins, solving long-standing liquidity challenges while preserving the unique identity and rarity characteristics of digital collectibles. The Chillonic collection introduces a paradigm shift in how digital assets function by allowing holders to seamlessly convert between NFTs and fungible tokens. This dual-state capability solves the fundamental limitations that have plagued both asset classes: “For the first time, NFT holders can access instant liquidity without sacrificing rarity and identity, while memecoin traders can acquire meaningful digital assets with genuine community and cultural value.” Chillonic has engineered a unique “Double Flywheel” mechanism that drives sustainable growth through both liquidity and attention: “This model represents a fundamental evolution in how digital assets capture and maintain value,” noted SEN. “By connecting liquidity with attention, we're building a self-reinforcing ecosystem that benefits both traders and collectors.” Chillonic is a pioneering NFT project built on Sonic SVM that introduces the revolutionary Chill-404 Protocol, bridging the gap between NFTs and memecoins. By allowing seamless conversion between NFTs and $CHILL tokens, Chillonic creates a new asset class that combines the liquidity of memecoins with the identity and rarity of NFTs. Sonic SVM is the first chain extension SVM to launch on Solana – developing a groundbreaking blockchain protocol that serves as a programmable attention settlement layer. Built on the HSSN network, it offers consensus-level validation of attention-related transactions, granular on-chain access to user activity across dApps, and composable primitives that eliminate the need for each project to build bespoke attention infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Ministry of Justice has drafted a bill that would formally treat digital currencies, like Bitcoin, as property that can be seized and confiscated in criminal investigations, as announced by Vadim Fedorov, Russian Deputy Minister of Justice, during a legal forum focused on the challenges posed by new technologies. The bill, first reported by TASS, would allow law enforcement to seize physical devices, such as hardware wallets or storage drives, that contain access to digital currencies. It would also enable investigators to request court orders to block crypto transactions. “It [the bill] proposes special requirements to ensure the security of such assets — depending on the specific characteristics of the digital currency, an investigator would be able to seize a physical device containing access codes or request a court-imposed ban on transactions,” Fedorov said. The proposed legislation is part of the Russian government's effort to modernize its criminal justice tools in response to the growing role of digital assets in financial crime. Fedorov said that authorities aim to close legal loopholes that currently make it difficult for law enforcement to deal with crypto assets involved in crime. Recognizing the technical complexity of handling crypto, the bill calls for the involvement of specialists who can determine how best to secure digital assets while ensuring they remain intact for future confiscation or victim compensation. The bill is under preparation for a first reading in the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament. Sign in to your account Don't have an account?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's been a flurry of activity in the crypto markets over the past several hours as US President Donald Trump pushes Congress to pass his ‘big, beautiful' bill. When signed into law, it could continue to propel both Bitcoin ($BTC) and the best altcoins forward. However, it has received pushback from moderate Republicans, especially as the bill will introduce massive cuts to Medicaid coverage and food assistance. Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun announced on X yesterday that he's the top holder of Donald Trump's $TRUMP cryptocurrency and has earned an invitation to the president's gala dinner on Thursday. Despite concerns, 220 of its biggest holders, many of them top players in crypto, will have the privilege to sit down with Trump for dinner, with the 25 holders getting a VIP reception. News of Bitcoin's surge, the imminent ‘Big, Beautiful Bill', and Trump's meme coin dinner tomorrow have already had a cascading effect on the world of altcoins. Let's take a look at some of the best today. Solaxy ($SOLX) is gearing up to become the first-ever Solana Layer 2 blockchain. Once launched, it will address common issues with Solana, such as network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability. Aside from unleashing Solana's potential, Solaxy's modular infrastructure will empower developers to create customized dApps at scale. Solaxy has made a name for itself as one of the best presales this year, having raised over $38.4M since its launch. But it'll be over in less than 26 days, so grab your $SOLX tokens for a low $0.00173, while you can. To get yours, connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet, enter the number of tokens you wish to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. For more detailed information, you can check out our Solaxy buying guide. You can also read the Solaxy whitepaper for more information, or follow Solaxy on X or subscribe to its Telegram channel for the latest news. With Bitcoin's continued rise, it's unsurprising that related projects are also gaining traction. This crypto project's premise is simple: earn free $BTC airdrops when the #1 cryptocurrency hits $150K and $200K. You'll also get free $BTCBULL airdrops when $BTC reaches the $250K mark, as well as regular $BTCBULL airdrops at $BTC's $125K, $175K, and $225K price milestones. You can currently get them via the BTC Bull Token presale page. It's currently priced at $0.00252, but a price increase is coming in a few hours, so it's best to buy them while they're at their cheapest. The rewards rate is currently at 68% p.a., but you can expect this to change over time as more investors stake their tokens. Overall, HODLing is a good strategy, not only for the airdrops, but also as $BTCBULL is expected to grow expontenially in the coming years. You can also follow the team on X or subscribe to Telegram for up-to-date news. As a smart contract platform, it provides speed, scalability, and high availability for dApps on its blockchain. It's already available on major centralized exchanges (CEXs), including Binance and HTX. While the token is trading below 37% of its all-time high of $0.415590, it's seen gains over the past 24 hours,  likely down to Sun's Trump gala announcement. To learn more about TRON, you can visit its official website. There's no telling when the current altcoin bull run will end, but it's smart to gather while the pickings are still plentiful and cheap. We're liking the sound of Solaxy ($SOLX) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) right now. As top trending crypto presales, they offer plenty of growth potential, especially if you join in this early stage. Investing early also provides higher staking APYs, which makes for an even more compelling case if you want to earn passive rewards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) hold strong above their key support levels. The crypto market appears to be in a wait-and-see mode, with traders closely watching whether BTC can break into uncharted territory and if ETH and XRP can maintain their respective support zones to fuel potential rebounds. On Tuesday, it again retested this support level and rose slightly. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 71, pointing upward above its overbought level of 70, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, traders should be cautious as the chances of a pullback are high due to its overbought condition. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is coiling together, indicating indecisiveness among traders. However, if BTC faces a pullback and closes below $105,000, it could extend the decline to retest its psychological level at $100,000. However, caution is warranted due to overbought signals suggesting potential for a pullback. On the other hand, if ETH closes below its 200-day EMA at $2,441, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychological level at $2,000. XRP price rebounded after retesting its 50-day EMA at $2.28 on Saturday and rose 3.18% the next day. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to hover above this level. If XRP breaks and closes below its 50-day EMA on a daily basis, it could extend the correction toward its next key support at $2.23. If the RSI moves below its neutral level of 50, it would give rise to strong bearish momentum and a sharp fall in XRP prices. The MACD indicator also switches to a bearish crossover on the daily chart on Monday, giving sell signals and indicating weakness. Conversely, if the 50-day EMA holds as support, XRP could trigger a rally to retest its $2.72 resistance level. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. While Bitcoin BTC/USD trades near its all time high price, Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of ZigChain, believes that the broader crypto market is primed for a shift. What Happened: In an interview with Benzinga, Gadit argued that investors should prepare for a strong rotation into altcoins as macroeconomic pressures ease and interest rates begin to fall. "Eighty to ninety percent of tokens are down, but Bitcoin has skewed the entire market perception," Gadit said. "Once rate cuts begin and inflation stabilizes, money will flow to other assets as well." While he acknowledged the dominance of Bitcoin in attracting institutional capital, Gadit insisted that altcoins tied to productive use cases will be the next to gain traction. Gadit is particularly optimistic about the future of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). He believes that bringing traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, private credit, and equities onto blockchain rails will drive the next wave of crypto adoption. "The DeFi sector overall, especially tokenization, is pretty much undervalued right now," he said. ZigChain is currently working with Zamanat, a Sharia-compliant RWA tokenization platform, to tokenize $2.5 billion worth of real estate in Dubai over the next three years. "Think of a $15 million family office that usually can't access private credit deals with high entry minimums. Through tokenization, even those chunks can be broken down into $1,000 units and accessed globally," he said. "The end user should not even feel that they are working on a blockchain," he said. Gadit also disclosed that ZigChain is investing in acquiring a fund tokenization license from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), viewing this as a key milestone in legitimizing tokenized asset offerings. Markets expect rate cuts — but your earnings don't have to suffer. Most serious tokenization players won't even launch their own token for the next five years—they're focused on infrastructure," he noted.

"Every day in Dubai, I meet someone from a large family office or desk who's looking to enter crypto," he said. "It always starts with Bitcoin, but eventually they begin to explore other tokens and asset classes." However, Gadit expects a shift: "Barring any black swan events, I think my thesis for the next 12 to 24 months is that the market will do well, and altcoins will catch up." In terms of specific sectors, Gadit highlighted three areas with high long-term potential: Layer-1 blockchains with real use cases, exchange tokens, and tokenized assets. "DEX tokens like Uniswap and Radium will benefit as volumes shift to decentralized trading venues. Exchanges, whether Bitget or Binance, are just buy-and-hold bets for me," he added. Gadit believes the market is becoming more disciplined in how it evaluates crypto projects. "Gone are the days when you could raise money on promises alone," he said. He noted that many high-profile protocols have underperformed due to inflated valuations and poorly designed tokenomics. When investors are already 10x up at launch, you're racing to the bottom." Even with ongoing hype cycles, whether around AI or other narratives, Gadit believes real utility will win out. Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the first time Wilcke has made a substantial transfer to an exchange since moving $147 million in four transactions last year. Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke transferred approximately $262 million worth of ETH to a wallet labeled as a Kraken deposit address on May 20, according to on-chain data. Subsequent withdrawals from the exchange suggest that this could be Wilcke dividing his holdings into different wallets. According to Lookonchain, a few minutes after his deposit, eight different addresses withdrew the equivalent of $262 million in ETH from Kraken. This is the first time Wilcke has made a substantial transfer to an exchange since moving $147 million in four transactions last year. Despite the movement's scale, Ethereum's price remained relatively stable. As of press time, ETH was trading at $2,493, down 0.17% over the past 24 hours, largely in line with broader market performance. Notably, Ethereum has shown strong performance in the past 30 days, climbing 72% from the lows recorded earlier this year to a high of $2,737.17 on May 13. On Aug. 23, 2024, the EF transferred $94 million worth of ETH to Kraken. The move raised concerns among community members, prompting explanations from EF contributor Josh Spark and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said the transfer aimed to support organizations contributing to Ethereum's development. In response, Buterin stated that legal risks and the possibility of contentious protocol upgrades had dissuaded the EF from staking at scale. The EF deposited 30,800 ETH, worth about $82 million, into Aave's lending markets. Analyst Tom Wan estimated a 1.5% annual yield potential from these movements, equating to a gain of roughly $1.5 million based on current prices.
