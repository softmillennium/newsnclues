                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jaedyn Shaw, Korbin Albert and Mia Fishel are among 20 players to make up the U-23 women's national team for two upcoming road matches against Germany. "This is what I've felt has really been missing for a lot of players," Hayes said. Yes, [Fishel] could come in, sit on the bench for us, but it's much better for her to go up and play in Germany and get the experiences so that these players are tracking to compete in the place that we want them to come [the 2027 World Cup]." Fishel, 24, tore her ACL ahead of the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup and recently returned to play for her club Chelsea. Hayes called her in as a training player for the April matches against Brazil, but she hasn't played with the full team in more than a year. But Hayes believes all three will benefit more from playing with the U-23 team right now. "I think the trip to Germany for [Fishel], plus Jaedyn plus Korbin, will be another step in their development," Hayes said. "And one where, just for context, both teams are able to play five overage players. Trinity Rodman made her valiant return to the USWNT in April where she scored a brilliant goal in the team's first match vs. Brazil. Since then, Rodman has taken a leave of absence from soccer to address ongoing back issues. There is no timetable for her return to club or country. Hayes said this week that she speaks with Rodman regularly and the ‘Triple Espresso' star is "doing really well." "It has certainly been a multidisciplinary approach to supporting Trin – [that includes] club, country and the NWSL – so there's good communication and support provided to her," Hayes said. "But unfortunately, like anything, you can't put a timeframe on it because we want to ensure that she's not carrying that pain any further. And I think we're definitely heading in the right direction. I don't know when she will be back, but I know that Trin is being given all the support and we very much hope for a speedy recovery." It's been almost one year since Hayes officially took over the USWNT (her first match was June 1, 2024 which resulted in a 4-0 win over Korea Republic). Hayes spent more than a decade at Chelsea where she transformed the club and won 16 trophies. In her first few months with the U.S., she led the squad to an Olympic gold medal and gave 21 different players their senior team debut. "The truth is, I'm in love with my job every day," Hayes told reporters this week. And the self-development that's gone on for me on a personal level was not just what I needed, but the push I needed as well. I'm on so many different leadership programs – not just formal but sometimes informal gatherings with other head coaches. Right now I'm working on the plan to qualify for 2027, but also within that, why those missing gaps are there. Not just in our program, but in our sport, because I'm all about not just closing the gap, but how can we help support all areas of the sport? So I'm in my perfect job and absolutely loving it." After being eliminated from Champions League competition, Chelsea responded by going onto win the FA Cup Final with a 3-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday. Not only was it Macario's 11th goal of the season, but she became the third American woman to score in an FA Cup Final, joining Sam Mewis and Carli Lloyd. In very uplifting news, Angel City FC defender Savy King has been discharged from the hospital. She posted the update on social media earlier this week. The game was stopped for about 10 minutes and King was carted off the field and immediately taken to a local hospital. The club later announced that King was in stable condition and that she underwent successful surgery for a heart abnormality. In an Instagram post, King thanked her family, friends, teammates and fans for their love and support as well as the medical team "who saved my life and cared for me every step of the way." King also said she is "looking forward to recovering and getting back out on the field." She previously wrote for Sports Illustrated, USA Today and The Indianapolis Star.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matt Turner's jubilant week in London has quickly turned on its head after U.S. Men's National Team head coach Mauricio Pochettino warned that the Crystal Palace goalkeeper's position as his starter is not guaranteed. And while Turner had started three FA Cup games for Palace earlier in the season, he returned to the bench from the quarter finals onward, with Henderson playing the full 90 minutes in their recent 1-0 Final win against Manchester City, marking Palace's first major title victory in their 164-year history. Turner was subsequently named to Pochettino's preliminary 60-man roster for their upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, which will be played a matter of days before they head to the CONCACAF Gold Cup. But while he has been Pochettino's starter since day one, the Argentine admitted on Tuesday that this could yet change. “I think it's true that he's not playing, and we were talking with him and we translated the idea of that for the future in one year's time, I think he needs to find a way to compete every week because if not it's going to be a little bit delayed with the rest of the teammates,” the former Tottenham Hotspur boss said. The USMNT has shortlisted six goalkeepers for their upcoming games, including the as yet uncapped trio of Chicago Fire's Chris Brady, New York City FC's Matthew Freese, and Barcelona's Diego Kochen. And while all six can't make the final cut, Pochettino did confirm that he plans on bringing four to the Gold Cup, at which point, the competition will come down to how they perform in training. Of course, until now, Matt was our number one choice, but that can change,” Pochettino admitted. With his loan deal set to expire in the summer, and two years remaining on his Forest contract, where Matz Sels has enjoyed an excellent season between the sticks, it seems likely Turner will be hoping to find a way out of the City Ground in the coming months - something he eluded to in March.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA – Twenty players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp and matches in Germany. “This is an incredible opportunity for our U-23 player pool to face top tier opponents in Europe and give them the valuable experiences that are much needed,” said Hayes. “We want to be very conscious of developing our players through different experiences, and as I have spoken about before, this will take shape of some players playing in U-23 games and at other times being called in with WNT.This is because wewant to increase the diversityof high-level opponents that they get to compete against, but the methodology and coaching points between the teams will be exactly the same.” The U.S. roster features 15 players who are Under-23 in age, and per an agreement with Germany that is standard for Women's U-23 internationals in Europe, each squad will have five “overage players,” none of whom can be born before Jan. 1, 1999. This U-23 camp will be led by University of New Mexico head coach Heather Dyche along with assistant coaches Yolanda Thomas, who is an assistant with the 2024 NWSL Champion Orlando Pride; former USWNT player Stephanie Cox, a 2008 Olympic gold medalist; and long-time U.S. Youth National Team and former San Diego Wave goalkeeper coach Louis Hunt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad news for the attacker. Real Madrid have published a medical report on Endrick, who suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's match in Sevilla and will miss the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. After the tests carried out today on our player Endrick by the Medical Services of Real Madrid, he has been diagnosed with an injury to the combined tendon of the hamstrings in his right leg. This is very bad news for Endrick and Real Madrid, as the young Brazilian forward could've played some minutes during the tournament. Now, he will have to miss the Club World Cup and then wait for the pre-season stage to start working under soon-to-be new coach Xabi Alonso. Hamstring injuries are always very tricky, so Endrick will need to take a cautious approach with his recovery in order to avoid setbacks when he's cleared to play during the summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Manchester City player attributed a “frustrating” year to injury and other factors, as he opened up about the toughest campaign of his career. Foden was named Footballer of the Year last season, when he scored 27 goals for City, but has not scored since January and was only a substitute for Saturday's FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace. He played in Thomas Tuchel's first two games in charge of England, the March wins over Albania and Latvia, but thinks he may be better off resting, rather than trying to impress the new manager, who names his squad for the June matches against Andorra and Senegal on Friday. Foden also feels it might benefit him to sit out the Club World Cup, which could involve seven games and more than five weeks in the United States for City, but he will consult with his club and country before making a decision. “I just need a few weeks off it without playing football and obviously I can't get it at the moment. It's a bit frustrating to play with niggles like this. Foden has only started one of City's last eight games as he continues to feel the after-effects of a challenge by Casemiro in April's 0-0 derby draw. “I picked up an ankle injury against [Manchester] United and it's taken time to heal. It was a bad ligament damage to the ankle. It took a while to heal before I can push myself back in training, I had to look after it. I've had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. It's one of them, sometimes there's things in life that are bigger than football. Foden is grateful to City for helping him during a tough period, adding: “The club have been so supportive. He also offered an insight into how players are feeling about the first 32-team Club World Cup, which will follow a campaign when City have already played 57 games. “It's obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season,” he said. Obviously, there will be this competition that's coming up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Phil Foden is seeking talks with England and Manchester City to devise a period of rest this summer after the toughest season of his career. The midfielder, who turns 25 next week, admitted to ‘mental fatigue' earlier in the campaign and has revealed off-field issues have hampered his performances. Foden is also carrying ligament damage in his ankle, sustained during the dour Manchester derby in early April, and has only featured for 105 minutes since. But Foden is looking for a break to recharge and put the season behind him. ‘I just need a few weeks off it without playing football and obviously I can't get it at the moment,' he said. Phil Foden has admitted he needs a break this summer after the worst season of his career Foden (with Kevin De Bruyne) has battled through ankle problems and off-field issues this term ‘I just don't know at the moment, it's a conversation to be had and we'll see what happens.' Foden had started this term as the PFA Players' Player of the Year but managed 10 goals and six assists in 44 appearances – with his seven Premier League goals coming in the space of a month. ‘The ankle has taken time to heal,' he said. ‘I somehow managed to play on at United. ‘A lot of people don't know what football players have to go through and play with. I'm feeling a lot better now and can really push on with it. I've had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. Thonas Tuchel (left) is set to name his second England squad for June's matches on Friday Foden (training with Jordan Henderson and Adam Wharton) suggested he wants a rest Thomas Tuchel names his second England squad on Friday morning ahead of a World Cup qualifier with Andorra at Espanyol on June 7 and a friendly against Senegal three days later. The German has previously suggested that he will not be doing Premier League clubs any favours when picking teams. City's Club World Cup tournament begins in Philadelphia against Wydad on June 18, with Pep Guardiola's squad going on a camp near Miami in the five days beforehand. Foden indicated that he wants to play for City. ‘It's obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season,' Foden added. Obviously there will be this competition that's coming up. ‘It's going to be a funny one, some clubs will take it more seriously than others but I know City and the club we are, we'll definitely take it seriously. I'm just looking forward to seeing what it's like and playing against top teams.' By posting your comment you agree to our house rules. Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bipartisan group of Congressional representatives are calling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline the government's visa processing system to ensure visitors from abroad will be able to attend next year's FIFA World Cup as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The World Cup, which kicks off in less than 400 days, is expected to generate $3.75 billion in economic activity in the U.S. With SoFi Stadium in Inglewood hosting eight games, the economic impact on Southern California is estimated at nearly $600 million. Will the Trump administration fix a backlogged visa approval process in time for fans from many countries to attend the World Cup and L.A. Olympics? Rubio is scheduled to appear Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee where he will be asked about the visa process, said Rep.  Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Los Angeles). Kamlager-Dove, a member of that committee and a proponent of sports diplomacy, laid out her concerns and those of her colleagues in two-page letter addressed to Rubio and signed by 52 representatives, including Rep. Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills), the first Republican to sign on; Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and Ted Lieu (D-Manhattan Beach), a member of Democratic House leadership. “I'm hoping to get some answers and some solutions,” said Kamlager-Dove, whose sprawling districts ranges from the border with Beverly Hills to South Los Angeles. It will also be the first World Cup played in three countries, with Mexico and Canada sharing host duties with the U.S. However the vast majority of the games — 78 of 104 — will be played in 11 U.S. cities between June 11 and July 19, 2026. Casey Wasserman says his committee has made strides with Trump over Olympians not having visa issues for the 2028 L.A. Games, despite the U.S. considering travel restrictions for 43 countries. “The United States has an obligation to put its best foot forward as the host of these games,” she said. “Sports diplomacy is an important tool for us as we continue to talk about peace and cooperation. It's also so important as we recognize all of the different ethnic communities that help make up the United States and want to root for their home team. Earlier this month President Trump held the first meeting of a White House task force charged with overseeing what the president called “the biggest, safest and most extraordinary soccer tournament in history.” But the administration has sent mixed signals over exactly how welcoming it intends to be. At that meeting attended by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, Vice President JD Vance — co-chair of the task force — said the U.S. wants foreign visitors “to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games. But when the time is up we want them to go home, otherwise they will have to talk to Secretary Noem.” He referred to Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency has detained and interrogated visa holders at U.S. points of entry. “The good news is you have Republicans and Democrats asking these questions. “Staff the State Department to focus on them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (May 21, 2025) – Twenty players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp and matches in Germany. The U.S. team will be in Germany from May 26-June 3 and will play its German counterparts twice, on May 30 and June 2 at small stadiums outside of Stuttgart. The programming in Europe is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importancealong the player pathway to the full National Team. “This is an incredible opportunity for our U-23 player pool to face top tier opponents in Europe and give them the valuable experiences that are much needed,” said Hayes. “We want to be very conscious of developing our players through different experiences, and as I have spoken about before, this will take shape of some players playing in U-23 games and at other times being called in with WNT.This is because wewant to increase the diversityof high-level opponents that they get to compete against, but the methodology and coaching points between the teams will be exactly the same.” ), Evelyn Shores (UNC; Atlanta, Ga.), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; Rossmoor, Calif.) The U.S. roster features 15 players who are Under-23 in age, and per an agreement with Germany that is standard for Women's U-23 internationals in Europe, each squad will have five “overage players,” none of whom can be born before Jan. 1, 1999. Players born in 2002, 2003 and 2004 are age-eligible for this year's U-23 WNT, and this U.S. roster also includes four players born in 2001 -- GK Angelina Anderson, F Mia Fishel, M Samantha Meza, D Kennedy Wesley and one in 2000 -- GK Jordan Silkowitz. This U-23 camp will be led by University of New Mexico head coach Heather Dyche along with assistant coaches Yolanda Thomas, who is an assistant with the 2024 NWSL Champion Orlando Pride; former USWNT player Stephanie Cox, a 2008 Olympic gold medalist; and long-time U.S. Youth National Team and former San Diego Wave goalkeeper coach Louis Hunt.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN JOSE, Calif. (May 21, 2025) – Today, U.S. Soccer announced Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz has been selected to join the U.S. U-23 Women's National Team roster for training camp and a pair of upcoming friendlies in Germany during the upcoming May 26 – June 5 international window. Silkowitz and the U-23 USWNT will play two matches during the trip, facing off with Germany May 30 and June 2 in Stuggart. Silkowitz's invitation is the first of her career to a national team program at any level. 2025 marks her third professional season and second with Bay FC after joining the club last August via trade from Kansas City Current. This season, Silkowitz has played every minute for Bay FC, recording three shutouts and taking home NWSL Week 4 Save of the Week honors. Born in 2000, Silkowitz is one of five “overage players” selected to the roster per U.S. Soccer's agreement with Germany. She is one of 16 NWSL players selected to the roster and one of two goalkeepers alongside Angel City FC goalkeeper Angelina Anderson. A Bay Area native, Anderson also featured against Bay FC last week in the SoCal side's visit to PayPal Park. The camp will be led by University of New Mexico head coach Heather Dyche, along with assistant coaches Yolanda Thomas from Orlando Pride, former USWNT player and 2008 Olympic gold medalist Stephanie Cox, and long-time U.S. Youth National Team and former San Diego Wave goalkeeper coach Louis Hunt. Prior to her first call-up, Silkowitz will still be available for selection when Bay FC heads to the Lone Star State for an afternoon matchup against the Houston Dash Saturday, May 24.

U.S women's national team head coach Emma Hayes is taking another step in developing the USWNT player pool. The two-game series will be played in two stadiums outside of Stuttgart, Germany, on May 30 and June 2. These are the first matches for Hayes' revamped U-23 program in 2025. "This is an incredible opportunity for our U-23 player pool to face top tier opponents in Europe and give them the valuable experiences that are much needed," said Hayes.

Orlando Pride assistant coach Yolanda Thomas, and former USWNT player Stephanie Cox, a 2008 Olympic gold medalist, will serve as U-23 assistant coaches, alongside U.S. Youth National Team and former San Diego Wave goalkeeper coach Louis Hunt. The roster has 15 players who are under 23 years old, and in an agreement with Germany and U23 standards in Europe, each roster will have five "over-age" players who can be born before Jan. 1, 1999.

He added, “This is a situation that forces teams like the U.S., Mexico, Canada, or Panama—whose best players are involved in the Club World Cup—to manage without players who would normally be with us.” “Even in defeat, I think there are many positives we can take away.” The lack of playing time for Matt Turner at Crystal Palace sparked debate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“When I was at FC Dallas at the start of my career, everyone said, ‘Yeah, he's good on the ball but has no idea how to defend',” he says. “So I went to the league that has the best defensive history and learned a lot from them and developed. So I moved to France to play where they're the best with duels and the best athletes in a fast-paced game. Most people had written off his troubled club Lyon's hopes of qualifying for Europe, but they beat Angers 2-0 on the closing day, sneaking into sixth place in Ligue 1, earning a spot in next season's Conference League play-off round or, depending on the result of Saturday's Coupe de France final, a Europa League place. When he arrived at the Groupama Stadium, the 23-year-old had to contend with a bottleneck of quality — experienced midfielders blocking his way into the first team — but he started against Angers and made 34 appearances in all competitions in his first season at the club. This summer, Mauricio Pochettino could select him for the USMNT's busy schedule of high-profile friendlies and their Gold Cup campaign after Tessmann furthered his development in European competition this season. He appeared in nine of Lyon's 12 Europa League games, including their quarter-final second leg against Manchester United, when Lyon fought back with 10 men at Old Trafford only to be knocked out in extra time by United's even more remarkable turnaround, with the game ending 5-4. Lyon's players are getting used to football's capacity for tumult. There have been financial difficulties and, in March, head coach Paulo Fonseca got a nine-month ban after an angry head-to-head confrontation with a referee. For a squad trying to adapt to the new coach's methods, it was a challenge, but one they overcame regardless. Lyon won six of their 10 league games after the ban (which lasts in part until November). At half-time, we get on a video call with him and he speaks. “Obviously it's not the same as when he's on the sideline but in these big games with 50,000 fans, it's hard to hear anyone anyway. His presence is missed but doesn't change so much. The first game was weird because we had just got a new coach and you change your warm-up routine to match how the new coach and his staff do everything, and then had to change again and get used to the new system. If anything, it has just made guys step up more and be leaders at half-time and speak before the game. We have a lot of players who will do that, so it's good.” For Tessmann, the season has been a welcome learning curve. “We have a lot of experienced players and loads to learn from, not just in my position,” he says. “The midfield is loaded, so playing with those guys has been a pleasure and an honour. Corentin Tolisso (a 30-year-old French midfielder who played for Bayern Munich) has a great mentality and the style and way he works have been good to learn from. Training has been different from his previous team, Venezia, which he left last summer after helping them win promotion to Italy's Serie A. “There is a lot more counter-attacking and transition in France,” he says. “I've improved my high-speed ball control and decisions. We're expected to win games, it's a different mentality.” Back in Italy, his friend, compatriot and former Venezia team-mate Gianluca Busio is embroiled in a relegation fight that will go to the last day of the season. Venezia face the daunting task of beating Weston McKennie and Tim Weah's Juventus (who are fighting for Champions League qualification) to have a chance of beating the drop. “They can do it,” he says of his former club. It's not easy when you're down at the bottom as a No 10 (attacking midfielder). It's easier when you're a No 6 or No 8 because you can control the game more, but in the position he is, he's done well.” He reflects on his upbeat summer in France last year, when he played for a young, impressive United States men's team that reached the quarter-finals of the Olympics. “We actually stayed in Lyon before we played Guinea and spent four days here with my wife and family,” he says. So when they approached me, I was very open.” The experience has left him even hungrier to feature for Pochettino's side more, a desire for repeat call-ups he admits can have differing effects in the run-up to next summer's World Cup. “With the national team growing and players being more active in big European clubs, the competition to be called up is harder and harder. “So when you are, the mistake is to think you can just do the minimum to be there and not make mistakes or take risks. The thing you need to do is to get on the ball, make things happen and impose yourself and if that comes with my mistakes or bad passes, then it has to be OK. “I would love to take part in the Gold Cup.” “I have found some good golf courses around Lyon,” he says. “Lyon has nice hills and woodland and you can design a course with a lot of different elements, but now I have a son, so I won't be playing as much unless he wants to caddy for me. If Tennyson has his father's appetite for fast learning, he could be carrying Tessmann Senior's clubs sooner rather than later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham is expected to miss at least the first six weeks of next season when he has shoulder surgery after the Club World Cup. The former Birmingham City midfielder has worn strapping on his shoulder when playing for England and for his club, having initially missed two games for both Madrid and England at the end of 2023 after injuring his shoulder against Rayo Vallecano. On Friday, England boss Thomas Tuchel will name his England squad for June's qualifier against Andorra and friendly against Senegal, with questions remaining about whether or not players due to play in the Club World Cup will be selected. He helped Madrid to the La Liga title and Champions League, scoring 23 goals in 43 appearances. This season, though, he has scored just 14 in 52, with Madrid losing the title to Barcelona and being knocked out of Europe in the quarter-finals by Arsenal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American Dream mall is no stranger to large crowds — nor is it a stranger to sporting events. For any soccer matches happening in the next year and a half, “you don't need to bring a cooler full of beer. Why don't you come over to our restaurants and have a great meal?” Paul Ghermezian, a senior executive with Triple Five, which owns American Dream, said in a recent interview. He noted that it makes perfect sense for American Dream to piggyback on the games. The mall has plenty of experience drawing a crowd centered around specific events. Thousands of patrons came out for JonasCon in March and the opening of a MrBeastBurgers — named after the famous YouTuber MrBeast — in 2022. In April the mall hosted the grand opening of former NFL quarterback Tom Brady's sports memorabilia store, CardVault by Tom Brady. And the mall has hosted a slew of sports-related events. It played host to the Harlem Globetrotters last summer, and plans to host them again in the summer of 2025. American Dream also hosted the U.S. curling championships in February 2024. At 3 million square feet and with a $5 billion price tag, the retail and entertainment venue — more than 30 years in the making between planning, financing and construction — features an indoor water park, an indoor amusement park with roller coasters, a 300-foot Ferris wheel, indoor miniature golf and ice skating, and the only year-round indoor ski and snowboard park in North America. American Dream also has more than 200 stores — including flagships for Toys R Us and Babies R Us — and over 50 dining options, including fast-casual, sit-down and high-end dining. Last summer, American Dream also had watch parties, entertainment, giveaways, video games and a soccer turf field for the Copa America tournament. State officials are spending $33 million on a new pedestrian bridge for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. “I love to think of them as dry runs, but it's almost nonstop all the time,” Ghermezian said of these events and offerings. All of it is essentially a buildup for what the mall might host during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. MetLife Stadium will be one of 16 stadiums across North America hosting matches for the World Cup. And MetLife will host the finals on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a capacity of over 82,000, and Gov. “Anything that's smaller than FIFA [World Cup] will be a dry run,” said Charles Cristella, executive vice president of retail at real estate services firm JLL. Ghermezian didn't say exactly what the mall is doing for either event. It largely depends on which teams end up being in the semifinals and finals. He said some retailers at the mall have shown interest in doing events of some kind for the FIFA Club World Cup. And Gregg Schwartz, a spokesperson for the mall, said certain tenants are looking at store openings related to the World Cup and soccer, but he did not provide names. “With the World Cup coming, they want to get here in a timely fashion and capitalize on a global audience,” Schwartz said. “You're going to find out around June 25 who's playing here on July 5, 8, 9 and 13,” he said. “But you have the potential of a team like Real Madrid playing here for three games or [Lionel] Messi with [Inter] Miami. “So all of a sudden, Messi's coming to MetLife Stadium, our phones are ringing off the hook,” Schwartz continued. In other words, if news breaks in late June that Messi is coming to MetLife Stadium, fans will flock to the stadium and likely come to American Dream. The mall, in turn, would have just a few days or, in the best-case scenario, a couple of weeks to plan, finalize and promote a slew of events and offerings for thousands of international guests. During Copa America last summer, American Dream hosted an array of activities ranging from video games to a soccer field and live DJ performance, made possible thanks to the mall's partnership with the American Spanish-language television network Univision. Schwartz highlighted a previous offering the mall did in November 2022, when American Dream hosted a Trophy Tour with Coca-Cola and numerous soccer stars, including Brazilian player Ricardo Kaká, who met with fans and signed autographs. The event featured a tour featuring the World Cup trophy, and it was geared toward young athletes and soccer fans. Then on the weekend of Aug. 1 to 3, American Dream is hosting a Japanese Sumo wrestling tournament, part of WorldWide Sumo's Power Show. “They are very well-suited,” Cristella said of Triple Five.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lo'eau LaBonta, known for her tenacious play and colorful personality, was among 24 players invited to USWNT training camp ahead of friendlies against China on May 31 and Jamaica on June 3. In just one year of coaching the U.S. women's national soccer team, Emma Hayes has extended close to two dozen first-time invitations to training camp. Most have gone to young players seeking a place in the talent pool as the 2027 World Cup draws closer. At 32, Lo'eau LaBonta did not seem to figure into Hayes's plans. LaBonta was among 24 players named by Hayes to training camp ahead of friendlies against China on May 31 in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Jamaica on June 3 in St. Louis. “With the volume of young players or less experienced players we're bringing in, I think we have to get that balance right,” Hayes said. This is the right moment to do it.” LaBonta's only international experience has been with the under-14, under-15 and under-23 squads. LaBonta was among three invitees who have never played for the national team, joining Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey and Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello, both 25. This camp marks the return of Chelsea's Naomi Girma, a world-class center back who has yet to play this year because of a calf injury. Trinity Rodman received an excused absence from the Washington Spirit after reinjuring her back this spring, and Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson are on maternity leave. “We want to ensure she's not carrying that pain any further, and I think we're definitely heading in the right direction,” Hayes said. “I don't know when she will be back, but I know Trin is being given all the support by everyone, and we very much hope for a speedy recovery.” Midfielder Rose Lavelle and defender Tierna Davidson are unavailable because of injuries. The U.S. Soccer Federation is also planning to announce an under-23 roster Wednesday for two away friendlies against Germany in the coming weeks. Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United). Midfielders: Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City), Olivia Moultrie (Portland), Lily Yohannes (Ajax).</p>
