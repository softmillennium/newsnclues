                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“If law enforcement officials, whether at the federal, state, or even local level, can secretly obtain Senators' location data or call histories, our ability to perform our constitutional duties is severely threatened.” AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told TechCrunch in a statement that, “we are complying with our obligations to the Senate Sergeant at Arms,” and that the phone company has “received no legal demands regarding Senate offices under the current contract, which began last June.” When asked whether AT&T received legal demands before the new contract, Byers did not respond. Wyden said in the letter that one unnamed carrier “confirmed that it turned over Senate data to law enforcement without notifying the Senate.” When reached by TechCrunch, Wyden's spokesperson Keith Chu said the reason was that, “we don't want to discourage companies from responding to Sen. Wyden's questions.” The letter also mentioned carriers Google Fi, US Mobile, and cellular startup Cape, which all have policies to notify “all customers about government demands whenever they are allowed to do so.” US Mobile and Cape adopted the policy after outreach from Wyden's office. Ahmed Khattak, US Mobile's founder and CEO, confirmed to TechCrunch that the company “did not have a formal customer notification policy regarding surveillance requests prior to Senator Wyden's inquiry.” “Our current policy is to notify customers of subpoenas or legal demands for information whenever we are legally permitted to do so and when the request is not subject to a court order, statutory gag provision, or other legal restriction on disclosure,” said Khattak. “To date, Cape has not received any requests for subscriber data that contained a nondisclosure obligation,” the privacy policy reads. As Wyden's letter notes, after Congress enacted protections in 2020 for Senate data held by third party companies, the Senate Sergeant at Arms updated its contracts to require phone carriers to send notifications of surveillance requests. Updated to include comment from Cape's John Doyle and corrected the title of US Mobile's founder.

As part of its Computex 2025 announcements, AMD has given gamers a sneak peek at the company's major update for its FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) technology. Dubbed FSR Redstone, the upcoming installment will bring many new features to match rival Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). While the initial batch of supported titles was limited to around 30 games, AMD expects to double that number by June 5, aligning with the Radeon RX 9060 XT launch. Although AMD did not provide specific details, the chipmaker emphasized three features to be included in FSR Redstone: neural radiance caching, machine learning ray regeneration, and machine learning frame generation. AMD states that neural radiance caching effectively learns how light reflects within a scene. The objective is to predict and store indirect lighting assets in a cache, which can subsequently be used to generate heaps of other rays. This feature leverages a trained neural network to regenerate pixels that couldn't be accurately traced. Thanks to machine learning, it can predict and filter grainy noise in real time. With FSR Redstone, AMD is enhancing its super resolution feature through the utilization of an improved machine learning model, designed to predict and reconstruct lower resolution frames in order to optimize performance. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Like Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR also offers gamers frame generation. However, FSR had utilized an AI-free approach up until now. The next-generation FSR Redstone will tap machine learning for frame generation, which should improve performance and quality. AMD has not committed to a specific date for FSR Redstone's prime debut, only indicating a release in the latter half of this year. FSR Redstone will launch with native compatibility for RDNA 4-powered graphics cards. Sadly, AMD did not specify whether it will be backward compatible with the previous generations of RDNA graphics cards. Zhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI and Ive's collaboration puts one of Apple's former design heads — famous for crafting many iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Apple Watches — at the forefront of the newest technology wave, generative AI. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI has amped up its consumer business significantly. Earlier this month, the company appointed former Meta executive and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo to lead its consumer applications. In recent years, Apple has struggled to develop AI features that keep up with the latest technology from OpenAI and Google. Apple's stock fell 2% on Wednesday after the OpenAI and Ive collaboration was announced. Many of io's employees are former Apple designers — including Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan — who helped build the firm's most iconic products. Ive is retaining control of his design firm, LoveFrom, which will continue to operate independently. The Wall Street Journal reports that Ive will have an expansive role, giving input into future versions of ChatGPT and more. That means OpenAI will pay $5 billion to fully acquire io, marking the ChatGPT maker's largest acquisition ever. Reportedly, the OpenAI Startup Fund made a separate investment in io last year. In a video posted by OpenAI, Altman said the mission of io is to create a family of AI devices that will let people use AI to produce “all sorts of wonderful things.” Ive said he's convinced that everything he's learned “over the last 30 years has led me to this place and this moment.” The first AI device io is working on has “completely captured” Ive's imagination, he said. Altman was an early investor in Humane, another AI hardware company founded by former Apple employees, which made an AI-powered “pin.” After a series of stumbles, Humane was sold to HP and its devices were sunsetted. Meta's AI-powered smart glasses, which it's developing with the eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, have achieved strong sales and adoption among consumers. This week, Google unveiled its version of AI smart glasses that it's developing with Samsung, Warby Parker, and other partners. Later in the video, Altman noted how using a laptop or smartphone to access ChatGPT was too cumbersome. Instead, the OpenAI CEO suggested he'd rather use a device more integrated into his everyday life The Information first reported on OpenAI's discussions to acquire io in March.

In April, Meta had to fend off allegations that it cheated on a popular crowdsourced AI benchmark, LM Arena. Meta has huge ambitions for Llama — and its broader generative AI portfolio. Meta has revenue-sharing agreements with some companies that host its Llama models. The company recently launched an API for customizing Llama releases. And Meta AI, the company's AI assistant powered by Llama, may eventually show ads and offer a subscription with additional features, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's Q1 earnings call. In 2024, Meta's “GenAI” budget was more than $900 million, and this year, it could exceed $1 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sudden productivity boost was driven by Goose, an artificial intelligence agent developed by Block several months ago that can help with coding and other work like knocking together data visualizations or mocking up new product features. “We've always had really strong hack weeks, but this one was at another level,” says Jackie Brosamer, who leads the AI and data platform at Block. The company says Goose has changed the way it works, not only helping automate code generation but also allowing non-engineers to dabble in coding or prototype for new apps or features. I first spoke to Block several months ago, when Goose was a little less cooked than it is now. They ran the system on machines where any changes could easily be rolled back. Agents are starting to change the way many developers and companies operate as AI models get better at managing code, using computers, and wielding tools. Over the past week, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have all touted agentic coding tools. Block uses Anthropic's Claude model by default, which is particularly good at coding and tool use. Block CEO Jack Dorsey and the company's CTO, Dhanji Prasanna, concluded that agents would shake up their industry in fall of 2024, when improved AI models triggered a significant leap in the performance of many agents. Block's Goose is available as open source (the name, in case you didn't guess, was inspired by Maverick's friend in the movie Top Gun). Goose can also tap into a growing number of online tools, like cloud storage platforms or online databases, thanks to the Model Context Protocol scheme for agent communications developed by Anthropic. Brad Axen, an engineering lead at Block using Goose, told me recently that Goose has proven especially useful for helping engineers wrap their head around an unfamiliar code base. “One of the things that works best is if you say ‘Hey, I don't know how this works yet, could you please go find everything and give me a summary,'” he says. As the complexity of these agentic systems grows, managing stability and security may become a bigger challenge. “It's a weird way of thinking about computers working together,” he says. What do you think of Goose and the way agents are changing work?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A consortium of global law enforcement agencies and tech companies announced on Wednesday that they have disrupted the infostealer malware known as Lumma. One of the most popular infostealers worldwide, Lumma has been used by hundreds of what Microsoft calls “cyber threat actors” to steal passwords, credit card and banking information, and cryptocurrency wallet details. The tool, which officials say is developed in Russia, has provided cybercriminals with the information and credentials they needed to drain bank accounts, disrupt services, and carry out data extortion attacks against schools, among other things. Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) obtained an order from a United States district court last week to seize and take down about 2,300 domains underpinning Lumma's infrastructure. Microsoft lawyers wrote on Wednesday that Lumma, which is also known as LummaC2, has spread so broadly because it is “easy to distribute, difficult to detect, and can be programmed to bypass certain security defenses.” Steven Masada, assistant general counsel at Microsoft's DCU, says in a blog post that Lumma is a “go-to tool,” including for the notorious Scattered Spider cybercriminal gang. Attackers distribute the malware using targeted phishing attacks that typically impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims. “In 2025, probably following Redline's disruption and Lumma's own development, it has ranked as the most active module, indicating its growing popularity and widespread adoption among cybercriminals,” says Victoria Kivilevich, director of threat research at security firm Kela. Microsoft says that more than 394,000 Windows computers were infected with the Lumma malware between March 16 and May 16 this year. And Lumma was mentioned in more than 21,000 listings on cybercrime forums in the spring of 2024, according to figures cited in a notice published today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Law enforcement's collaboration with Microsoft's DCU and other tech companies like Cloudflare focused on disrupting Lumma's infrastructure in multiple ways, so its developers could not simply hire new providers or create parallel systems to rebuild. Typically, infostealers find their way onto people's computers through downloads of pirated software or through targeted phishing attacks that impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims. Once on a computer it is able to grab sensitive information—such as usernames and passwords, financial information, browser extensions, multifactor authentication details and more—and send it back to the malware's operators. “It's clear that infostealers have become more than just grab-and-go malware,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “In many campaigns they really act as the first stage, collecting credentials, access tokens, and other foothold-enabling data, which is then used to launch more traditional, high-impact attacks such as lateral movement, espionage, or ransomware.” Attackers want to add these capabilities to automate some of the work involved in cleaning up the massive amounts of raw data collected by infostealers, including identifying and separating “bot” accounts that are less valuable for most attackers. “Shamel markets different tiers of service for Lumma via Telegram and other Russian-language chat forums,” Microsoft's Masada wrote on Wednesday. “Depending on what service a cybercriminal purchases, they can create their own versions of the malware, add tools to conceal and distribute it, and track stolen information through an online portal.” Kela's Kivilevich says that in the days leading up to the takedown, some cybercriminals started to complain on forums that there had been problems with Lumma. They even speculated that the malware platform had been targeted in a law enforcement operation. “Based on what we see, there is a wide range of cybercriminals admitting they are using Lumma, such as actors involved in credit card fraud, initial access sales, cryptocurrency theft, and more,” Kivilevich says. “We're now seeing infostealers not just evolve technically, but also play a more central role operationally,” says DoubleYou's Wardle. Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at the security firm Flashpoint, says that while infostealers are only one tool that cybercriminals will use, their prevalence may make it easier for cybercriminals to hide their tracks. “Even advanced threat actor groups are leveraging infostealer logs, or they risk burning sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),” Gray says. Lumma isn't the first infostealer to be targeted by law enforcement. Despite the international crackdown, infostealers have proven too useful and effective for attackers to abandon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A family vacation to Costa Rica turned sour after 12 of 13 relatives developed symptoms of a fungal lung infection following an excursion through bat-filled caves. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica. In a paper published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of histoplasmosis: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses. During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone—except the one family member who hadn't toured the cave—became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. “However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.” In other words, given that it's harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis. Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies—or had lung cancer—and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals go away on their own. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to “consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,” they concluded. It's not surprising that The Last of Us is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski—author of The Witcher—wrote that “there's a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matthew D. Lane, 19, is accused of using stolen login credentials to access the network of an unnamed software company, which serves schools across North America and elsewhere, to steal the personal information of more than 60 million students and 10 million teachers. In some cases, the hackers stole decades of historical student data. While the company was not named, federal prosecutors described specific details matching the data breach at education software maker PowerSchool, which revealed in January that it had been hacked as far back as August and September 2024. Prosecutors say Lane worked with an unnamed co-conspirator who lived in Illinois to extort the education software maker for about $2.85 million in cryptocurrency, according to the criminal complaint. Earlier this month, several school districts said that they had since faced extortion attempts from someone saying that the stolen student data had not been destroyed. NBC News was first to report on Lane's plea agreement. Lane is also accused of hacking and extorting another company, which prosecutors said was a U.S. telecoms provider.

A statement from NCOSE explains the mother's grievances thusly: is a 14-year-old minor child who resides in Kansas with his mother, Jane Doe. found an old laptop that was stored forgotten in a closet. Unfortunately for Q.R., it was still in working condition. Q.R., using this old laptop, was able to access the internet and began searching for hardcore pornography. “It is unreasonably dangerous for these pornography websites to provide this product which they know is harmful to children, that children are drawn to access, and do access, without employing age verification as required by Kansas law. Our plaintiff deserves every measure of justice,” a statement from the NCOSE says. The NCOSE's website shows it has also assisted with lawsuits against XVideos, another prominent porn site, as well as against Twitter, which it accuses of breaking a federal sex trafficking statute. GOP Senator Introduces Bill to Make All Porn a Federal Crime, Following Project 2025 Playbook The modern anti-porn movement has popped up in mostly conservative states and has sought to highlight the harmful psychological impact that pornography may have on young people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dario Amodei's AI safety contingent was growing disquieted with some of Sam Altman's behaviors. Shortly after OpenAI's Microsoft deal was inked in 2019, several of them were stunned to discover the extent of the promises that Altman had made to Microsoft for which technologies it would get access to in return for its investment. If AI safety issues actually arose in OpenAI's models, they worried, those commitments would make it far more difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the models' deployment. Amodei's contingent began to have serious doubts about Altman's honesty. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. “We're all pragmatic people,” a person in the group says. It might look very reasonable if you're someone who makes loads of deals like Sam, to be like, ‘All right, let's make a deal, let's trade a thing, we're going to trade the next thing.' Within the AI safety contingent, it centered on what they saw as strengthening evidence that powerful misaligned systems could lead to disastrous outcomes. One bizarre experience in particular had left several of them somewhat nervous. In 2019, on a model trained after GPT‑2 with roughly twice the number of parameters, a group of researchers had begun advancing the AI safety work that Amodei had wanted: testing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) as a way to guide the model toward generating cheerful and positive content and away from anything offensive. But late one night, a researcher made an update that included a single typo in his code before leaving the RLHF process to run overnight. That typo was an important one: It was a minus sign flipped to a plus sign that made the RLHF process work in reverse, pushing GPT‑2 to generate more offensive content instead of less. By the next morning, the typo had wreaked its havoc, and GPT‑2 was completing every single prompt with extremely lewd and sexually explicit language. In part fueled by the realization that scaling alone could produce more AI advancements, many employees also worried about what would happen if different companies caught on to OpenAI's secret. “The secret of how our stuff works can be written on a grain of rice,” they would say to each other, meaning the single word scale. At times this rankled employees who were not American. During lunches, they would question, Why did it have to be a US organization? During these heady discussions philosophizing about the long‑term implications of AI research, many employees returned often to Altman's early analogies between OpenAI and the Manhattan Project. Was OpenAI really building the equivalent of a nuclear weapon? On Fridays, employees would kick back after a long week for music and wine nights, unwinding to the soothing sounds of a rotating cast of colleagues playing the office piano late into the night. The shift in gravity unsettled some people, heightening their anxiety about random and unrelated incidents. Another time, an employee found an unaccounted‑for USB stick, stirring consternation about whether it contained malware files, a common vector of attack, and was some kind of attempt at a cybersecurity breach. He was paranoid about state actors stealing OpenAI's secrets and building their own powerful AI models for malicious purposes. He privately worried about Neuralink staff, with whom OpenAI continued to share an office, now with more unease after Elon Musk's departure. Altman worried, too, about Musk, who wielded an extensive security apparatus including personal drivers and bodyguards. Keenly aware of the capability difference, Altman at one point secretly commissioned an electronic countersurveillance audit in an attempt to scan the office for any bugs that Musk may have left to spy on OpenAI. To employees, Altman used the specter of US adversaries advancing AI research faster than OpenAI to rationalize why the company needed to be less and less open while working as fast as possible. “On the other hand, if an authoritarian government builds AGI before we do and misuses it, we will have also failed at our mission—we almost certainly have to make rapid technical progress in order to succeed at our mission.” Excerpt adapted from Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman's OpenAI, by Karen Hao.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man who died after authorities say he bombed a Palm Springs, California, fertility clinic on Saturday was linked to antinatalism—the belief that all life is a form of suffering imposed on people without their consent—according to terrorism experts who have been analyzing his online presence. Authorities say Guy Bartkus, who was 25, set off an explosion in a car outside American Reproductive Centers, injuring five people and killing himself as well as causing extensive damage to the building in an act of terrorism. “The subject had nihilistic ideations, and this was a targeted attack,” said Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, in a press conference. Since the attack, Bartkus' digital footprint has surfaced, including writings and recordings of his views. According to the LAist, Bartkus appeared to describe himself as being promortalist and misandrist on a website that surfaced after the bombing and could be heard in an audio recording saying, “Basically I'm anti-life. Reddit has also banned the antinatalist subreddit r/Efilism, telling NBC News it was removing “any instances of the suspect's manifesto or recordings and hashing to prevent reupload.” Efilism, a form of antinatalism also linked to promortalism, gets its name by spelling “life” backward. While promortalists and antinatalists also don't value human life, Katherine Keneally, US director of threat analysis and prevention for the ISD, says Bartkus' views were somewhat distinct from nihilism because of his belief he was on a mission. “Promortalists recognize and seek to minimize suffering rather than embrace misanthropy and amorality,” Keneally says, noting that the writings attributed to Bartkus indicate he rejected the “sociopath[ic] tendencies of nihilists” in a May 2025 forum post. In a recording of the aforementioned website, Bartkus reportedly said, “ I am angry that I exist, um, and that, uh, you know, nobody got my consent to bring me here.” Keneally says the suspect's statements and social media posts indicate the bombing was motivated by promortalism, as he may have thought targeting a fertility clinic was preventing new life. The report found that two prominent nihilistic subcultures, True Crime Community and No Lives Matter, were linked by authorities to nine school shooting plots and two Swedish stabbing attacks in 2024. True Crime Community adherents fawn over school shooters, but rather than focus on their motivations, the fixation is on their personal characteristics, the report says. “We'll see young girls and young women in these communities online that will create memes and images of shooters with hearts around them, adding their last name to theirs,” Keneally says. “Those who carry out nihilistic violence are not seeking to change society or promote a specific ideological outcome,” the report says. The report points to a manifesto left behind by the Madison, Wisconsin school shooter in December, which was called “War Against Humanity,” as an example of nihilistic-fueled violence. Keneally says people who get wrapped up in these beliefs skew younger; mental illness can also be a predictor. On the website believed to be linked to Bartkus, he said he had borderline personality disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by impulsive behavior and difficulty regulating one's emotions. “There were signals that could have potentially served as a way to disrupt this attack,” she claims.

Of particular interest, we attended a partner demo where the firm utilized 32 of its latest and greatest PCIe Gen5 SSDs in a RAID setup. This demonstration of extraordinary speed was enabled by a powerful modern workstation PC and a mix of cutting-edge storage components. Specifically, Phison utilized an AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7978WX CPU, installed on an Asus Pro WS WRX90E-Sage SE motherboard, as the foundation of the system. All these components were installed in a sweet-looking be quiet! Phison's new E28 Gen5 SSD rubs shoulders with the best in consumer mid-2025 PC land. The Phison E28 Gen5 is being marketed as “the weapon of choice for serious gaming and productivity,” so it is definitely targeting consumers. Its controller features a quad-CPU architecture, is fabbed on TSMC's 6nm node, and supports up to 32 TB. Here we had 32 of Phison's new E28 Gen5 SSDs; however, each Apex Storage X16 Gen5 add-in card can fit 16 M.2 SSDs (there's a clue in the name), so two would have sufficed for a 32x SSD demo. We guess three cards were installed for optimal performance, load balancing, or another nuance of the Threadripper-powered Windows system. Apex Storage's new X16 Gen5 add-in card features the PM584 Microchip switch that has 84 lanes, claimed to support the full 16 M.2 at full bandwidth. We were told each X16 Gen5 card also has a limit of 128TB of addressable storage, at this time (that would require using 32x 4TB drives).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After enduring two hours of nonstop Gemini AI announcement after announcement at Google I/O, I waited one hour in the press lounge to get a chance to try out either a pair of Android XR smart glasses or Samsung's Project Moohan mixed reality headset. Obviously, I went for the Android XR smart glasses to see how they compare to Meta's $10,000 Orion concept and Google Glass before it. Is Android XR the holy grail of smart glasses we've been waiting over a decade for? Unfortunately, Google only let me try them out for 90 seconds. I was promised five minutes with the Android XR headset prototype and only had three minutes total, half of which a product rep spent explaining to me how the smart glasses worked. Ninety seconds in, I was told to tap on the right side of the glasses to invoke Gemini. The AI's star-shaped icon appeared in the right lens (this pair of Android XR glasses only had one tiny transparent display) slightly below its center point. I turned around and looked at a painting hung on the wall and asked it what I was looking at, who painted it, and asked for the art style. Gemini answered confidently; I have no idea if the answers were correct. I looked over at a bookshelf and asked Gemini to tell me the names of the books—and it did. He told me to look down at my feet, and I saw a small portion of a map; I looked back up, and there Gemini pulled up a turn-by-turn navigation. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and honestly, I barely even got to get a sense for how well Gemini worked. Compared to Meta's Orion smart glasses—which are also a prototype concept at this stage—the Android XR glasses aren't even on the same level. You can see more and do more with Orion and through its waveguide lenses with silicon carbide. Orion runs multiple app windows, like Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and even has “holographic” games, like a Pong knockoff that you can play with another person wearing their own pair of the AR glasses. Versus Snapchat's latest AR “Spectacles” and their super narrow field of view, I'd say the Android XR prototype and its singular display might actually be better. If you're going to have less powerful hardware, lean into its strength(s). I was promised 5 minutes with the Google Android XR smart glasses, but they only gave me 3 minutes, and half of that was explaining what they were and how they worked, so I actually only had 90 seconds to use Gemini on a painting on a wall, two books on a bookshelf, and the… pic.twitter.com/Ly60boX91G They did slide off my nose a bit, but that's only because I have a flat and wider Asian nose. They didn't appear to slip off the nose of my friend and Engadget arch-nemesis, Karissa Bell. There was no way for me to check battery life in 90 seconds. Part of me is wondering why the hell Google chose to limit demo time like this. My spidey sense tells me that it may not be as far along as it appeared in the I/O keynote demo. What I saw feels like a better version of Google Glass, for sure, with the screen resembling a super-tiny heads-up display that's located in the center of the right lens instead of above your right eye on Glass. But with only 90 seconds, there's no way for me to form a firm opinion. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

To cap off its series of announcements, AMD is thrilled to introduce the Radeon AI Pro R9700, a PCIe 5.0 graphics card designed specifically for professional and workstation users. RDNA 4 is an architecture geared towards gaming, but that doesn't mean AMD can't apply it to professional-grade graphics cards. For instance, RDNA 3 saw the mainstream Radeon RX 7000 series successfully coexisting with the Radeon Pro W7000 series. The same situation will occur with RDNA 4. The new workstation graphics card aims to replace the RDNA 3-powered Radeon Pro W7800, which has been faithfully catering to consumers since 2023. It's currently the largest RDNA 4 silicon to date, with a die size of 357 mm² and home to 53.9 billion transistors. Navi 48 is also found in the Radeon RX 9070 series. It's a substantially smaller silicon than the last-generation Navi 31 silicon, which is 529 mm² with 57.7 billion transistors. On the contrary, Navi 31 features an MCM (Multi-Chip Module) design, consisting of chiplets interconnected to a monolithic die. That's the reason why Navi 31 is so enormous. The GCD (Graphics Complex Die) alone measures 304.35 mm², whereas each of the six MCDs (Memory Cache Die) is 37.52 mm². With Navi 48, AMD returned to a monolithic die and, with N4P's help, reduced the die size by 33%. The former has a density of 151 million transistors per mm², whereas the latter comes in at 109.1 million transistors per mm². In terms of composition, the Navi 48 features 64 RDNA 4 Compute Units (CUs), which enable a maximum of 4,096 Streaming Processors (SPs). In contrast, the Navi 31 is equipped with 96 RDNA 3 CUs, for a total of 6,144 SPs. More CUs don't necessarily mean more performance since RDNA 4 delivers considerable generation-over-generation performance uplift over RDNA 3. This correlates to the graphics card having 9% fewer AI accelerators. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. AMD rates the graphics card with a 1,531 TOPS of AI performance. AMD claims the Radeon AI Pro R9700 offers 2X improved performance over the Radeon Pro W7800 in DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 8B. Tested in a few large AI models, the Radeon AI Pro R9700 delivered up to 5X higher performance than the RTX 5080. This configuration results in a memory bandwidth of up to 640 GB/s, 11% more than the Radeon Pro W7800 32GB but 26% less than the Radeon Pro W7800 48GB. The Radeon AI Pro R9700's typical blower-type design will enable users to rock up to four of them inside a single system, such as AMD's Ryzen Threadripper platform, which has good multi-GPU support. With four of them, users will have access to 128GB, more than enough for heavy models that exceed 100GB of VRAM usage. The Radeon AI Pro R9700 has a 300W TBP (Total Board Power). AMD has announced that the Radeon AI Pro R9700 will launch in July, but it has not revealed pricing details. In contrast, the Radeon Pro W7800 debuted at $2,499 two years ago and has maintained most of its value, currently priced at $2,399. We will soon learn the price of the Radeon AI Pro R9700 as its launch approaches in just a couple of months. AMD anticipates a healthy supply of the Radeon AI Pro R9700 from its partners, including ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, XFX, and Yeston.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. AMD announced its new Zen 5-powered Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-series and non-Pro processors here at Computex 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan, touting up to 96 cores and 192 threads in the flagship 9995WX. AMD's newest 'Shamida Peak' Threadrippers bring the benefits of the Zen 5 architecture to AMD's premier WX-Series workstation and non-Pro processors, saying they deliver up to 2.2X the performance in rendering than Intel's fastest competing Xeon-W chips. AMD also revamped its non-Pro Ryzen Threadripper 9000-series chips, with the flagship 9980X HEDT chip wielding 64 cores and 128 threads. AMD's full Threadripper 9000 series will be available in July. AVX-512 support is also fully baked into the design, dramamatically improving performance in applications that utilize the dense instruction set. The chip also come with all of the same I/O connectivity as before, including up to 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, but memory support has been bumped up from DDR5-5200 to DDR5-6400. As with all of AMD's Threadripper chips, these models have the same design as AMD's data center chips, in this case, the EPYC 'Turin' 9005 series, but come with special firmware and power tuning to optimize them for workstation platforms. As you can see above, the chips have a large central 6nm I/O die flanked by rows of 4nm compute dies. With this generation, AMD has rotated the eight-core compute dies 90 degrees and arranged them into four vertical rows of three chips apiece, for a total of 12 compute dies with 96 cores for the flagship 9995WX. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The WR90 platform with support for eight channels of memory will house the Pro chips, while value-optmized TRX50 boards with support for four channels of memory house the HEDT processors. After a BIOS update, the new chips are compatible with existing motherboards. AMD expects a few new refreshed motherboard models from vendors, but it says the chips will largely leverage the existing ecosystem of sTR5 motherboards. AMD shared a few benchmarks to underline its performance superiority over Intel's Xeon-W lineup, but as with all vendor-provided benchmarks, take them with a grain of salt. AMD also shared a broader spate of benchmarks, with impressive gains ranging from 140% to 245% faster than the W9-3595X in a diverse set of real-world applications like media and entertainment, design and manufacturing, and LLM inference verticals, among others. Overall AMD's Threadripper 9000 series appears poised to continue its utter dominance over Intel's competing workstation processors. AMD hasn't shared pricing yet, but given that its most affordable previous-gen HEDT model weighed in at $1,400 while the flagship retailed for $4,999, these chips will undoubtedly be pricey. As you'd expect, we'll have our own benchmarks coming around the time of launch in July. Paul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there's one thing the Federal Bureau of Investigation does well, it's mass surveillance. Several years ago, then attorney general William Barr established an internal office to curb the FBI's abuse of one controversial surveillance law. Sources also reportedly said that Hall was trying to expand the office's work, but her attempts to onboard new employees were stopped by the Trump administration's hiring freezes. However, Jeramie Scott, senior counselor at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Gizmodo via email that the FBI “has repeatedly abused its ability to search Americans' communications ‘incidentally' collected under Section 702” to conduct warrantless spying. Patel has not released any official comment regarding his decision to close the office. But Elizabeth Goitein, senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice, told Gizmodo via email, “It is hard to square this move with Mr. Patel's own stated concerns about the FBI's use of Section 702.” Last year, Congress reauthorized Section 702 despite mounting concerns over its misuses. According to Goitein, the office has “played a key role in exposing FBI abuses of Section 702, including warrantless searches for the communication of members of Congress, judges, and protesters.” And ironically, Patel inadvertently drove its creation after attacking the FBI's FISA applications to wiretap a former Trump campaign advisor in 2018 while investigating potential Russian election interference. Trump and his supporters used Patel's attacks to push their own narrative dismissing any concerns. Last year, former representative Devin Nunes, who is now CEO of Truth Social, said Patel was “instrumental” to uncovering the “hoax and finding evidence of government malfeasance.” Although Patel mostly peddled conspiracies, the Justice Department conducted a probe into the FBI's investigation that raised concerns over “basic and fundamental errors” it committed. But since taking office, Patel has changed his tune about FISA. During his confirmation hearing, Patel referred to Section 702 as a “critical tool” and said, “I'm proud of the reforms that have been implemented and I'm proud to work with Congress moving forward to implement more.” However, reforms don't mean much by themselves. As Goitein noted, “Without a separate office dedicated to surveillance compliance, [the FBI's] abuses could go unreported and unchecked.” While this looks like progress, it doesn't mean that the Office of Internal Auditing's work is done.

Kash Patel claims Judge Hannah Dugan helped a "perp" escape ICE. The leak highlights how digital workplace surveillance exposes employees to new risks. Although it may have chilling technology like 360-degree AI cameras, the police robot's full potential is unknown. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>
