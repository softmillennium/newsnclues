It's always very exciting when beloved actors are announced to star in new projects, and doubly so when comparisons can be made. While Supernatural fans are waiting forThe Boys' big reunion for its central. trio, hype for Jensen Ackles' new show Countdown has been building. This has been especially exciting for fans of his 15-year stint as the demon hunter Dean Winchester, especially because according to Ackles himself, fans of Supernatural won't be disappointed of his new character. In an interview, Entertainment Weekly spoke with co-creator Derek Haas, Ackles and more cast members to get a glimpse into Countdown and learn what fans can expect. While we don't know much about the plot beyond the initial synopsis, Ackles shared that while it's not the exact same premise as Supernatural, fans of Dean Winchester won't be disappointed to find similarities with his newest character. There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy. It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. While we're looking at a show closer to Chicago and 9-1-1, Ackles describes his new character as "rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy", classic play by his own rules risk-taker. Which even for people like me who has scraped the surface of Supernatural, that's pretty promising if you just switch L.A. detective with demon hunter. As for why the two characters are so close, Ackles had a simple but understandable response. Considering Dean is so beloved, it makes sense to bring some of the most likable aspects of his personality and character to a new project. And from the looks of it, Ackles isn't rehashing Dean, just using some of him as a jumping off point for his new role. From sharing some photos on his social media to celebrating filming coming to a close in March, Jensen Ackles' hype train for Countdown has been quite steady. Even if we don't know every single detail about the new drama just yet, nuggets of new info such as BTS on-set pics are helping to keep the fires stoked. Amazon Prime Video: 30-day free trialNothing supernatural is needed to watch Jensen Ackles' upcoming series Countdown, just an Amazon Prime subscription. Even in those posts, fans are quick to comment that just seeing Jensen Ackles on set is enough to make this show a hypothetical smash hit, without any footage out. So for the sake of fans, I hope that Countdown lives up to the hype once its available to stream with an Amazon Prime subscription on June 25, 2025.

It's part of Propstore's auction of items from Planet Hollywood's extensive memorabilia collection (see the whole catalog here), kicking off May 21 and running through June 11. There's a Gremlins puppet, Ghostbusters miniatures, Spock ears from two different Star Trek movies, and lots more, but the Close Encounters alien—complete with “functional eye mechanisms”—is the standout pick. According to Propstore's listing, the climactic Close Encounters sequence in which the musically inclined aliens land their ship at Devils Tower “was achieved by dressing dozens of young girls as the friendly Grays. This particular item, the listing explains, “originated from Academy Award-nominated special mechanical effects artist and regular Spielberg collaborator Roy Arbogast. It features a foam latex-backed slip latex skin dressed over a fiberglass underskull and painted gray-brown on the exterior. Arbogast's many special effects credits also include several John Carpenter films (Escape From New York, The Thing, They Live, and more) as well as Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mysterious crop circles have been discovered etched into fields in one of the world's most famous UFO hotspots. That design featured several geometric shapes set inside two overlapping circles. Crop circles are large, unexplained formations that appear, typically in the middle of the night, in fields with tall grass or fresh crops like wheat or corn. However, it's been proven that many are man-made, using tools like planks to push down and flatten crops as a mean to spark fears or artistic expression. Although these strange patterns have been discovered in dozens of countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan, crop circles have been most commonly found in the UK. Moreover, roughly 80 percent of all UK crop circles have been reported in Wiltshire. Since 2005, there have been more than 380 crop circles recorded in this area alone. The formations are typically found in crop fields and their appearance often coincides with the growing season, when crops are mature enough to show visible patterns but haven't been harvested yet. In countries in Earth's Northern Hemisphere, like the US and UK, crop circles tend to appear between May and August when the crops are tall enough to be flattened into circular patterns. UAP researcher Holly Wood posted on X: 'Who or what is trying to get our attention?' Another Ufologist shared: 'People say when you look at it from the top, the symbol makes them 'download' certain information to their subconscious mind.' Wiltshire has become the most common location to find crop circles in the UK, with more than 380 discovered in this one county since 2005 Monique Klinkenbergh, founder of the crop circle exhibition in Wiltshire's Pewsey Vale, admitted that there are definitely man-made crop circles on Earth, but others are much harder to explain without considering UFOs and aliens. 'There is definitely a mystery going on, but it's very hard to label the source, whether it is extra-terrestrial, paranormal or just nature,' she added. For example, the 2001 'Milk Hill circle' in Wiltshire had over 400 circles spanning 787 feet and was said to be too complex for humans to quickly create in one night. UFO researchers have also claimed that crop circles display several unusual features, like crop stalks which have all been perfectly bent but not broken or cut by machinery. Witnesses have also claimed to have seen orbs of light and other strange beams appearing over fields moments before the crop circles formed. The 2001 Milk Hill circle is said to be too complex for humans to have created in just one night, making it one of many examples of strange designs UFO researchers say proves crop circles are created by extraterrestrials In 2002, five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT were recruited by a television show to create crop circles, aiming to replicate the work of Bower and Chorley. The students successfully produced a formation that could be mistaken as an alien message. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules. Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.

Toronto, Ontario -- An auto parts behemoth is teaming up to provide training alongside a major collision industry group.

United Auto Parts/National Auto Parts Association is joining I-CAR Canada's sustaining partner program. 

Through this partnership, UAP/NAPA customers can now earn I-CAR Canada training credits by completing select UAP/NAPA courses. This integration streamlines the certification process and reduces training redundancy, making it more efficient for professionals to achieve their training goals. 

According to Stuart Klein, executive director of I-CAR Canada, the collaboration aims to provide technicians with greater access to high-quality education, ensuring they are equipped to perform safe and effective repairs in an evolving automotive landscape.

“By welcoming UAP/NAPA into this program, we are expanding access to high-quality training while reducing redundancy, making it easier for professionals to achieve their training goals," he said. "This partnership underscores our commitment to supporting the sustainability of our workforce and ensuring repair excellence.” 

Yves Racette, Director of NAPA/NexDrive Program Development, highlighted the alignment of this partnership with NAPA's ongoing strategy to provide top-tier training, especially in the growing electric vehicle sector.

“We are very happy to partner with I-CAR Canada to align our ongoing efforts in providing the Canadian automotive industry with first-class training and education”, he said. “We believe this partnership is aligned with our ongoing strategy to provide the best possible training to shops and technicians from across the country, including the growing EV sector. Having a more standardized approach will benefit the key players in the market as well as the customers.” </p>

These gargantuan rats, named the subalpine woolly rat (Mallomys istapantap), measure up to 33.5 inches (85 centimeters) long from the end of their tail to their nose, and weigh as much as 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms). The species was first identified in 1989 through museum specimens, but it had never been photographed or observed in the wild — until now. When they were first scientifically described, researchers noted that subalpine woolly rats are usually found in montane forests and grasslands between 8,040 and 12,630 feet (2,450 to 3,850 meters) above sea level, live a nocturnal lifestyle, mostly eats plant matter, and nest in burrows. These rodents have sharp incisor teeth, thick fur and huge 3-inch-long (8 cm) paws. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Little research has been done regarding this species in the decades since, due to its elusive nature and hard-to-access habitat, meaning it has never been formally observed, filmed or photographed in the wild before. "It's astonishing that such a large and striking animal has remained so poorly studied. How much more is there to discover about the biodiversity of tropical mountains?" On a six-month expedition to New Guinea, Vejmělka surveyed more than 60 species of rodents and marsupials on the slopes of Mount Wilhelm, the highest mountain in Papua New Guinea. —Rat numbers are skyrocketing across US cities — and it's only going to get worse —Capuchins have started abducting newborn howler monkeys in bizarre, deadly fad —Scientists solve mystery of how orange cats got their coats — and why so many are male He also recorded data about the rats' parasites, diet and patterns of activity and movement, finding it spends its days hiding in underground burrows or tree canopies, and then climbs trees at night to feast on plant matter. Vejmělka told Live Science that the extremely high and steep mountain ranges provide a unique ecosystem. "Their ancestors arrived from Asia to the island completely absent of any other terrestrial placental mammals (only marsupials and monotremes)," he said in an email, adding their size may be an example of insular gigantism — an evolutionary phenomenon where small animals on islands grow bigger than their mainland counterparts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: countdown, Jensen Ackles Countdown's Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys) on the ensemble cast, Dean Winchester comparisons, and getting to feel like Tom Cruise. With only a little more than a month to go until Prime Video's Countdown starts hitting screens, we're getting some insights on what we can expect from Showrunner/EP Derek Haas (NBC's "Chicago" franchise) and series star/EP Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys). When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum (Ackles) is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. Ackles's Mark Meachum is described as a "rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy" who "takes risks that most people wouldn't take." That could make things difficult when Meachum finds himself part of an elite team that also includes Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), Amber Oliveras (Jessica Camacho), Keyonte Bell (Elliot Knight), Evan Shepherd (Violett Beane), and Lucas Finau (Uli Latukefu). Speaking exclusively with EW, Haas noted that the show's drama won't just be about big action scenes, with Meachum involved in some romantic entanglements. "It's not going to be just one," Haas added about the potential romantic dynamics at play. And we're going to have a few of those." In addition, Ackles discussed what it was like working with the ensemble cast, how Supernatural fans might find similarities between Meachum and Dean Winchester, and how the series made him feel a bit like Tom Cruise: Ackles on Working with the "Countdown" Cast: "It's like every ingredient for a perfect dish. Everybody's so giving and happy to do whatever it takes for the team." Ackles on Fans Finding Similarities Between Mark Meachum & Dean Winchester: "There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy. It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. Ackles on Getting "Getting My Tom Cruise On" with "Countdown": "I actually just did some ADR the other day for an action sequence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Check out exclusive photos from the new Prime Video series. Samantha is a writer based in Los Angeles. Television is her one true love, and she tweets about it. But this isn't about a local police station. Rather, Countdown follows a task force comprised of law enforcement professionals from many different organizations. The idea came to Haas during his time on Chicago P.D. Haas recalls, likely referencing Erin Lindsay's (Sophia Bush) arc on the show. And he was like, 'Well, do you want her to come back?' He's like, 'She's got to join a task force.'" As Haas learned more about task forces, he says, "I found out it's kind of like an all-star team and it's got people from a bunch of different agencies. So you got DEA or NSA or you could have somebody from the coast guard, secret service, detectives from local police departments, feds. That brings us to Countdown, where this specific task force is made up of Mark Meachum (Jensen Ackles), Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), Amber Oliveras (Jessica Camacho), Keyonte Bell (Elliot Knight), Evan Shepherd (Violett Beane), and Lucas Finau (Uli Latukefu). Although we can't give too many details about their roles just yet, they will have to work as a team if they want to succeed. "Putting this disparate group together and then emphasizing different strengths is what makes the show," Haas says. I think that's what the viewers are going to find really interesting." Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Coming together as a team was a breeze for the cast, led by Supernatural and The Boys star Jensen Ackles. "It's like every ingredient for a perfect dish. Everybody blends well together," Ackles says of the cast. "Everybody's so giving and happy to do whatever it takes for the team." Speaking of Supernatural, Ackles knows fans love to see nods to his demon-fighting former character, Dean Winchester, and let's just say he doesn't think Meachum will disappoint. "There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy," he says. "It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I loved playing that kind of a character. Specifically, Ackles describes him as a "rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy" who perhaps "takes risks that most people wouldn't take." Fans can expect what Ackles calls "a fair amount" of action from the series and his character in particular. "I actually just did some ADR the other day for an action sequence," Ackles says. But there's more to the series than full-on action.There's also some romance, as Meachum finds himself in a bit of a will-they-won't-they. "It's not going to be just one," Haas says when asked about a will-they-won't-they relationship. And we're going to have a few of those."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Of course, this is an absurd hypothesis when heard without context, but it could make sense with what was seen in California. This discovery could change everything we know and have done so far when it comes to clean and renewable energy. If we stop to think about all the clean energy sources we have so far, we can come up with a good list, but they all have major challenges to overcome to be disseminated on a large scale. In other words, to solve our energy problem, we still need to create a new way to produce a lot of energy or solve the problems with the energy sources we have. A few years ago, a renewable energy company called Heliogen, backed by Bill Gates and founded by serial entrepreneur Bill Gross, tested a new approach to an existing clean energy model. They discovered that this new approach could replace the use of fossil fuels in industrial processes, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Heliogen's main goal is to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in industrial processes, as they alone account for about 75% of global energy demand. With this in mind, the company is looking to use ultra-high-carbon, carbon-free solar heat to produce clean fuels, such as green hydrogen. To test this new approach, Heliogen built a smaller version of its planned solar refinery in California. That's when hundreds of perfectly aligned mirrors, all reflecting sunlight to a central point, were spotted and mistaken for an “unidentified flying object” (UFO) sitting in the middle of nowhere. Besides being mistaken for a UFO, this object is one of our greatest hopes for the future of clean energy. There are 400 aligned mirrors concentrating sunlight on a specific point. Well, this process alone generated extreme heat with great efficiency. Just to give you an idea, most full-scale concentrated solar power plants in existence can produce temperatures in the range of 400°C to 500°C. To achieve these results, the company also had the help of cutting-edge software, which, by combining AI and a series of cameras, kept the mirrors on target as much as possible, through slight adjustments in their position throughout the day. The results that this process can generate for us are truly impressive, as they range from replacing gas and coal furnaces in industry, producing green hydrogen, storing heat for days, to generating electrical energy with extremely high efficiency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Connecticut's own Annabelle—the haunted Raggedy Ann doll famously kept under lock and key in the Warrens' Occult Museum—is on tour across the U.S., and wherever she stops, things get weird. I could've told you this would happen. According to MSN, Annabelle recently made a stop in San Antonio, Texas, where she headlined the Fourth Annual Psychic & Spirit Fest at the haunted Black Swan Inn. The event stirred up a frenzy both online and off. Social media users flooded TikTok with warnings like “DO. Paranormal investigator Ryan Daniel Buell, who's leading the “Devil's On The Run Tour,” told MySA he believes the Warrens used to travel with Annabelle themselves, though that's a claim that not everyone agrees on. But maybe the strangest stop so far? According to KPEL, shortly after Annabelle's arrival at a private paranormal event in the French Quarter, the region experienced a series of disturbing events: a local jail break, a fire at the historic Nottoway Plantation, and a spike in reports of electrical issues and pets acting strangely. One attendee said, “I'm not saying Annabelle caused it… but all of this happening at once? Look, I've read just about everything there is on Annabelle—and written plenty myself—and I can say with confidence: she's not for me. I do believe in the paranormal, but I'm not quick to label every strange occurrence as supernatural. However, when it comes to Annabelle, I do believe she's carrying something truly dark. I think the Warrens stumbled into something real and terrifying with her, and they didn't have a clue how to handle it. Check out the Ethan, Lou & Large Dave Show Podcast on Apple & Spotify I've been invited more than once to get up close with that doll. I won't go within 15 feet of her.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LORE CITY − Be it Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, Grassman or any other name, they all refer to the large, furry, humanoid creature rumored to hide in the woods. Regardless of what you call this mysterious mythical creature, here in Ohio or somewhere else in the world, there is a large contingent of true believers in the state and around the country. And so, the search continues year after year for the legendary creature as his popularity seems to grow. In Ohio, a true sign that another summer Bigfoot exploration season is underway starts with the annual Ohio Bigfoot Conference, which took place at the Salt Fork State Park Lodge in early May. The conference has been held for more than 30 years with the first meeting held in 1989 by Don Keating in Newcomerstown, Ohio. "Our mission statement has always been to educate folks on the probability and possibility that Bigfoot or Sasquatch does in fact roam the Ohio woodlands," DeWerth said. Salt Fork Park naturalist John Hickenbottom, a local authority on and self-proclaimed Bigfoot enthusiast, feels the real attraction of the conference is the opportunity to meet other Bigfoot fans. You get to spend a weekend with people who are interested in Bigfoot. "I mean, you would have to consider interest in Bigfoot to be a fringe amount of the population. Well now, by attending the conference, you get to mingle, meet and talk with around 3,000 people who share your interest in the 'Big Guy.'" A group of over 3,000 Bigfoot enthusiasts were estimated to be in attendance for this year's event, which featured an impressive list of guest speakers, including Ranae Holland and Cliff Barackman of Finding Bigfoot, which is an American reality television series on Animal Planet that follows a team of four researchers investigating potential evidence for Bigfoot, a human or ape-like mythical creature. 'We created the Ohio Bigfoot Hall of Fame in 2012 with the idea that it was time to start giving recognition to the early pioneers of Ohio's Bigfoot research community," DeWerth said. "These individuals who took the time to investigate and document Ohio's vast Bigfoot history. "Making the Eco-Discovery Center its home is a perfect place for it to be displayed so people truly understand that Ohio does in fact have a huge history when it comes to the Bigfoot phenomenon.  " Then make plans to attend popular bigfoot hikes called Salt Fork Squatchin' The hikes begin shortly after Memorial Day and are held monthly until around September. "It is family friendly (not scary) Bigfoot hike that we call Salt Fork Squatchin', and there is no pre-registration and free of charge," said Hickenbottom, who organizes the hikes. "Visitors get to learn about the legend of Bigfoot here at Salt Fork and some of the research techniques that Bigfoot researchers use out in the field. They also learn about nocturnal animals, owls, coyotes, etc., ecology and habitat. For more information on Salt Fork Squatchin', contact naturalist John Hickenbottom at 740-630-6105 or john.hickenbottom@dnr.ohio.gov.</p>
