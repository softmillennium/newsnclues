The CBO has estimated at least 15 million people would lose health care coverage due to the bill's cuts to Medicaid.

Republicans' marquee reconciliation bill would redistribute wealth from the poorest to the richest Americans over the next decade, new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) show.

An analysis of the bill, dubbed by President Donald Trump as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” finds that the poorest 10 percent of Americans would experience a 4 percent decrease in their household resources, as calculated by their incomes, in the decade of the bill's enforcement. 

The richest 10 percent, or those making $170,000 according to 2021 data, would see a 2 percent increase, with gains up to 4 percent in coming years. Overall, the CBO found that the bill would add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.

“The agency estimates that in general, resources would decrease for households in the lowest decile (tenth) of the income distribution, whereas resources would increase for households in the highest decile,” the agency wrote in its report.

This redistribution of wealth would come as a result of the bill's massive cuts to crucial welfare programs, combined with tax cuts for the rich.

The CBO has estimated that 15 million people, and likely far more, would lose health care coverage as a result of the bill's $716 billion cuts to Medicaid and provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would face major cuts, to the tune of nearly $300 billion, which helps to feed 42 million people across the U.S. each year.

The bill also cuts other programs benefiting working class families, including student loan aid plans and environmental investments — while funnelling $150 billion to the Pentagon and more funding for Trump's horrific mass deportation agenda.

At the center of the bill is a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy, including an extension of Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from 2017. Research has found that the richest Americans would gain tens of thousands of dollars in tax savings each year from the cuts, while the bottom 20 percent of Americans would see their taxes increase over the course of the bill. 

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a whopping two-thirds of the share of the tax cuts would go to the richest 20 percent of Americans, with incomes of $157,000 and above — including 24 percent to the richest 1 percent.

These effects would compound upon decades of existing wealth redistribution to the rich. Since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act originally passed, U.S. billionaires have doubled their wealth to a collective $5.8 trillion, Americans for Tax Fairness found last year. It's not just the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that is fueling the growing wealth gap, however; according to an analysis by RAND published in February, the richest 1 percent of Americans have sapped $79 trillion in wealth from the bottom 90 percent since 1975.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Truthout is appealing for your support to weather this storm of censorship. We've launched a fundraising campaign to find 232 new monthly donors in the next 24 hours. Will you be one?

As independent media with no corporate backing or billionaire ownership, Truthout is uniquely able to push back against the right-wing narrative and expose the shocking extent of political repression under the new McCarthyism. We're committed to doing this work, but we're also deeply vulnerable to Trump's attacks.

Your support during our fundraiser (24 hours left!) will help us continue our nonprofit movement journalism in the face of right-wing authoritarianism. Please make a tax-deductible donation today.

Donald Trump ambushed Cyril Ramaphosa during their Oval Office meeting with footage he said showed white South Africans being persecuted.

In an extraordinary confrontation, the US president ordered staffers to dim the lights and play a video showcasing what he called a genocide of white farmers in the country.

Turning to Mr Ramaphosa, the South African president, Mr Trump said people “were fleeing” while demanding an “explanation” for what he said was a “very sad situation”.

“We have thousands of stories talking about it, we have documentaries, we have news stories... it has to be responded to,” the US president said.

Narrating over the footage, he continued: “These are burial sites right here, over a thousand of white farmers and those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning.”

“Those cars aren't driving. They're stopped there to pay respects to their family member who was killed, and it's a terrible sight. I've never seen anything like it.”

Visibly uncomfortable, Mr Ramaphosa appeared to turn away to speak to the US president, who in turn pointed at him to implore him to continue watching.

Mr Trump accused Pretoria of carrying out a “genocide” against white Afrikaner farmers, allegations South Africa has vehemently denied.

After being shown the clips of what Mr Trump claimed were black South Africans making racist speeches and singing “kill the Boer” about white people, Mr Ramaphosa told Mr Trump: “This is not government policy.”

Confronting Mr Ramaphosa in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said: “You're taking people's land. And those people, in many cases, are being executed. They're being executed and they happen to be white, and most of them happen to be farmers, and that's a tough situation.”

Earlier this month the Trump administration admitted 59 white South Africans as refugees who have claimed they have been discriminated against because of their race.

After the footage had finished playing, Mr Trump began flicking through a series of news articles printed out on A4 paper showcasing apparent white persecution.

“Death, death, death, horrible death,” he said as he examined the stories.

Meanwhile, South African native Elon Musk, who has increasingly been absent from the White House in recent weeks, watched on in silence.

Pointing to him during the exchange, Mr Trump admitted he does not want” to get “Elon involved”, suggesting it was too dangerous.

He said: “I know many people from South Africa... Elon is from South Africa. But I don't want to get Elon involved. He actually wanted to talk about a different subject, sending rockets to space.”

There were moments of levity sprinkled throughout the press conference, with conversation intermittently turning to golf.

Mr Ramaphosa was flanked by some of South Africa's top golfers in the Oval Office, including Ernie Els.

Els, a former world number one is friends with both men and is understood to have been instrumental in persuading Mr Trump to set up the meeting with the South African president.

Mr Trump cut off aid to South Africa over allegations the country was mistreating its minority white population. Washington also expelled the country's ambassador, accusing him of being a “race-baiting politician” who hates the US and Mr Trump.

Experts in South Africa say there is no evidence of white people being targeted, although farmers of all races are victims of violent home invasions in a country that suffers from a very high crime rate.

The South African leader had sought to use the meeting to set the record straight and salvage his country's relationship with the United States which is at its lowest point since South Africa enforced its apartheid system of racial segregation, which ended in 1994.

Mr Trump has falsely accused the South African government of a rights violation against white Afrikaner farmers by seizing their land through a new expropriation law. No land has been seized and the South African government has pushed back, saying US criticism is driven by misinformation.

The Trump administration's references to the Afrikaner people — who are descendants of Dutch and other European settlers — have also elevated previous claims made by Mr Musk that the South African government is allowing attacks on white farmers in what amounts to a genocide.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the project could cost as much as $831 billion over the next 20 years.

President Donald Trump has chosen a concept plan for his “Golden Dome” missile defense system that he says would cost $175 billion — but that other government officials say could cost over $800 billion in the next 20 years.

The president said in remarks in the Oval Office that the system, inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, would be “fully operational before the end of my term” in 2029. Behind the president were two large posters depicting an illustration of a science fiction-esque golden dome over the U.S.

Experts have said that, not only is the timeline impossible, but the entire project is nearly completely unfeasible, with an absurd price tag. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the deployment and operation of the project could cost as much as $831 billion over the next 20 years, or as little as $161 billion. 

The project would publicly put U.S. weapons into space for the first time. In a January executive order directing the Pentagon to research the project, Trump cited vague threats of missiles and “advanced aerial attacks” as “the most catastrophic threat facing the United States.” 

The project is inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, which exists in large part due to the Israeli military's near-constant aggression toward Israel's neighboring countries and subjugation of Palestinians. The Iron Dome is capable only of intercepting short range missiles, and operates by shooting them down with missiles.

Previous attempts to develop technology to intercept the types of intercontinental missiles Trump is referring to have failed. Further, some analysts say it's unlikely that countries like China or Russia would attack the U.S. directly at all, making the system a nearly completely redundant expense.

But the price tag is, perhaps, the point. Trump — who has close ties to numerous owners of major defense contractors — has backed a record-breaking $1 trillion annual defense budget. This would represent a major boon for military contractors, who receive roughly half of the Pentagon's massive budget each year.

Defense Contractors are already boosting the idea. In an interview with Fox on Wednesday, Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet boasted that the dome would create jobs domestically, while also trying to sell Lockheed Martin as a company that could play a major role in its creation.

Among benefactors of the project could be Elon Musk, who has played a major role in Trump's government-gutting spree after spending more than $250 million on Trump's reelection; and Peter Thiel, a major backer of Vice President J.D. Vance, credited for Vance's rise in politics. 

Musk's SpaceX and Thiel's Palantir are reportedly frontrunners to win a contract to build a major part of the Golden Dome, Reuters reported last month.

Donald Trump ambushed Cyril Ramaphosa with videos of what he said was persecution of white South Africans as the two leaders met in the Oval Office.

Mr Trump told the South African president that white farmers were being “persecuted” and “fleeing” the country, demanding an “explanation” for what he said was a “very sad situation”.

“We have thousands of stories talking about it, we have documentaries, we have news stories... it has to be responded to,” the US president said.

Narrating over the footage, having dimmed the lights in the Oval Office, he continued: “These are burial sites right here, over a thousand of white farmers and those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning.”

Mr Trump then flicked through a series of news articles in front of Mr Ramaphosa about “white South Africans... fleeing because of the violence and racist laws”. He added, looking at one story: “This family was wiped out.”

The people “being persecuted” are “generally... white farmers and they're fleeing South Africa and it's a very sad thing to see”, Mr Trump said, telling Mr Ramaphosa: “I hope we have an explanation of that, because I know you don't want that.”

Donald Trump's meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office in front of media is now over.

A trade union leader who is part of Cyril Ramaphosa's delegation was called to speak.

She insisted that issues within South Africa were more to do with crime, than race, citing the murder and rape of black women in the country.

Donald Trump nodded along as she spoke, and did not interrupt.

South African golfer Ernie Els tells Donald Trump about growing up during apartheid, adding: “Two wrongs don't make a right”.

The former world number one says: “We wanted to come here to meet you and see the way forward [and] see our nation flourish.”

Donald Trump described a genocide under way in South Africa.

“We have hundreds of people, thousands of people, trying to come into our country because they feel they're going to be killed and their land is going to be confiscated,” he said in the Oval Office.

In fact the first flight that arrived from South Africa last week carried just 59 people. They flew on a Boeing 767 chartered by the Trump administration, leaving most of its 270 seats unoccupied.

Cyril Ramaphosa is trying to steer the conversation back to the economy and away from persecution claims, saying his “main reason” for being in the US is to “foster trade and investment”.

That will allow them to “address these societal problems”, he continues, saying people turn to crime when they are unemployed and “have no other hope”.

John Steenhuisen, the minister for agriculture in South Africa, has insisted that the majority of white farmers want to stay in South Africa.

He said that the attacks on farms must also be treated as priority crimes, and that the views of Julius Malema and Jacob Zuma, whom Mr Trump showed videos of, do not represent the views of the current government.

He said that his party, the Democratic Alliance, has joined hands with Mr Ramaphosa's government, of the African National Congress party, to “keep those people out of the union”.

Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, knew it would be a tricky meeting. The Trump administration last week gave refuge to Afrikaner farmers amid wild accusations that they were the victims of a genocide and land seizures.

But he may not have reckoned with Donald Trump's sense of theatre.

“Turn the lights down and just put this on,' he said, as journalists and leaders alike craned to watch an explosive video of Julius Malema, leader of a fringe communist party, dancing and singing an anti-Apartheid song entitled “Kill the Boer, the farmer.”

Mr Trump accused his guest of failing to protect white South Africans as Mr Ramaphosa tried to keep his cool, explaining that his government had nothing to do with Mr Malema.

That may be so, and Mr Trump's grasp of South African politics might be weak, but once again he had used the intimate setting of the Oval Office to drive home his point.

Donald Trump pointed to Elon Musk during his Oval Office meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, although he admitted he “did not want” to get “Elon involved”.

He said: “I know many people from South Africa...Elon is from South Africa. But I don't want to get Elon involved. He actually wanted to talk about a different subject, sending rockets to space.”

Speaking over Mr Ramaphosa, the US president added: “I would say that people are fleeing South Africa for their own safety, their land is being confiscated and they are being killed.”

Media figures speak out as Orbán's party proposes penalising organisations that receive foreign funding

More than 90 editors-in-chief and publishers from across Europe have signed a statement calling on the EU to take action over proposed legislation in Hungary, warning that, if passed, it could result in “effectively outlawing the free press”.

Earlier this month, Viktor Orbán's rightwing populist party, Fidesz, put forward legislation that would allow the government to monitor, penalise and potentially ban organisations that receive any sort of foreign funding, including donations or EU grants.

The proposal was immediately criticised by opposition politicians, who said it would pave the way for the government to potentially shut down all independent media and NGOs engaged in public affairs.

The statement published this week, signed by leading media voices from 23 countries, described the draft bill as being in line with “the authoritarian tactics” seen in Russia under Vladimir Putin, in a reference to the country's “foreign agent” law.

The Hungarian legislation, which would allow the government to blacklist organisations, levy steep fines on them and ban them from receiving donations, had been written “so broadly that it could be applied to virtually any organisation involved in public life or debate,” it said.

The latest move by Orbán – who is facing an unprecedented challenge from a former member of the Fidesz elite, Péter Magyar, before elections next year – was particularly significant given the wider political context, it added. “The survival of a free press is not a local issue, especially in a region where more and more populist leaders are borrowing techniques from Viktor Orbán.”

The statement, whose signatories included the Guardian's editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, as well as editors from Libération in France and Gazeta Wyborcza in Poland, called on the EU and governments across Europe to do all they could to prevent the draft law from being passed.

Since Orbán's return to power in 2010, he has been repeatedly accused of working to weaken democratic institutions and undermine the rule of law in Hungary.

Those who have borne the brunt of this crackdown include independent media, with press freedom plunging as Orbán is accused of wielding state subsidies to reward pro-government outlets and starve critical media. Weakened media outlets have, at times, been snapped up by entrepreneurs loyal to Orbán and turned into government mouthpieces, resulting in Fidesz and its loyalists now controlling more than 80% of the country's media.

This month's draft law, however, has been described by critics as one of Orbán's boldest moves to date. “Its aim is to silence all critical voices and eliminate what remains of Hungarian democracy once and for all,” a joint statement, signed by hundreds of civil society and media organisations, recently noted.

The Hungarian Helsinki committee (HHC), a human rights organisation, described the draft legislation as a “dark turn in Hungary's erosion of democratic norms”. In a statement, Márta Pardavi, the organisation's co-chair, added: “If this bill passes, it will not simply marginalise Hungary's independent voices – it will extinguish them.”

The HHC is among the many organisations that are scrambling to have the EU intervene before Fidesz uses its parliamentary majority to pass the legislation in mid-June.

“The consequences reverberate beyond Hungary's borders and are already spreading,” said Pardavi. “This model of illiberal repression is designed to be exported. The European Union must act decisively before this anti-democratic playbook becomes the new norm.”

The sentiment was echoed by Transparency International. “If adopted, this law will be immediately weaponised against those trying to preserve the rule of law in Hungary,” said Nick Aiossa, the director at Transparency International EU, in a statement. “The EU institutions cannot and must not sit idly by while Hungary targets civil society and destroys democracy from the inside.”

Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, had said the bill had been introduced amid worries that foreign-funded organisations, primarily from the US and Brussels, were being used to shape the country's political discourse.

On Wednesday, 26 EU lawmakers from across the political spectrum weighed in, signing a letter calling for Brussels to freeze all funding to Hungary. After years of being at loggerheads with the EU, there had been little meaningful progress, said the letter, written by German Green MEP Daniel Freund and seen by the Guardian.

Instead the country had seen further “alarming regressions,” citing examples such as the recent law banning Budapest's Pride parade and the draft legislation aimed at silencing government critics.

“Continuing to fund a corrupt regime openly undermining European values is unacceptable,” the letter noted. “At a moment when Europe faces profound external challenges, we must stand united in defence of democracy and fundamental rights, resisting any drift towards authoritarianism in our union.”

The legislation is aimed at making public colleges and universities tuition-free for most Americans.

As U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans move to gut federal student aid programs to help fund tax cuts for the rich, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday will introduce legislation aimed at making public colleges and universities tuition-free for most Americans.

The College for All Act of 2025, shared exclusively with Common Dreams ahead of its official introduction, would eliminate public college and university tuition and fees for students from married households earning $300,000 or less per year or single households earning $150,000 or less.

The legislation would also make public community colleges and trade schools tuition-free for all students, and provide grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other institutions to eliminate tuition and fees for eligible students.

Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who will introduce identical companion legislation in the House, presented the bill as a direct counter to Trump and congressional Republicans, whose emerging reconciliation package and proposed federal budget for the coming fiscal year would enact deep cuts to federal higher education funding — while delivering huge tax breaks to the richest Americans.

“Instead of increasing the cost of college in order to give more tax breaks to billionaires, we have a better idea,” said Sanders. “We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free so that working-class students can succeed and are not burdened with a lifetime of debt.”

Jayapal, a senior House Democratic whip and chair emerita of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said that “Congress can and must ensure that working families never have to take out crushing loans to pursue an education.”

“The College for All Act will free students from a lifetime of debt, invest in working people, and transform higher education across America by making a degree more accessible to poor and working families across this country,” she added. “This is more important now than ever as Trump continues to attack education in this country through attempts to strip funding from universities and to dismantle the Department of Education.”

The legislation stands no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress, but it represents an alternative vision for higher education that has proven extremely popular with the American public. A 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 63% of U.S. adults support making public colleges and universities tuition-free.

More recent polling has shown similar support, with Democratic voters overwhelmingly backing the proposal as higher education costs rise and students graduate saddled with massive student loan debt.

Sanders plans to introduce the legislation Wednesday morning at a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP Committee hearing on the state of higher education in the U.S., where public college costs more per student than in any other country except Luxembourg, according to the Education Data Initiative.

“Making public colleges and universities tuition-free is not a radical idea,” declares a summary of the College for All Act provided by Sanders' office. “Other wealthy countries like France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland made their public colleges and universities tuition-free or virtually tuition-free several years ago.”

“Over 50 years ago, many of our most prestigious public colleges and universities were also tuition-free or virtually tuition-free,” the summary notes. “In a competitive global economy, we need the best-educated workforce in the world. Young people should not have to go deeply into debt to get the education they and our nation need. We must make public colleges and universities tuition-free.”

G7 finance ministers and central bank governors are meeting for three days in the Alberta resort town of Banff as a prelude to the Leaders' Summit next month.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

This week, finance ministers and central bank governors belonging to G7 countries are gathering in Banff, Alta., to discuss a range of global economic and financial challenges against the backdrop of a global trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The three-day meeting in the Alberta resort town is a prelude to the main event next month, the G7 Leaders' Summit, which Canada will host in Kananaskis, Alta.

Here is a guide to the G7. 

The G7 stands for Group of Seven and it is an informal grouping of the world's seven advanced economies. It includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States.

The European Union has also been included in the G7 since 1981 (when Canada hosted) as a “non-enumerated” member because of its large market size, according to think tank the Council on Foreign Relations.

Each year, a different member country holds the presidency of the G7 and the host rotates in the following order: France, U.S., Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada.

The informal grouping is different from the likes of NATO and the United Nations, which are formal institutions with charters and secretariats.

The G7 provides an opportunity for major democracies to convene, and discuss global economic policy and emerging global crises.

It began in 1975 as a gathering of the six other countries, excluding Canada. The following year, Canada joined. Members created the group in reaction to global economic crises of the time, where high oil prices caused instability, slow growth and high inflation. 

By 1998, Russia had joined as a full member, turning the group into the G8. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton had thought adding Russia would help it align more with the West. In 2014, Russia's annexation of Crimea turned it into a pariah and it was booted from the group.

The G7 Leaders' Summit is the main annual event, but there are ministerial meetings that are more focused. 

In March, foreign ministers gathered in Quebec. In May, finance ministers and central bank governors convened in Alberta.

The Leaders' Summit has consistently dealt with macroeconomic management, international trade and relations with developing countries, according to the University of Toronto's G7 Research Group.

In the past, climate change, gender equality and, recently, artificial intelligence have also been major topics.

This year's summit is occurring against a backdrop of rising trade tensions after Mr. Trump launched a global trade war.

G7 countries are all trying to strike trade deals with Washington to avoid the tariffs imposed – but then paused – by Mr. Trump, which he argued were necessary to remedy unfair trading practices by allies, as well as by competitors such as China.

The G7 has been criticized for its lack of follow-through on policy initiatives and its exclusion of emerging powers, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. 

An awareness of this oversight has prompted host countries to include leaders from outside the G7 at summits, the think tank says. Last year, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, India, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritania, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were included at the summit in Italy.

Canada will host the 2025 G7 Leaders' Summit from June 15 to 17 in Kananaskis, Alta., located west of Calgary in the Rockies.

Canada has hosted six other summits in the past:

All the heads of state of G7 countries are expected to attend, including Mr. Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 

World leaders, ministers, delegates and special guests are invited. Residents that live nearby can also attend, and journalists from around the world come to cover the meetings.

This year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are also expected to attend.

U.S. national-security adviser Jake Sullivan referred to the G7 as the “steering committee of the free world” in 2022. 

Senator Peter Boehm, a former diplomat who played a central role in Canada's participation in the G7 for decades, said it's a key tool for Canada to exert influence and safeguard economic and security interests. “Our participation in the G7 is potentially the jewel of the crown of our foreign policy.”

The group originally focused largely on economic matters. But the rise of countries such as China and India has prompted the G7 to hone in on the rule of law, human rights and open markets.

The G7 also inspires projects, such as a monitoring service led by Canada that tracks how adversarial countries spread disinformation, particularly through social media during general elections.

When hosting the G7, countries often launch a “signature initiative,” usually a multiyear development project that gets large amounts of funding from peer countries.

In 2018, the Liberals rallied nearly $3.8-billion for educating women and girls in crisis and conflict situations. In 2010, the Conservatives pledged $1.1-billion for maternal health, and got peer countries to focus part of their aid budgets on this cause.

Mr. Boehm argues the summits feature “frank and unscripted discussions among leaders” that help them get on the same page, “despite the almost universal skepticism of first-time participants.”

            Until last week, a secretive fleet of ships ferrying Russian oil around the world showed no clear links to the Kremlin. That changed when, in a dramatic escalation, Russia used a fighter jet in an apparent effort to protect one of the tankers thought to be in the fleet.
    


            After the Estonian military contacted the Jaguar – an unflagged tanker sanctioned by the United Kingdom earlier this month – on May 13 in an attempt to carry out checks, a Russian Su-35 fighter jet flew past the ship, inside Estonian airspace, the Estonian Defense Forces said. The military eventually escorted the tanker out of Estonian waters.
    


            “This is something very new,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters Thursday at a NATO meeting in Turkey. Russia has now “officially tied and connected itself” to the so-called shadow fleet, he added.
    


            Others agree. “This seems to be a step-change in Kremlin thinking,” Ed Arnold, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a UK-based think tank, told CNN.

Europe's undersea infrastructure keeps getting damaged. What's going on?



            Estimated to be hundreds of vessels strong, with no official ties to Russia, the “shadow fleet” includes many old, poorly maintained ships, which have in some instances wreaked environmental havoc and, according to some, have been implicated in damage to vital undersea cables off the Baltic coast. Russia has denied any role in the damage.
    


            The tankers, many with opaque ownership structures, transport Russian oil for export to avoid Western sanctions. As such, they have themselves become a focus of further sanctions on Moscow.
    


            On Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that a sanctioned ship belonging to the shadow fleet was caught performing “suspicious maneuvers” near an undersea power cable that runs between Poland and Sweden, before the Polish military intervened.
    


            Russia's use, for the first time, of “military action” in response to economic sanctions “is a testament to the level of the threat that we're facing on the eastern flank of NATO,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told journalists at the meeting in Turkey.
    


            Video shot from the bridge of the Jaguar, which appears to have been edited, shows a radio call from Estonian authorities demanding the ship change course, with Estonian military ships and aircraft visible around the tanker. CNN has corroborated details of the footage, which was shared online by Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of Russian state media outlet RT.
    


            Later in the video, a sole Russian Su-35 fighter jet sweeps ahead of the tanker, which was previously named the Argent, according to shipping records and the UK government. In response, Portuguese F-16 jets on a NATO mission in Estonia were rushed to the area to monitor the Russian aircraft, NATO said.
    


            The jets are part of a strengthened NATO presence in northern Europe since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            “Probably what the Kremlin is trying to do is push back on that, so in the hope that NATO nations get spooked by what happened (last Tuesday),” said Arnold at RUSI.
    


            “There will be those within NATO who are a bit worried about this and say, ‘Well, hang on, do we really want to risk starting a wider confrontation with Russia over one ship?'”
    


            For the Estonians, the Russian jet's intrusion into Estonian air space is proof that Western sanctions are biting.
    


            The incident “demonstrates that monitoring and sanctioning the shadow fleet is effective and that such efforts must be further intensified,” the Estonian Defense Forces said in a statement.

            CNN was not able to locate the registered owner of the Jaguar for comment. The Russian Ministry of Defense has declined to respond to CNN's request for comment. The Kremlin has previously refused to respond to accusations that it uses a “shadow fleet.”
    


            In January, following repeated incidents in which ships caused damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, NATO launched the “Baltic Sentry” initiative to bolster its military presence in the waters.
    


            “We see the (Tuesday) incident as a reaction to Baltic Sentry,” Col. Martin O'Donnell, a NATO spokesman, told CNN. “Russia's destabilizing actions will not deter us from acting within international law to maintain maritime security, safety and freedom of navigation.”
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that a new sanctions package could be adopted as early as Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to join Russia's talks with Ukraine in Turkey last week. Merz had said earlier that Russia's “shadow fleet” – “permanently operating in the Baltic Sea with up to 300 ships” – would be specifically targeted in this package.
    


            In a possible tit-for-tat move, a Greek-owned oil tanker, Green Admire, was detained Sunday by Russia as it transited Russian waters on a route agreed by Estonia, Finland and Russia, Estonia's foreign minister posted on X.
    


            CNN has reached out to the vessel's owner and the Russian foreign ministry for comment. The Russian foreign ministry has not responded.
    


            Estonian authorities have conducted more than 450 checks on vessels in Tallinn-controlled waters in the Baltic Sea since last June, according to the country's transport ministry. This includes the Gulf of Finland, one of the principal conduits for Russian overseas trade.

The Toyota RAV4 dethroned the Ford F-150 pickup as the best-selling passenger vehicle in the United States after a reign of 40 years. While that's not the case in Canada, the RAV4 still comes in second and manages to keep its head well above the rest of the field of compact SUVs, including the exceedingly popular Honda CR-V. 

Now, there's an all-new RAV4, which will be built in Ontario and is destined to build on the momentum of the previous generation. It was revealed Tuesday evening in Texas while simultaneously being revealed in Tokyo and Europe at separate events. Its continued success will likely hinge on the fact that the RAV4 will be sold only as a hybrid.

The RAV4's success, especially in recent years, signifies a shift in consumer preferences toward smaller and more economical vehicles. High prices, fuel costs and inflated loan rates are driving people away from large SUVs and pickups over to more fuel-efficient compact and subcompact cars and crossovers.

Toyota's success with the RAV4 cannot be understated. Long wait times to secure a new one in Canada are the norm. The Toyota Canada website still states that inventory for the RAV4 and RAV4 hybrid is limited.

Inconsistent EV rules in Canadian provinces create road bumps for buyers outside Quebec, B.C.

Since the first Corolla-based generation came out in 1995, the RAV4's car-like driving manners with increased utility proved a winning formula. Today, compact SUVs represent one of the most popular segments in the industry.

The new 2026 RAV4 doesn't mess with the last generation's formula but only improves on it. The chassis receives a stronger foundation with stiffer suspension mounts and frame joints that are said to decrease noise and vibrations.

There are three new grades of RAV4: Core, Sport and Rugged. Depending on what you pick, there's either a hybrid or plug-in hybrid drivetrain on offer. Each grade features distinctive styling and has separate trim levels, providing a lot of choice for the consumer but also making the new model structure confusing. So much so that Toyota included a table in their press release to illustrate which powertrain is available with which trim.

Allow me to simplify it as best I can. The Core and Rugged models are all regular hybrids. The Sport trims get the option of hybrid or plug-in hybrid drivetrains. Under the Sport trim umbrella, there's an all-new Gazoo Racing (GR) trim with specially tuned suspension under the consultation of Toyota's in-house racing division. The GR Sport RAV4 will be a plug-in hybrid only.

The plug-in hybrid system, now in its fourth generation, gets up to 320 horsepower, an 18 horsepower increase over the outgoing generation, while being more efficient and getting up to 80 kilometres of all-electric range. The company says that the gains have been made possible through highly efficient silicon-carbide semiconductors and a larger battery. The plug-in will also get DC fast charging capability (not on all trims), which means a 10 to 80 per cent charge in 30 minutes. Level 2 charging speeds have also been improved with a new onboard 11-kilowatt charger.

The new fifth-generation hybrid sees improvements in efficiency but also more power, now up to 236 horsepower, owing to an updated battery, power electronics and transaxle.

A new infotainment system is Toyota's first step toward software-defined vehicles, according to the company. There's an all-new digital instrument cluster and either a 10.5-inch or 12.9-inch centre touchscreen and an available head-up display. The new infotainment system is said to be easier to use with improved voice recognition and standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

Core models get a clean body-coloured grille, the GR gets a large and open functional grille and the Rugged or Woodland version will get a look that feels inspired by Toyota's bigger SUVs such as the Land Cruiser and 4Runner.

A large part of Toyota's recent success can be attributed to its influx of hybrid models across its lineup, with many of them, like the Camry and Sienna, being exclusively electrified. The new RAV4 is likely to bolster this upward sales trajectory by significantly increasing the number of hybrids on offer from the company.

The RAV4 is built in Cambridge and Woodstock, Ont. and both plants are undergoing retooling for production of the new RAV4, which will launch later this year. Eighty-five per cent of those RAV4s are exported to the United States. The company says that as of now, tariffs have not affected current production plans, which will remain in Canada.

Pricing and further details on the new RAV4 will be available closer to its launch.

            A suicide attack on a school bus in southwestern Pakistan killed three students of a military-run school on Wednesday, officials said, in the latest attack that underscores the deteriorating security situation in the region.
    


            The explosion took place in the city of Khuzdar in restive Balochistan province and targeted a school bus carrying “a large number” of children of military officials, according to Yasir Dashti, a senior government official from the province. Dashti said 38 people were wounded in the attack.
    


            “The bus was carrying Army Public School children,” said Kaleem Ullah, a police official from Khuzdar.
    


            Army Public Schools are a network of school across Pakistan for children of military staff.
    


            At least three children and two adults were killed, according to a statement from the Pakistan military.
    


            There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack so far.
    


            Balochistan has been rocked for years by a separatist insurgency that seeks greater political autonomy and economic development in the strategically important and mineral-rich mountainous region.

            Pakistan's military accused “Indian proxies” of being behind the attack in a statement released shortly after the incident. It did not give evidence for its claims.
    


            Pakistan has previously accused its neighbor and arch-rival of being behind attacks in Balochistan. New Delhi has denied the accusations.
    


            India's foreign ministry rejected what it described as “baseless allegations” on Wednesday, and accused Islamabad of leveling such claims “to hide its own gross failings.”
    


            “India condoles the loss of lives in all such incidents,” a spokesperson for the country's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement to CNN.
    


            “However, in order to divert attention from its reputation as the global epicenter of terrorism and to hide its own gross failings, it has become second nature for Pakistan to blame India for all its internal issues,” the spokesperson added.
    


            Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “strongly condemned the cowardly attack” in a statement and repeated the military's accusations that India was behind the attack.
    


            India has long accused Pakistan of sheltering militant groups that have carried out attacks across the border, including a recent massacre of tourists in India-administered Kashmir, allegations Islamabad has denied.
    


            Tensions between the two spiraled after that massacre and resulted in a brief four-day conflict earlier this month that was the most sustained fighting between the two in decades. A fragile ceasefire has held since then.
    


            Wednesday's attack comes just over two months after the deadly hijacking of a train by separatist militants in Balochistan.
    


            In that incident the Baloch Liberation Army took more than 350 people – some of whom were security personnel – hostage, killing 27 of them.
    


            Children have also been the target of some of Pakistan's most devastating terror attacks.
    


            At least 145 people, mostly school children, were killed in by Pakistani Taliban militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2014 – the worst terror attack in the country's history.
    


            The Pakistani Taliban's most notable target was then 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot on October 9, 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls.

Call for UK PM to act urgently over pro-democracy campaigner who has spent 1,602 days in solitary confinement

Former prisoners and hostages wrongly held abroad have urged the UK prime minister to urgently secure the release of the pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai before he dies in a Hong Kong jail.

The 77-year-old media mogul, who is a British citizen, has been held in solitary confinement for 1,602 days and his family fears he might not survive another summer in Hong Kong, where temperatures can reach 40C (104F).

A letter to Keir Starmer signed by 22 people who were detained abroad and their family members, says he must act “before it is too late”.

The signatories include Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Jason Rezaian, who were held in Iran, Matthew Hedges, who was imprisoned in the UAE, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, Alsu Kurmasheva and Paul Whelan, who were released by Russia last year in a prisoner swap with the US.

They write: “We know firsthand the horror of these cases and the reality of living everyday with the knowledge you may never see your loved one again. We also know that resolving these cases and bringing British citizens home to the UK depends on robust, principled, strategic action by the UK government.”

At a press conference in London on Wednesday, Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, lead international counsel for Lai and his son, Jimmy, said there had been “outrageous foot dragging” in Lai's case, involving charges under the city's punitive national security law.

She said it was supposed to last 30 days when it started after multiple adjournments in December 2023 but a current six-month pause meant closing submissions would not take place until August.

Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, said: “I think we do need to be looking at government squarely in the eye and saying … ‘How dare you not prioritise the protection of your citizens from torture, from profound injustice and from the risk of death?'”

An emotional Anoosheh Ashoori, 71, who was released in Iran at the same time as Zaghari-Ratcliffe, said: “Luckily, I was only 116 days in a solitary confinement. With someone who has been there for such a long time, even for me it is difficult to imagine how resilient he must be and what he has been through.”

The signatories urge Starmer to urgently accede to the Lai's son's request for a meeting with the prime minister.

Gallagher said that raising Lai's case bilaterally was not enough, the UK government had to make the Chinese understand “that actually there is a conditionality or an impact if they don't engage”.

A UK government spokesperson said Lai's case was a priority, adding: “We continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release Jimmy Lai.”

            South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa will hold crucial talks at the White House with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday in a high-stakes meeting that could improve or deteriorate already frosty relations between the nations.
    


            Ramaphosa is hopeful his visit could end a diplomatic feud that sparked aid cancellations by Trump and fueled the expulsion of his nation's ambassador to the US – but some in his country fear the meeting could go off the rails, as it did for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the notorious Oval Office encounter in February.
    


            There are also fears that the African nation could now potentially lose some of its US trade privileges as relations between the two countries sour.
    


            Ramaphosa's trip comes just over a week after a group of 59 White South Africans arrived in the US after being granted refugee status.
    


            Trump and his ally Elon Musk, who was born and raised in the country, claimed the South Africans were being persecuted back home. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was in the US national interest to prioritize White South Africans for refugee resettlement, telling a hearing that they're “a small subset” who “are easier to vet.”
    


            Rubio did not rule out that their race is a factor in the resettlement but argued that they are being “persecuted” for being White.
    


            The Trump administration has sharply criticized an expropriation law, which was enacted in South Africa earlier this year, in an attempt to reverse historic racial inequalities. The law empowers South Africa's government to take land and redistribute it – with no obligation to pay compensation in some instances – if the seizure is found to be “just and equitable and in the public interest.”



            During a discriminatory apartheid government that ended in the mid-1990s, Black South Africans were forcibly dispossessed of their lands for the benefit of Whites. Today, some three decades after the end of apartheid, Blacks, who comprise over 80% of the country's population of 63 million, own around 4% of private land.

            Trump claimed that lands belonging to minority Whites, who own 72% of the nation's agricultural land, were being targeted for confiscation, and cited unverified claims that “a genocide is taking place” in South Africa. He added that “White farmers are being brutally killed” amid reports of farm attacks.
    


            South African authorities have pushed back hard against those claims with police minister Senzo Mchunu saying there was no evidence of a “White genocide” in the country.
    


            In a statement in February, the South African Police Service urged the public “to desist from assumptions that belong to the past, where farm murders are the same as murders of white farmers.”



            Trump also disapproves of South Africa's genocide case before the International Court of Justice against the US ally Israel.
    


            Ramaphosa's office said he would “discuss bilateral, regional and global issues of interest” with the US president at the White House. Analysts say the meeting could pose a tipping point for their fraught ties.
    


            The US is South Africa's second-largest trading partner, and the African nation benefits the most from a US trade agreement that provides preferential duty-free access to US markets for eligible sub-Saharan African nations.
    


            Under that agreement, South Africa is the main agricultural exporter and exports two-thirds of its agricultural goods to the US, tariff-free. But some US lawmakers want those benefits withdrawn when the trade agreement is reviewed this year.
    


            South African researcher Neo Letswalo describes the anticipated meeting as “make-or-break” and one that requires “supreme negotiation tactics” by Ramaphosa.
    


            The South African leader is set for a tightrope walk at the White House, he added, reminiscing about a shouting match that broke out in the Oval Office between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Ukraine's Zelensky in late February.
    


            “Drawing from Zelensky's meeting with Donald Trump and JD Vance, we know that the Oval Office is currently or at least for the next five years, a tricky place to be,” Letswalo, a research associate at the University of Johannesburg told CNN.
    


            He believes that “Ramaphosa would maintain his composure to iron out some of the misunderstandings that Trump's administration officials have about South Africa.”
    


            Other analysts, such as Christopher Afoke Isike, who is a professor of African politics and international relations at the University of Pretoria, believe that Ramaphosa can pull through, “considering the fact that he's a businessman president like President Trump.”
    


            Ramaphosa plans to soften the ground with a potential licensing deal for Starlink, a satellite internet service owned by Musk. His spokesman Vincent Magwenya confirmed to CNN that South Africa has had talks with Starlink about operating in the country.
    


            The South African government said “reframing bilateral, economic and commercial relations” was the specific focus of Ramaphosa's US visit.
    


            “We want to come out of the United States with a really good trade deal,” Ramaphosa told reporters ahead of his meeting with Trump.
    


            South African golfer Ernie Els is expected to visit the White House with Ramaphosa's delegation, according to three US officials familiar with the plans. Musk is also expected to attend the White House meeting, two US officials said.
    


            Bringing one of the most successful golfers in the world into the meeting with Trump, who is an avid golfer himself, might set a positive tone. But some US officials still predict that the meeting could turn into a “nightmare” scenario.
    


            “It is certainly possible that we see fireworks like we saw in the Zelensky oval office meeting,” said a US official of the Wednesday meeting.
    


            For Letswalo, the crucial talks between Trump and Ramaphosa could hit a brick wall if the White House makes costly demands.
    


            “A dealbreaker would be a request by Washington for Pretoria to retrieve the Land Expropriation Act or Gaza Case in order to continue the US-SA relationship,” he said, adding, “it would be interesting to see how President Ramaphosa maintains the sovereignty and his statement of ‘not going to be bullied by America', without compromising the pre-existing relationship with the US.”
    


            That task could be one of Ramaphosa's most challenging, according to André Duvenhage, a politics professor at South Africa's Northwest University.
    


            “This may be his single biggest challenge in terms of anything he had to deal with in his term as president of the Republic of South Africa.”

MOSCOW, May 21. /TASS/. Brussels is beginning to realize it made an error by appointing Kaja Kallas as the EU's top foreign policy official, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement shared with TASS.

"Kaja Kallas is a visible manifestation of the European Union's crisis. The SVR press bureau reports that according to the information made available to it, Brussels is starting to acknowledge its mistake in appointing Kaja Kallas to the post of the EU foreign policy chief," the statement said.

The SVR noted that officials at the European Commission have observed Kallas' utter lack of expertise in her duties as the EU foreign policy chief. "Now it is clear to everyone that she is 'incapable of considering the nuances of other countries' positions and can only devise simple schemes, most of which are devoid of sense.' Brussels and other European capitals openly accuse the ‘irrepressible Estonian of excessive engagement and inclination to spontaneous and uncoordinated initiatives'," the statement said.

According to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, the EU leadership was taken aback by Kallas' recent remarks criticizing US President Donald Trump, as well as her declaration that "the free world needs a new leader." "The West knows very well that Washington remembers such 'brave statements' once and for all. Moreover, the State Department has already dismissed the 'tactless diplomat.' This significantly hinders Brussels' dialogue with its main ally," the press bureau pointed out.

The SVR stressed that, in her five and a half months in the role, Kallas failed to forge working ties with most EU member state leaders. "Consequently, she barely manages her main responsibility of coordinating the work of the EU member states' foreign ministries," the statement said.

The press bureau also mentioned that dissatisfaction from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen led to Kallas being excluded from drafting strategic defense policy documents. "Kallas's role in discussions on settling the Ukrainian conflict has also practically been reduced to zero," the SVR added.

The statement further asserted that the EU's approach of selecting senior officials based on gender and nationality is driving the bloc away from substantive politics. "The modern international situation demands that officials possess in-depth knowledge and professionalism, not ultraliberal pseudo-competencies, which the European bureaucrats lack," the Foreign Intelligence Service concluded.

Daily roundup of research and analysis from The Globe and Mail's market strategist Scott Barlow

BMO E&P analyst Jeremy McCrea identified the stocks institutional investors are buying in the sector,

“With the latest 13F and AMR ownership filings, we look at every fund that has reported a holding of at least one Canadian E&P since 2023 (approximately 5,800 funds). As global commodity prices and economic uncertainty continued, this group of funds sold $0.9 billion worth of CDN E&P companies; while still buying $0.1 billion of CDN mid-cap names … Bottom line, names that came up multiple times in our checklist criteria this quarter include Surge, Tamarack Valley, Topaz, Peyto and Headwater. 1. What ‘energy-weighted' specialty funds are buying/selling. Typically, these funds are early movers and closer to company management including field-level operations (of the 29 high-energy focused funds we track). The top names held by these energy funds are ARC (Restricted), Tourmaline, Topaz, Advantage, and Headwater (with Peyto and Paramount new to the list). 2. What were the best-performing E&P stocks in 1Q25; which institutional funds had the foresight to buy these names in the preceding quarter, and what are these funds buying today? Collectively, these funds are now buying Whitecap, Topaz, and MEG (Restricted) … We highlight the names that have seen the most ‘new buyers.' Names to highlight include Topaz, Baytex, Spartan Delta, and Whitecap”

Also in the energy sector, RBC Capital Markets head of global energy research Greg Pardy assesses the importance of Strathcona Resources' (SCR-T) bid for MEG Energy (MEG-T),

“Strathcona Resources—Bold + Strategic. As framed in Strategically Bold, Strathcona's $2.84 billion Montney disposition and subsequent takeover bid for MEG constitutes a bold strategic thrust aimed at building a first-quartile oil sands producer that would afford quality scale, increase its float shares outstanding (currently 20% of outstanding shares) and enhance its portfolio. The company's 2026 pro[1]forma MEG outlook screens well financially. Cenovus Energy—Most Logical Fit. In our minds, Cenovus would be a logical acquirer of MEG given the proximity of its Christina Lake operations and potential for operating synergies beyond overhead/ cost savings that could be accretive to our 2026 pro-forma scenario analysis (using a 50/50 debt/equity financing structure). Timing would be less ideal given that Cenovus is completing a major capital cycle in 2025 aimed at adding up to 150,000 boe/d of production in 2026 and beyond and undertaking initiatives to improve its US refinery performance. Nonetheless, where there is a will there is a way, and we think this could involve the sale of assets as a partial funding source, possibly Cenovus' Liwan field in the South China Sea. Imperial Oil—Possible. Imperial is in an enviable position to acquire given its premium relative cash flow multiple and strong balance sheet (hence a potential 50/50 equity/debt financing scenario). The company's 2026 pro-forma MEG scenario looks solid by our yardstick, while strategically, a deal could complement its upstream portfolio with top-quartile SAGD operations”.

Morgan Stanley cross asset strategist Serena Tang is impressed that the global economy has avoided recession and favours U.S. equities for the remainder of 2025,

“The global economy is not in a recession: Despite unprecedented policy uncertainty, the global economy is still in expansion mode, albeit with slowing growth. Off-ramps for de-escalation of trade tensions exist and we expect that tariffs will not end at the extreme levels in the aftermath of Liberation Day. Substantial monetary easing is ahead along with the benefits of deregulation. US assets remain compelling versus the RoW: US Treasuries, equities, and credit outperform their RoW counterparts on our forecasts. We push back against the idea that foreign investors would or should abandon US assets significantly, although we expect greater currency hedging. Persistent USD weakness: We expect USD to continue to weaken thanks to both a convergence in US rates and growth to peers … We roll forward our S&P 500 price target of 6,500: We've already experienced rolling earnings recessions across the equity market for the last ~3 years. This makes comparisons less onerous and sets the stage for a more synchronous EPS recovery over the course of our forecast horizon. We see 2025 EPS of US$259 (7% growth), 2026 EPS of US$283 (9% growth), and 2027 EPS of US$321 (13% growth)”

U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz listens as U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, on April 7.Kevin Mohatt/Reuters

A hacker who breached the communications service used by former Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz earlier this month intercepted messages from a broader swathe of American officials than has previously been reported, according to a Reuters review, potentially raising the stakes of a breach that has already drawn questions about data security in the Trump administration.

Reuters identified more than 60 unique government users of the messaging platform TeleMessage in a cache of leaked data provided by Distributed Denial of Secrets, a U.S. non-profit whose stated mission is to archive hacked and leaked documents in the public interest. The trove included material from disaster responders, customs officials, several U.S. diplomatic staffers, at least one White House staffer and members of the Secret Service. 

The messages reviewed by Reuters covered a roughly day-long period of time ending on May 4, and many of them were fragmentary. 

Once little known outside government and finance circles, TeleMessage drew media attention after an April 30 Reuters photograph showed Waltz checking TeleMessage‘s version of the privacy-focused app Signal during a cabinet meeting.

While Reuters could not verify the entire contents of the TeleMessage trove, in more than half a dozen cases the news agency was able to establish that the phone numbers in the leaked data were correctly attributed to their owners. 

One of the intercepted texts' recipients – an applicant for aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency – confirmed to Reuters that the leaked message was authentic; a financial services firm whose messages were similarly intercepted also confirmed their authenticity. 

Based on its limited review, Reuters uncovered nothing that seemed clearly sensitive and did not uncover chats by Waltz or other cabinet officials. Some chats did seem to bear on the travel plans of senior government officials. One Signal group, “POTUS | ROME-VATICAN | PRESS GC,” appeared to pertain to the logistics of an event at the Vatican. Another appeared to discuss U.S. officials' trip to Jordan.

Reuters reached out to all the individuals it could identify seeking comment; some confirmed their identities but most didn't respond or referred questions to their respective agencies. Reuters could not ascertain how TeleMessage had been used by each agency. 

The service – which takes versions of popular apps and allows their messages to be archived in line with government rules – has been suspended since May 5, when it went offline “out of an abundance of caution.” TeleMessage‘s owner, the Portland, Oregon-based digital communications firm Smarsh, did not respond to requests for comments about the leaked data.

The White House said in a statement that it was “aware of the cyber security incident at Smarsh” but didn't offer comment on its use of the platform. The State Department didn't respond to messages. The Secret Service said TeleMessage products had been used “by a small subset of Secret Service employees” and that it was reviewing the situation. FEMA said in an e-mail that it had “no evidence” that its information had been compromised. It didn't respond when sent copies of internal FEMA messages. A CBP spokesperson repeated a past statement noting that it had disabled TeleMessage and was investigating the breach.

Federal contracting data shows that State and DHS have had contracts with TeleMessage in recent years, as has the Centers for Disease Control. A CDC spokesperson told Reuters in an e-mail Monday that the agency piloted the software in 2024 to assess its potential for records management requirements “but found it did not fit our needs.” The status of the other contracts wasn't clear. A week after that hack, the U.S. cyber defence agency CISA recommended that users “discontinue use of the product” barring any mitigating instructions about how to use the app from Smarsh.

Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cyber specialist, said that, even if the intercepted text messages were innocuous, the wealth of metadata – the who and when of the leaked conversations and chat groups – posed a counter-intelligence risk.

“Even if you don't have the content, that is a top-tier intelligence access,” said Williams, now vice president of research and development at cybersecurity firm Hunter Strategy. Waltz's prior use of Signal created a public furor when he accidentally added a prominent journalist to a Signal chat where he and other Trump cabinet officials were discussing air raids on Yemen in real time. Soon after, Waltz was ousted from his job, although not from the administration: Trump said he was nominating Waltz to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

The circumstances surrounding Waltz's use of TeleMessage haven't been publicly disclosed and neither he nor the White House has responded to questions about the matter.

The U.S. Senate is ready to vote on a bill on sanctions against Russia if peace talks over the war in Ukraine do not progress soon, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 20, as Voice of America journalist Tetiana Vorozhko reported.

The U.S.-mediated negotiations between Ukraine and Russia have stalled, as Moscow continues to refuse a ceasefire and pushes its claims to four partially occupied Ukrainian oblasts — Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk — and Crimea.

"If the next few days are like the last few months, then you can just count on us moving, because I think it's our job to try to help the world end this war," Graham said during the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearings.

"The Chinese are watching. This is a dress rehearsal for Taiwan. How this ends, I think, will greatly determine what happens with the future of Taiwan. And I want this war to end in a way that makes Xi (Jinping) think, 'Well, that didn't work out too well for (Vladimir) Putin,'" the senator said.

Graham stressed that the war in Ukraine must end in a way that prevents a new one from starting.

"Afghanistan was a disaster. If we do not get this right in Ukraine, and the world perceives that Putin got away with it, that will be even worse. That will be worse than Afghanistan," he added.

The bill, introduced to the Senate in early April, would impose new penalties on Russia and slap 500% tariffs on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or uranium.

The bill, proposed by Graham and Senator Richard Blumenthal, was supported by 72 senators, a majority in the Senate, according to Graham.

Ukraine's European allies are tightening sanctions against Russia as Moscow refuses to cease fire. Despite Russia's refusal, no new U.S. sanctions have been imposed so far, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying that new sanctions "could also make it much worse" after he held a phone call with Putin.

Several media outlets reported on European leaders' frustrations with the lack of U.S. sanctions against Russia, with a senior European official telling the New York Times (NYT) that Trump "never seemed invested in joining sanctions on Russia."

Ukrainian drones struck Russia's Bolkhov semiconductor plant in Oryol Oblast, which is producing parts for Sukhoi warplanes and Iskander and Kinzhal missiles, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on May 21.

The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 150 Ukrainain drones overnight in multiple regions, including 53 in Oryol Oblast. 

The region's governor, Andrey Klychkov, initially reported no damage or casualties, but later said that the semiconductor plant and several residential buildings were damaged.

Ukrainian Telegram channel Supernova+ shared what it claimed to be footage of the burning and damaged facility.

Ten drones hit the plant's premises, resulting in a fire, the General Staff reported. The full consequences of the attack are being determined.

The plant has been sanctioned by the U.S. since last year over its role in the Russian military-industrial complex.

The Bolkhov plant is one of Russia's leading producers of semiconductor devices and components, focusing on diodes, microcircuits, optoelectronic switches, and more, the General Staff said.

The factory supplies at least 19 Russian plants involved in the production of Sukhoi planes or Iskander and Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Despite the sanctions, it produces almost 3 million devices per year, according to the Ukrainian military.

Explosions were also reported in the Tula and Ryazan oblasts, while Ukrainain official Andrii Kovalenko claimed that facilities of the Russian military-industrial complex were attacked by "unknown drones" in Oryol Oblast.

Temporary flight restrictions were introduced at the Yaroslavl, Kostroma, and Kaluga airports. 

Ukraine regularly launches drone attacks against Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear to undermine Moscow's ability to wage its all-out war.

            Just days after the United States and China declared a temporary truce over tariffs, tempers are already flaring: this time over the future of Beijing's most advanced homegrown semiconductors.
    


            Over the past week, Beijing has repeatedly lashed out at Washington for warning companies against using AI chips made by national tech champion Huawei. It has even accused the Trump administration of “undermining” a consensus reached at recent trade talks in Geneva, where both sides agreed to temporarily roll back tariffs and use a 90-day window to hash out a broader deal.
    


            The conflict over Huawei's most advanced chips serves as a reality check that despite the positive words shared by US and Chinese negotiators last week, there are still sharp differences between the two sides on a variety of subjects that may be difficult to bridge.
    


            On Wednesday, China's Commerce Ministry fired its latest broadside, accusing the US of “abusing export controls to suppress and contain China” and engaging in what it called “typical acts of unilateral bullying and protectionism.”
    


            China was responding to the Trump administration's announcement last week rescinding a set of Biden-era curbs meant to keep AI chips out of the hands of foreign adversaries.
    


            As part of that announcement, the US Commerce Department issued guidance on May 12 warning companies that “using Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world would violate US export controls.” The department has since changed its wording to remove the reference of “anywhere in the world” in an updated version of the statement.
    


            The Ascend chips are Huawei's most powerful AI processors, which are used to train AI models and aim to challenge Nvidia's dominance in designing high-end chips. Huawei's efforts are central to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's plans to build up China's own capacity to develop cutting-edge chips as it vies for AI supremacy with the US.
    


            At a top political meeting last month, Xi called for “self-reliance” to develop AI in China, saying his country would leverage its “new whole national system” to target bottlenecks such as advanced chips.
    


            CNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.
    


            On Monday, Beijing signaled the US Commerce Department's wording change in the updated statement on Huawei wasn't enough to end the feud. In a statement, China's Commerce Ministry said that despite the “adjustment” in wording, the “discriminatory measures and market-distorting nature” of the guidance itself remained unchanged.
    


            “China has engaged in negotiations and communications with the US at various levels through the China-US economic and trade consultation mechanism, pointing out that the US actions seriously undermined the consensus reached during the high-level talks in Geneva,” the ministry said, urging the US to “correct its mistake.”
    


            The ministry's latest statement on Wednesday came with an extra warning from Beijing to global businesses, threatening legal action against anyone who helps what it calls a US attempt to “globally ban the use of advanced Chinese chips.”
    


            “Any organization or individual that implements or assists in implementing these US measures may be in violation of China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and other relevant laws and regulations, and must bear corresponding legal responsibilities,” the statement said.
    


            “China will closely monitor the implementation of the US measures and will take resolute steps to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” it added.
    


            There has been no announcement of further trade talks between the US and China. But last Friday, US trade representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese trade envoy Li Chenggang met on the sidelines of a gathering of APEC trade ministers in South Korea, Reuters reported.
    


            As Huawei accelerates efforts to develop its own high-performance chips, US chip giant Nvidia is increasingly concerned about losing access to the Chinese market, after the Trump administration restricted the export of its H20 AI chips to China.
    


            Speaking at Taiwan's annual Computex trade show on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the ban had forced the company to write off “multiple billion dollars” of inventory. “The cost to us is very high,” he added.
    


            Huang estimated that the China market could be worth $50 billion next year. “It would be a shame not to be able to enjoy that opportunity, bring home tax revenues to the United States, create jobs, sustain the industry,” he said. “I believe the US government should allow American technology to serve and participate and compete in the China market.”

            Huang also used the occasion to criticize US export controls to China, saying they gave Chinese AI companies “the spirit, the energy and the government support” to accelerate their own development.
    


            “I think, all in all, export control was a failure,” he added.
    


            But Huang did hail Trump's rescinding of Biden-era curbs “a great reversal of a wrong policy,” handing Nvidia a big win in the Middle East.
    


            “The fundamental assumptions that led to the AI Diffusion rule in the first place has been proven to be fundamentally flawed … and that fundamental assumption is that the United States is the only provider of AI, and it's not obvious enough to me,” he said.
    


            “If the United States wants to stay in the lead, and the United States would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, we need to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed. And that's where we are today.”
    


            Last week, Nvidia scored a major deal in Saudi Arabia by announcing a strategic partnership with startup Humain to build “AI factories” in the country with a projected capacity of up to 500 megawatts during US President Donald Trump's visit to the Gulf.
    


            To power those facilities, Nvidia will sell several hundred thousand of its most advanced graphic processing units there over the next five years, beginning with 18,000 of its top-of-the-line GB300 Grace Blackwell chips.
    


Analysts said the Gulf deals, which also involved AMD and Qualcomm, were possible because the Trump administration was able to “sidestep” the Biden-era curbs, which were rescinded before they could take effect.

During the Pacific War, Reiji Kitajima was sent to Manila and other battlefronts in the south as an army fighter plane pilot.

At 102 years old, Kitajima, who lives in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture, recalls why he became a pilot: to fulfill his childhood dream of flying. He also remembers how he gradually came to see shooting down enemy fighter planes as a matter of course.

With almost 80 years having passed since the end of the war, there are fewer and fewer people who can share their wartime experiences. “War produces nothing but victims,” he said. “We must continue to think about what we can do to stop war.”

Kitajima was born in Shizuoka Prefecture in 1923, the sixth of nine children, to parents who were green tea farmers. After graduating from a higher elementary school, he left his parents' house in search of a stable life and began working at a post office in present-day Fujisawa.

Although the Second Sino-Japanese War had begun in 1937, he believed wars had nothing to do with him. However, his life totally changed when he was 18 years old. He saw a call for volunteer soldiers in a newspaper and was inspired to become a pilot so he could fly out of the small world he had lived in so far. He volunteered for the military without a sense of the reality of war.

He passed a test and was admitted to a pilot training school. After studying at the school, he went on to the Mito army aviation school, where in addition to receiving flight training and classroom lectures on meteorology and other subjects, he listened to sermons by a Buddhist monk. The monk lived in the neighborhood and visited the school every day to preach the teachings of militarism. “Your honorable death in battle will help protect your family and Japan,” the monk said. Kitajima started to become more aware of the war, and his fear of death diminished.

In March 1943, he graduated from the aviation school and was assigned to an Army Air Force unit in the south. While in the unit, he mainly flew a Hayabusa Type 1 Fighter and a Shoki Type 2 Single-Seat Fighter and experienced dogfights over Manila, Java, New Guinea and other places. He always displayed a photograph of his father and mother in the cockpit. During aerial combat over the sea separating Luzon and Borneo, his plane experienced engine trouble and he made an emergency water landing. He thought no one would come to save him, but he was eventually rescued by a ship and narrowly avoided death.

Whenever news of a comrade's death reached his base, he always thought, “That will be me someday.” For respite, he enjoyed Javanese chocolates, which he had never tasted in Japan, the sweet flavor distracting him from the war.

Around the beginning of 1945, fewer than 20 Japanese fighter planes had to intercept twice as many enemy fighter planes at a higher frequency than ever before. Kitajima felt strongly that the war situation was deteriorating for Japan. Many of his fellow pilots who had headed back to Japan on resupply missions did not return, sparking concerns over a shortage of war supplies. Every time this happened, he would come close to losing all hope. However, he encouraged himself by thinking, “We have to win.”

Kitajima learned that the war had ended when he was in Java. Tears fell from his eyes as he thought, “I can return to Japan alive.” He spent six months as a captive in Singapore before returning home to his parents in Shizuoka Prefecture. His mother welcomed him with a hug.

After the war, he worked at a machinery component manufacturer in Fujisawa until he reached the age of retirement. In addition to being involved in activities that contributed to the community, he helped to establish the Chiran Peace Museum in Kagoshima Prefecture, which exhibits the articles of Kamikaze pilots, since he escorted fighter planes on such kamikaze special attack missions during the war.

Kitajima now lives in a nursing home in Fujisawa. Even after 80 years, he still recalls being in the cockpit, pushing a button with his left hand to shoot and seeing an enemy fighter plane hit by the bullets falling slowly. During the war, he thought he did what he had to do. Now, however, he feels that killing is absolutely something that must not be done.

“I only survived the war by chance,” he said. “I want our society to be based on the fundamental principle of not waging war.”

As Russia continues its war against Ukraine and the Trump administration reduces U.S. aid to Kyiv, European countries have stepped up their support of the Ukrainian people. But more can be done. At this critical moment, the European Union should seize the immobilized Russian sovereign assets that sit in Europe and use those resources to provide Ukraine with a sustainable source of assistance.

In February 2022, just days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the United States worked with the G-7 to freeze approximately $300 billion in Russian assets, the vast majority of which were held in Europe. Before the decision was made, some European countries raised economic and legal concerns, but they ultimately agreed. Over the course of the Biden administration—which both of us were a part of—the United States encouraged Europe to go one step further and seize Russia's funds so that they could be put to use, as opposed to sitting frozen in accounts. But European leaders were unwilling to take this additional action: concerns similar to the ones raised several years earlier persisted.

Today, Europe should reconsider. The need to seize Russia's sovereign assets is more urgent now than at any time since the war began. U.S. military aid deliveries to Ukraine from U.S. stockpiles, authorized during the Biden administration, will run out in the coming weeks, and the Trump administration has not announced renewed assistance for Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected calls for a 30-day cease-fire and has stalled peace talks by making maximalist demands, presumably betting that Ukraine's position will deteriorate as U.S. aid winds down and as China, Iran, and North Korea maintain their support for Russia.

Over the past three years, European countries have provided extraordinary support to Ukraine—more than the Kremlin ever expected. They have, for example, sent military and financial aid, implemented an unprecedented price cap on Russian oil, and enacted 17 sanctions packages against the Russian economy. But Europe will need to do even more to fill the void left by the United States. Europe cannot afford to see Russia triumph over Ukraine.

European leaders must increase support to Ukraine, but their citizens do not need to shoulder the cost alone. It is time to make Russia pay for the war it chose to wage. By seizing Russia's assets, European governments can send a clear message to the Kremlin that support for Ukraine will persist. Such a move could transform Ukraine's negotiating position and, ultimately, the trajectory of the war. 

After Russia began its assault against Ukraine in 2014, Moscow moved most of its sovereign assets out of the United States to reduce its exposure to U.S. retaliation. But Russia continued to store hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of assets in financial institutions in other G-7 countries, believing, wrongly, that these governments would be unwilling to sanction Russian state funds. Now, approximately $300 billion sits frozen, mostly in Europe. That is a massive sum, considering that the United States and Europe have allocated about $282 billion in total aid to Ukraine since the start of the war, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

The Biden administration, in its final year, argued that the immobilized assets should be used to support Ukraine, but some allies remained reluctant. As the war continued, and as it became more challenging to secure additional congressional funding for Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden and other G-7 leaders reached a compromise. In June 2024, they agreed to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans, paid back by the interest income earned from the immobilized assets. This was a meaningful step forward, but the time has come to use the full $300 billion to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. 

Some European officials have questioned the legal basis for seizing Russia's assets, arguing that it would violate principles of sovereign immunity, which are enshrined in international law. But there are clear and compelling legal arguments in favor of taking Russia's assets. As the UN General Assembly resoundingly affirmed in 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine violates the prohibition against aggression, which is a legal obligation owed to all countries. Russia is flagrantly violating Ukraine's sovereignty with impunity. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Moscow can block legal and diplomatic efforts aimed at stopping the conflict. Under these circumstances, seizing Russia's sovereign assets is a legitimate countermeasure. This is one of the justifications the U.S. Congress cited for passing the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians (REPO) Act of 2024, which allows the president to confiscate Russian sovereign assets. Canada, for its part, passed a similar law.



Seizure is proportionate to the harm Russia has wrought, and because Russia has a legal obligation to pay Ukraine for damages from the war, seizure would be permissible in that it would set off Ukraine's claim to reparations. As the former U.S. government officials Larry Summers, Philip Zelikow, and Robert Zoellick argued in Foreign Affairs, there is precedent for taking an aggressor's assets: in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the United States and its allies led efforts to transfer frozen Iraqi funds to an international escrow account to finance reparations. 

European officials also worry that if they were to seize Russia's assets, then managers of other sovereign wealth would be reluctant to invest in Europe. But there is no evidence that seizing Russia's assets would cause investors to flee the continent. Investors did not leave when European countries froze the Kremlin's assets three years ago, and the line between indefinitely freezing assets and seizing them is an incremental one. Fears of capital flight are overblown.

Today, in fact, seizure poses fewer risks to Europe's economic and financial stability than at any other point during the war. Europe's ability to generate growth and maintain its economic stability—especially as investors remain concerned by the economic uncertainty being exported by the United States—matter far more to asset allocators than the status of Russia's sovereign assets. And the potential collapse of Ukraine is a much more significant threat to the European economy, because it could prompt massive Ukrainian refugee outflows and embolden Russia to threaten countries on NATO's eastern flank. Using the sovereign assets would help strengthen Ukraine and prevent such a scenario from taking place. 

The benefits of asset seizure far outweigh the risks. Without U.S. aid, European governments will be forced to support Ukraine largely by themselves—even as they invest in their own military stockpiles and prepare for their own increased security needs. Europe can use Russian assets to procure the weapons that Kyiv urgently needs, fund Ukraine's innovative defense industrial base, and maintain the country's macroeconomic stability. As part of this approach, European leaders should try to negotiate an agreement with the White House to purchase U.S. capabilities for Ukraine, starting with air defense missiles, with the understanding that the U.S. Department of Defense would prioritize these purchases given Ukraine's urgent requirements. If successful, this model could be expanded to include other U.S. defense exports.

When a cease-fire is reached, Ukraine will still need sustained assistance for its military—so that it can deter future Russian aggression—and for the gargantuan task of reconstruction, which will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Leaders of the G-7 have called on the Kremlin to pay for the damage it has caused, but Russia will never voluntarily finance Ukraine's reconstruction. The only realistic way for Russia to make recompense is for Europe to put Russia's assets toward helping Ukraine defend itself in the near term and rebuild over the long term. 

There is also a diplomatic purpose to asset seizure. Putin believes that time is on his side in this war and that, eventually, foreign aid for Ukraine will dry up. Unlocking the $300 billion could change Putin's calculus. That money would enable Europe to support Ukraine for years to come, with few domestic political costs, the specter of which could help bring Putin to the negotiating table. Ukraine, with this long-term support in hand, would have more leverage in negotiations and would be better positioned to reach a just and sustainable outcome to this war. 

The debate over whether to seize the sovereign assets, therefore, must progress from the theoretical to the practical. An important first step is for the European Union to pass its own version of the REPO Act, which will give member states the ability to seize and use Russia's assets at a time of their choosing. If the EU is unable to achieve consensus, then individual member states with Russian assets in their jurisdictions should take steps in their own national systems to enable seizure. With this authority in hand, European leaders should then develop and implement a plan to deploy the assets in support of Ukraine's military and economy.

The war in Ukraine is at an inflection point: U.S. support for Kyiv is receding; Moscow is continuing its invasion, with the help of Beijing, Pyongyang, and Tehran; and Putin is betting that his position will improve with time. European countries can shift these dynamics, provide Ukraine with a lasting source of support, and persuade Putin to engage in meaningful negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that Ukraine “has no cards” in peace talks. But with Russia's sovereign assets, Europe holds a card of its own. Now is the time to play it.

In 2025, most people are inseparable from their laptops and smartphones. With that familiarity has come a wariness of the dangers of clicking on unsolicited emails, SMS, or WhatsApp messages.

But there is a growing menace called zero-click attacks, which have previously targeted only VIPs or the very wealthy because of their cost and sophistication.

A zero-click attack is a cyberattack that hacks a device without the user clicking anything. It can happen just by receiving a message, call, or file. The attacker uses hidden flaws in apps or systems to take control of the device with no action needed from the user, and the user remains unaware of the attack.

“Although public awareness has increased recently, these attacks have steadily evolved over many years, becoming more frequent as smartphones and connected devices proliferated,” Nathan House, CEO of StationX, a UK-based cybersecurity training platform, told The Epoch Times.

“The key vulnerability is in the software rather than the type of device, meaning any connected device with exploitable weaknesses could potentially be targeted.”

Aras Nazarovas, an information security researcher at Cybernews, told The Epoch Times why zero-click attacks usually target VIPs rather than ordinary individuals.

“Since finding such zero-click exploits is difficult and expensive, most of the time such exploits are used to gain access to information from key figures, such as politicians or journalists in authoritarian regimes,” he said.

“They are often used in targeted campaigns. Using such exploits to steal money is rare.”

“The part that requires high levels of sophistication is finding bugs that allow such attacks and writing exploits for these bugs,” Nazarovas said.

“It has been a billion-dollar market for years, selling zero-click exploits and exploit chains. Some gray/dark market exploit brokers often offer $500,000 to $1 million for such exploit chains for popular devices and apps.”

House said that people could use AI to “write zero-click exploit chains for people who would have otherwise lacked the time, experience, or knowledge to be able to discover and write such exploits.”

But the increase in zero-click attacks in recent years “stems mainly from expanded spyware markets and greater availability of sophisticated exploits, rather than directly from AI-driven techniques,” he said.

In July 2021, The Guardian and 16 other media outlets published a series of articles alleging that foreign governments used the Israeli-based NSO Group's Pegasus software to surveil at least 180 journalists and numerous other targets around the world.

Alleged targets of Pegasus surveillance included French President Emmanuel Macron, Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, and Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi, who was slain in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018.

“While ordinary users can occasionally become collateral targets, attackers generally reserve these costly exploits for individuals whose information is especially valuable or sensitive,” Nazarovas said.

According to Nazarovas, corporations offer hackers ‘bug bounties' to incentivize them to find these exploits and report them to the company rather than selling them to a broker who then sells them on to parties who use them illegally.

House said defending against zero-click attacks is “challenging,” but some simple cybersecurity steps can reduce the risk.

“Users should always keep software and operating systems updated, regularly reboot their devices, and use hardened security modes such as Apple's lockdown mode, especially if they believe they're high-risk targets,” he said.

House said that whatever precautions are taken, it is crucial to recognize “exceptionally sophisticated attacks—like those from advanced nation-state adversaries—can bypass even the most robust defenses.”

Nazarovas said many big tech players, such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, collect extensive telemetry data from billions of devices and use the data to detect zero-click exploits and other sophisticated attacks. Telemetry data is information collected remotely from devices such as phones and computers. This data, especially on app usage and behavior, is sent back to a central system to help improve performance, fix problems, or track activity.

“When vulnerabilities that allow such attacks are detected, they can be quickly fixed and rolled out almost immediately to billions of people thanks to automatic updates,” Nazarovas said.

Following reports of deportations to South Sudan, the Trump administration said Wednesday it has deported eight migrants convicted of crimes in the United States.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries with a flight linked to the chaotic African nation of South Sudan, a federal judge said Wednesday, hours after the Trump administration said it had expelled eight immigrants convicted of violent crimes in the United States but refused to reveal where they would end up. The judge's statement was a notably strong rebuke to the government's attempts to manage immigration. 

In an emergency hearing he called to address reports that immigrants had been sent to South Sudan, Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston said the eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger. Minutes before the hearing, administration officials accused “activist judges” of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.

“The department actions in this case are unquestionably in violation of this court's order,” Murphy said Wednesday, arguing that the deportees didn't have “meaningful opportunity” to object to being sent to South Sudan. The group was flown out of the United States just hours after getting notice, leaving them no chance to contact lawyers who could object in court.

Government attorneys argued that the men had a history with the immigration system, giving them prior opportunities to express a fear of being deported to a country outside their homeland. They also said that immigration authorities may have misunderstood the order because the judge did not specify the time needed between notice and deportation. 

The migrants' home countries — Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan — would not take them back, according to Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who spoke to reporters in Washington. He later said the migrants either came from countries that often do not take back all their deported citizens or had other situations that meant they could not be sent home.

“These represent the true national security threats,” Lyons said at a news conference. Behind him was a display of photos of men he said had been convicted of rape, homicide, armed robbery and other crimes. 

Administration officials, who have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants, made their displeasure clear Wednesday. 

“It is absurd that an activist judge is trying to force the United States to bring back these uniquely barbaric monsters who present a clear and present threat to the safety of the American people,” Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokesperson, said in a statement after the press conference. 

Homeland Security officials released few specific details about the deportation flight. They said it left Tuesday with eight people on board and said they remained in the department's custody Wednesday. Officials said they could not disclose the migrants' final destination because of “safety and operational security.”

The case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight is the latest flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president's policies. 

With Congress largely silent or supportive, opponents of Trump's agenda have filed hundreds of lawsuits and judges have issued dozens of orders against the administration. Immigration has been the most contentious issue. There was the mistaken deportation of an immigrant who was living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, as well as Trump's push to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court review.

The administration officials insisted that the deported men had received due process, but did not provide details. Immigration rights lawyers have said that the deportations violated a court order against sending people to countries other than their homelands without first allowing them to argue the removal could put them in danger.

Trina Realmuto, the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, asked the judge to return the individuals. “They are no less deserving of protection than any other human beings on this planet,” she said.

Murphy said he would try to find a “narrowly tailored” fix for the violation. And while not directly threatening anyone with charges, he did raise the prospect. 

“Everyone who was involved in an illegal deportation,” the judge said, “risks criminal contempt.”

Attorneys for the migrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to Africa. The lawyers say that violates a court order that people have a “meaningful opportunity” to argue that sending them to a country outside their homeland would threaten their safety. 

The apparent removal of one man from the troubled Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said. 

A woman also reported that her husband from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote. 

Murphy, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would “clearly” violate his ruling, which also applies to people who have otherwise exhausted their legal appeals. 

South Sudan's police spokesperson, Maj. Gen. James Monday Enoka, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and “redeported to their correct country” if found not to be South Sudanese.

Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States. That has led the administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The U.S. has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law, an action being contested in the courts. 

South Sudan has endured repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country's top U.N. official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war. 

The State Department's annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says “significant human rights issues” include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.

The Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review. 

The U.S is one of the biggest donors to South Sudan's humanitarian aid programs, with the total funding in 2024 standing at over $640 million.

Live Updates


            • On the stand now: Dawn Hughes, a board-certified clinical and forensic psychologist specializing in trauma, is testifying in Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal sex-trafficking trial. She's a “blind expert,” meaning she hasn't interviewed anyone connected to the case, and she has been providing information about how victims of abusive relationships often behave.
    


            • The testimony so far: The jury has heard from a number of witnesses, including Combs' former assistant and the special agent from the search of his Miami home. Cassie Ventura — the prosecution's star witness who dated Combs — testified last week that she endured physical and sexual abuse from him and detailed how Combs orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances called “Freak Offs.”
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Defense attorney Jonathan Bach asked psychologist Dawn Hughes to confirm she has not gathered detailed information about the specific facts of this case.
    


            Hughes said that's correct and added, “I'm not rendering any opinions about a specific individual.”
    


            When asked, Hughes said she's heard there's someone named “Cassie” in this case.
    


            Bach confirmed the forensic psychologist didn't hear Cassie's testimony or review records about her or her drug use.
    


Remember: Hughes said earlier today that she's testifying as a “blind expert” to provide the jury with information about domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and traumatic stress. She said she has not interviewed anyone connected to the case.
    


            Clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes is back on the witness stand. The jury is now entering, and her testimony is resuming.
    


            Defense attorney Jonathan Bach is cross-examining Hughes.
    


            The judge is back on the bench, and the lawyers are in the courtroom.
    


            The jury has not come in yet. When the trial resumes, Dawn Hughes, a board-certified clinical and forensic psychologist specializing in trauma, will continue testifying.
    


            Here's a summary of what was said from the witness stand before lunch on the eighth day of Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal racketeering and sex-trafficking trial.
    


Gerard Gannon, HSI special agent in charge



            Gerard Gannon, the Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge at the March 2024 search of Combs' Miami Beach home, resumed his testimony from yesterday.
    


Dawn Hughes, psychologist



            Dawn Hughes, a board-certified clinical and forensic psychologist, testified she has not assessed any victims or witnesses in this case nor has she interviewed anyone connected to the case.
    


            Cross-examination of psychologist Dawn Hughes will resume after a lunch break.
    


            Dawn Hughes is answering a series of general questions from defense attorney Jonathan Bach about how she evaluates someone in a forensic capacity in the context of a legal proceeding.
    


            It's different than how she approaches the patients she treats in a clinical setting, she said.
    


            She'll typically administer a comprehensive interview, other psychological tests and evaluate external information to offer a detailed analysis of someone when she's hired for forensic psychology work.
    


            Assistant US Attorney Mitzi Steiner is finished with questions.
    


            Dawn Hughes said victims tend not to recall each specific time they were abused.
    


            Within domestic abuse, there's a “routine” that happens, Hughs said, where a victim can conflate instances of abuse in the same way that mundane routine events that anyone does frequently can run together, she explained.
    


            Hughes said a victim may commonly say something like, “I know I got punched a bunch of times but can't tell you when that was.”
    


            Victims are more likely to remember isolated instances of abuse that are connected to a “marker,” or a significant event for a victim, such as a birthday or anniversary.
    


            Psychologist Dawn Hughes testified about the ways trauma impacts memory.
    


            She explained that victims will usually remember the “core gist” of a traumatic event and the central, sensory details they perceived as significant. Other peripheral details that weren't assigned any significance aren't remembered as easily, she said.
    


            “That's a very unique thing for each person and each situation they're in,” she said.
    


            Some traumatic memories can also be “fragmented,” but they can still be reliable, she said.
    


            Abuse victims often use minimizing and hedging language when disclosing the abuse, psychologist Dawn Hughes testified under direct examination by the prosecution.
    


            “They don't want to label themselves … a victim. They don't want to label their abuser as abuser,” Hughes said. “It's too painful to admit that fact that, ‘Somebody who loved me did this to me.' They're still in self-blame.”
    


            It's uncommon for victims to talk about the abuse around the time it occurs, psychologist Dawn Hughes said.
    


                    “Many victims will wait months, even years, before telling about what happened to them,” she said.
                





            She explained that a victim is usually more willing to discuss abuse from a stranger than from a partner.
    


            “The closer the relationship to the perpetrator, the less likely you're going to be to disclose,” she said.
    


            Expert witness Dawn Hughes said it's common for victims in abusive relationships to use substances to “numb” themselves.
    


            Victims will often take drugs or drink before they see their partner, Hughes said, “preventively to ward off other psychical or psychological pain to come.”
    


            Psychologist Dawn Hughes discussed both passive and active self-defense during her testimony under questioning by the prosecution.
    


            Passive self-defense includes actions that are “the least provoking as possible to get the violent episode to stop,” including blocking punches or curling up on the floor, Hughes said.
    


            Active self-defense includes throwing objects or hitting back against abuse, she said. Victims use active self-defense “to have some way of standing up for themselves, although in many cases that usually results in more severe injury to themselves,” Hughes said.
    


            As the abuse becomes more severe, so do the coping mechanisms, psychologist Dawn Hughes explained.
    


            A victim's coping mechanisms usually exist within the confines of the relationship. Sometimes this includes fighting back, but the most common coping mechanism is trying to work things out with the abusive partner to stop the abuse and “preserve the love.”
    


            Clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes said it often takes multiple attempts for victims to leave abusive relationships.
    


            “There's this pattern of returning and reconciliation, and then returning again,” she testified.
    


            She said victims could want to come back to “the good version of their partner that they still do love.” She said they may also return because the abuse is still continuing outside of the relationship.
    


            Abusive relationships often have love and kindness in them in addition to the abuse, clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes testified.
    


            “The victim wants that, they want that back. So when that is shown to the victim, that's very reinforcing,” she said.
    


            Hughes testified that a “trauma bond” is when somebody is attached to their partner in spite of violence and abuse. A trauma bond can make a victim unwilling to leave a relationship, she said.
    


            Psychologist Dawn Hughes testified that a victim's financial dependence on an abuser plays a very important role in their decision to stay in an abusive situation.
    


            She explained that resources are necessary for a victim to leave the relationship, and when an abuser controls their general living expenses, it's hard for the victim to see a way out. The abuser is “sabotaging a victim's ability to have independence.”
    


            “How are you to leave if you don't have access to those tangible resources,” Hughes said.
    


            Sexual abuse is “a very private harm,” which can make it difficult for a victim to seek help to leave an abusive relationship, clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes testified under direct examination by the prosecution.
    


            “They experience a tremendous amount of shame, humiliation, degradation,” Hughes said. “They don't want to talk about it. They don't even want to think about it in their own brain.”
    


            Clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes testified that it's very common for victims to stay in abusive relationships.
    


            She explained that perpetrators often use various abusive methods, beyond just physical violence, to make victims feel trapped. “It's about the power and control that the abuser has over the victim,” she said.
    


            Psychologist Dawn Hughes said she's testifying as a “blind expert” and will provide the jury with some information about domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and traumatic stress.
    


            Hughes testified she has not assessed any of the victims or the witnesses in this case, nor has she interviewed anyone connected to the case.
    


            She said she has seen some press coverage of the case, but she has not been following what's been happening in court. She testified that she's being paid $600 an hour for her work and $6,000 for a day of testimony in court.
    


            Dawn Hughes, a board-certified clinical and forensic psychologist, is now on the stand. She is an experienced expert witness, having testified in cases including the 2022 defamation trial of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.
    


            Hughes is the 11th witness called by the prosecution in this case. She is being questioned by Assistant US Attorney Mitzi Steiner.
    


            On the stand, Hughes said her experience is unique because she's “almost always had training in trauma.” She said she started working at a domestic violence survivors program in graduate school.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian qualified Hughes as an expert witness in clinical and forensic psychology specializing in trauma and traumatic stress. It's routine for an expert witness to answer questions about their credentials and experience before they're qualified at trial.
    


            Hughes is expected to testify today about why victims in general remain in relationships, how victims cope in such relationships, why they engage in delayed disclosure and the effect of trauma on memory.
    


            Subramanian previously ruled Hughes cannot testify about certain topics, including the idea of coercive control, nor can she speak to the credibility of the accusers in this case.
    


            Special agent Gerard Gannon is off the stand.
    


            Defense attorney Teny Geragos asked special agent Gerard Gannon to confirm that the two AR-15 rifles recovered from a closet in the master bedroom were dismantled and not loaded when investigators found them.
    


            Six people were at Sean “Diddy” Combs' Miami Beach home when when Homeland Security Investigations agents gained to begin the search, special agent Gerard Gannon testified.
    


            A music producer, a property manager and other facilities personnel were put in handcuffs for law enforcement to identify and search, Gannon, who was the special agent in charge on the ground during the search, confirmed.
    


            The music producer was not identified by name. No weapons or paraphernalia were recovered on any of the people found at the home at the time.
    


            Dawn Hughes, a clinical and forensic psychologist, is an experienced expert witness, having been involved in high-profile cases, including testifying in the 2022 defamation trial of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.
    


            She also testified as an expert in abusive relationships in the criminal trials of Nxivm founder Keith Raniere and singer R. Kelly.
    


            Hughes is expected to testify today during the Sean “Diddy” Combs sex-trafficking trial about why victims in general remain in relationships, how victims cope in such relationships, why they engage in delayed disclosure and the effect of trauma on memory.
    


            The judge previously ruled Hughes cannot testify about certain topics, including the idea of coercive control, nor can she speak to the credibility of the accusers in this case.
    


            Hughes is board-certified in forensic psychology, is based in New York City and specializes in the “assessment and treatment of interpersonal violence, traumatic stress and the anxiety disorders,” according to her website.
    


            Combs' defense previously indicated they would call their own expert, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Alexander Bardey, to counter the government's witness. Bardey previously testified as an expert witness for the defense during the 2022 trial of Kevin Spacey. 



            Prosecutors have finished their questioning of special agent Gerard Gannon. Defense attorney Teny Geragos is beginning cross-examination now.
    


            A loaded .45 handgun was recovered from a suitcase in a room in the property's guesthouse. Special agent Gerard Gannon identified the room as a “guard shack.”
    


            On the witness stand, Gannon held up an evidence bag filled with the bullets recovered from the firearm.
    


            The jury is seeing more photos taken during the March 2024 search of Sean “Diddy” Combs' Miami Beach home.
    


            The images shown in court included photos of boxes filled with bottles of baby oil and personal lubricant that were recovered from a closet in the home. Twenty-five bottles of baby oil and 31 bottles of lubricant were found in that closet, Gerard Gannon, the special agent in charge on the ground during the search, said.
    


             In the master bathroom, argents found a box adorned with a gold plate bearing the inscription “Puffy,” Gannon testified. MDMA and capsules containing the active ingredient in mushrooms were recovered from inside the box, the court heard.
    


            The jury saw photos of the narcotics and the box in the bathroom.
    


            A Gucci bag in the closet contained an assortment of pills, white powder, a “crystal rock-like substance,” a plastic straw, a $100 bill, and other items, special agent Gerard Gannon said.
    


            The powder and residue from the straw tested positive for cocaine and ketamine, according to a stipulation read in court. Residue from the $100 bill tested positive for cocaine and ketamine, the stipulation said.
    


            A bottle of eye drops found in the bag tested positive for MDMA and ketamine, according to the stipulation.
    


            Various tablets tested positive for MDMA, according to the stipulation. Other tablets tested positive for alprazolam, which is the active ingredient in Xanax. Some tested positive for ketamine and alprazolam, and others tested positive for methamphetamine and MDMA, according to the stipulation.
    


            Gerard Gannon, the Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge at the March 2024 search of Combs' Miami Beach home, has resumed testimony. The jury is now seeing photos of a sex toy and a pair of red high-heeled heels that Gannon says was found in a master bedroom closet in that home.
    


            Gannon pulled out shoes that he says were found in the closet and displayed them to the jury.
    


            About 18 pairs of platform high heels were recovered from the home, Gannon said.
    


            Three cell phones were found inside a Balenciaga boot in the closet, Gannon testified. Another cell phone was seized from a bedroom in the house, according to a stipulation read in court.
    


            Gannon began testifying yesterday about other items he says were found in the closet, including personal lubricant, lingerie and “upper and lower receivers of AR-15s.” Gannon said the search was tied to a human trafficking investigation. He was assigned to HSI's human trafficking group at the time, he said.
    


            Dawn Hughes, a board-certified forensic and clinical psychologist, is expected to testify later today.
    


            As an expert witness, she is likely to explain to the jury why victims remain in relationships, how victims cope in such relationships, why they engage in delayed disclosure, and the effect of trauma on memory.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian ruled ahead of the trial that Hughes cannot opine on certain topics, including the concept of coercive control.
    


            Hughes will also refrain from sharing any specific opinions about the alleged victims' credibility in this case.
    


            She was not contracted to review the details of this case and will only speak to the concepts as they pertain to victims generally.
    


            Gerard Gannon, the Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge at the March 2024 search of Combs' Miami Beach home, is on the stand to resume testimony under direct examination by the prosecution.
    


            The jury is entering.
    


            The prosecution just indicated that Kid Cudi will not take the stand today.
    


            Yesterday, prosecutors said they expect to call Scott Mescudi, the recording artist better known by his stage name Kid Cudi, this week.
    


            In her testimony last week, Cassie Ventura, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former girlfriend, testified that Combs was “irate” when he learned she was briefly dating Mescudi. Ventura said she broke it off with Mescudi after Combs assaulted her and threatened more violence on her and the rapper.
    


            Sean “Diddy” Combs is now in the courtroom, and lawyers for both sides are engaging with Judge Arun Subramanian.
    


            The jury is not in the courtroom yet.
    


            Gerard Gannon, the special agent in charge at the March 2024 search of Combs' Miami Beach home, is expected to resume the testimony that he began yesterday.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench, but Sean “Diddy” Combs hasn't been brought into the courtroom yet.
    


            Court is expected to get underway this morning with more testimony from Gerard Gannon, the special agent in charge on the ground for the 2024 search of Combs' Miami Beach home.
    


            Gerard Gannon, the special agent in charge on the ground for the search of Sean “Diddy” Combs' Florida home on March 25, 2024, is expected to continue testifying when court resumes this morning.
    


            Gannon, with Homeland Security Investigations, testified Tuesday about the search of Combs' Miami Beach home in which they found guns, ammunition and baby oil. He said about 80 to 90 law enforcement agents participated in the search because of the size of the property.
    


            Prosecutors indicated yesterday that Scott Mescudi, the recording artist better known by his stage name Kid Cudi, could be called to testify as early as today.
    


            Special Agent Gerard Gannon is expected to return to the stand this morning, followed by two others, including a former employee for Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            After court adjourned, prosecutor Maurene Comey said Cudi is also slated to testify, but may not take the stand until Thursday morning.
    


            In her testimony last week, Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend, testified that Combs was “irate” when he learned she was briefly dating Mescudi. Ventura said she broke it off with Mescudi after Combs assaulted her and threatened more violence on her and the rapper.
    


            It's the eighth day of Sean “Diddy” Combs' racketeering and sex-trafficking trial. So far, the jury has heard testimony from 10 witnesses.
    


Before the jury was dismissed for lunch yesterday, David James, a Combs former assistant, described witnessing the music mogul use drugs, his role in stocking hotel rooms for Combs, and being subjected to lie detector tests and an intimidating search. Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, testified about visits with her daughter becoming less frequent when she started dating Combs, “memorializing” her daughter's alleged abuse by taking photos of her condition in one instance, and taking a home equity loan to pay Combs the $20,000 he requested from her.
    


            A male escort, Sharay Hayes, took the stand before the lunch break yesterday, outlining his role in “creating a scene, a sexy scene, that was enjoyable” with Ventura for Combs.
    


            After Hayes wrapped up after lunch, Gerard Gannon, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, gave evidence under direct examination, which is set to resume today at 9 a.m. ET.
    


Here's a look at some of what was said yesterday:

The conservative House Freedom Caucus is demanding House GOP leaders delay plans to vote on President Donald Trump's "one big, beautiful bill" this week.

The group of GOP rebels is joining House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for a meeting at the White House later on Wednesday in an apparent bid to hash out differences on the massive piece of legislation, Fox News was told.

"I don't think it can be done today. I mean, the runway is short today," House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday.

Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said the group accepted an "offer" from the White House on Tuesday night. He suggested the offer was not yet included in the broad-based bill that Republicans are hoping to pass via the budget reconciliation process this year.

"We need to continue to work at that. We as members are at the table. We don't want the deal to be ended," Perry said.

A House Freedom Caucus source told Fox News Digital that the speaker was still "digesting" the agreement, though lawmakers at the press conference declined to say what the deal was, but a White House official pushed back in a statement to Fox News Radio.

"There was no deal. The White House presented HFC with policy options that the Administration can live with, provided they can get the votes, but they cannot get the votes," the official said. "There was no deal. The HFC will meet with the president at 3pm to hopefully strike one."

A House GOP leadership aide also told Fox News Digital that the White House only provided the Freedom Caucus with policy options rather than a deal.

Johnson had told reporters this week that the bill could see a chamber-wide vote as early as Wednesday. However, Harris said, "I'm not sure this can be done this week. I'm pretty confident it could be done in 10 days. But that's up to leadership to decide."

House conservatives have been pushing for the bill to include more aggressive cuts to Medicaid – specifically the expanded population who became eligible under the Affordable Care Act – and a full repeal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its green energy subsidies.

Allies of Johnson and other House GOP leaders have accused the GOP rebels of "moving the goal posts" from their initial demands of needing at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the cost of new spending in the bill. 

However, Harris challenged that notion during the press conference.

"We're saying work within the goalposts, rearrange it within the goalposts in accordance with what the president wants – end waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, which is wasting dollars that should be spent on the truly vulnerable, and then end as much of the green new scam as possible," Harris said.

Earlier this morning, two key critics of the bill told Fox News Digital that negotiations between the House Freedom Caucus and House GOP leaders had regressed.

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said talks went "massively south" but declined to go into detail. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., similarly said in a text message to Fox News Digital, "THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL!!"

HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT

There are several outstanding issues with the bill that have not yet been resolved – blue state Republicans pushing for a raise in state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps, and conservatives demanding stricter work requirement rules for Medicaid as well as a full repeal of green energy subsidies in the IRA.

Conservatives have been wary of the New York and California GOP lawmakers' push, however.

The House Rules Committee, the final gatekeeper before most legislation sees a House-wide vote, has been debating the bill since 1 a.m. Wednesday. The debate is expected to go through the better part of the day.

Critically, Norman and Roy are members of the rules panel – but even if they both voted against it in committee, the numbers are still on Republicans' side to advance it.

The House of Representatives, where Republicans can lose just three votes to pass anything along party lines, is another story.

Republicans are working to pass Trump's policies on tax, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt all in one massive bill via the budget reconciliation process.

Budget reconciliation lowers the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, thereby allowing the party in power to skirt the minority — in this case, Democrats — to pass sweeping pieces of legislation, provided they deal with the federal budget, taxation or the national debt.

House Republicans are hoping to advance Trump's bill through the House and Senate by the Fourth of July.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin could go down as billionaire Elon Musk's last big spend on a political campaign.

And it was a flop.

Musk, the richest person in the world, said Tuesday that he would be spending less on political campaigns. The announcement came as Musk is stepping back from his role in the Trump administration, saying he will spend more time focused on his businesses, and just seven weeks after the candidate he backed in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race lost by 10 percentage points.

Democrats in the swing state said Musk's comments show that a party-led effort in this spring's election, dubbed “ People vs. Musk, ” succeeded in making Musk and his money “toxic.” 

“The people have won,” said Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler. “The biggest funder in Republican politics is taking his toys and going home.”

Brandon Scholz, a retired longtime Republican strategist in the state, said that at least in Wisconsin, “after that court race he deserves to be labeled as toxic.” 

But that doesn't mean Musk couldn't spend money on races in the state and nationally again, especially if the stakes are high and his money could make a difference, Scholz said.

“Does he bring with him a lot of baggage? Possibly,” Scholz said. “But over time, maybe not as much.”




Musk's spending in this year's Wisconsin Supreme Court race helped make it the most expensive court race in U.S. history. And it came just five months after Musk spent at least $250 million to help President Donald Trump win, reversing losses in Wisconsin and other battleground states four years earlier.

Musk was all-in on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, even making a personal appearance in Green Bay the weekend before the election wearing a cheesehead hat — popular with fans of the NFL's Green Bay Packers — and personally handing out checks for $1 million to supporters. It was an extension of Musk's high-profile role in the presidential race, where he campaigned alongside Trump and headlined some of his own rallies.

“It's a super big deal,” he told the roughly 2,000-person crowd in the event center, where hundreds of protesters were rallying against his appearance outside. “I'm not phoning it in. I'm here in person.”

But his appearance — and money — didn't work.

The candidate Musk backed lost Brown County, the home of Green Bay, by 3 percentage points, going on to lose statewide by more than three times that margin.

After the defeat, Musk has said little publicly about the race and his involvement in it. His popularity has also plummeted.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll taken two weeks after the Wisconsin court election found that just 33% of adults had a favorable view of the Tesla CEO, down from 41% in December.

Musk's involvement in the race came at the same time he was the chain-saw-wielding face of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government.

His Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, has enacted deep cuts to the workforce and spending, in some cases seeking to shutter entire agencies, but it has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, is one of the most liberal members of Congress and a loud critic of both Trump and Musk.

Pocan is skeptical that Musk truly will back away.

“I don't believe any of it, first of all,” Pocan said. “This just means they realize how toxic Elon Musk is and the work he did through DOGE.”

Kelda Roys, a Democratic state senator, was also tempered in her excitement over Musk saying he plans to do a “lot less” political spending in the future.

“There's a ton of other billionaire bros, I'm sure, willing and happy to step up in his place,” Roys said. 

Musk could also get involved with future races, but in a much more low-profile way, said Scholz, the Republican.

“In Wisconsin, he had such a huge, huge, huge profile,” Scholz said. “He became the campaign. He became the story.”

Musk spent at least $3 million on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race himself. Musk-backed groups America PAC and a Rebuilding America's Future spent another $19 million in support of the Republican-backed candidate Brad Schimel. That was part of more than $100 million spent on both sides. 

America PAC spent at least $6 million on vendors who sent door-to-door canvassers across the state, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It was a reprise of what the group did last fall across the seven most competitive presidential battleground states, including Wisconsin, which were carried by Trump.

In addition to his political contributions, Musk paid three individual voters $1 million each for signing a petition in an effort to goose turnout. Musk also offered to pay $20 to anyone who signed up on his group's site to knock on doors for Schimel and posted a photo of themselves as proof. His organization promised $100 to every voter who signed the petition against “activist judges” and another $100 for every signer they referred.

Musk himself hosted Schimel on his podcast and cast what was at stake in stark terms.

“A seemingly small election could determine the fate of Western civilization,” Musk said in a social media post on the April 1 election day. “I think it matters for the future of the world.”

Democrats made the race a referendum on both Musk and Trump's agenda, successfully electing a judge whose victory ensures the Wisconsin Supreme Court will remain under liberal control until at least 2028.

Coincidentally, Musk's announcement about spending less on political races came just hours after a liberal judge announced her candidacy for the 2026 Wisconsin Supreme Court race. 

Wisconsin Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor is challenging a conservative incumbent justice who sided with Trump in his unsuccessful lawsuit that attempted to overturn his 2020 loss in Wisconsin. The race will be decided in April, months before the midterms in which Democrats hope unease with Trump and Musk will help the party make gains. 

Taylor appeared to be taking a similar approach to her campaign that the winning Democratic-backed candidate did this year.

“My campaign is going to be a campaign about the people of this state,” she told The Associated Press, “not about billionaires, not about the most powerful.”

The veteran head coach currently views the Philadelphia Eagles' famed play as simply football, but is curious to see how a rule change vote goes on it.

A proposal from the Green Bay Packers that would have effectively banned the tush push failed to receive enough votes from NFL owners on Wednesday.

The tush push will continue to be a part of the game through at least the 2025 season, according to FOX Sports.

As team owners deliberated in the morning, Philadelphia Eagles team owner Jeffrey Lurie reportedly brought Jason Kelce into the meeting to explain why the tush push should be kept in the game. The Eagles have had the most success with the play over the last few years, and Kelce's input was apparently enough for owners to forgo approving the ban.

The Packers' official rule change proposal would have prohibited "an offensive player from pushing a teammate who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap." The proposal added that a penalty would be assessed on any offensive player who violated the rule.

The original vote was set to take place in April, but it was tabled to May.

Proponents of the play and those who oppose it both presented strong arguments, while the league expressed worry about safety.

Rich McKay, the NFL Competition Committee chair, said in April the issues go beyond safety, because there was not enough data to say whether it is a dangerous play. The league has said there have been no injuries reported from the tush push.

Fewer people are buying Team Biden's efforts to play down reports that he was mentally declining as president, believing instead that his aides and the media engaged in a cover-up to hide his failings.

In the latest Rasmussen Reports survey shared with Secrets Tuesday morning, more likely voters than not believe that Joe Biden entered the presidency already in a mental decline that got worse over time, eventually leading to his eleventh-hour decision to bail out of his reelection campaign.

The pollster said 44% of voters believe that “Joe Biden's mental condition was already going downhill before he ever got elected in 2020.” Some 41% disagreed.

And 60% believe he would not have been mentally or physically capable of doing his job had he stayed in the 2024 race and beaten President Donald Trump to win a second term.

Good Morning !TODAY – 72% Say Cover-Up of Biden Decline a ‘Serious' ScandalEfforts by White House officials to conceal former President Joe Biden's cognitive impairment constitute a serious scandal, according to a majority of voters who also believe the news media were part… https://t.co/ovUIrc7LBn

The results follow a flurry of new reports about efforts among Biden aides and the media to hide the truth about the former president's failings, which were obvious to many. It also comes after Biden said this week that he has prostate cancer.

As a result, the public appears angry and not willing to give the president, his team, or the media the benefit of the doubt on charges that they engaged in a cover-up to hide his mental and physical conditions from the public last year.

Rasmussen, for example, found that 72% believe the cover-up is a serious scandal. That includes 60% of Democratic voters and 71% of independent voters.

In addition to blaming Biden's staff, his allies in the media are also taking a big hit. The pollster said 63% believe the media “were aware of Joe Biden's declining mental condition, but chose to help cover it up.”

A U.S. Navy technician was identified as the suspect charged with making a false bomb threat on board a Hawaiian Airlines flight preparing to take off from San Diego. 

The Port of San Diego Harbor Police Department announced that John Stea, 35, was arrested following Tuesday's incident. 

"The suspect was onboard Hawaiian Airlines flight 15 when he told a flight attendant the passenger next to him had a bomb. The flight attendant informed the captain of the plane about the potential threat as the flight was pulling away from the jetway and getting ready to depart the San Diego International Airport to Honolulu, Hawaii," it said in a statement. 

A spokesperson for the U.S. Third Fleet Fox News Digital that "The Navy is aware Electronics Technician 2nd Class John Stea, assigned to Maritime Expeditionary Security Group One, was arrested by San Diego Harbor Police on May 20 following an alleged bomb threat.

"The safety of the public and our personnel is of utmost importance to the Navy. We take all threats seriously and are cooperating fully with local and federal authorities," the spokesperson added. 

The Port of San Diego Harbor Police Department said its "Police Maritime Tactical Team, K-9 Team, and Joint Terrorism Task Force, along with the San Diego Fire Department and multiple federal agencies, responded to the scene to search the aircraft and its contents."

"The plane captain had taxied to a safe location on the airfield. All 293 people onboard were deplaned and transported by bus to a safe area. K-9s cleared the aircraft including all carry-on and checked luggage," it added. 

Stea, described by police as a "member of the military," was charged with making a false bomb threat and false report of a security threat. 

Isai Solorzano, another Navy sailor who was on the flight, told FOX 5 KUSI what he witnessed, explaining that law enforcement officials boarded the plane and asked about the owner of some specific containers.

"One guy stood up, (and) they immediately told him to turn around and put him in handcuffs," Solorzano said. "They took him away."

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference — a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed — the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar's novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.

Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?

“There is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,” acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. “It's an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it's quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.”

The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.

The result was finally unveiled before last year's Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.




The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year's IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.

But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.

“I've had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it's going to be at Indianapolis,” IndyCar president Doug Boles said. “I asked why and they say, ‘Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are — especially in qualifying — any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.

“We're going to see some exciting racing,” Boles continued, “and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It's going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.”

It hasn't gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.

For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.

“That's a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,” two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. “It's almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, ‘Hey, guys, we're going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,' I bet they would all go, ‘OK, this drives differently.' And now we have to counteract it.”

Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing's Marcus Armstrong said, “I do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.”

Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.

Then there's the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay's hybrid didn't work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.

Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.

“I think it definitely adds some variables,” said Dixon, who will start on the second row. “If you're sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.

“I think the biggest thing that we've probably all learnt so far, you've got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,” he added. “But I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.”

Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, tells Fox News Digital Democrats will ‘hold Republicans accountable' over President Donald Trump's budget bill.

EXCLUSIVE – As House GOP leaders advance President Donald Trump's so-called "big, beautiful bill" toward a floor vote this week, Democrats, who are in the minority, are sounding a warning.

"We're going to hold Republicans accountable and there will be a price to pay," Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington State, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, emphasized as she pointed to next year's midterm elections during a Fox News Digital interview.

Republicans are holding onto an extremely razor-thin majority in the chamber right now, and Democrats only need a three-seat pickup to win back the House majority in the 2026 elections.

Additionally, they view the sweeping and controversial GOP-crafted measure stocked full of Trump's second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit – which is currently making its way through numerous votes and hurdles in the House – as political ammunition.

INCHING CLOSER: HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH SOME HOLDOUT GOP LAWMAKERS

"This is a terrible piece of legislation," DelBene argued.

Democrats from across the party are shining a spotlight on the Republicans' restructuring of Medicaid, the nearly 60-year-old federal government program that provides health insurance for roughly 71 million adults and children with limited incomes.

"Let's be clear, all Republicans are talking about right now is how many people and how fast they're going to take away healthcare. They have these huge cuts to Medicaid, 14 million people lose healthcare across the country, and they're talking about how fast they can do that," DelBene charged on Tuesday.

She claimed that House Republicans are "all blindly following the president and going to blindly follow him off the cliff."

Rep. Ted Lieu of California, another member of the House Democrat leadership, argued as he took questions from reporters that the bill "has the largest cut to healthcare in U.S. history."

GOP HOLDOUTS UNMOVED BY TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL' TRIP TO CAPITOL HILL

The cuts to Medicaid, being drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cut law, which is set to expire later this year, include a slew of new rules and regulatory requirements for those seeking coverage. Among them are a new set of work requirements for many of those seeking coverage.

"When you go across the country and talk to folks, folks are outraged, and they're scared. They're scared about the cuts to healthcare, not only cutting 14 million people off of healthcare but then raising costs beyond that for everyone and things like rural hospitals closing," DelBene argued. "This would have devastating impacts across the country. This is policy that Republicans are fighting for, cutting nutrition health programs so that families don't even have healthy food."

House Republicans push back against the Democrats' attacks and say what they are doing is putting an end to waste, fraud and abuse currently in the Medicaid system, so the program can work for the public in the way that it was intended.

They call any talk that they are cutting aid to mothers, children, people with disabilities and the elderly a "flat out lie."

FIRST ON FOX: THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS SAY THEY ‘STAND UNITED' IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP'S ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

DelBene countered, saying, "we're not buying the argument because what we've seen in committee, what they've written down on paper is massive cuts in healthcare and all to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country. This isn't a bill about helping working families. This bill is devastating for working families."

However, her counterparty, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement that "Republicans are ending waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid so the most vulnerable get the care they need."

Additionally, Hudson argued that "Democrats are lying to protect a broken status quo that lets illegal immigrants siphon off billions meant for American families. We're strengthening Medicaid for future generations by protecting taxpayers and restoring integrity."

Dating back to last year's presidential campaign, Trump has vowed not to touch Medicaid. On Tuesday, as he made a rare stop on Capitol Hill to meet behind closed doors with House Republicans in order to shore up support for the bill, Trump's message to fiscally conservative lawmakers looking to make further cuts to Medicaid was "don't f--- around with Medicaid."

While there are divisions between Republicans over Medicaid, and a chasm between the two major parties over the longstanding entitlement program, there is one point of agreement – this issue will continue to simmer on the campaign trail in one form or another long after the legislative battles on Capitol Hill are over.

Lockheed Martin COO Frank St. John joins 'FOX & Friends First' to explain the company's 'leading role' in developing President Donald Trump's planned defense system for America.

China is concerned by President Donald Trump's proposal for a new U.S. missile defense system, called the Golden Dome, which is designed to protect against adversarial attacks on America.  

Golden Dome has a "strong offensive nature and violates the principle of peaceful use in the Outer Space Treaty," Chinese Foreign Minister Mao Ning said Wednesday. 

"The project will heighten the risk of turning space into a war zone and creating a space arms race, and shake the international security and arms control system," Mao said. "We urge the U.S. to give up developing and deploying global anti-missile system."

Both China and Russia have placed offensive weapons in space, like anti-satellite capabilities that could potentially be used to try to take the U.S. offline, American intelligence officials have warned.

However, China said it was the U.S. that was "obsessed" with offensive space dominance. 

"The U.S., by putting itself first, and being obsessed with pursuing absolute security, violates the principle of, and diminishes, the security for all and undermines the global strategic balance and stability," Mao said.

"China is gravely concerned about this," she added. "We urge the U.S. to give up developing and deploying the global anti-missile system at an early date and take concrete actions to enhance strategic mutual trust between major countries and safeguard global strategic stability." 

Trump laid out a broad overview of the Golden Dome plan from the White House on Tuesday, projecting the cost figure at $125 billion. The current government funding bill working its way through Congress includes an initial $25 billion to kick off the project. 

Trump also offered an ambitious timeline for the project to be completed before he leaves office.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment on China's reaction. 

The Kremlin, meanwhile, said the Golden Dome project could prompt talks on strategic arms control between Russia and the U.S. 

The U.S. withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019 and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, citing Russian violations which Moscow denied. 

"Now that the legal framework in this area has been destroyed, and the validity period has expired, or deliberately, let's say, a number of documents have ceased to be valid, this base must be recreated both in the interests of our two countries and in the interests of security throughout the planet," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

China's space-based targeting capabilities have "grown most impressively" in recent years, according to Space Force Vice Chief Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, with hundreds of satellites now dedicated to tracking U.S. assets in orbit. He called China's rapid advances "mind-boggling" during a hearing on Capitol Hill last month and said the U.S. was at risk of losing its dominance in orbit.

Weeks before that, Space Force Vice Chief of Operations Gen. Michael Guetlein revealed that China has been practicing satellite "dogfighting," a sign of its growing ability to conduct complex operations in orbit.

Space Force has observed "five different objects in space maneuvering in and out and around each other in synchronicity and in control," he said.

"That's what we call dogfighting in space," Guetlein said. "They are practicing tactics, techniques and procedures to conduct on-orbit operations from one satellite to another."

            Armed men hijacked a tourist boat in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, robbed all 14 people on board and forced them to empty their bank accounts via mobile apps, according to one of the victims.
    


            Spanish TikToker Elisabet de la Almudena, who has more than 235,000 followers on the platform, described the ordeal as the “worst day of her life” in a 4.5-minute video uploaded Tuesday.
    


            According to her account, she was part of a 14-person group, including her parents and 6-year-old daughter, that set off on an all-day boat tour from the city of Iquitos, a popular jumping-off point to explore the rainforest.
    


            “We contracted a family tour, a sightseeing tour, and we ended up being kidnapped,” she said.

            Four men armed with pistols and a machine gun boarded the boat and sailed it deep into the forest, said de la Almudena, where they took everyone's belongings and even the vessel's motor.
    


            “Through mobile phone applications, they asked us to take the money out of our accounts and transfer it to one of their accounts, otherwise they would not leave,” she added.
    


            “I wouldn't wish it upon anyone,” de la Almudena said.
    


            The passengers then took pieces of wood from the boat and used them to row down the river, where they came upon a family in another boat that towed them to safety, she said.
    


            De la Almudena claimed that the tour company, Canopy Tours Iquitos, had no GPS tracker on the boat, no insurance and no security measures in place, despite the fact that she was later told that this kind of incident has happened in the area before.
    


            “We were completely abandoned by the people that were supposed to look after us,” she said.
    


            In response, Canopy Tours Iquitos said the incident, which occurred on May 14, was a chance event outside of its control that “was immediately reported to the authorities.”

            “We activated our emergency protocols straight away, offered our assistance to the affected group and have been actively cooperating with the investigation,” the company said in a Facebook post published Tuesday.
    


            In addition, the company said it would strengthen security measures, including introducing GPS monitoring, closer cooperation with the police and more training for staff.
    


            According to the US State Department, travelers to Peru should “exercise increased caution due to crime, civil unrest, and the risk of kidnapping. Some areas have increased risk.”
    


            In a travel advisory update published May 16, the department underlined that “crime is common in Peru.”
    


            “Petty theft, carjackings, muggings, assaults, and other violent crime often happen even in daylight hours and with many witnesses around. Kidnapping is rare, but it does occur,” it said.
    


            CNN has contacted Canopy Tours Iquitos, the Peruvian national police and the Spanish Embassy in Peru for comment.

For the last two months of their life in the United States, José Alberto González and his family spent nearly all their time in their one-bedroom Denver apartment. They didn't speak to anyone except their roommates, another family from Venezuela. 

They consulted WhatsApp messages for warnings of immigration agents in the area before leaving for the rare landscaping job or to buy groceries.

But most days at 7:20 a.m., González's wife took their children to school. 

The appeal of their children learning English in American schools, and the desire to make money, had compelled González and his wife to bring their 6- and 3-year-old on the monthslong journey to the United States. 

They arrived two years ago, planning to stay for a decade. But on Feb. 28, González and his family boarded a bus from Denver to El Paso, where they would walk across the border and start the long trip back to Venezuela. 

Bianca Vázquez Toness, who speaks Spanish and Portuguese, has spent a decade writing about immigration or education.

Even as immigrants in the U.S. avoid going out in public, terrified of encountering immigration authorities, families across the country are mostly sending their children to school. 

That's not to say they feel safe. In some cases, families are telling their children's schools that they're leaving.

Already, thousands of immigrants have notified federal authorities they plan to “self-deport,” according to the Department of Homeland Security. President Donald Trump has encouraged more families to leave by stoking fears of imprisonment, ramping up government surveillance, and offering people $1,000 and transportation out of the country. 




And on Monday, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants, potentially exposing them to deportation. Without Temporary Protective Status, even more families will weigh whether to leave the U.S., advocates say.

Departures in significant numbers could spell trouble for schools, which receive funding based on how many students they enroll.

“The amount of fear and uncertainty that is going through parents' heads, who could blame somebody for making a choice to leave?” said Andrea Rentería, principal of a Denver elementary school serving immigrant students. “I can tell them as a principal that I won't let anybody in this school. Nobody is taking your kid. But I can't say the same for them out in the workforce or driving somewhere.”

When Trump was elected in November after promising to deport immigrants and depicting Venezuelans, in particular, as gang members, González knew it was time to go. He was willing to accept the trade-off of earning just $50 weekly in his home country, where public schools operate a few hours a day. 

“I don't want to be treated like a delinquent,” González said in Spanish. “I'm from Venezuela and have tattoos. For him, that means I'm a criminal.”

It took González months to save up the more than $3,000 he needed to get his family to Venezuela on a series of buses and on foot. He and his wife didn't tell anyone of their plan except the single mom who shared their apartment, afraid to draw attention to themselves. Telling people they wanted to leave would signal they were living here illegally. 

They sent their children to their Denver school regularly until late February, when González's phone lit up with messages claiming immigration agents were planning raids inside schools. That week, they kept their son home.

“Honestly, we were really scared for our boy,” González said. “Because we didn't have legal status.”

In the months following Trump's inauguration, Denver Public School attendance suffered, according to district data.

Attendance districtwide fell by 3% in February compared with the same period last year, with even steeper declines of up to 4.7% at schools primarily serving immigrant newcomer students. The deflated rates continued through March, with districtwide attendance down 1.7% and as much as 3.9% at some newcomer schools.

Some parents told Denver school staff they had no plans to approach their children's campus after the Trump administration ended a policy that had limited immigration enforcement at schools.

The Denver school district sued the government over that reversal, saying attendance dropped “noticeably” across all schools, “particularly those schools in areas with new-to-country families and where ICE raids have already occurred.” A federal judge ruled in March the district failed to prove the new policy caused the attendance decline.

Data obtained from 15 districts across eight additional states, including Texas, Alabama, Idaho and Massachusetts, showed a similar decline in school attendance after the inauguration for a few weeks. In most places, attendance rebounded sooner than in Denver. 

From 2022 to 2024, more than 40,000 Venezuelans and Colombian migrants received shelter or other assistance from Denver. Trump said during the campaign he would begin his mass deportation efforts nearby, in the suburb of Aurora, because of alleged Venezuelan gang activity.

Nationwide, schools are still reporting immediate drops in daily attendance during weeks when there is immigration enforcement — or even rumors of ICE raids — in their communities, said Hedy Chang of the nonprofit Attendance Works, which helps schools address absenteeism.

Dozens of districts didn't respond to requests for attendance data. Some said they feared drawing the attention of immigration enforcement.

In late February, González and his wife withdrew their children from school and told administrators they were returning to Venezuela. He posted a goodbye message on a Facebook group for Denver volunteers he used to find work and other help. “Thank you for everything, friends,” he posted. “Tomorrow I leave with God's favor.”

Immediately, half a dozen Venezuelan and Colombian women asked him for advice on getting back. “We plan to leave in May, if God allows,” one woman posted in Spanish. 

In Denver, 3,323 students have withdrawn from school through mid-April – an increase of 686 compared with the same period last year. Denver school officials couldn't explain the uptick.

At the 400-student Denver elementary school Andrea Rentería heads, at least two students have withdrawn since the inauguration because of immigration concerns. One is going back to Colombia and the other didn't say where they were headed.

School officials in Massachusetts and Washington state have confirmed some students are withdrawing from school to return to El Salvador, Brazil and Mexico. Haitians are trying to go to Mexico or Canada. 

In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a 6,000-student district where nearly half the students are still learning English, a handful of families have recently withdrawn their children because of immigration concerns. 

One mother in March withdrew two young children from the district to return to El Salvador, according to district administrator Daniel Mojica. Her 19-year old daughter will stay behind, on her own, to finish school – a sign that these decisions are leading to more family separation.

In Bellingham, Washington, two families withdrew their children after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in early April at a local roofing company, where agents arrested fathers of 16 children attending Bellingham schools. Both families returned to Mexico, family engagement specialist Isabel Meaker said. 

“There's a sense, not just with these families, that it's not worth it to fight. They know the end result,” Meaker said.

Countries with large populations living in the United States are seeing signs of more people wanting to return home.

Applications for Brazilian passports from consulates in the U.S. increased 36% in March, compared to the previous year, according to data from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Birth registrations, the first step to getting a Brazilian passport for a U.S.-born child, were up 76% in April compared to the previous year. Guatemala reports a 5% increase over last year for passports from its nationals living in the United States. 

Last month, Melvin Josué, his wife and another couple drove four hours from New Jersey to Boston to get Honduran passports for their American-born children.

It's a step that's taken on urgency in case these families decide life in the United States is untenable. Melvin Josué worries about Trump's immigration policy and what might happen if he or his wife is detained, but lately he's more concerned with the difficulty of finding work.

Demand for his drywall crew immediately stopped amid the economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. There's also more reluctance, he said, to hire workers here illegally.

(The Associated Press agreed to use only his first and middle name because he's in the country illegally and fears being separated from his family.)

“I don't know what we'll do, but we may have to go back to Honduras,” he said. “We want to be ready.”

The size of the exodus and its impact on schools remains unclear, but already some are starting to worry. 

A consultant working with districts in Texas on immigrant education said one district there has seen a significant drop in summer school sign-ups for students learning English.

“They're really worried about enrollment for the fall,” said Viridiana Carrizales, chief executive officer of ImmSchools, a nonprofit that advises school districts how to meet the needs of immigrant students and their families. 

Education finance experts predict budget problems for districts with large immigrant populations. 

“Every student that walks in the door gets a chunk of money with it, not just federal money, but state and local money, too,” said Marguerite Roza, a Georgetown University professor focusing on education finance. “If a district had a lot of migrant students in its district, that's a loss of funds potentially there. We think that's a real high risk.”

Trump's offer to pay immigrants to leave and help them with transportation could hasten the departures. 

González, now back in Venezuela, says he wouldn't have accepted the money, because it would have meant registering with the U.S. government, which he no longer trusts. And that's what he's telling the dozens of migrants in the U.S. who contact him each week asking the best way home.

Go on your own, he tells them. Once you have the cash, it's much easier going south than it was getting to the U.S. in the first place.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the constitutional provision that allows people to legally challenge their detention by the government is actually a tool the Trump administration can use in its broader crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border. She called habeas corpus “a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their rights.”

Noem, testifying before a congressional committee Tuesday, gave that response when asked by Sen. Maggie Hassan to define the legal concept.

“That's incorrect,” the New Hampshire Democrat swiftly interrupted Noem, defining the “legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people.” Hassan, a former attorney who practiced in Boston, went on to call habeas corpus “the foundational right that separates free societies like America from police states like North Korea.”

The back and forth follows comments by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who said earlier this month that President Donald Trump is looking for ways to expand his administration's legal power to deport migrants who are in the United States illegally. To achieve that, Miller said the administration is “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus.

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem being called out for giving a differing definition of a constitutional principle.




The Latin term means, literally, “you have the body.” Federal courts use a writ of habeas corpus to bring a prisoner before a neutral judge to determine if imprisonment is legal.

Habeas corpus was included in the Constitution as an import from English common law. Parliament enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, which was meant to ensure that the king released prisoners when the law did not justify confining them.

The Constitution's Suspension Clause, the second clause of Section 9 of Article I, states that habeas corpus “shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.”

Yes. The United States has suspended habeas corpus under four distinct circumstances during its history. Those usually involved authorization from Congress, something that would be nearly impossible today — even at Trump's urging — given the narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate.

President Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus multiple times during the Civil War, beginning in 1861 to detain suspected spies and Confederate sympathizers. He ignored a ruling from Roger Taney, the Supreme Court ‘s chief justice. Congress then authorized suspending it in 1863, which allowed Lincoln to do so again. 

Congress acted similarly under President Ulysses S. Grant, suspending habeas corpus in parts of South Carolina under the Civil Rights Act of 1871. Also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, it was meant to counter violence and intimidation by groups that opposed Reconstruction in the South. 

Habeas corpus was suspended in two provinces of the Philippines in 1905, when it was a U.S. territory and authorities were worried about the threat of an insurrection, and in Hawaii after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor but before it became a state in 1959. 

Writing before becoming a Supreme Court justice, Amy Coney Barrett co-authored a piece stating that the Suspension Clause “does not specify which branch of government has the authority to suspend the privilege of the writ, but most agree that only Congress can do it.”

Miller has said the administration is considering trying.

“The Constitution is clear, and that of course is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,” he told reporters outside the White House on May 9. 

“So, I would say that's an option we're actively looking at,” Miller said. “Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”

Asked by Hassan on Tuesday if she supported the provision, Noem said she did, adding that “the president of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not.” 

Hassan, who responded by saying that even Lincoln had obtained “retroactive approval” from Congress, then asked Noem if she would follow a court order overturning a theoretical suspension of habeas corpus, or if she would follow Trump's decision.

Noem said she was “following all court orders ... as is the president,” prompting Hassan to say “that is obviously not true for anybody who reads the news.”

John Blume, a professor at Cornell Law School, said Noem's response to Hassan was either evidence that she “fundamentally misunderstands habeas corpus” or “was giving an answer she knew was wrong to appease the president.”

Should the administration argue that the constitutional provision should be suspended due to what Trump officials have characterized as an “invasion” by migrants, Blume said he felt such a position would be “very unlikely to fly” with the U.S. Supreme Court.

It can try. Miller suggested that the U.S. is facing an “invasion” of migrants. That term was used deliberately, though any effort to suspend habeas corpus would spark legal challenges questioning whether the country was in fact facing an invasion, let alone one that presented extraordinary threats to public safety. 

Federal judges have so far been skeptical of the Trump administration's past efforts to use extraordinary powers to make deportations easier, and that could make suspending habeas corpus even tougher. 

Trump argued in March that the United States was facing an “invasion” of Venezuelan gang members and evoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime authority he has tried to use to speed up mass deportations. His administration acted to swiftly deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua to a notorious prison in El Salvador, leading to a series of legal fights. 

Federal courts around the country, including in New York, Colorado, Texas and Pennsylvania, have since blocked the administration's uses of the Alien Enemies Act for many reasons, including by raising questions about whether the country is truly facing an invasion. 

Miller, who has been fiercely critical of judges ruling against the administration, advanced the argument that the judicial branch may not get to decide. 

“Congress passed a body of law known as the Immigration Nationality Act which stripped Article III courts, that's the judicial branch, of jurisdiction over immigration cases,” he said earlier this month. 

That statute was approved by Congress in 1952 and there were important amendments in 1996 and 2005. Legal scholars note that it does contain language that could funnel certain cases to immigration courts, which are overseen by the executive branch. 

Still, most appeals in those cases would largely be handled by the judicial branch, and they could run into the same issues as Trump's attempts to use the Alien Enemies Act. 

The U.S. system of government is divided into three branches: executive (the president), legislative (Congress) and judicial (the courts). 

Technically not since Pearl Harbor, though habeas corpus has been at the center of some major legal challenges more recently than that. 

Republican President George W. Bush did not move to suspend habeas corpus after the Sept. 11 attacks, but his administration subsequently sent detainees to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, drawing lawsuits from advocates who argued the administration was violating it and other legal constitutional protections. 

In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo detainees had a constitutional right to habeas corpus, allowing them to challenge their detention before a judge. That led to some detainees being released.

            The Trump administration significantly cut funding for flood prevention projects in blue states across the country while creating new water construction opportunities in red states, undoing a Biden-era budget proposal that would have allocated money more evenly, according to a data analysis prepared by Democratic staffers.
    


            California and the state of Washington lost the most funds, with the administration cutting water construction budget for those states by a combined $606 million, according to the analysis, which was shared with CNN. Texas, meanwhile, gained $206 million.
    


            Democrats decried the moves, saying the administration was slashing essential projects in the name of political retribution. Collectively, states with Democratic senators lost over $436 million in funding compared to what they would have received under the last proposed budget of President Joe Biden's administration, the data analysis shows. Republican-led states gained more than $257 million, the analysis shows.
    


            “President Trump is blatantly playing politics with critical Army Corps construction investments and punishing the American people for the way their states have voted,” House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro and fellow Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur said in a joint statement to CNN.
    


            The Trump administration said money was allocated “based on need and urgency,” and the cuts did not universally hit Democrat-controlled states. Iowa and Louisiana, which both have Republican governors and US senators, for example, both saw their overall funding reduced.
    


            “The FY25 Civil Works plan will generate billions of dollars in economic activity by building American energy dominance and shipping capacity while investing in important conservation projects,” an Office of Management and Budget spokesperson told CNN. “The available funds were allocated by the administration based on need and urgency, in accordance with the guidelines set by Congress.”
    


            During a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday, an Army Corps of Engineers official pledged nonpartisanship but could not give a concrete answer about why the administration cut funding from blue states and gave to red states under questioning from California Democratic Rep. Mike Levin.
    


            Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army Robyn Colosimo said the administration had to cut projects because the short-term government funding extension bill significantly cut the funds available to the program. It was not her decision, Colosimo said, how the cuts were made.
    


            “We always support the best projects. In this case it's a dicey situation,” Colosimo said. “They made hard choices. The administration did. And they had that discretion.”
    


            “I believe they had to make trade-offs that I was not privy to,” Colosimo responded, when pressed further on whether the cuts were partisan. “It's the priorities they placed that were different than the priorities of other projects.”
    


            In an earlier statement to CNN, an Army Corps spokesperson said the appropriations bill “allowed the administration to allocate all funds to Civil Works projects, programs and activities in accordance with its priorities.”
    


            Typically, Congress takes a presidential budget request and sets funding levels for water construction projects through full-year appropriations bills on a bipartisan basis. But because Congress passed a short-term government funding bill without clear directives for these projects in March, the Trump administration has full discretion to determine how the funding should be allocated.
    


            Biden had proposed relatively even funding levels for water construction projects across red and blue states in his budget request last year, with blue states getting about 53% of the funds available for construction projects and red states getting 47%. Both the House and Senate passed bills in 2024 that also would have provided relatively even funding for 2025. But the Trump administration's plan allocated just 33% of funds to blue states, and 64% to red.
    


            A source familiar with the budget said priorities often shift with a change of administration, but the change in spending on these projects was “unique” for the “magnitude” of how the funding was reallocated.
    


            “That's always been done on the edges; this is a wholesale dismissal of the 2025 budget,” the person said. “It looks like a war on the West Coast primarily. They definitely swiped away from blue states to fund red states.”
    


            Four flood prevention projects in California, which were set to gain a combined $126.4 million under the Biden budget proposal, are getting nothing under the Trump administration's plan. One of the projects to lose funding, Sacramento's Natomas Basin is “one of the most at-risk areas in the nation for catastrophic flooding,” according to the Army Corps of Engineers website.
    


            The West Sacramento levee project, which is not getting a proposed $43 million, bisects 48,000 residents and provides vital infrastructure to the US Postal Service, the California Department of Water Resources flood fight facility, and the Port of West Sacramento, the Army Corps of Engineers says.
    


            The California flood control projects are key given the deluge the state has gotten from so-called atmospheric rivers, essentially, rivers in the sky that can deluge cities and towns in water. One of the California communities that was set to receive the Army Corps funding flooded during atmospheric rivers in 2023, a year where tens of trillions of gallons of water fell on the state, according to NOAA.
    


            “Natural disasters like floods don't discriminate – they can and do hit red and blue states alike,” Democratic California Sen. Adam Schiff said in a statement to CNN. “The Trump administration is politicizing the Army Corps and its critical mission, and it needs to stop playing games with people's lives.”
    


            A $500 million dam project that provides flood control and water conservation in Washington also will get nothing under the Trump plan, and other state projects were given significantly less resources. The dam has flooded more than 30 times over the past 70 years causing serious damage to lands and buildings, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.
    


            “We are witnessing a historic and serious, politically motivated abuse of our taxpayer dollars by President Trump,” said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, adding, “this is some corrupt B-S from the President.”
    


            Texas got the biggest investment, with over $206 million awarded for two large waterway projects that were not part of the 2024 budget request. One will deepen the Sabine-Neches Waterway, which is crucial to military and energy transport. And the funding for the Houston Ship Channel will provide dredging and maintenance.
    


            The other Republican-led states to gain tens of millions of new waterway construction funding include Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee. A new $16.5 million in funding to address storm damage in Democratic-run New Jersey originates in GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew's district.
    


            Hill Republicans defended allocations of money to their states and districts.
    


            “Good for Republican states,” GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, told CNN. “There is your incentive to be a Republican state.”
    


            “Washington has picked winners and losers for a long time. It's not going to stop picking winners and losers. Better to be on the winning side than on the losing side” Gonzales added.
    


            When asked if he thought partisan politics overshadowed the funding breakdown, Van Drew, who worked with the administration to get the funding approved, told CNN. “Not that I know of.”
    


            “I will say this, even when the Democrats were in control and I was here, I did very well in my district because the need for these projects are so great,” Van Drew said.
    


            GOP Rep. Randy Weber, whose coastal Texas district is home to several key ports, said the construction awarded to his state was based on the outsized need to maintain safe shipping practices.
    


            “We need the channel dug out,” Weber explained. “We're able to do more commerce and more trade. So, for us, it's a big deal.”
    


            GOP Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio, who says he has had success getting various dredging projects funded, told CNN lawmakers must make the case to convince the administration to fund these types of projects.
    


            “You got to work on them,” Joyce said about the way to advocate with the administration. “It's like a rebound, right? That's where the sharp elbows get in there and make sure you get the rebound.”

We've become so accustomed to corruption in our politics that it probably sounds hyperbolic to contend that any one scandal is perhaps the biggest in American history. But the cover-up of former President Joe Biden's mental and physical deterioration is up there. It involved government officials and pliant press propping up a cancer-ridden man who was clearly unable to perform the most rudimentary tasks of the most important job in the world. 

If Biden had skipped the presidential debate with Donald Trump, as many Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), urged him to do, White House lackeys and the obliging media would have continued concealing the president's deteriorating condition. They, no doubt, would have done it all the way to Election Day and into his second term, should Biden have won. 

We still have no clue who participated. We have seen no reckoning by reporters or Democrats who participated in the sham. Sure, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, has sparked discussion about the former president's state. The problem is that the book is written by reporters as if they are merely spectators rather than participants. 

Original Sin is like All the President's Men if the latter hadn't named any of the men and had been written by John Ehrlichman.

It gets worse. This week, Biden disclosed that he's suffering from aggressive Stage 4 prostate cancer. When House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies (D-NY) was asked if the former president should have been more open about his health problems, he responded, “There are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories and want us to look backward.”

Well, virtually every alleged conspiracy theory regarding Biden over the past five years has turned out to be true. The Hunter Biden laptop story was real. The contention that the president knew about, and probably led, his family's corrupt influence-peddling enterprise was true. The claim that Biden's mental acuity was seriously impaired is now inarguable.

So, it's also wholly reasonable, even necessary at this point, to figure out what happened. Did Biden or his handlers know the president had an aggressive form of cancer? Did he have it when he ran in 2024? How about in 2020? 

Almost every oncologist interviewed on the topic says Biden's type of prostate cancer would have been around for several years, perhaps a decade. Biden “did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that,” Zeke Emanuel, an oncologist and Democrat who was Biden's White House COVID adviser, told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, who not long ago was passionately assuring us that Biden was “as sharp as anybody” he'd spoken to in years. 

William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, said, “We definitely would anticipate that he has had prostate cancer for many, many years.” So, doctors examining an octogenarian U.S. president and missing an aggressive cancer for years is about as plausible as White House reporters failing to notice his deteriorating mental state. 

Biden, of course, never released full medical records, only summaries, despite headlines claiming otherwise (Trump has also only released summaries). Did doctors believe conducting a blood test for cancer wasn't necessary at Biden's age? Or did they administer it and then hide the results from the public? Or did the president refuse to take one? 

You can call it a conspiracy theory, but considering what went on in the Biden White House, lying about cancer seems quite plausible. After all, there's a strong possibility that serious decisions regarding foreign and domestic policy were made by unelected officials and handlers rather than the president. Yet not one person in the White House thought it was important enough to blow the whistle. The other possibility is that a president who forgets the names of his Cabinet and the year his son died was making major, generational decisions for the public and the world. And, again, not one person in the White House thought it was important enough to blow the whistle. 

Was Biden even in control when 13 American servicemen were murdered in the administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan? Did Biden know what was happening when pushing a giant inflation-sparking reform bill that sank his presidency, or did he simply repeat the inanities written for him by his daft aides?

Was it Biden who thought it was wise to use an autopen to issue unprecedented 10-year blanket retroactive pardons to his family and political allies, or was it his family and political allies who came up with the idea?

Feel free to grouse all you like about the sycophancy surrounding Trump. It's a problem. It is clear that Democrats put their love of power over their love of country. 

Ideally, it is the journalist's job to figure out what happened and who was responsible. Democracy dies in darkness, and all that. And that's the rub. 

It would be a waste of space to list all the media outlets that participated in the attempted gaslighting of the public over Biden's obvious cognitive deterioration. Let's just say every one of them participated to some degree. At best, the media disseminated exactly what government officials told them, or, at worst, they helped with the cover-up. There is overwhelming evidence of the latter, from the expediently discovered lifelong stuttering problem to the attacks on then-special counsel Robert Hur, who, unlike White House reporters, needed only a few hours with the president to understand that he was an “elderly man with a poor memory.”

And there are a few heroes in Original Sin. One person who emerges well is Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), who, according to Tapper and Thompson, attempted to tell Biden the truth about his presidential prospects after the disastrous first presidential debate. (So not exactly stepping out on a ledge.) 

First lady Jill Biden, we learn, whisked her husband away from the governor. It's clear that by the time of the first presidential debate, the first lady was controlling what the president was hearing. You may recall Jill Biden sending out pictures of herself “prepping” for the G7 or sitting in a Cabinet meeting. “Jill Biden joined a Cabinet meeting to give a women's health update,” the aggressively unreliable PolitiFact assured voters. “She's not running the US.” Are we still sure about that? 

It is likely that Jill Biden emerged to assure voters that the president was in good hands. When Woodrow Wilson, one of the worst presidents when he was conscious, had a debilitating stroke in 1919, his wife Edith famously took over the job for 15 months. With the help of the president's doctor, Edith Wilson covered up her husband's mental and physical breakdown and hid it from the voters and the press. It was a lot easier to get away with in those days. And though she had never been elected to office, Edith Wilson made a slew of major domestic and foreign policy decisions. The question is, who was making those policy decisions for Joe Biden for four years? If not Jill Biden, then who? It's an important question for the historical record. And it's important because we should know who was involved moving forward.  

DEMOCRATS MUST ADDRESS THEIR CREDIBILITY CANCER BEFORE IT SPREADS

Now, there's a tendency for people to excuse Biden's role in this because of his age and to blame others exclusively. One hopes Biden recovers from his ailment. It should not be forgotten, though, that the former president has always been reckless and unscrupulous. A blowhard senator, a world champion fabulist and boor, the patriarch of a corrupt family, Biden didn't hold a single consistent principle in his long career. A man who refused to acknowledge his granddaughter's existence for years because it was bad for his political prospects is not above lying about his health. Indeed, any patriot, or even a marginally conscientious person, would never have run for the presidency in his condition. He deserves lots of blame. 

But, no, he is not alone.

The Trump administration begins self-deportation flights with 'Project Homecoming' to incentivize illegal immigrants to leave the United States on their own accord. The 'Outnumbered' panel weighs in. 

A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump's administration must maintain custody of illegal immigrants deported to South Sudan in case he rules the removals unlawful and they must be transferred back to the U.S.

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts issued the ruling Tuesday night after lawyers for illegal immigrants from Myanmar and Vietnam accused the Trump administration of illegally deporting their clients to third-party countries. They argue there is currently a court order blocking such removals.

Murphy's ruling said the government must "maintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful."

Attorneys for the immigrants argue that the deportations violated a court order mandating that migrants be granted "meaningful opportunity" to establish that sending them to a third country would make them unsafe.

The attorneys asked Murphy for an emergency court order to prevent the deportations. Murphy, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would "clearly" violate his ruling, which also applies to people who have otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.

Murphy said in his Tuesday order that U.S. officials must appear in court on Wednesday to identify the immigrants impacted, address when and how they learned they would be removed to a third country and what opportunity they were given to raise a fear-based claim. He also ruled that the government must provide information about the whereabouts of the migrants apparently already removed.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in April that the U.S. would revoke visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and no others would be issued, effective immediately. Rubio attributed the change to "the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner," according to a statement posted on X.

President Donald Trump and top House Republicans are ramping up a sweeping investigation into former President Joe Biden's use of a mechanical signature device known as the autopen, raising questions about the legitimacy of executive actions taken during Biden's presidency — especially a wave of last-minute pardons signed with the device.

The investigation, led by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), gained traction after the Washington Examiner first reported on Friday about Comer's plans for the committee to investigate whether Biden personally authorized all of his clemency orders and executive actions or whether his aides, acting on his behalf, used the autopen without valid authority.

At the center of the controversy are Republican claims that Biden lacked the cognitive ability to carry out key decisions and that unelected aides may have orchestrated policy behind the scenes. The Justice Department, now under Trump's control, has also pledged internal reviews of Biden-era pardons under newly appointed Pardon Attorney Ed Martin.

A staffer familiar with Martin's plans told the Washington Examiner that Martin “looks forward to being in a position to facilitate congressional inquiries from inside the building and to cooperate with those inquiries, because they're all on the same team.”

Comer has made the autopen investigation a new front in the broader Republican effort to investigate Biden's fitness and decision-making while in office.

In a statement after his closed-door announcement of the investigation at the annual Republican National Lawyers Association event, Comer said his panel would commence its investigation into “the cover-up of President Biden's mental decline and use of autopen,” even teasing that he believes he knows which former Biden staffer operated the device.

Comer said he plans to subpoena former Biden aides Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal, and Ashley Williams, who he says “ran interference” for the president and may have coordinated the use of the autopen.

“Now that Biden's top enablers can no longer hide behind the power of the presidency, we're continuing our investigation to expose the truth,” Comer said.

Although Comer has named three former aides to Biden, Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for the Oversight Project, formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, said House Republicans should consider additional names to subpoena, including those who received the blanket pardons from Biden just before he left office.

“I would hope and expect that the people that received those preemptive pardons are on the deposition list,” Brosnan told the Washington Examiner. “They're certainly eligible to be deposed in this situation, and they cannot assert the Fifth Amendment for these pardons either.”

Republicans have pointed to Biden's final-week pardons and clemency grants as a focal point for legal scrutiny. Among the figures who received preemptive clemency were former COVID-19 adviser Anthony Fauci, former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, and members of the House Jan. 6 committee.

Several of the pardons were signed between Jan. 16 and Jan. 19, just days before Trump's inauguration. According to public filings and internal memoranda obtained by congressional investigators, a significant number of clemency warrants were executed using batch-format autopen signatures, raising questions about whether Biden was directly involved in the process.

Also included in the final clemency wave were Hunter Biden, the president's son, and James Biden, his brother, both of whom had been under various federal investigations. GOP lawmakers say the use of preemptive pardons to shield Biden family members from potential future charges may constitute abuse of executive power.

Brosnan said the legal questions are serious: “The Constitution vests the power of pardon in one person and one person only — the President of the United States.”

“If it's autopened, it opens up a whole can of worms,” Brosnan added. “Did the president [himself] authorize this? Was there a written authorization? Who controlled the autopen? What procedures were in place to ensure it wasn't being misused?”

Brosnan added that Biden's DOJ had previously argued in Jan. 6 cases that accepting a pardon implies guilt, questioning why the same standard of reasoning should not also apply to the former president's family and political allies.

“It's a reasonable question for Congress to ask,” he said. “What crime did Hunter Biden admit to? What about James Biden, or the dozens of others granted immunity preemptively?”

The Oversight Project has spent months reviewing Biden-era documents and clemency orders. Of the 57 total clemency warrants issued during Biden's presidency, affecting over 4,000 people, 32 were signed using the autopen, according to a March 17 report from the Oversight Project.

Even more notable: The group found two distinct versions of Biden's signature, which they identified as “Autopen A” and “Autopen B,” Brosnan added.

“These are some of the broadest pardons we've ever seen,” Brosnan said, noting especially the ones issued in the waning hours of Biden's term. “Traditionally, pardons absolve past crimes — so if Biden's team is issuing pardons as blanket immunity, that's not just a break from history, that's a constitutional problem.”

During his visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump alleged that aides may have used the autopen to enact more lenient immigration policies without Biden's knowledge.

“We're going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,” Trump said. “Who signed legislation opening our border? I don't think he knew.”

Trump did not cite specific legislation or provide evidence for his suspicions but claimed that the device was operated by “radical Left lunatics” who were frustrated that Biden, not Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), had won the Democratic nomination.

“They said, ‘Wait a minute, this is a gift. He'll do anything. We're going to use the autopen,'” Trump said. “And they used the autopen on everything.”

Although many of Biden's orders were not signed in public, the president, on numerous occasions, signed orders for the public to witness, meaning that not all of Biden's actions will be under the microscope of the committee's investigation. However, many of the controversial actions that occurred behind closed doors, such as clemency grants, will be fair game.

The legality of using the autopen is not in question. Rather, the investigation will revolve around whether the president explicitly authorized his top aides to use the technology to sign orders in his name or whether it was done without his consent.

Trump himself has acknowledged limited ceremonial use of the autopen. In March, he said, “We may use it, as an example, to send some young person a letter, because it's nice.”

Following his visit to the Capitol, Trump ramped up his interest even further in the retroactive investigation of Biden's autopen use, specifically as it relates to executive orders signed by Biden that he said led to “open borders.”

“Biden was not for open borders… They stole the presidency,” Trump posted to Truth Social. “This is TREASON at the highest level!”

Concerns over Biden's physical and mental state were intensified this week ahead of the release of Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, a book by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson, which reports that top aides worked to conceal Biden's deteriorating cognitive abilities from the public.

Biden announced Sunday that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which drew bipartisan well wishes for his health but sparked larger questions about how such an advanced disease could have progressed without his world-class doctors detecting it.

“I'm surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago because to get to [Gleason score grade] nine, that's a long time,” Trump said in response to a reporter's question Monday evening.

Trump's appointment of Martin to oversee the Office of the Pardon Attorney and the DOJ's Weaponization Working Group puts a key ally in position to examine Biden's clemency orders from inside the DOJ.

Martin, a former “Stop the Steal” organizer whose nomination to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia collapsed earlier this month, has vowed to scrutinize Biden's final actions in office.

“I do think the Biden pardons need some scrutiny,” Martin said at a press conference on May 13. “We want pardons to matter … to be accepted and to be something that's used correctly.”

With the power to review and document clemency decisions, and now tasked with investigating alleged political weaponization, Martin's dual roles could accelerate GOP efforts to determine whether the autopen was used legally, or as Republicans now claim, as a tool for bypassing presidential accountability.

OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The military rulers of Burkina Faso have turned to a man once known as “Africa's Che Guevara” as a way to rally a country struggling to defeat extremists and turning away from former Western allies.

Hundreds of young people gathered over the weekend in the capital, Ouagadougou, for the opening of a mausoleum for legendary leader Thomas Sankara.

“I'm the driver of the revolution!” one young man exclaimed with delight, sitting behind the wheel of the jeep that Sankara used during his presidency decades ago.

A charismatic Marxist leader who seized global attention by defiantly declaring his country could rely on itself, Sankara came to power in 1983 at the age of 33 after he and former ally Blaise Compaore led a leftist coup that overthrew a moderate military faction. But in 1987, Compaore turned on his former friend in a coup that killed Sankara in the capital — and later became president himself.

Nearly four decades after his death, Sankara is being celebrated in Burkina Faso, a nation of 23 million people once known for its bustling arts scene and vibrant intellectual life — including Sankara's anti-imperialist and pan-African legacy.

“When I stepped inside the mausoleum, I felt the revolution,” said Timoté, a 22-year-old who said he came because of what he heard about Sankara at home and at school.

Sankara's mausoleum, designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architect Francis Kéré, has been the project of current military leader Capt. Ibrahim Traore.




Since taking power during a coup in 2022, Traore has presented himself as the new Sankara. He has named one of the main streets after the revolutionary leader, elevated him to the rank of Hero of the Nation and revived revolutionary slogans such as “Fatherland or death, we will win!” in most of his speeches.

The mission of the mausoleum is “to keep the flame of the revolution alive and to remind the world of Capt. Thomas Sankara's fight to break the chains of slavery and imperialist domination,” Burkina Faso Prime Minister Jean Emmanuel Ouédraogo said as he read Traore's statement.

Despite promising to fight the security crisis that pushed them to stage a coup, Burkina Faso's military leaders have struggled to deal with the worsening crisis. According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive.

Human rights groups say the military leadership has installed a system of de facto censorship, crushing critics, while many have been killed by jihadi groups or government forces.

As people flocked to Ouagadougou to celebrate Sankara, life elsewhere in the country reflects a different reality.

“We can go out for a bit in the city center, but with caution,” said one student from Dori, the capital of the northern region, echoing concerns about restrictions on free speech and movement.

The student spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being arrested.

Security concerns have permeated every aspect of life outside Ouagadougou. Even the price of beer has skyrocketed as more places become inaccessible to traders.

“There are two Burkina Fasos,” said a teacher from the east, speaking on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. “One where the streets are deserted at night, and another that comes alive to enjoy the cool evening air.”

Awake Illinois founder Shannon Adcock joins 'America Reports' to discuss the debate over transgender athletes in girls' sports after female track runners were defeated by a biological male.

Former Chicago Bears star linebacker Brian Urlacher made his stance known on the issue of transgender athletes in women's and girls' sports as the debate creates a divide in the state where he made his reputation – Illinois. 

Urlacher shared his opinion on the issue during an interview on the "Global View" podcast on May 9 and questioned why it is even a debate in some circles.

"Why is it even a debate? A woman is a woman and a man is a man… you're born with what you're born with," Urlacher said.

Urlacher even referenced an ongoing controversy in Minnesota, where a transgender pitcher is currently dominating the girls' softball season. The trans athlete reportedly won 14 straight games heading into the playoffs and earned first-team All-State honors rocked the state in recent weeks. 

"It's just different because we are men, there are certain things we do better than women, and it's just, number one, it's not fair, and if I had a daughter who had to be forced to play against a man I would not be okay with it and I would raise hell about it," Urlacher said. 

"I just don't get it, it's a common sense thing, I just don't see how you can push this and make someone thing they're a different sex."

The Pro Football Hall of Famer praised President Donald Trump for signing the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order at the White House on Feb. 5. 

Illinois has become a hotbed of controversy over the issue of trans athlete inclusion in recent days after a biological male competed in a seventh-grade track meet against biological females at the Naper Prairie Conference Meet. 

The incident resulted in a Naperville 203 Community School District Board meeting descending into a heated debate over the issue on Monday.

Awake Illinois has filed a civil rights complaint against the district, with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights alleging a violation of Title IX.

They called on federal funds to be withheld from the district, which it says receives between $8 million and $9 million in federal grants annually. The complaint is part of a broader effort by Awake Illinois, which previously filed similar Title IX complaints against other districts and the Illinois State Board of Education.

Fox News' Caroline Elliott reports on the Venezuelan migrant's arrest on ‘Fox Report.'

A 24-year-old illegal immigrant from Venezuela was arrested in Perrysburg, Ohio, after he allegedly enrolled in a public high school using fraudulent documents.

Court records show that 24-year-old Anthony Emmanuel Labrador Sierra has been charged with forgery, and he is being held on $50,000 bond. The Perrysburg Police Department said it was contacted by the Perrysburg Local Schools on Monday about possible fraudulent activity involving one of its students.

After a preliminary investigation, a fraud case was established and handed over to the department's detectives for further investigation.

Detectives worked with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and it was discovered that Labrador was a 24-year-old from Venezuela.

Investigators also learned Labrador Sierra used fraudulent documents to enroll in Perrysburg Schools and was posing as a 16-year-old student.

Perrysburg School officials said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital that Labrador Sierra had been enrolled at Perrysburg High School under the name and age of a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor on Jan. 11, 2024, in accordance with federal and state requirements for enrolling students experiencing homelessness or without a legal guardian.

Between Jan. 11, 2024 and May 14, 2025, the school said Labrador Sierra obtained documentation and support, further complicating the situation. For instance, he obtained a state-issued driver's license, social security number and Temporary Protective Status (TPS) from U.S. Immigrations.

The school also said Labrador completed an application for a visa with help from Advocating Opportunities, which provides free legal assistance.

The Wood County Juvenile Court granted guardianship of Labrador Sierra to a Perrysburg family.

School officials said the guardians contacted the school on May 14 to report they had received information indicating Labrador Sierra was not a minor, but instead a 24-year-old man.

Labrador Sierra reportedly denied the allegation when district administrators met with him on May 15.

"Given the seriousness of the claim, Perrysburg Schools immediately directed the guardians to keep Labrador off school property while the matter was investigated further," the school said. "This case involves highly unusual and deceptive circumstances that impacted many local, state and federal agencies."

"The school district has reviewed its actions regarding enrollment and is confident proper legal channels were followed to provide support for an individual presenting themselves as an unaccompanied minor as spelled out in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act," the district added. "We appreciate our close partnership with the Perrysburg Police Division and the swift action taken."

The school also updated the statement, saying Labrador Sierra had been a member of the junior varsity soccer and swim teams, adding the situation has been reported to the Ohio High School Athletic Association.

Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, called the discovery and allegations "shocking."

Moreno shared a letter he sent to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel on X, writing, "Unreal. Thanks to Joe Biden's abuse of TPS, a 24-year-old illegal alien was caught on a fake asylum claim pretending to be a teenager at a high school in Ohio."

Moreno called on Noem and Patel to launch investigations immediately into the situation, asking them to take any and all lawful measures to enforce federal immigration and criminal laws against Labrador.

"That a 24-year-old alleged illegal alien adult male was permitted to attend an Ohio high school for nearly a year and a half under allegedly false documentation, including potentially false immigration documentation, is shocking to say the least," he wrote. "As you may recall, I called for the revocation of TPS Status on January 10, 2025. On February 5, 2025, you rightfully agreed with my request and decided to terminate TPS under the 2023 designation for Venezuela. However, a federal judge in San Francisco ordered the Department of Homeland Security to continue TPS status for Venezuela.

"I vehemently disagree with this dangerous decision," Moreno continued. "If the arrestee was granted TPS status, it is imperative for me to know when they were granted such status and the vetting that was conducted on the arrestee."

Labrador Sierra was ultimately taken into custody during a traffic stop on Interstate 75 on Tuesday afternoon.

DHS told Fox News they have located Labrador Sierra's information under a different spelling of his name. They added that Labrador Sierra is a visa overstay who first came to the U.S. in 2019. DHS also confirmed Labrador has received TPS.

Labrador is being held in the Wood County Jail on $50,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear in court on May 29.

Scrutiny over former President Joe Biden's decline is already testing 2028 hopefuls, particularly those who were involved in his administration.

The announcement that Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer on Sunday came amid a fresh reckoning in the party over the former president's mental acuity and whether he should have withdrawn from the presidential race earlier last year. Possible 2028 contenders have largely avoided addressing Biden's condition in office or whether Democrats should have pushed harder for him to step aside sooner.

“Democrats testing the water may not have been forced to answer Biden health questions in the past, but they certainly will now,” said a national Democrat involved with major fundraising efforts, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

During the 2024 campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris publicly supported Biden. In an interview with ABC News in January 2024, Harris described Biden as “extraordinarily smart,” highlighting his ability to anticipate challenges and his extensive experience in leadership roles.

In response to special counsel Robert Hur's report in February 2024 that described Biden as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” Harris called the characterization “gratuitous, inaccurate, and inappropriate,” defending Biden's capabilities.

Even after Biden's difficult debate performance in June 2024, Harris acknowledged that it was “not his finest hour” but emphasized during remarks to a small group of donors in San Francisco that the outcome of the election should not be decided by a single moment.

Following Biden's withdrawal from the race and subsequent endorsement of Harris, she continued to face questions about his day-to-day performance. Her campaign spokesperson reaffirmed her complete confidence in Biden's stamina and mental clarity to manage both domestic and international challenges in October 2024.

According to new reporting in Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, a pivotal moment unfolded during a 9/11 commemoration in Pennsylvania when Biden briefly wore a “Trump 2024” hat after engaging with pro-Trump attendees. This incident raised serious doubts about Biden's judgment for Harris, leading her campaign to distance itself from joint public appearances with the president.

Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist based in New York, said he believes that 2028 hopefuls who served in the Biden administration believe they lacked the usual access to the president due to an unusual, deliberate effort to keep him separated from his Cabinet.

“There's certainly credibility to them saying, ‘We didn't know, we didn't have the access to him,' that, in normal times, a Cabinet would have to its chief executive,” Reinish said. “It does seem that there was a concerted effort to keep them separated.”

At a nearly 90-minute veterans event in Iowa last week, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg mentioned his former boss just once.

Speaking to reporters in Cedar Rapids, Buttigieg said that whenever he needed support from Biden, “I got it.” He noted that their closest collaboration came in the aftermath of last year's catastrophic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.

“I will tell you the same president the world saw addressing that was the president I was in the Oval [Office] with, insisting that we do good and do right by Baltimore, and that is characteristic of my experience with him,” Buttigieg said.

When asked if the Democratic Party might have been better off had Biden chosen not to run for a second term, Buttigieg responded, “Maybe.”

“Right now, with the benefit of hindsight, most people would agree that is the case,” he said. “We also are not in a position to wallow in hindsight. We have to get ready for some fundamental tests for the future of this country and this party.”

The comments mark a shift from the 2024 presidential campaign, when Buttigieg was a loyal advocate for the president, regularly defending his leadership and capacity to serve.

The anonymous national Democrat with experience running presidential campaigns believes it would be best to “start from scratch.”

“There was a lot of gaslighting that went on during the 2024 cycle, and anyone who was potentially complicit in that is not going to be viewed kindly,” the person said. “It could definitely be a drag on certain candidates who were connected to the administration,” such as Harris and Buttigieg.

Reinish argued that in a crowded 2028 field, candidates with less baggage will have an advantage, especially those who can avoid being dragged into questions about what they knew and when regarding Biden's condition.

“It's going to be a very crowded field, and I think that the less baggage you have, the better off these candidates will be,” he said. “That's not a way to start a conversation for 2028 with the American people. So that is going to be something that they're all going to have to navigate.”

Several possible 2028 candidates have begun openly questioning Biden's fitness for office, despite the risk of being labeled hypocrites for previously supporting him. This week alone, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) acknowledged Biden's mental decline. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) argued that Biden never should have sought a second term. Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), once a vice presidential prospect for Harris, recently put distance between himself and Biden, maintaining he privately raised concerns with the former president at the moment.

“I can tell you that I was very frank with the president during his campaign about what I saw were some of the shortcomings,” Shapiro said in an interview with Politico. “I was very honest with him in a private setting about that.”

However, a Democratic strategist with presidential campaign experience dismissed concerns that candidates closely associated with Biden would be harmed by revelations about his health.

BIDEN'S CANCER DIAGNOSIS FUELS FRESH DOUBTS AND DISTRUST AMONG DEMOCRATS

“If you're going to win an election in 2028, voters have to think three things: One, you have a plan for the future, two, you are authentic, and three, they believe what you say, and if you can click those three boxes, that is what you have to do,” the strategist said.

“Whether they are forced to talk about Joe Biden or talk about something else — if they do it in a way that hits all three of those things, they'll be in a good spot. The election is too far out to really say, because in three years, who knows what the world will be like?”

As a former college football coach for 40 years, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of college sports in shaping young lives. From the locker room to the classroom, athletics instill discipline, teamwork and resilience — values that extend far beyond the field. But ever since the Supreme Court ruled that college athletes can be compensated for the use of their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL), college sports have been in a tailspin.  

While I'm all for players making money, we need to create national standards to protect the integrity of college sports. Because there are no national rules for NIL contracts, every state has passed its own laws. This patchwork of laws has created an uneven playing field and given some universities advantages over their competitors.  

We now have pay-to-play as bidding wars for recruits are starting in middle and high school. This is not to mention the transfer portal, which has become a revolving door with student-athletes jumping from school to school in pursuit of more money.  

TRUMP CONSIDERING EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REGULATE NIL AFTER MEETING WITH NICK SABAN: REPORT

For example, the men's basketball teams at Kentucky, Duke and the University of North Carolina are preparing for their entire rosters to change in the upcoming 2025-26 season. This is not only bad for team culture, it's also having negative impacts on the student-athletes' educations, which is what college athletics is supposed to be all about.

I've been working to try to address these issues since I got to the Senate in 2021. Last Congress, West Virginia Independent Senator Joe Manchin and I introduced the "Protecting Athletes, Schools, and Sports Act" (PASS Act). This bipartisan legislation would establish a national standard for NIL contracts, ensuring consistency and fairness across all institutions.  

The PASS Act would also require universities to honor the original scholarship made to student-athletes, regardless of their NIL deal status, and provide stability by moderating eligibility for the transfer portal.

Importantly, this was not just our bill — we worked with student athletes, coaches, athletics directors and parents to draft it. Unfortunately, Democrats, who had the majority at the time, refused to bring the bill to the floor for a vote.  

SEN TUBERVILLE PREVIEWS NIL MEETING WITH TRUMP, SAYS DEMOCRATS 'DON'T CARE' ABOUT COLLEGE SPORTS

Thankfully, President Donald Trump — a notorious sports fan — is looking to get involved. A few weeks ago, I had the chance to talk to him about our fight to preserve college sports while on Air Force One headed to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was particularly focused on protecting women's and Olympic sports, which are sadly in danger of being eliminated at some schools who don't have enough money to play players.  

He was also focused on preserving education, ensuring antitrust protections are in place, and protecting women's and Olympic sports, which are sadly being eliminated at some schools that don't have enough money to pay players. In typical Trump fashion, he sprang into action.  

Following our conversation, the White House began exploring ways, ranging from an executive order to a federal commission, to address the most pressing issues within college athletics. By hearing from key stakeholders, including my friends former Coach Nick Saban from Alabama and former NFL player and Chairman of the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System Cody Campbell, the Trump administration is working to gather possible solutions that address the complexities of NIL and its impact on college sports.

Regardless of which path Trump chooses to address the current state of college sports, I'm confident that his administration — which has already proven to be both effective and unafraid to shake up the status quo — can make meaningful reforms to make sure college sports remain intact. 

NCAA POWER FOUR COMMISSIONERS SAY THEY 'NEED HELP FROM CONGRESS' TO REGULATE NIL, TRANSFER PORTAL

Meanwhile, I'll continue to work with my colleagues to hopefully draft legislation that could pass both chambers. The challenges facing college sports today are formidable, but not insurmountable. With President Trump's leadership and a unified approach, we can navigate this new era while preserving the integrity and spirit of collegiate athletics.

            The US has been talking with Hamas through an American intermediary in Doha this week in hopes of brokering an Israel-Gaza ceasefire agreement, according to a source familiar with the matter, as US officials say President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with Israel's handling of the conflict.
    


            The talks have been led on the US side by Bishara Bahbah, the American-Palestinian who led the group “Arab Americans for Trump” during the 2024 presidential campaign and who has been working on behalf of the administration, the source said.
    


            Bahbah remotely exchanged messages with Hamas earlier this year in what became a critical backchannel to secure Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, the source said.
    


            Israel also began indirect talks with Hamas in the Qatari capital on Saturday, and working level dialogue continues. But bolstering the line between the Trump administration and Hamas could give US officials a clearer sense of Hamas's position, particularly as Trump's frustrations have mounted. In the past, the US has gone through Qatar and Egypt to correspond with Hamas.
    


            “It tells me that they think they have a real negotiation happening. They want their own Hamas channel, not through Qatar or Egypt. That is an indicator that they think they can cut through the issues more effectively and also that they think they can influence Hamas,” said Dennis Ross, a former US envoy to the Middle East who is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
    


            But some other regional experts are skeptical that this channel could lead to a breakthrough, given that Bahbah has limited experience and the Hamas decision makers are based in Gaza. But they argue it underscores that Trump is willing to work around Israel.
    


            “I am not sure if this is a sign of desperation or confusion,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Maybe they see him as a window into Hamas thinking, it is certainly plausible.”
    


            The growing frustrations among Trump and his top aides with Israel boil down to a key issue: the president wants the war to end – and soon. Trump, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, has been “annoyed” on several occasions with the pace of talks.
    


            And Netanyahu, they fear, is not ready to deal.
    


            “The president obviously wants a deal,” a person close to Trump told CNN. “It's becoming more clear as talks continue that Bibi isn't quite there.”
    


            With Israel launching renewed strikes in Gaza, Vice President JD Vance opted not to visit the country over the weekend following his trip to Italy – a decision sources said was driven in part by logistics, and in part because his presence could have been viewed as a dramatic endorsement of the attacks.
    


            “It would be hard to view the US as truly independent if he had gone,” the official added, calling it “an overly generous signal of support for what Israel is doing.”
    


            Axios first reported on Trump's frustrations and the reasoning behind Vance's decision to skip a stop in Israel.
    


            The sources cautioned that  Trump's frustrations do not amount to a change in posture in the United States' support of Israel, a country which the president continues to view as one of America's strongest allies. Nor is Trump privately pressuring Israel to halt its renewed military operation in the Gaza strip, said a source familiar with the matter.
    


            National Security Council Spokesman Max Bluestein argued in a statement to CNN that it “is absolutely false” that the administration is frustrated with Israel.
    


            “Israel has had no better friend than President Trump. We continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure that remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and that every opportunity for regional economic prosperity – especially the expansion of the Abraham Accords – is exploited. As Secretary [Marco] Rubio explained over the weekend, ‘What the President is saying is he doesn't want to end the war until Hamas is defeated,'” Bluestein said.
    


            Trump has shown a willingness to approach US foreign policy moves without direct adherence to Israel in recent months, including the announcement of a ceasefire with the Houthis – that did not include strikes on Israel and continued Iran deal talks while Israel has pushed for strikes on Iran's nuclear program.
    


            “There is a litany of actions lately reflecting that Trump will do what he thinks is in the US interest and Israeli considerations aren't foremost in his mind. It's not reflecting a break necessarily with Israel but it's an effort to put energy into US interests,” Ross said.
    


            Keeping US interests front and center – especially efforts that Trump wants to pursue in the region more broadly – the administration remains focused on trying to secure a Gaza ceasefire.
    


            Bahbah has been coordinating his efforts with Steve Witkoff, the president's Middle East envoy who has also been directly in touch with Netanyahu and his aides. Witkoff recently put forward a new proposal to both Israel and Hamas that could serve as the foundation to getting both sides to agree to another ceasefire, Trump administration officials said.
    


            One of the officials said that the US wants humanitarian aid to continue flowing into Gaza, something the Israelis acquiesced to on Sunday after blocking aid into the strip for nearly 11 weeks.
    


            Israel “can achieve their objective of defeating Hamas while still allowing aid to enter in sufficient quantities,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday.
    


            “You have this acute, immediate challenge of food and aid not reaching people, and you have existing distribution systems that could get them there,” Rubio told the Senate Appropriations Committee.
    


            Asked if it is an emergency humanitarian situation, Rubio conceded it is.
    


            “Ultimately, I think we all see the same images,” he said.
    


            The Trump administration was also pleased with how the talks with Hamas to release Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, unfolded in recent weeks. Instead of shutting down the channel between Hamas and Bahbah, they elevated it, signing off on in-person talks in Doha.
    


            “His release was widely viewed internally as a goodwill gesture,” a White House official told CNN, adding that they saw the move as a key opportunity to draw Israel and Hamas back to the negotiating table.
    


            But just days later, Israeli military forces moved into northern and southern Gaza as part of the “Gideon's Chariots” operation, which Israel warned would take place if Hamas did not agree to a deal to release hostages. The fresh attacks did little to reassure US officials that a potential ceasefire deal was on the horizon.
    


            But Trump's frustrations with Netanyahu began even before the war took another deadly turn this week, the sources familiar with the matter said. One such instance was when the Israeli Prime Minister met privately with the president's then-National Security Adviser, Michael Waltz, at the White House to discuss military options against Iran prior to a scheduled meeting in the Oval Office with Trump.
    


            The meeting, first reported by the Washington Post, has been cited as a key point of Trump's frustration with Waltz, who was later ousted from his position. But a source familiar with the matter said Trump also took issue with Netanyahu potentially trying to influence Waltz on a sensitive topic before raising it with Trump directly.

The artificial intelligence boom has sent energy demand soaring. Some of the supercomputers sucking up all that power are helping to find new energy sources.

Fusion energy is the process of forcing two hydrogen atoms to combine and form one helium atom, which releases huge amounts of power. It uses a stellarator, a type of fusion reactor invented in the 1950's that produces heat. 

Until now, the technology was too difficult to deploy commercially.

But this old concept has brand new potential. Type One Energy, a startup based in Tennessee, claims to have proven that fusion energy will be able to produce electricity in the next decade.

"It's going to create heat that's going to boil water, make steam, run a turbine and put fusion electrons on the power grid on a 24/7 reliable basis," said Type One Christofer Mowry.

AI has made it all practical. 

"Things have really accelerated remarkably over the last five or six years," Mowry said. "The supercomputers have allowed industry, academia and large institutions to develop now and actually test at large scale the science machines that demonstrate the process." 

Dozens of other companies are working on different approaches to fusion energy, but Mowry said Type One is so far the only one with the proven stellarator technology to implement at existing power plants. It will soon be tested with the Tennessee Valley Authority.

TDK Ventures is betting that Mowry is right. 

"With Type One Energy solutions, we expect outsized return potential," said Nicola Sauvage, president of TDK Ventures. "Fusion is no longer science fiction, and Type One Energy's technology is catching up fast to the vision of this low-cost, continuous green energy." 

Type One is also backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Centaurus Capital, GD1, Foxglove Capital, and SeaX Ventures, and has raised a total of $82.4 million.

Fusion energy is different from nuclear power, and there's no risk of a nuclear accident. The power source has no long-term radioactive waste, and, according to Mowry, can't be weaponized. 

But for handling AI, it could be a critical solution. Fusion energy can be deployed anywhere, whether it's next to a data center or near a large industrial park that needs clean, reliable energy.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Wednesday that the company hasn't seen any signs of consumers tightening their wallets in the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.

Jassy's comments came during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, which was held virtually on Wednesday.

"We have not seen any attenuation of demand at this point," Jassy said during a question-and-answer portion of the meeting. "We also haven't yet seen any meaningful average selling price increases."

Amazon and other retailers continue to digest the impact of Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Amazon pointed to "tariffs and trade policies" as one of several factors that could make its guidance for the current quarter subject to change.

Rival retailer Walmart warned last week that consumers could start seeing price hikes from tariffs later this month and in June. Within days, that sparked the ire of Trump, who urged the company to "EAT THE TARIFFS."

Target said Wednesday it will likely need to hike prices on some items, while Home Depot said it expects to maintain its current pricing levels.

Amazon faces significant exposure to the levies through its retail unit, which sources some goods from tariff-hit China. Jassy said last month the company made some "strategic forward inventory buys" to stock up on goods and is "pretty maniacally focused" on keeping prices low for shoppers.

Some third-party sellers, which account for roughly 60% of products sold, have increased prices on certain items, while others have opted to keep prices steady, Jassy said Wednesday.

"I think that the diversity and the size of our marketplace really helps customers have the best selection of the best prices," Jassy said.

Before the Q-and-A portion, Amazon investors listened to eight outside proposals addressing the company's emissions reporting, warehouse working conditions and the climate impact of its data centers, among others.

All of the resolutions, which Amazon recommended investors vote against, were rejected. Vote totals are expected to be released soon after the meeting.

OpenAI:

OpenAI will acquire the AI device startup co-founded by Apple Inc. veteran Jony Ive in a nearly $6.5 billion all-stock deal, joining forces with the legendary designer to make a push into hardware.

The purchase — the largest in OpenAI's history — will provide the company with a dedicated unit for developing AI-powered devices. Acquiring the secretive startup, named io, also will secure the services of Ive and other former Apple designers who were behind iconic products such as the iPhone.

OpenAI said on Wednesday that it's buying Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for about $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal that includes its current stake in the company.

Ive is taking on "deep creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and io," OpenAI said in a statement. The company said that io is merging with OpenAI, while Ive and his "creative collective" called LoveFrom will stay independent.

In a blog post on Wednesday from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive, the pair said that io was founded a year ago by Ive, along with Apple alumni Scott Cannon, Tang Tan and Evans Hankey, who briefly took over Ive's role at Apple after he departed.

"The io team, focused on developing products that inspire, empower and enable, will now merge with OpenAI to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco," the post said.

The purchase is by far OpenAI's largest and comes weeks after the company agreed to buy AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3 billion. Prior to that, OpenAI acquired analytics database company Rockset for an undisclosed sum in 2024.

Ive announced in 2019 that he was leaving Apple, where he was the longtime chief design officer, to start LoveFrom. The New York Times reported last year that LoveFrom's clients pay the firm up to $200 million a year and that its designers at the time were working on projects for Christie's, Airbnb and Ferrarri.

Airbnb said in 2020 that Ive was consulting with the company on hiring and future products.

Ive is responsible for designing Apple's most iconic products, including the iPod, iPhone, iPad and MacBook Air. He also helped design Apple's new Cupertino headquarters, called Apple Park, a project that began in 2004 with the campus officially opening in 2019.

News of the acquisition comes as OpenAI, which was recently valued at $300 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank, is rushing to stay ahead in the generative AI race, where competitors including Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI are investing heavily and regularly rolling out new products. Part of staying ahead in that race includes shoring up its hardware operations.

To further its hardware ambitions, OpenAI hired the former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses initiative in November to lead its robotics and consumer hardware efforts. Caitlin "CK" Kalinowski wrote in an announcement at the time that the role would "initially focus on OpenAI's robotics work and partnerships to help bring AI into the physical world and unlock its benefits for humanity."

Also late last year, OpenAI invested in Physical Intelligence, a robot startup based in San Francisco, which raised $400 million at a $2.4 billion post-money valuation. Other investors included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Thrive Capital, Lux Capital and Bond Capital.

The startup focuses on "bringing general-purpose AI into the physical world," per its website, and it aims to do this by developing large-scale artificial intelligence models and algorithms to power robots.

Microsoft said Wednesday that it broke down the Lumma Stealer malware project with the help of law enforcement officials across the globe.The tech giant said in a blog post that its digital crimes unit discovered over 394,000 Windows computers were infected by the Lumma malware worldwide between March 16 through May 16. The Lumma malware was a favorite hacking tool used by bad actors, Microsoft said in the post. Hackers used the malware to steal passwords, credit cards, bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.

Microsoft said its digital crimes unit was able to dismantle the web domains underpinning Lumma's infrastructure with the help of a court order from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.

The U.S. Department of Justice then took control of Lumma's "central command structure" and squashed the online marketplaces where bad actors purchased the malware.

The cybercrime control center of Japan "facilitated the suspension of locally based Lumma infrastructure," the blog post said.

"Working with law enforcement and industry partners, we have severed communications between the malicious tool and victims," Microsoft said in the post. "Moreover, more than 1,300 domains seized by or transferred to Microsoft, including 300 domains actioned by law enforcement with the support of Europol, will be redirected to Microsoft sinkholes."

Microsoft said that other tech companies like Cloudflare, Bitsight and Lumen also helped break down the Lumma malware ecosystem.

Hackers have been buying the Lumma malware via underground online forums since at least 2022, all while developers were "continually improving its capabilities," the blog post said. 

The malware has become the "go-to tool for cybercriminals and online threat actors" because it's easy to spread and break through some security defenses with the right programming, the company said.

In one example of how criminals used Lumma, Microsoft pointed to a March 2025 phishing campaign in which bad actors misled people into believing they were part of the Booking.com online travel service. 

These cyber criminals used the Lumma malware to carry out their financial crimes in this scheme, the company said.

Additionally, Microsoft said that hackers have used the Lumma to attack online gaming communities and education systems, while other cybersecurity companies have noted that the malware has been used in cyber attacks targeting manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other related critical infrastructure.

A tax package House Republicans may pass as soon as this week would kill a slew of consumer tax breaks tied to clean energy, as currently drafted. If it becomes law, households interested in the tax breaks may have to rush to claim them this year, experts said.

Tax breaks on the chopping block include ones for consumers who buy or lease electric vehicles, and others for households that make their homes more energy-efficient.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which made historic investments to combat climate change, created or enhanced those tax breaks.

Most would be terminated after 2025, about seven years earlier than under current law.

"Based on the existing proposed language, if you've been considering an EV or planning to get one, now is the time to do it," Alexia Melendez Martineau, senior policy manager at Plug In America, wrote in an e-mail.

Consumers who buy a new EV can claim a tax break worth up to $7,500. One for used EVs is worth up to $4,000. Car dealers can also pass along a $7,500 credit to consumers who lease an electric vehicle.

The House tax proposal would terminate these tax credits after 2025. The Inflation Reduction Act made them available through 2032.

A "special rule" would keep the $7,500 credit in place for some new EVs for an additional year, through 2026. However, it would only be available for new vehicles from automakers that haven't yet sold 200,000 EVs. That would disqualify EVs from companies like General Motors (GM), Tesla (TSLA) and Toyota (TM).

About 7.5% of all new-vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025 were EVs, an increase from 7% a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. Tax credits for EVs have been available in some form since 2008, when George W. Bush approved them.

The Inflation Reduction Act made it easier for consumers to access the EV credit, by allowing dealers to issue the tax break to consumers upfront at the point of sale instead of waiting until tax season. Consumers who buy an EV in the near term would be wise to pick this option, experts said.

"We recommend taking the upfront rebate at the dealership, as it reduces the price you pay now and shifts liability to the dealer to manage getting the credit from the IRS," Martineau said.

House Republicans also aim to axe various tax breaks tied to making existing homes more energy-efficient.

These breaks defray the cost of projects like installing insulation, solar panels, heat pumps, and installing energy-efficient windows and doors, for example.

One — the energy efficient home improvement credit, also known as the 25C credit — is worth up to 30% of the cost of a qualifying project. Taxpayers can claim up to $3,200 per year on their tax returns, with the overall dollar amount tied to specific projects.

Another — the residential clean energy credit, or the 25D credit — is also worth 30% of qualifying project costs. It doesn't have an annual or lifetime dollar, except for certain limits on fuel cells, according to the IRS.

They are currently available through 2032. (The 25D credit phases down to 26% for installations in 2033 and 22% for those in 2034.)

Both tax credits would be repealed after 2025 under the House bill.

The 25C and 25D credits have been available in some form since 1978 and 2005, respectively, according to economists at the Haas Energy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.

More than 3.4 million U.S. households claimed one of the credits in 2023, receiving more than $8 billion, according to the Treasury Department.

Experts recommend that consumers considering a home-efficiency project have it completed by year's end to be able to claim a tax credit.

"If a homeowner was looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit, under what is being proposed [by the House] they'd need to ensure their system was put in service this year," said Kara Saul Rinaldi, president and CEO of AnnDyl Policy Group, an energy and environmental policy strategy firm.

Republicans are eyeing the climate tax breaks as a way to raise money for a sprawling package that also extends measures from President Trump's 2017 tax law and cuts taxes on overtime and tips, for example.

The House tax plan's repeal or modification of clean energy credits — including those for EVs and home efficiency — would raise $707 billion over a decade, according to an analysis published Monday by the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

As drafted, the overall House bill would raise the U.S. deficit by a net $3.3 trillion over a decade, after accounting for spending cuts, Penn Wharton said.

Of course, the tax bill's text may change.

There appears to be dissent from within House Republican ranks over various aspects of the bill. Some of the infighting is tied to the repeal of climate related tax breaks, which have been more popular among consumers than anticipated.

The Senate also needs to pass the measure before it heads to the president's desk.

"Republicans are far from united, with deficit hawks pushing for greater deficit reduction, centrists objecting to steep welfare cuts and blue-state Republicans fighting for bigger State and Local Tax (SALT) exemptions," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note on Tuesday.

The Senate this week unanimously passed the No Tax on Tips Act in a surprise vote, which could boost momentum for an idea floated by President Donald Trump during his 2024 campaign. 

If enacted, the legislation would create a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000 per year, with some limitations. The tax break applies to workers who typically receive cash tips reported to their employer for payroll tax withholdings, according to a summary of the bill, which was passed by the Senate on Tuesday. 

To qualify for the deduction, there's a $160,000 earnings limit for 2025. That limit would be indexed for inflation yearly.

Currently, workers who receive cash tips of $20 or more monthly must report those earnings to employers, according to the IRS. Cash tips can include funds received directly from customers, tip-sharing from other employees or tips paid via credit card.

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris both called for no tax on tips during appearances in Nevada.

The bill advanced by the House Ways and Means Committee last week also includes a no tax on tips provision. If enacted, workers could deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028. Tips must be reported to qualify for the deduction. However, this could still change before the full House floor vote.

"Whether it passes free-standing or as part of the bigger bill, one way or another, no tax on tips is going to become law and give real relief to hard-working Americans," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., said from the Senate floor on Tuesday. 

Cruz introduced the bipartisan bill in January with Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada.

In 2023, there were roughly 4 million U.S. workers in tipped occupations, representing 2.5% of all employment, according to estimates from The Budget Lab at Yale University.

"This is a very narrow subset of the workforce," said Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation. 

Tipped occupations include jobs in restaurants and hotels, as well as courier services like taxis, ride-shares and food delivery services, he said.

What's more, a good chunk of tipped workers are part-time employees, and they wouldn't see a significant benefit from a tip exemption, he said. Many such workers already don't pay federal income tax because their earnings fall under the standard deduction.

"For the lowest income tipped workers, it provides no marginal benefit" Muresianu said. "It would benefit moderate to middle income workers substantially."

A no tax on tips policy could create several issues, Muresianu said.

For example, there could be the introduction of tips in new occupations, or a shift in compensation in already tipped occupations toward a greater reliance on tips. It's also possible that income could be misclassified as tips to take advantage of the tax benefit, he said.

"It's tough to model or project because tipping is a social behavior, not strictly an economic transaction," Muresianu said.

From a general economic standpoint, it doesn't make sense to treat one type of income earned in specific industries differently than another type of income, he said. Take, for example, a waitress and a retail cashier: Both earn $35,000, but the waitress makes $10,000 in tips, which would be tax exempt.

"Why does the cashier pay full income tax on her income but the waitress gets a very substantial tax exemption?" he said. "That clearly violates some principle of fairness."

Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high on Wednesday, breaking its January record.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 2% at $108,955.10, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $109,500.

The flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 2% at $108,955.10, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, bitcoin rose as high as $109,857, surpassing its January record. At one point, bitcoin had erased its gains , after Treasury yields spiked and stocks fell to session lows.

"Bitcoin's new high has been concocted by an array of favorable ingredients in the macro cauldron, namely softer U.S. inflation numbers, a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has put the spotlight on alternative stores of value like bitcoin," said Antoni Trenchev, cofounder of crypto exchange Nexo.

"We've entered an alternate universe very different from early April when global macro concerns were at their peak and bitcoin slumped to $74,000," he added. "It's possible a three-month window has opened for risk assets to thrive as a broader agreement between the U.S. and China is thrashed out."

After languishing for several weeks amid tariff-related uncertainty, bitcoin's price has been steadily climbing in May, up 15% for the month. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion last week and have seen just two days of outflows in May, according to SoSoValue. The cryptocurrency has benefited from both liquidity in the stock market giving a boost to risk assets, as well as recent risk-off scenarios related to concerns about tariffs and deficits in the U.S. that have driven gains in gold as well as bitcoin.

On-chain data also shows lower selling pressure as indicated by bitcoin inflows into exchanges and increased liquidity in the crypto market as measured by new records of the amount of Tether stablecoin USDT, a gauge of crypto market liquidity, sitting on exchanges, according to CryptoQuant.

Investors have been expecting upcoming catalysts, including regulatory updates as well as corporate treasury investments, to drive bitcoin prices higher. Since the beginning of the year, the number of bitcoin held by public companies has grown 31% to about $349 billion, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. That comprises 15% of the total bitcoin supply.

Earlier this week, the Senate voted to advance legislation that would create the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for stablecoins, a key sector of the crypto market. President Donald Trump has said he wants to see crypto regulation on his desk and ready to sign by August before Congress is in recess.

Also this month, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, which Wall Street has praised as a watershed moment for the crypto industry.

Meta is expanding the ranks of its lowest-rated employees in their midyear performance reviews, months after it laid off nearly 4,000 employees whom it labeled low performers.

It's telling managers to put more employees in its "below expectations" tier, the lowest performance bucket, during this year's midyear performance reviews, according to a memo shared on Meta's internal forum on May 14, which was viewed by Business Insider. For teams of 150 or more, Meta wants managers to put 15% to 20% of employees in the bottom bucket compared with 12% to 15% last year.

The expanded range includes employees who have already left the company as part of "nonregrettable attrition," Meta's term for staff considered noncritical to operations, including those who resigned or were dismissed for underperformance.

The midyear performance review process is "an opportunity to make exit decisions," the memo said. It added that "there will be no company-wide performance terminations, unlike earlier this year," and that leaders are expected to manage the performance of their reports.

Managers can select employees for performance cuts based on criteria including a "below expectations" rating in their midyear review, if they were formally disciplined within the past six months, or if they had an "employee relations" case in the first quarter. Those cases are when an employee was on a plan to manage their performance.

The review process is set to begin on June 16, and conversations between managers and employees on performance are scheduled for between July and August.

The change comes just months after Meta laid off nearly 4,000 employees — about 5% of its workforce — over their performance. Internal documents seen by BI earlier this year suggested such layoffs could become an annual fixture, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling staff he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and move faster to "move out low-performers."

Meta declined to comment.

The new midyear targets echo a move Meta made at the end of 2022, when it roughly doubled the share of employees placed in its lowest performance categories during annual reviews. At the time, managers were instructed to classify up to 16.5% of staff as underperformers, up from the previous range of 7% to 12%.

As with the current midyear cycle, that figure included employees already marked for nonregrettable attrition. The company also told managers to be more rigorous when evaluating employees on the borderline between performance tiers.

The repeated tightening of performance review criteria underscores Meta's effort to reshape its workforce following years of overhiring. Meta executives have increasingly used performance management as a mechanism to streamline teams and cut costs. Meta's human resources leaders have emphasized a need to "move faster" in managing out underperformers so that new, stronger talent could be brought in.

Meta's move mirrors a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are sharpening their focus on performance, while doubling down on artificial intelligence investments. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it would cut about 6,000 roles — roughly 3% of its global workforce — in an effort to trim layers of middle management and boost the ratio of coders to noncoders on projects. At Google, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees late last year that the company had reduced its top management ranks by 10% as part of an efficiency push.

Major airline CEOs on Wednesday called on Congress to approve billions of dollars in funding to modernize the United States' aging air traffic control system, saying it is "failing Americans."

The Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control network's woes have been years in the making. But a rush of high-profile mishaps, near-misses and a deadly January crash involving an American Airlines regional jet caused public alarm and prompted new calls for action.

In a joint letter, the airline executives cited recent failures involving Newark Airport and said the FAA's technology "is wildly out of date."

"Aviation remains the safest mode of transportation in the U.S., but for it to remain so, serious upgrades need to happen now," said the letter, citing a 2023 independent review that raised safety concerns.

The executives called for urgent action as the busy summer travel season begins with the Memorial Day holiday this weekend.

The FAA on Tuesday predicted a record number of Memorial Day holiday flights despite imposing temporary flight cuts at Newark due to runway construction, technology issues and persistent air traffic control staffing shortages.

The letter was signed by the heads of American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Alaska Airlines, Atlas Air, trade group Airlines for America and senior executives at FedEx and UPS.

Airlines and others this month called for at least $31 billion in spending on air traffic reform.

The U.S. House is considering legislation that includes an initial $12.5 billion for air traffic control reform efforts.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wants billions of dollars to replace outdated radar and telecommunications systems, air traffic control towers and other facilities and increase air traffic control staffing.

The FAA wants funding for new radios, network connections and to replace 618 radars, install anti-collision tarmac technology at 200 airports, build six new air traffic control centers and expand its ADS-B network of real-time aircraft traffic information.

The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels.

TikTok Shop employees in the US are bracing for layoffs after the company told staffers to work from home Wednesday ahead of "organizational and personnel changes," per a memo viewed by Business Insider.

The moves are expected to impact employees who work in US operations and global key accounts, a team that works with large brands.

The company said it was making the changes after "careful analysis of how to create more efficient operating models for the team's long-term growth," according to the memo, which was sent by Mu Qing, an e-commerce executive.

Employees began receiving emails that their roles were affected on Wednesday morning.

BI was not able to determine the number of employees affected by the changes. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg earlier reported on the memo.

TikTok's US e-commerce business has been off to a rocky start this year, as sales have slumped amid global tariffs and broader economic uncertainty. Employees previously told BI that daily US sales from foreign sellers, many based in China, where tariffs skyrocketed in April, contributed to a broader sales drop-off on the platform starting in late March.

TikTok's coming personnel changes follow a round of job cuts in April when it restructured its e-commerce governance and experience team, BI previously reported.

TikTok Shop's growth in the US is a big priority at ByteDance, which sees hundreds of billions in annual sales on its Chinese sister app, Douyin. But even before its more recent sales slump, the US e-commerce business failed to meet many of its performance goals in 2024, company leaders told staffers during a February all-hands.

Over the past year and a half, TikTok has shaken up its leadership structure across the company, giving greater oversight to some Chinese and Singaporean leaders in departments including Shop.

TikTok's US future is up in the air, subject to the outcome of a divest-or-ban law that requires ByteDance to give up majority ownership of its US app.

TikTok has until June 19 to find a new owner, though President Donald Trump may extend that deadline. During a recent press appearance, he said he had a warm spot in his heart for TikTok.

In this article

Google on Tuesday announced that it's getting back into the smart glasses game, and co-founder Sergey Brin said that this time will be different. 

"I've learned a lot," Brin said Tuesday at a fireside chat during the annual Google I/O developer conference. 

His appearance came after Google announced a partnership with Warby Parker, which saw its stock rise more than 15% after the two companies said they plan to launch a series of smart glasses as soon as next year. The glasses will be built on top of Google's Android XR, an operating system for headset computers, and they'll include Google's Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control the wearable devices.

Brin's comments came in an impromptu appearance at a conference chat scheduled between Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and journalist Alex Kantrowitz about "the future of AI and its impact on our world." 

During the chat, Brin said that with the rise of generative artificial intelligence, Alphabet is able to revive the idea of Google Glass, the wearable devices the company launched in 2013 for $1,500. 

"I definitely feel like I made a lot of mistakes with Google Glass, I'll be honest," Brin said, adding that he is still a big believer in the glasses form factor. 

"And now it looks like normal glasses without that thing in front," he said, referring to the visible camera that existed on the corner of the original Google Glass prototype.

Brin attributed the failure of Google Glass in part to "a technology gap." Since 2013 when Google Glass was launched, the company has developed advanced AI technology that powers Gemini, its flagship AI product and a key component for users to control a wearable device.

"Now, in the AI world, the things these glasses can do to help you out without constantly distracting you — that capability is much higher," he said. 

Brin also said that during his first attempt at the Google Glass, he didn't know anything about supply chains and how to get the glasses to a reasonable price point.

The Google co-founder's comments come as companies race to compete for wearable glasses as a form factor for AI products. Meta partnered with EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban, to make smart glasses that have a camera for capturing photos and videos. Apple is reportedly working on smart glasses that use augmented reality.

Besides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Sony, Xreal and Magic Leap. Google's annual developer conference also included a number of updates to its AI products, including a new high-end subscription service called Google AI Ultra, which costs $249.99 per month.

Glass was first sold to developers and early adopters and gained popularity mostly among tech enthusiasts. Despite backing from Brin and fellow Google co-founder Larry Page, the Glass project never caught on as a mainstream product. The built-in camera led to fights over privacy, and the product became the butt of jokes on late-night television. The company tried to re-launch it as an "enterprise" product, but Google in 2023 announced that it would stop selling its Glass Enterprise smart glasses.

Brin on Tuesday joked about the infamous skydivers that introduced the glasses at Google I/O in 2012, which took place at San Francisco's Moscone Center. At the time, four Google employees skydived out of a plane, live streaming their jump through their Google Glasses.

"Honestly, it would have been even cooler here at Shoreline Amphitheater," Brin said, referring to the Mountain View, California, venue that's currently used by Google for the conference.

"But we should probably polish the product first," he said, which drew laughs from the audience. "Then we'll do a really cool demo. That's probably the smart move."

Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia has died at the age of 75 after a battle with esophageal cancer, his family said Wednesday.

"It is with immense sadness that we share that our devoted and loving father, husband, brother, friend, and public servant, Congressman Gerald E. Connolly, passed away peacefully at his home this morning surrounded by family," read a statement posted on Connolly's X account.

Connolly served as the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform until late last month, when he said he would step down because his cancer had returned.

Connolly had been elected to that leadership role in December over a challenge from progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., even after announcing his diagnosis a month earlier.

First elected to Congress in 2008, Connolly was known in the House for his fierce advocacy on behalf of the thousands of federal employees who live in his northern Virginia district.

A gregarious person, Connolly cultivated friendships on both sides of the aisle over more than 15 years in Congress.

On Wednesday morning, the House Rules Committee paused its contentious meeting on President Donald Trump's massive tax bill and held a moment of silence in Connolly's honor.

"To stop and say a prayer for his family, please take some time," Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., told members.

Connolly revealed in November that he had been diagnosed with throat cancer — a surprise, he said, because he was experiencing almost no symptoms.

He said he would immediately undergo chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and vowed to fight the disease "the only way I know how — with Irish fight and humor."

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said he was "heartbroken" over Connolly's loss.

"Gerry was a fighter. His sharp mind, boundless energy, and deep commitment to the people of Northern Virginia made him a force to be reckoned with, whether on the Fairfax Board of Supervisors or in Congress," Warner said in a statement.

"He met every challenge with tenacity and purpose, including his final battle with cancer, which he faced with courage, grace, and quiet dignity," the senator said.

"Gerry lived his life to give back to others and make our community better," his family's statement read.

"He looked out for the disadvantaged and voiceless. He always stood up for what is right and just. He was a skilled statesman on the international stage, an accomplished legislator in Congress, a visionary executive on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, a fierce defender of democracy, an environmental champion, and a mentor to so many."

A dinner on Thursday in Washington — billed as the “Most Exclusive Once in Lifetime Invitation” — is the latest and boldest spectacle Bill Zanker has launched for Donald Trump.

Since Zanker co-authored a 2007 book with Trump, they've had a number of splashy collaborations, including a crowdfunding site and a series of non-fungible tokens featuring superhero versions of Trump, with events for some of the largest holders at Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago.

Tesla's Cybertruck launched with some asterisks.

Owners technically weren't allowed to resell the vehicle for a year — Tesla said that if they did, it could sue for damages and blacklist the owner from buying future Teslas. Tesla also didn't offer Cybertruck trade-ins.

Now, more than a year and a half since the first Cybertrucks were delivered, the company is allowing owners to trade in the electric pickup for credit toward a new Tesla, offering a glimpse into its depreciation rate.

Two Cybertruck owners — one who owns the all-wheel-drive model and the other who has a top-of-the-line Cyberbeast variant — shared the estimated trade-in values that Tesla offered them after they requested a quote. Despite a difference in mileage of more than 10,000 miles, both vehicles showed a similar depreciation rate of about 37% to 38%.

The all-wheel-drive owner told BI he spent about $100,000 on the Cybertruck about a year ago, including add-ons. After driving 19,623 miles with the vehicle, his trade-in estimate came in at $63,100, a roughly 37% depreciation.

The Cyberbeast owner said he purchased the vehicle in September for about $118,000 plus tax, which took the total cost to roughly $127,000.

The owner received a trade-in estimate of $78,200, representing about a 38% decrease in value in eight months of ownership.

Tesla's trade-in estimates are just that — estimates. Tesla says in the fine print under the estimate that the value is "based on current market conditions and vehicle details" and that the estimate could differ from the final offer. In other words, the final amount Tesla is willing to credit to the owner could end up being less. The EV news website Electrek reported earlier on Tesla beginning to accept Cybertruck trade-ins.

Vehicles famously begin to depreciate as soon as owners drive them off the lot, but Tesla's trade-in estimates give a glimpse into how the company values used Cybertrucks at a time when some car dealers have shared struggles to sell used models.

The trade-in estimates shared with BI suggest the Cybertruck has a higher depreciation rate than the average vehicle. Kelley Blue Book estimates that new cars depreciate about 30% on average over the first two years and lose an added 8% to 12% each year after that.

But it's important to note that EVs tend to depreciate at a higher rate as used models have increasingly hit the market amid the EV buying slowdown in recent years. An iSeeCars study that analyzed more than 800,000 5-year-old used cars sold from March 2024 to February 2025 found that EVs lost the most value, depreciating 58.8% in five years.

The study found that trucks and hybrids retained the most value, with trucks losing 40.4% of their value in a five-year period. Still, the rates that Cybertruck owners shared appear steeper than similar models such as Rivian's all-electric 2023 R1T, which depreciated about 29% in the past two years, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Not all Tesla models depreciate at the same rate. While the iSeeCars study found that the Tesla Model S ranked among the top depreciating vehicles, with an average five-year depreciation rate of 65.2%, the Model 3 held the lowest five-year depreciation rate among EVs at 55.9%.

While depreciation rates can vary based on several factors, including market conditions and mileage, the Cybertruck's decline in value has come amid wider pressures on the brand.

With political backlash over Tesla CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the White House DOGE office, Cybertruck owners have faced harassment and vandalism. Some owners have expressed interest in selling their vehicles, with one telling BI earlier this year that he returned his Cybertruck soon after purchasing it because of concerns about his kids getting bullied.

Despite Musk saying Tesla had more than 1 million reservations prior to its release, a March recall filing disclosed that Tesla delivered fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks. BI also earlier reported that the automaker had scaled back Cybertruck production in recent months, dropping targets for several Cybertruck lines.

Hailey Bieber is done pretending that becoming a new mom is easy.

In an interview with Vogue published on Tuesday, the Rhode Skin founder spoke about her childbirth and postpartum experiences. In August, she welcomed her son, Jack Blues, with her husband, Justin Bieber.

Bieber told Vogue that she struggled with postpartum body dysmorphia after giving birth.

"When people talk about 'bouncing back' — ​back where, because my hips are wider, my boobs are actually bigger than they were before. They did not go back. And great, I'll take it, but it's not the same body that it was before," Bieber said.

She added that she fell into the cycle of looking up mean comments online about her appearance, only to end up feeling even worse about herself.

It took her some time to accept that her body wouldn't look how it used to, she said.

"You're not the same person that you were before. You change head to toe. And I think there was a minute where I kept really hyper-​fixating on getting back to what I was. And then I had to go through that acceptance of, I'm not going back. So it's really about how do I want to move forward? Who do I want to be?" Bieber said.

Her difficult postpartum journey was compounded by the internet rumours surrounding her marriage.

She said people speculating online that she was going through a divorce made it even worse. "I cannot even begin to explain it. It's a crazy life to live," she said.

"Being postpartum is the most sensitive time I've ever gone through in my life, and learning a new version of myself is very difficult," Bieber said.

Postpartum typically refers to the first six to eight weeks after giving birth. During that time, a lot changes in a woman's body. New moms might deal with things like breast engorgement or vaginal bleeding, and some also experience postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety.

Bieber isn't the only celebrity mom who has spoken about her postpartum experience.

Lindsay Lohan said in a March 2024 interview that she doesn't feel pressured to "snap back" to her old body after giving birth.

"I feel like everything always comes full circle again, so this is that moment, and this, too, shall pass," she said.

In a March interview, Ashley Tisdale said that welcoming her second child was a chance to experience motherhood again since she felt "robbed" of her first experience due to postpartum depression, or PPD.

A representative for Bieber did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Solaxy (SOLX), a project building a Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, has passed $38 million in raised funds, making it one of the largest meme coin presales of 2025.

With the Solana meme coin market cap valued at $12.8 billion, Solaxy enters a market that is showing no signs of slowing down. Yet Solana's rise has not been without friction, network congestion continues to plague the system during peak times. Solaxy aims to tackle this challenge head-on with its innovative solutions.

Currently priced at $0.001728 per token, SOLX increases in value with every new presale stage, giving early participants an edge before exchange listings go live.

With more users entering the Solana ecosystem, issues around network congestion and failed transactions are becoming increasingly evident. Solaxy aims to fix this issue with its upcoming Layer-2 scaling solution.

Instead of having every transaction processed on Solana's mainnet, Solaxy plans to execute most operations off the main chain. This offloading strategy enables transactions to be bundled together and settled later on Solana's base layer, helping minimize lag and reduce failure rates.

What makes Solaxy especially innovative is its customizable framework. Developers will be able to tailor dApps to suit their own unique needs, whether that's DeFi applications, NFT platforms, or high-traffic meme coin projects. This flexibility allows for broader use-case implementation beyond traditional blockchain limitations.

Solaxy is also expanding its ecosystem with Ethereum compatibility on the roadmap, setting the stage for potential cross-chain functionality and wider liquidity access.

On the tech front, the recent launch of Solaxy's testnet block explorer and bridge showcases its development transparency. Users can already view live testnet data, offering insight into how the full rollout may look.

ClayBro, a crypto analyst and YouTuber with over 136,000 subscribers, has recently shared his optimistic outlook on Solaxy. He notes that Layer-2 blockchain tokens historically tend to perform well in bullish markets, something the current $3.5 trillion crypto market landscape seems to support.

According to ClayBro, Solaxy's strength lies in its dual appeal: it offers both a strong meme coin narrative and genuine utility. He emphasizes that most of the project's impressive $38 million presale raise took place during Q1 2025, a period many viewed as volatile and uncertain.

This early traction is a strong indicator of investor confidence. As Solaxy prepares for broader adoption, ClayBro suggests that it could become a long-term player in the scaling solutions space, especially if it properly executes the current roadmap plans.

Solaxy is also gaining traction for its staking rewards. The project currently offers an impressive 107% APY (annual percentage yield), allowing SOLX holders to earn passive income by locking up their tokens.

At present, over 10.7 billion SOLX tokens have already been staked, a figure that continues to grow. As more tokens are committed to the staking pool, the APY is expected to decrease, creating an incentive for early adopters to lock in higher rates. This staking model not only encourages user engagement but also contributes to token scarcity and long-term ecosystem health.



Momentum behind the Solaxy presale shows no sign of slowing. With over $38 million raised, demand is surging as investors look to secure their SOLX holdings before the price increases in upcoming stages.

SOLX tokens are available for purchase through the official Solaxy presale website using ETH, USDT, BNB, or bank cards.

Additionally, buyers can access the token via the Best Wallet app, which is available on both Android and iOS platforms.

Between its upcoming Layer-2 rollout, strong analyst sentiment, and attractive staking incentives, Solaxy is positioning itself as a standout presale of 2025.

While no investment is without risk, Solaxy's development roadmap and community traction make it a project worth monitoring closely.

Sam Altman's blockchain project World Network has raised $135 million in a private token sale of its WLD token. 

The sale was to venture capital giants a16z and Bain Capital Crypto and will be used to fund network expansion, the team shared.

WLD is higher by 14% on the news.

The funding comes as the group behind the blockchain announced the project's in-app functionalities as well as the WLD token has become available as of earlier this month to U.S. users.

“To meet increasing demand for Orb-verified World IDs and support the expansion of the World network throughout the U.S. and beyond, World Assets, Ltd. (a subsidiary of the World Foundation) sold $135M of WLD at market prices to two of the project's earliest backers, Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto. The circulating supply of WLD has thus increased correspondingly,” the team wrote in a blog post.

The WLD token was created at launch in July 2023,  and it currently has a market capitalization of $1.87 billion and is up 55% in the last month, according to CoinMarketCap. WLD though is down roughly 75% from its all time high.

Until earlier this month, U.S. users were unable to use World's primary product, their orbs, a bowling ball-shaped device that scans a person's eyeballs to confirm their identity. Once they scan, users can access the World app and receive an airdrop of the WLD token, which can then be used in World's miniapps ecosystem. 

During the announcement earlier this month, Altman shared that the project hopes to have to give 180 million Americans access to Orbs, more than half the country's population, by the end of the year.

CoinMarketCap has unveiled its latest AI-powered assistant, CMC AI, that will serve up a set of predefined questions and answers on price movements, token fundamentals, and sentiment with a single click on all major token pages.

All you need to do is click on one of these questions to get a detailed analysis. This is a prime example of how AI agents and tech are shaping real-world experiences.

Keep reading to learn more about how this feature works and how it could simplify crypto investing for you. We'll also suggest a similar AI agent token (MIND of Pepe) you can invest in to make the most of the upcoming AI investment era.

The CMC AI interacts with a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI and feeds it a prompt that includes the latest price data of various tokens.

When you click on the pre-generated questions, you're essentially seeing the response generated by the LLM based on the prompt provided to it by CoinMarketCap.

Simply put, CoinMarketCap asks the LLM questions about a given token, and the responses are linked in the CMC AI section on the token's detail page.



For major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the answers are updated every 30 minutes. For other tokens, however, updates will roll out if the price moves more than 2% in an hour.

Our AI is purpose-built for crypto, trained on our extensive market data, and designed to surface insights when users need clarity about specific cryptocurrencies. – David Salamon, Chief Product Officer at CoinMarketCap.

The biggest benefit of CMC AI is that it reduces repeated search queries on these LLMs. For example, millions of investors would want to ask ChatGPT, ‘Why is the bitcoin price going up?'

This leads to a lot of API calls and LLM running costs. With CMC AI, such repeated requests can be eliminated, resulting in large-scale cost savings.

It's worth noting that CMC AI's initial rollout is only the first phase of CoinMarketCap's host of planned AI updates, which will gradually roll out throughout 2025.

Upcoming features include trending market data on the CoinMarketCap homepage, custom question answers with conversational AI LLM tools, and personalized answers based on your watchlist, portfolio, and investment interests.

This is only the beginning of how AI models and AI agents are going to change the future of cryptocurrency and the Web3 space.

AI agents are rapidly finding new applications and making their way into real-world scenarios. The AI agent market cap today stands at $7.22B, but it's expected to cross the $10B mark soon.

If you want to make the most of this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, we've got something perfect for you: MIND of Pepe ($MIND).

Don't mistake MIND of Pepe for just another AI assistant. It's a never-before-seen intelligent AI agent built from the ground up to identify the next cryptos to explode, i.e., cheap presale tokens poised for growth.

$MIND will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X. Unlike typical AI chatbots that feel sterile and boring to talk to, however, $MIND will serve up a user-friendly and context-aware tone, engaging crypto degens like never before.

We were blown away when we found out that MIND of Pepe has also been programmed to understand crypto-native lingo, prevalent memes, and the overall mindset of the crypto trading community.



Once it's gathered the crypto community's varying opinions on different tokens, $MIND will use its cutting-edge hive-mind analysis system to deliver actionable trading insights to its token holders.

It's worth noting that besides social sentiment, MIND of Pepe will also gather real-time on-chain activity and things like market data APIs to help it spot and connect everything relevant for the AI agent to offer good trading calls.

Buy Some $MIND Now

In addition to being fully autonomous, MIND of Pepe will also be self-evolving. According to its whitepaper, $MIND will eventually even be able to create its own tokens.

Seeing as $MIND will have access to CoinMarketCap, DexScreener, and Solana-specific metrics (like token creation, wallet activity, and early LP behavior), there's really no arguing that $MIND's own tokens could very well be in a pole position to become the next top trending cryptos.

The most significant piece of information we could give you today is that every single benefit related to MIND of Pepe will only be available to holders of the $MIND presale token.

Luckily for you, the project is still in its presale. It's gaining more and more attention and has raised nearly $10M in early investor funding, which is a testament to its revolutionary powers.



Each token is currently available for just $0.0037515, but interested investors should really hurry up because the presale will end in less than 10 days from now.

Our MIND of Pepe's price prediction found it could easily be the next crypto to explode. According to our research, $MIND could reach $0.030 by the end of 2030. If this holds true, you could see a nearly 800x return on your investment.

If this is your first time joining a crypto presale, here's a detailed guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe.

Bitcoin BTC$106,546.31 became the world's fifth-largest asset after hitting a new all-time high on Wednesday, which pushed its market cap to $2.16 trillion.

Though the crypto's price consolidated lower after hitting a high of $109,400, its market cap passed Amazon (AMZN), which stands at $2.15 trillion.

Bitcoin is up 16.44% year-to-date while shares of the online retailer are down about 8% over the same period. It is currently trading at $108,954.

Gold is the largest asset, by far, standing at a $22 trillion market cap, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) which stand at $3.1 trillion to $3.4 trillion respectively.

As a result of the surge in bitcoin's price since the win of U.S. President Donald Trump, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently became the fifth-largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) by inflows this year as it took in roughly $9 billion from investors, according to data from Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

The cruel truth about the video game industry is that there are simply too many releases trying to grab the audience's attention. With an ever-growing timeline of titles, spanning back further and further, it seems that some real gems may fall through the cracks. That's natural, considering it takes longer to play a game than it might to watch a movie or binge a TV show. This type of interactive entertainment benefits tremendously from word of mouth, though, with players passing their recommendations on to each other, in the hope that a game might find its footing when that effect begins to snowball.

Of course, for those games that span back much further, fans need to listen to the experts. Luckily, one well-respected critic and video game developer has pointed audiences in the direction of Ico, a fantastic game from 2001 which still hasn't garnered the attention that it so sorely deserves. So, this is a good opportunity to dive into why Hideo Kojima recommended this old-school title at all and how it has actually gone on to influence the video game industry in general. Because this was a game that carried such quality, it inspired a whole generation of developers, with a studio set up in its honor. Ico might not be overly easy to find and play today, considering it was launched on the PlayStation 2, but retro gamers should absolutely hunt out this lost icon.

Hideo Kojima, known for his work on Death Stranding, Metal Gear Solid, and Snatcher, has created quite the reputation. Because gamers and movie buffs alike look to the creator for his opinion on just about anything. His film reviews have become the stuff of legend at this point, with Kojima refusing to say anything at all about the movies he feels fail to live up to expectations. But if the developer gets behind a film, like Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, then the world is going to know about it.

Well, back in 2001, Hideo Kojima got behind a video game that would soon fade into the history books, despite his love for the title. The game, as established, was Ico, and Hideo Kojima has named it as one of the greatest games ever made. In fact, Kojima was so heavily influenced by the title that he claims that it has actually impacted his own work, citing that the visuals in games like Metal Gear Solid directly draw from this gameplay experience.

And he's not the only one to do so. Several other creators have also shared in this adulation for Ico and its visual palette, which is cinematically rich and always focused on narrative above all else. Ico has shaped a whole generation of designers, but it also had a profound impact on the team that worked on the game.

Metal Gear Solid was a genre-defying work of video game artistry, and it still holds up as the most game-changing entry in Konami's iconic franchise.

The game was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, a company that would eventually go on to host the studio known as Team Ico, which worked on Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian. The studio was full of like-minded geniuses, all content to continue experimenting within their small area of the industry. A few notable names worked on Ico, including director Fumito Ueda, who also directed on Team Ico's two other notable releases, and producer Kenji Kaido, who also worked on the Tomba! and the Ape Escape series, among others.

Famous composer Michiru Ōshima put together the score for the game, having established himself in anime and on games like Legend of Legaia, and eventually The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. The title's voice acting cast further elevated the piece, with Kazuhiro Shindō appearing as Ico, Rieko Takahashi starring as Yorda, and Misa Watanabe playing the Queen. The team behind Ico is essentially full of significant talents who prove that they are so much more than the sum of their parts when they are brought together. Perhaps that's why Ico had such an effect on so many other storytellers. Because it was a showcase piece of what the best are capable of when collaborating.

So, Hideo Kojima might have had some fond words to say about Ico, and the team behind the hit is of great value, but what about the forgotten PlayStation 2 game actually made it such a must-play experience? Well, Ico began with a stunning premise that saw players take control of the titular boy, after he is taken away to be sacrificed by a group of warriors. It's a haunting start, but one that allows Ico to escape and battle back in a heroic display. While exploring the castle he has been abducted to, Ico finds a girl called Yorda, who is also imprisoned here and somehow connected to the fortress itself.

With unexplainable powers and a good heart, Yorda proves to be the perfect ally, as the duo maintains their distance from the ominous Queen. When it's revealed that the Queen won't let them escape because she believes she can live out a new life within Yorda, her supposed daughter, Ico, is forced to finally confront the forces of evil head-on. It's a story dripping in tension and drama, but one that also possesses real heart as Ico and Yorda build their bonds in the most difficult of situations. Narratively, this is a standout piece of work, but the development team always supported that storytelling with their own expert mechanics and visuals.

Hideo Kojima shared some thoughts about being a creative online, and it has some fans wondering about his future in games.

Graphically, Ico wasn't breaking any new ground, especially when relying on the technology of the PlayStation 2. But there's real scope and ambition to the castle players explore, and a sense of world-building whenever a new area is accessed. This always felt like a real, breathing world, where everything has a purpose. That's further supported by the character models and asset designs, with NPCs packing personality, and weapons and other background objects always taking on a slightly stylized aesthetic. The true strength of this title is its cinematic lighting, which adds grandeur to every scene, especially with complex key frame animation.

Ico also relied upon classic platform level design, with intriguing puzzles to solve, and a third-person camera rig that always moved in unexpected ways. With minimal dialogue throughout, the action had to do so much of the talking, and Yorda and Ico's relationship is thus further built by how the player must help Yorda navigate the castle via the gameplay mechanics. What's especially fascinating is that the player is therefore constantly defending Yorda from the enemy, too, with the combat elements focused on that dynamic. Some versions of the game even provide a 2-player option, which reinvents the experience all over again.

Ico's legacy is one of risk-taking and looking for ways to add wrinkles to a genre that perhaps had been seen a little too often. It excels in its mission, and it's no wonder that so many creatives feel that the legacy of the game is so powerful. Indeed, all of those who were influenced by the title are still adding to Ico's fingerprint, its very DNA is changing by how the industry is still influenced by it. Unfortunately, Ico was never a commercial hit, with the difficult PlayStation 2 game overlooked even at the time of its release. But the critics always smiled down upon its inventive spirit.

The use of bloom lighting also changed the industry, with the effect becoming a more standard inclusion after what Ico achieved. It wasn't that surprising that, after so many had said such good things about Ico, the game would be revisited in an HD remaster that could truly advance those visuals. In 2011, 10 years on from its release, an HD version of Ico was released on the PlayStation 3; a version of the game that should be a lot more accessible for modern audiences. The game soon also became available on the PlayStation Vita, albeit with a couple of adjustments.

The production of Metal Gear Solid almost came to a screeching halt.

As of this writing, there do not appear to be any plans to return to Ico again, either for a full-on remake or a sequel. However, PlayStation has been particularly interested in its own history as of late, and perhaps Ico's role in that will be recognized again, despite it never quite forming the connection with audiences that developers hoped it would be able to cement. But players who are interested in the legacy of this title, its impact on the industry, and why it came to have such an effect on creators like Hideo Kojima should know that this title deserves a moment of their time. It has, without a doubt, one of the most moving finales to any video game, resulting in a truly satisfying encounter.

Microsoft has made some baffling choices with the Xbox brand in recent times, potentially signifying the end of the console that once challenged Sony.

Some classic Mario Kart tracks, including Mario Kart 64's Yoshi Valley and Rainbow Road, are better in newer Mario Kart games.

Forza Horizon and Saints Row are some of the best Xbox 360 games that are stuck on that console.

Franchises like Final Fantasy and even Pokémon are stepping away from turn-based combat, but new games are stepping in to fill the void.

Some classic Sega Dreamcast games, including Sonic Adventure and Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers, are actually not that great.

Key points:

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.

Ethereum trades above its cost basis

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether's ETHUSD price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.

This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher. 

ETH holders returning to profit after unrealized losses “provides meaningful financial relief for many holders, signaling a bullish outlook,” Glassnode explained in its latest report.

Historically, during the early phase of a rally, holders in profit provided upward momentum by holding firm and attracting new investors. 

Further analysis of the cost basis of active market participants indicated the “strength of this upward move” as the price moved above its True Market Mean, or the Active-Investor Price, at $2,400. This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. 

As Cointelegraph reported, holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest.

Despite Ether's recent outperformance, Glassnode analysts noted that the Active Realized Price still sits overhead around $2,900 and remains a key level that must be “decisively reclaimed to support continued improvement in investor confidence” in the altcoin.

The market intelligence firm added:

Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades also said that ETH price must “convincingly break” out of the $2,400-$2,600 range before rising higher to confront high-timeframe resistance between $2,800 and $2,850. 



2.27 million ETH at $2,800 could trigger a sell-off

According to Ether's cost basis distribution data, investors hold approximately 2.27 million ETH at an average cost basis of $2,767, creating a potential resistance zone. This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Ether's upward momentum.

From a technical perspective, ETH must flip the $3,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs above $4,000.

But first, the ETHUSD pair must close above the $2,600-$2,800 range, where the 100-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) currently sit. ETH price dropped below this level in February, driven by risk-off sentiment following Trump's tariff measures. 

​​One positive catalyst for the bulls could be continued demand from spot Ethereum ETFs. Ether ETFs registered $100.7 million in net inflows in the last three days, per Farside Investors' data.

Meanwhile, the bears will attempt to keep the $2,600 resistance in place to increase the likelihood of pulling the price lower. The immediate target is below the $2,400 level, or the 200-day SMA.

Below $2,400, the next key area of interest remains between $2,200 and the psychological level at $2,000. Reaching $1,800 would erase all the gains made after the Pectra upgrade.

 Bitcoin has set a new all-time high just nine days after the US and China closed a 90-day trade agreement, easing economic uncertainty and market jitters. 

Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high after a temporary trade agreement between the United States and China eased macroeconomic fears and boosted investor confidence. 

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%.

The 90-day tariff suspension and the cooperative tone in negotiations removed the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which had a significant impact on risk appetite among traditional and cryptocurrency investors, Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph.

US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs were seen as the biggest macroeconomic threat to traditional equities and cryptocurrency markets in 2025.

Bitcoin briefly fell to a year-to-date low of $74,434 on April 7, five days after Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, sending shockwaves across global markets, with the S&P 500 losing more than $5 trillion in value, its largest drop to date.

Bitcoin started its recovery on April 9 after Trump's Liberation Day marked the “climax of uncertainty” for market participants, Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph at the time.

Bitcoin kicked off May with a “near-flawless setup, catalyzed by a rare alignment of geopolitical de-escalation, improving regulatory optics and macroeconomic tailwinds,” according to Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex exchange.

“The Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks have defused one of the primary geopolitical volatility engines of the past two years,” Kooner told Cointelegraph, adding:

The capital rotation reflects a “maturing narrative” as “Bitcoin is no longer just a fear hedge — it's increasingly a high-conviction risk asset in periods of macro stability,” Kooner said.

Russia and Ukraine “will immediately start negotiations towards a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” Trump said in a May 19 X post, summarizing his two-hour call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Still, funding rates need to remain neutral and open interest stable for a “consecutive setup” that may ignite a Bitcoin rally to above $114,000 to $120,000, which may be catalyzed by any “macro or regulatory spark,” Kooner said.

Other analysts have predicted a Bitcoin rally to above $130,000 before the end of 2025, based on BTC's close correlation with the global money supply.

The increasing money supply may push Bitcoin's price above $132,000 before the end of the year, as investor demand is driven by the growing fiat money debasement, predicted Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision.

 The GENIUS Act would legitimize stablecoins for institutional adoption and set a precedent for other global jurisdictions, according to the managing partner of DWF Labs. 

Stablecoin adoption among institutions could surge as the United States Senate prepares to debate a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating the sector.  

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.

The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

“This act doesn't just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.

“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That's what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding:

The GENIUS Act may be the “first step” toward establishing a “unified digital financial system which is borderless, programmable and efficient,” Grachev said, adding:

Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a co-sponsor of the bill, also pointed to Memorial Day as a “fair target” for its potential passage.  

Grachev said regulatory clarity alone will not drive institutional adoption. Products offering stable and predictable yield will also be necessary. Falcon Finance is currently developing a synthetic yield-bearing dollar product designed for this market, he noted.

Yield-bearing stablecoins now represent 4.5% of the total stablecoin market after rising to $11 billion in total circulation, Cointelegraph reported on May 21.

Despite broad support for the GENIUS Act, some critics say the legislation does not go far enough. Vugar Usi Zade, the chief operating officer at Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph that “the bill doesn't fully address offshore stablecoin issuers like Tether, which continue to play an outsized role in global liquidity.”

He added that US-based issuers will now face “steeper costs,” likely accelerating consolidation across the market and favoring well-resourced players that can meet the new thresholds.

Still, Zade acknowledged that the legislation could bring greater “stability” to regulated offerings, depending on how it is ultimately worded and enforced.

Sangha Renewables, a bitcoin BTC$106,546.31 mining firm that aims to enable renewable energy companies to mine bitcoin, broke ground Wednesday on its flagship 19.9 megawatt (MW) solar facility in West Texas.

“We have been extremely pleased with the development so far,” Spencer Marr, the firm's president, told CoinDesk in a statement. “We made the decision to use our own funds to buy long lead time electrical infrastructure last November, even prior to the deal closing, to ensure we could be mining as soon as possible, and that has paid off.”

“We also have a great team of partners and suppliers, including CSD Energy, EcoDigital, Moonshot Electrical, Fusion Industries, Greenhash and Pro Mining Solutions that have all pitched in to make this a success,” Marr added.

Whereas most mining companies focus on acquiring mining rigs and seeking the cheapest electricity contracts possible to produce bitcoin, Sangha's approach is markedly different: to convince large renewable energy companies to incorporate bitcoin mining into their own business models.

The pitch is simple. Green energy projects often suffer from a mismatch in production and demand. A wind farm, for example, may generate a lot of electricity on a windy night — right when everyone is asleep and consumption is lowest. Instead of selling that surplus electricity at a loss, the affected company could potentially switch on bitcoin mining machines and turn a profit.

The West Texas project is Sangha's pilot program. For now, Sangha itself owns the miner through a series of subsidiaries, and purchases electricity from the energy company, though the energy company may eventually integrate the operation.

The project is expected to generate $42 million in revenue in the first 12 months and mine roughly 900 bitcoin over the next 10 years. It will have access to electricity for anywhere between 2.8 cents and 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour on a 30-year lease, meaning that investors will be able to acquire bitcoin at a 25% to 50% discount.

Construction is projected to close in the second half of July, though unforeseen events may push that back a month, Marr said. Bitcoin mining should begin soon as construction is complete.

“We expect to commission the project over the summer and use that time to iron out any initial kinks,” Marr said. “We purposely ordered 2% more ASICs than we needed to give us a margin of error for faulty machines.”

With $14 million raised so far through equity — partially thanks to Plural Energy, which enables mid-sized renewable energy projects to raise funds from investors on-chain — Sangha has secured 82% of its $17 million equity round target for the West Texas project.

“By the fall, we expect to be a well-oiled machine and to be utilizing Plural Energy's smart contract capabilities to stream distributions to our equity investors, who are excited by the idea of receiving distributions natively in bitcoin,” Marr said.

Russia's Ministry of Justice has drafted a bill that would formally treat digital currencies, like Bitcoin, as property that can be seized and confiscated in criminal investigations, as announced by Vadim Fedorov, Russian Deputy Minister of Justice, during a legal forum focused on the challenges posed by new technologies.

The bill, first reported by TASS, would allow law enforcement to seize physical devices, such as hardware wallets or storage drives, that contain access to digital currencies. It would also enable investigators to request court orders to block crypto transactions.

“It [the bill] proposes special requirements to ensure the security of such assets — depending on the specific characteristics of the digital currency, an investigator would be able to seize a physical device containing access codes or request a court-imposed ban on transactions,” Fedorov said.

The proposed legislation is part of the Russian government's effort to modernize its criminal justice tools in response to the growing role of digital assets in financial crime.

Fedorov said that authorities aim to close legal loopholes that currently make it difficult for law enforcement to deal with crypto assets involved in crime.

Recognizing the technical complexity of handling crypto, the bill calls for the involvement of specialists who can determine how best to secure digital assets while ensuring they remain intact for future confiscation or victim compensation.

The bill is under preparation for a first reading in the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.

There's been a flurry of activity in the crypto markets over the past several hours as US President Donald Trump pushes Congress to pass his ‘big, beautiful' bill. When signed into law, it could continue to propel both Bitcoin ($BTC) and the best altcoins forward.

In a statement on Monday, the White House urged Trump's Republican party mates in Congress ‘to immediately pass the landmark bill.'

However, it has received pushback from moderate Republicans, especially as the bill will introduce massive cuts to Medicaid coverage and food assistance.

Despite that, $BTC has already shown a positive reaction to this news as it continues to stay solid above the $105K mark and inch closer to its all-time high of $109K.

According to data from CoinGecko, the world's largest cryptocurrency increased by 1.6% over the past 24 hours and a whopping 22% over the past 30 days.



Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun announced on X yesterday that he's the top holder of Donald Trump's $TRUMP cryptocurrency and has earned an invitation to the president's gala dinner on Thursday.

Sun, who is also the founder of the Tron Foundation, holds $18.6M worth of $TRUMP.



The ‘official meme coin' of POTUS, $TRUMP has raised eyebrows for its potential for corruption and foreign influence.

Despite concerns, 220 of its biggest holders, many of them top players in crypto, will have the privilege to sit down with Trump for dinner, with the 25 holders getting a VIP reception.

News of Bitcoin's surge, the imminent ‘Big, Beautiful Bill', and Trump's meme coin dinner tomorrow have already had a cascading effect on the world of altcoins.

While it's not exactly a buyer's market, there are still several attractive tokens to be had at a great discount. Let's take a look at some of the best today.

Solaxy ($SOLX) is gearing up to become the first-ever Solana Layer 2 blockchain. Once launched, it will address common issues with Solana, such as network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability.

Aside from unleashing Solana's potential, Solaxy's modular infrastructure will empower developers to create customized dApps at scale.



Solaxy has made a name for itself as one of the best presales this year, having raised over $38.4M since its launch. But it'll be over in less than 26 days, so grab your $SOLX tokens for a low $0.00173, while you can.

$SOLX tokens are available at the Solaxy presale page. To get yours, connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet, enter the number of tokens you wish to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto.

If you prefer, you can also stake your tokens immediately after buying. Doing so lets you earn passive rewards in exchange for supporting the project in its early stage.

For more detailed information, you can check out our Solaxy buying guide. You can also read the Solaxy whitepaper for more information, or follow Solaxy on X or subscribe to its Telegram channel for the latest news.

With Bitcoin's continued rise, it's unsurprising that related projects are also gaining traction. Take BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). This crypto project's premise is simple: earn free $BTC airdrops when the #1 cryptocurrency hits $150K and $200K.



You'll also get free $BTCBULL airdrops when $BTC reaches the $250K mark, as well as regular $BTCBULL airdrops at $BTC's $125K, $175K, and $225K price milestones.

To enjoy these perks, you only need to hold the project's native $BTCBULL token in Best Wallet. You can currently get them via the BTC Bull Token presale page. It's currently priced at $0.00252, but a price increase is coming in a few hours, so it's best to buy them while they're at their cheapest.

Just like Solaxy, you can stake the tokens you purchased during the BTC Bull Token presale. The rewards rate is currently at 68% p.a., but you can expect this to change over time as more investors stake their tokens.

Overall, HODLing is a good strategy, not only for the airdrops, but also as $BTCBULL is expected to grow expontenially in the coming years. 

The BTC Bull Token whitepaper has all the information you need about the project. You can also follow the team on X or subscribe to Telegram for up-to-date news.

Created by the Justin Sun-backed Tron Foundation, the Tron blockchain is pushing to decentralize more of the internet and its infrastructure. As a smart contract platform, it provides speed, scalability, and high availability for dApps on its blockchain.



Powering this platform is its native token $TRX. It's already available on major centralized exchanges (CEXs), including Binance and HTX.

While the token is trading below 37% of its all-time high of $0.415590, it's seen gains over the past 24 hours,  likely down to Sun's Trump gala announcement. During the same period, the token has also seen trading volumes over $965M.

To learn more about TRON, you can visit its official website.

There's no telling when the current altcoin bull run will end, but it's smart to gather while the pickings are still plentiful and cheap. We're liking the sound of Solaxy ($SOLX) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) right now.

As top trending crypto presales, they offer plenty of growth potential, especially if you join in this early stage. Investing early also provides higher staking APYs, which makes for an even more compelling case if you want to earn passive rewards.

But before you invest, make sure you do your own research. Only use the information in this article for educational purposes and not as investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes at around $106,400 at the time of writing on Wednesday, just 3% shy of its record peak. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) hold strong above their key support levels.  The crypto market appears to be in a wait-and-see mode, with traders closely watching whether BTC can break into uncharted territory and if ETH and XRP can maintain their respective support zones to fuel potential rebounds.

Bitcoin price broke above its $105,000 resistance level on Sunday and retested, finding support around this level the previous day. On Tuesday, it again retested this support level and rose slightly. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it stabilizes at around $106,700.

If the $105,000 remains strong, BTC could extend the rally toward the all-time high of $109,588 set on January 20.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 71, pointing upward above its overbought level of 70, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, traders should be cautious as the chances of a pullback are high due to its overbought condition. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is coiling together, indicating indecisiveness among traders. 

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC faces a pullback and closes below $105,000, it could extend the decline to retest its psychological level at $100,000.

Ethereum price has retested and found support around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $2,441 since Sunday and hovered around it the next two days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues at around $2,500.

If the 200-day EMA remains strong and gains momentum, ETH could extend the rally to retest its key psychological level at $3,000.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 69, pointing upward toward its overbought levels of 70, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, caution is warranted due to overbought signals suggesting potential for a pullback. Another possibility is that the RSI remains above its overbought level of 70 and continues its upward trend.

ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH closes below its 200-day EMA at $2,441, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychological level at $2,000.

XRP price rebounded after retesting its 50-day EMA at $2.28 on Saturday and rose 3.18% the next day. However, on Monday, it declined and remained above the 50-day EMA level until the next day. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to hover above this level.

If XRP breaks and closes below its 50-day EMA on a daily basis, it could extend the correction toward its next key support at $2.23.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 52, pointing toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bullish momentum. If the RSI moves below its neutral level of 50, it would give rise to strong bearish momentum and a sharp fall in XRP prices. The MACD indicator also switches to a bearish crossover on the daily chart on Monday, giving sell signals and indicating weakness.

XRP/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if the 50-day EMA holds as support, XRP could trigger a rally to retest its $2.72 resistance level.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

XRP's drop from recent highs of $2.65 on May 12 tests the 50-day EMA support as downside risks emerge. XRP faces declining network activity amid subdued daily active addresses.

Bitcoin price stabilizes above $106,000 on Wednesday, just 3% shy of its all-time high at $109,588. BTC's open interest hits a new all-time high of $75.14 billion, mirroring the setup of previous bullish cycles.

Privacy-focused Monero is back in the spotlight, surging near 30% in May to $362. Monero's price increase reflects rising interest in privacy-focused crypto, driven by growing surveillance and regulatory scrutiny concerns.

PEPE price jumps over 5% on Wednesday after rebounding from a key support level the previous day. On-chain data shows rising open interest and a flip to positive funding rates, signaling strong bullish sentiment.

Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes at around $103,000 when writing on Friday, after facing multiple rejections at the key $105,000 resistance level throughout the week.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.

While Bitcoin BTC/USD trades near its all time high price, Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of ZigChain, believes that the broader crypto market is primed for a shift.

What Happened: In an interview with Benzinga, Gadit argued that investors should prepare for a strong rotation into altcoins as macroeconomic pressures ease and interest rates begin to fall.

He also named decentralized finance and tokenization as the most undervalued sectors in crypto, citing their real-world utility and long-term growth potential.

"Eighty to ninety percent of tokens are down, but Bitcoin has skewed the entire market perception," Gadit said. "Once rate cuts begin and inflation stabilizes, money will flow to other assets as well." 

While he acknowledged the dominance of Bitcoin in attracting institutional capital, Gadit insisted that altcoins tied to productive use cases will be the next to gain traction.

Trending: Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

Bullish On Tokenization And DeFi

Gadit is particularly optimistic about the future of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). 

He believes that bringing traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, private credit, and equities onto blockchain rails will drive the next wave of crypto adoption.

"The DeFi sector overall, especially tokenization, is pretty much undervalued right now," he said. "If a real use case of AI or tokenization can lower the operational costs of blockchain, it could be massively disruptive."

ZigChain is currently working with Zamanat, a Sharia-compliant RWA tokenization platform, to tokenize $2.5 billion worth of real estate in Dubai over the next three years. 

"Think of a $15 million family office that usually can't access private credit deals with high entry minimums. Through tokenization, even those chunks can be broken down into $1,000 units and accessed globally," he said.

Retail Inclusion And Infrastructure Investment

While other platforms like Ondo Finance ONDO/USD focus on institutions, ZigChain is betting on retail adoption. 

Gadit emphasized that ZigChain is building an all-in-one infrastructure layer that enables tokenized assets, stablecoins, and DeFi products to co-exist seamlessly. 

"The end user should not even feel that they are working on a blockchain," he said.

Gadit also disclosed that ZigChain is investing in acquiring a fund tokenization license from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), viewing this as a key milestone in legitimizing tokenized asset offerings. 

Markets expect rate cuts — but your earnings don't have to suffer. Lock in 7.2% until 2028 from ten individual bonds.

"That license alone shows how serious we are. Most serious tokenization players won't even launch their own token for the next five years—they're focused on infrastructure," he noted.

From Bitcoin To Altcoins: Institutional Appetite Matures

Despite ongoing regulatory shifts and geopolitical uncertainty, Gadit is confident that institutional interest in crypto is accelerating. 

"Every day in Dubai, I meet someone from a large family office or desk who's looking to enter crypto," he said. "It always starts with Bitcoin, but eventually they begin to explore other tokens and asset classes."

He added that this institutional behavior, especially after spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, has helped Bitcoin maintain its strength above $100,000. 

However, Gadit expects a shift: "Barring any black swan events, I think my thesis for the next 12 to 24 months is that the market will do well, and altcoins will catch up."

In terms of specific sectors, Gadit highlighted three areas with high long-term potential: Layer-1 blockchains with real use cases, exchange tokens, and tokenized assets. "DEX tokens like Uniswap and Radium will benefit as volumes shift to decentralized trading venues. 

Exchanges, whether Bitget or Binance, are just buy-and-hold bets for me," he added.

Crypto Investing Is Maturing

Gadit believes the market is becoming more disciplined in how it evaluates crypto projects. 

"Gone are the days when you could raise money on promises alone," he said. "Now, revenue and user adoption are the key metrics. Token price is no longer enough."

He noted that many high-profile protocols have underperformed due to inflated valuations and poorly designed tokenomics. "It's the fault of the cap table. When investors are already 10x up at launch, you're racing to the bottom."

Even with ongoing hype cycles, whether around AI or other narratives, Gadit believes real utility will win out. "We use AI internally to reduce costs and increase margin, but we don't shout about it. The projects that quietly solve real problems will be the ones that last."

Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke transferred approximately $262 million worth of ETH to a wallet labeled as a Kraken deposit address on May 20, according to on-chain data. 

The transfer of 105,736 ETH emptied nearly all of Wilcke's holdings, leaving just 268.73 ETH in his wallet. Subsequent withdrawals from the exchange suggest that this could be Wilcke dividing his holdings into different wallets.

According to Lookonchain, a few minutes after his deposit, eight different addresses withdrew the equivalent of $262 million in ETH from Kraken. This is the first time Wilcke has made a substantial transfer to an exchange since moving $147 million in four transactions last year.

Despite the movement's scale, Ethereum's price remained relatively stable. As of press time, ETH was trading at $2,493, down 0.17% over the past 24 hours, largely in line with broader market performance.

Notably, Ethereum has shown strong performance in the past 30 days, climbing 72% from the lows recorded earlier this year to a high of $2,737.17 on May 13.

Ethereum transfers conducted by major figures associated with the protocol and the Ethereum Foundation (EF) often lead to scrutiny within the community. 

On Aug. 23, 2024, the EF transferred $94 million worth of ETH to Kraken. The move raised concerns among community members, prompting explanations from EF contributor Josh Spark and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said the transfer aimed to support organizations contributing to Ethereum's development.

Subsequent Ethereum Foundation transactions continued into early 2025, with the foundation selling 300 ETH in January alone, totaling roughly $981,200.

The community questioned whether the foundation should stake its holdings rather than liquidate them. In response, Buterin stated that legal risks and the possibility of contentious protocol upgrades had dissuaded the EF from staking at scale. 

However, the foundation began allocating funds to decentralized finance platforms in February to generate yield. 

The EF deposited 30,800 ETH, worth about $82 million, into Aave's lending markets. Spark received an additional deposit of 10,000 ETH, and Compound received 4,200 ETH. Analyst Tom Wan estimated a 1.5% annual yield potential from these movements, equating to a gain of roughly $1.5 million based on current prices.

Rutgers University-New Brunswick researchers have discovered a new class of materials -- called intercrystals -- with unique electronic properties that could power future technologies.

Intercrystals exhibit newly discovered forms of electronic properties that could pave the way for advancements in more efficient electronic components, quantum computing and environmentally friendly materials, the scientists said.

As described in a report in the science journal Nature Materials, the scientists stacked two ultrathin layers of graphene, each a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal grid. They twisted them slightly atop a layer of hexagonal boron nitride, a hexagonal crystal made of boron and nitrogen. A subtle misalignment between the layers that formed moiré patterns -- patterns similar to those seen when two fine mesh screens are overlaid -- significantly altered how electrons moved through the material, they found.

"Our discovery opens a new path for material design," said Eva Andrei, Board of Governors Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences and lead author of the study. "Intercrystals give us a new handle to control electronic behavior using geometry alone, without having to change the material's chemical composition."

By understanding and controlling the unique properties of electrons in intercrystals, scientists can use them to develop technologies such as more efficient transistors and sensors that previously required a more complex mix of materials and processing, the researchers said.

"You can imagine designing an entire electronic circuit where every function -- switching, sensing, signal propagation -- is controlled by tuning geometry at the atomic level," said Jedediah Pixley, an associate professor of physics and a co-author of the study. "Intercrystals could be the building blocks of such future technologies.

"The discovery hinges on a rising technique in modern physics called "twistronics," where layers of materials are contorted at specific angles to create moiré patterns. These configurations significantly alter the behavior of electrons within the substance, leading to properties that aren't found in regular crystals.

The foundational idea was first demonstrated by Andrei and her team in 2009, when they showed that moiré patterns in twisted graphene dramatically reshape its electronic structure. That discovery helped seed the field of twistronics.

Electrons are tiny particles that move around in materials and are responsible for conducting electricity. In regular crystals, which possess a repeating pattern of atoms forming a perfectly arranged grid, the way electrons move is well understood and predictable. If a crystal is rotated or shifted by certain angles or distances, it looks the same because of an intrinsic characteristic known as symmetry.

The researchers found the electronic properties of intercrystals, however, can vary significantly with small changes in their structure. This variability can lead to new and unusual behaviors, such as superconductivity and magnetism, which aren't typically found in regular crystals. Superconducting materials offer the promise of continuously flowing electrical current because they conduct electricity with zero resistance.

Intercrystals could be a part of the new circuitry for low loss electronics and atomic sensors that could play a part in the making of quantum computers and power new forms of consumer technologies, the scientists said.

The materials also offer the prospect of functioning as the basis of more environmentally friendly electronic technologies.

"Because these structures can be made out of abundant, non-toxic elements such as carbon, boron and nitrogen, rather than rare earth elements, they also offer a more sustainable and scalable pathway for future technologies," Andrei said.

Intercrystals aren't only distinct from conventional crystals. They also are different from quasicrystals, a special type of crystal discovered in 1982 with an ordered structure but without the repeating pattern found in regular crystals.

Research team members named their discovery "intercrystals" because they are a mix between crystals and quasicrystals: they have non-repeating patterns like quasicrystals but share symmetries in common with regular crystals.

"The discovery of quasicrystals in the 1980s challenged the old rules about atomic order," Andrei said. "With intercrystals, we go a step further, showing that materials can be engineered to access new phases of matter by exploiting geometric frustration at the smallest scale."

Rutgers researchers are optimistic about the future applications of intercrystals, opening new possibilities for exploring and manipulating the properties of materials at the atomic level.

"This is just the beginning," Pixley said. "We are excited to see where this discovery will lead us and how it will impact technology and science in the years to come."

Other Rutgers researchers who contributed to the study included research associates Xinyuan Lai, Guohong Li and Angela Coe of the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

Scientists from the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan also contributed to the study.

The Filo del Sol deposit high in the Argentine Andes likely contains five times more metal than previously believed, but many environmental concerns remain.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Located along the border of Chile and Argentina, the Filo del Sol copper deposit has been under investigation for years for potentially being one of the largest copper deposits in the world. And that makes sense, considering this deposit is nestled along the Atacama Desert—long known for its immense copper reserves due to its location in the Andes and its placement within the eastern portion of the Ring of Fire. 

However, a new initial mineral resource estimate completed earlier this month suggests that the companies in charge of mining this area—the U.S.-based Lundin Mining and BHP—may have stumbled upon five times more metal than they bargained for. According to a statement from Lundin Mining, the new assessment estimates the presence of up to 13 million tonnes of copper, 907,000 kilograms (32 million ounces) of gold, and 18.6 million kilograms (659 million ounces) of silver. This new update, gathered from data collected from 400 additional exploration holes, came from the discovery that deeper mineralization of copper far exceeded the estimates that were closer to the surface. According to AFP, Filo del Sol could prove to be richer still, as experts dig deeper and explore the resource's northern and southern boundaries.

“Filo del Sol has been one of the most significant greenfield discoveries in the last 30 years and an amazing journey for all those that have been involved,” Jack Lundin, CEO of Lundin Mining, said in a press statement. “The initial Mineral Resource has highlighted the potential for one of the highest grade undeveloped open pit copper projects in the world and one of the largest gold and silver resources globally.”

This mine is particularly lucrative, as many of the metals found there will be vital to both the green energy revolution and other industries (such as aerospace and telecommunications) that need precious metals like gold. 

Of course, discovering the existence of these resources is one thing, and extracting them is something else entirely—especially due to this open pit mine's particular location. Located at roughly 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) above sea level, the mine and its high elevation (not to mention the overall punishing environment) can take a toll on workers and even induce altitude sickness, according to AFP. As with mining any hard-to-reach location, the logistics of moving equipment up to those altitudes will also be difficult.

Extracting the metals from this portion of the Andes—an initial mineralization that occurred during the Late Cretaceous—will also cause lasting damage to an already fragile ecosystem. Mining operations on both sides of the border have tried to clean up their act, and mines in other areas of Chile's Atacama Desert are working toward transitioning to mining powered by renewable energy, according to Mining Technology. In December of 2024, Argentina's largest private electricity generator Central Puerto began a feasibility study to figure out the best way to build transmission lines capable of ferrying renewable energy to mining sites in the northwest. Lundin also announced in 2022 that they'd be building high-voltage power lines to bring renewable energy to the area and keep diesel consumption to a minimum. 

However, concerns remain. In a report from Dialogue Earth, the environmental NGO Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (FARN) has accused Lundin Group of flouting the country's Glacier Law, which prohibits the establishment of mining pits within the periglacier area (the country's current president is actively seeking to undermine that law). Some 70 percent of the country's drinking water comes from glaciers.

It also doesn't help that mining itself requires lots of water. For example, one of the country's biggest mining sites—La Alumbrera—uses 25 billion liters of water every year, which is equal to 34 percent of the water consumed by the region's nearly half a million inhabitants in a year, according to FARN. 

It's no secret that humanity needs minerals hiding within the Earth if it has any hope of transitioning away from fossil fuels. But in the quest for those minerals, it's best not to kill the patient to cure the disease.

A 1.37-inch inscription could upend our understanding of the religion's spread.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

An 1,800-year-old silver amulet discovered buried in a Frankfurt, Germany grave, still next to the chin of the man who wore it, has 18 lines of text written in Latin on just 1.37 inches of silver foil. That could be enough to rewrite the known history of Christianity in the Roman Empire. 

The amulet—and the inscription—are the oldest evidence of Christianity found north of the Alps.

Every other link to reliable evidence of Christian life in the northern Alpine area of the Roman Empire is at least 50 years younger, all coming from the fourth century A.D. But the amulet, found in a grave dating between 230 and 270 A.D. and now known as “The Frankfurt Inscription,” was made to better decipher the inscription. 

“This extraordinary find affects many areas of research and will keep science busy for a long time,” Ina Hartwig, Frankfurt's head of culture and science, said in a translated statement. “This applies to archaeology as well as to religious studies, philology, and anthropology. Such a significant find here in Frankfurt is truly something extraordinary.”

The amulet was found in what was once the Roman city of Nida at an archaeological site outside of Frankfurt in 2018. During excavation of the area, crews uncovered an entire Roman cemetery wherein the plot designated as “grave 134,” a small silver amulet, known as a phylactery, was located right under the chin of the occupant's skeleton. He likely wore it around his neck and was buried with it.  

Following the find, the Archaeological Museum Frankfurt restored the silver amulet, which included a thin silver foil with an inscription, as seen by microscopic examinations and X-rays in 2019. The wafer-thin silver foil was too brittle to roll out. 

In May 2024, a breakthrough came when using a state-of-the-art computer tomograph at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology in Mainz. “The challenge in the analysis was that the silver sheet was rolled, but of course after around 1,800 years it was also crumpled and pressed,” Ivan Calandra, laboratory manager for imaging procedures at the center, said in a statement. “Using the CT, we were able to scan it in a very high resolution and create a 3D model.” The virtual object was then scanned piece by piece, slowly revealing the words, allowing experts to finally get a look at the inscribed text on the individual fragments from the scan.

But then came the puzzle work. Markus Scholz from Frankfurt's Goethe University was able to piece together the 18 lines. “Sometimes it took weeks, even months, until I had the next idea,” he said in a statement. “I called in experts from the history of theology, among others, and we approached the text together bit by bit and ultimately deciphered it.” Some edges were lost due to damage and some words remain open to discussion. The original inscription is entirely in Latin, unusual for a time that featured amulets written in Greek or Hebrew. 

The Frankfurt Silver Inscription, based on the most updated translation: 

Without a reference to any other faith besides Christianity, rare for amulets of this age, the purely Christian inscription not only shows the rise of Christianity to the north, but also the amulet owner's devotion. During the third century A.D., association with Christianity was still dangerous, and identifying as Christian came with great personal risk, especially as Roman emperor Nero punished Christians with death or even a date in the Colosseum. That was no matter for this man in Frankfurt who took his allegiance to Jesus Christ to his grave. 

The scientific study is bolstered by references never found so early, such as mention of Saint Titus, a student of the Apostle Paul, the invocation “holy, holy, holy!” which wasn't more common until the fourth century A.D., and the phrase “bend your knees,” which is a quote from Paul's letter to the Philippians. 

“The ‘Frankfurt Inscription' is a scientific sensation,” said Mike Josef, Frankfurt's mayor, in a statement. “As a result, the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond will have to be turned back by around 50 to 100 years. The first Christian find north of the Alps comes from our city. We can be proud of this, especially now, so close to Christmas.”

Metrics details

ATP generated in the mitochondria is exported by an ADP/ATP carrier of the SLC25 family1. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cannot synthesize ATP but must import cytoplasmic ATP to energize protein folding, quality control and trafficking2,3. It was recently proposed that a member of the nucleotide sugar transporter family, termed SLC35B1 (also known as AXER), is not a nucleotide sugar transporter but a long-sought-after ER importer of ATP4. Here we report that human SLC35B1 does not bind nucleotide sugars but indeed executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with uptake kinetics consistent with the import of ATP into crude ER microsomes. A CRISPR–Cas9 cell-line knockout demonstrated that SLC35B1 clusters with the most essential SLC transporters for cell growth, consistent with its proposed physiological function. We have further determined seven cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human SLC35B1 in complex with an Fv fragment and either bound to an ATP analogue or ADP in all major conformations of the transport cycle. We observed that nucleotides were vertically repositioned up to approximately 6.5 Å during translocation while retaining key interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. We conclude that SLC35B1 operates by a stepwise ATP translocation mechanism, which is a previously undescribed model for substrate translocation by an SLC transporter.

ATP is the most critical and universal fuel currency of cells across all kingdoms of life2. In eukaryotes, ATP is regenerated in the mitochondria by rotary F0F1-ATP synthase and exported to the cytoplasm by mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers belonging to the SLC25 family1. Owing to our high energy requirements, mitochondrial carriers move our own body weight in ATP every day1. One of the most demanding organelles for ATP consumption is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)3, which occupies a large portion of eukaryotic cell and has no endogenous production. Therefore, it must import ATP from the cytoplasm. ATP in the ER lumen is required for Hsp70 chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP)5-mediated protein folding and ER-associated protein degradation, which are essential processes in protein biogenesis, quality control and trafficking6,7. ER luminal ATP is required for the calreticulin-dependent trafficking of glycosylated major histocompatibility complex class I molecules from the peptide-loading complex8, an important process in the adaptive immune system.

Over the years, different proteins have been proposed and disregarded as routes for ATP entry into the ER3,9,10,11, with a recent proposal for SLC35B1 considered the most convincing4; SLC35B1 has also been referred to as AXER for ATP/ADP exchanger in the ER membrane4 (Fig. 1a). SLC35B1 belongs to the nucleotide sugar transporter (NST) family12, which mainly transports cytoplasmic nucleoside phosphate sugars into the ER and Golgi for the counter-transport of luminal mononucleotides, wherein the nucleotide sugars are used for glycosylation (for example, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose is exchanged for uridine monophosphate (UMP)13) (Extended Data Fig. 1a). SLC35B1 localizes to the ER4, and it has been shown that short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of SLC35B1 in HeLa cells reduces ER ATP levels4. BiP-dependent protein import was also lowered in SLC35B1 knockdown, and ATP/ADP exchange was demonstrated in Escherichia coli upon overexpression of human SLC35B1 (ref. 4). A follow-up study confirmed that SLC35B1 knockdown in Chinese hamster ovary cells substantially decreased ER ATP levels14. Nevertheless, the ATP/ADP exchange kinetics of human SLC35B1 in E. coli are poor and lack validation with purified components4. SLC35B1 and yeast orthologues have also been proposed as UDP-galactose/glucuronic acid transporters15,16,17, and NST members adopt the drug–metabolite transporter (DMT)-fold18,19, which is a different transporter-fold than that used by the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers1. Here we have validated the physiological function, structure and transport mechanism of human SLC35B1.

Thermal shift assays have shown to be a powerful approach for detecting nucleotide binding to the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier SLC25A4 (refs. 20,21) and were therefore used for human SLC35B1. We observed that the addition of either 1 mM ATP or ADP to purified SLC35B1 increased its resistance to heat denaturation, with an average melting temperature (ΔTm) increase of 5.2 °C and 5.3 °C, respectively (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). The degree of nucleotide thermostabilization was similar to that measured for the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A4 (ref. 20). By contrast, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and UDP-galactose only showed a minimal ΔTm increase for SLC35B1 by 1.1 °C and 0.3 °C, respectively (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b). We then reconstituted purified SLC35B1 into liposomes and assessed nucleotide binding using saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy22. Briefly, ligands will only produce STD NMR signals if their non-exchangeable protons interact specifically with SLC35B1, receiving magnetization transfer during on-pulses. Consistent with the thermal shift analysis, the addition of ATP and ADP resulted in strong STD NMR signals, whereas the addition of UDP-galactose and AMP resulted in only weak signals (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d).

To assess transport function, SLC35B1 proteoliposomes were preloaded with 1 mM ADP, and the uptake of externally added [3H]ATP measured after 1 min. Robust uptake of [3H]ATP was apparent, with little uptake in either unloaded or protein-free liposomes (Fig. 1d). Comparable results were obtained when proteoliposomes were preloaded with 1 mM ATP, followed by uptake of [3H]ADP (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e). The addition of external cold ATP or ADP showed strong competition for [3H]ADP uptake, whereas AMP or UDP-galactose addition showed only weak competition, which is consistent with the thermal shift assays and STD NMR analysis (Fig. 1f). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined to be 10.6 μM for ATP, 1.6 μM for ADP and 3.7 mM for AMP (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Under symmetric pH conditions and with no membrane potential (ψ) applied, a Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of 3.4 μM for ATP was measured, similar to the Km of 4 μM reported for ATP import into crude ER microsomes23 (Fig. 1g). The turnover (kcat) of 12 ATP min−1 was calculated and was found to be higher than the rates for the major ER folding chaperone BiP, with a kcat of 0.013 min−1 (ref. 24) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1a). To support the physiological role of human SLC35B1, cell growth in an SLC35B1 knockout was compared against all other SLC transporters in a CRISPR–Cas9 knockout screen in HCT 116 cells (Methods). Together with SLC transporters known to be essential for cell survival, the SLC35B1 protein emerged as one of the top five most essential SLCs, indicating a critical housekeeping role (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Taken together, our biochemical, kinetic and genetic analyses confirmed that SLC35B1 is a bona fide ATP/ADP exchanger for the ER.

Detergent-purified human SLC35B1, with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa, was considered too small for structural determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Therefore, a monoclonal antibody was raised against human SLC35B1, and a recombinant Fv-maltose-binding protein (MBP) fiducial marker was constructed for structural studies (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Purified SLC35B1 formed a homogeneous complex with the Fv–MBP fusion protein (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Although the SLC35B1–Fv–MBP fusion protein complex showed a stronger STD NMR signal for ATP than SLC35B1 alone (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2d), the ADP/ATP kinetics and IC50 for ADP with and without the Fv–MBP fusion were similar; therefore, the antibody fragment had not overly perturbed SLC35B1 transport activity (Fig. 2a, Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1c,d).

The SLC35B1–Fv–MBP fusion complex was optimized for cryo-EM with or without the addition of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP–PNP), which was first confirmed to produce equivalent STD NMR signals and transport activity as ATP (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d–f). After processing and refinement, the SLC35B1 structures showed good fitting into the cryo-EM maps reconstructed to a resolution of approximately 3.4 Å (Extended Data Figs. 3a,b and 4a–c and Extended Data Table 1). The SLC35B1 structure had the expected DMT-fold, which comprised two structurally similar four-transmembrane (4-TM) helix bundles made up from two overlocking V-shaped transmembrane helical pairs of TM1–TM2 with TM8–TM9 and TM3–TM4 with TM6–TM7 (Fig. 2b). The peripheral and shorter TM5 and TM10 are connected to the two 4-TM helix bundles by flexible loops that in other DMT-fold members can mediate the formation of a stable homodimer25,26,27,28, but this was not observed in SLC35B1. The middle of TM4 was found to be broken between the conserved K117 and P212 residues and was therefore designated TM4a–TM4b (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). A helix–break–helix in TM4 has not been observed in other NST structures for GDP-mannose and cytidine monophosphate (CMP)–sialic acid19,25,29, but it has been observed in a distantly related bacterial DMT-fold member acting on amino acids30. The SLC35B1 structure displayed a large cavity open towards the cytoplasm (inward-facing), which is also a conformation yet to be captured experimentally for the NST family19,25,29 (Fig. 2b).

The Fv fragment formed multiple interactions with the flexible loop located between the TM2 and TM3 helices and at the end of TM6, which are all positioned on the same bundle, consistent with the Fv–MBP complex retaining robust transport activity (Fig. 2a,c). Bundle closure on the luminal side is formed by highly conserved polar residues located between the ends of TM1 and TM9 together with TM3–TM4a (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). In particular, hydrogen bond interactions were observed between E33 and N290 and between R37 and N109, which are located at the respective ends of TM1, TM4a and TM9 (Fig. 2d). SLC35B1 structures with and without AMP–PNP addition are mostly equivalent, apart from the extra cryo-EM map density for the nucleotide (Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). Unexpectedly, the ring-shaped map density implied a nucleotide conformation where the terminal γ-phosphate had arched back towards the adenine moiety (Extended Data Fig. 4e). However, this is an unusual configuration for the ATP analogue, and the symmetrical map density made it difficult to confidently assign its correct orientation.

In view of the few inter-bundle interactions, we attempted to stabilize the protein by mutating the key cavity-closing residues (Fig. 2d). After screening various mutations, a Q113F variant was identified that increased the melting temperature (Tm) from 33.8 °C to 37.2 °C, and the ΔTm (ATP) shifted from 5.2 °C to 6.6 °C (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3a). The Q113F variant also displayed a stronger STD NMR signal for ATP than wild-type SLC35B1 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Although transport activity was reduced to approximately 25% of wild-type levels, the ATP IC50 at 2.7 μM was only somewhat lower (Extended Data Figs. 1f and 5b,c). Consistent with the increased stability, the cryo-EM structure of Fv–MBP(Q113F) was determined to have an improved resolution of approximately 3.0 Å (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 1). The Q113F mutant structure adopted the same conformation as the wild-type structure but with minor side-chain differences located around the phenylalanine residue introduced in the cavity-closing contacts (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). The map density for AMP–PNP in Q113F was in the same position as in wild-type SLC35B1; however, the improved resolution now enabled its unambiguous assignment and confirmed the toroid shape conformation of the ATP analogue (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5f,g).

Source data

Matching the positively charged surface of the cytoplasmic-facing cavity, the negatively charged α- and β-phosphates in AMP–PNP were found to be coordinated by R276 and K277 in TM9 and by K120 in TM4b (Fig. 3a,b). The K120 residue also interacted with γ-phosphate, which had circled back to interact with the adenosine nitrogen. The T273 residue in TM9 also formed a polar interaction with the α-phosphate, and the ribose ring oxygen was stabilized by hydrogen bonding to Q254 in TM8 (Fig. 3b). Comparing the apo wild-type and AMP–PNP-bound Q113F structures, we found that K120 and K277 residues had repositioned to interact with the nucleotide, breaking polar interactions with D183 and S118, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5h). Unexpectedly, there were no polar interactions coordinating the adenine moiety (Fig. 3a,b). Instead, I257 and V261 in TM8 formed a hydrophobic patch for adenine, together with the C269 residue in TM9.

In transporters, the substrate is typically coordinated at the bottom of the cavity and not part-way down, as seen in SLC35B1. At this position, K117 in TM4a was too distant to directly interact with AMP–PNP (Fig. 3b). Although the modelled position for AMP–PNP was unexpected, adenine is fairly hydrophobic31 and, therefore, the amphipathic substrate was nevertheless matched by complementary charged and non-charged protein surfaces (Fig. 3a). However, given the atypical binding mode of AMP–PNP, we sought to determine whether ADP would also interact in a similar manner. Although the physiological substrate in the cytoplasmic-facing conformation is ATP, we observed that ADP/ATP versus ADP/ADP exchange activities were comparable and, as such, mechanistically, ADP and ATP are robustly transported in either direction (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Repeating the cryo-EM workflow for the SLC35B1–Fv–MBP fusion, we noticed that the particles were more homogeneous with ADP, and the map quality could be further improved to a resolution of 2.85 Å (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Extended Data Table 1). The wild-type structure with ADP was very similar to previous structures, and we were further able to model a peripheral lipid on the outside of the TM3 and TM6 helices (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). Strong map density showed that ADP was also bound to the same location as AMP–PNP (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Video 1). ADP also adopted a toroidal shape conformation, and the adenine moiety was likewise positioned next to the hydrophobic patch formed by the I257 and V261 residues (Fig. 3d). The K277 residue in TM9 and the side chain of K120 in TM4b had further repositioned to maintain an interaction with both phosphates in ADP but R276 was no longer forming a direct interaction (Fig. 3d).

To evaluate the importance of the observed nucleotide coordination, we forthwith substituted the nucleotide-binding site residues with alanine and reassessed the transport of purified variants in liposomes (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Confirming their requirement for transport, all variants were inactive, including K117A in TM4a and Y25A in TM1, which interacts with a Q254 residue (TM8) that itself is interacting with the ribose moiety (Fig. 3b). To assess the role of the hydrophobic interactions, I257 and V261 residues were substituted with glutamate and threonine, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The transport activities of the I257E and V261T variants were also severely reduced, confirming their importance (Fig. 3e). Finally, C269, located at the beginning of TM9, was substituted with either alanine or serine residues. Yet, cysteine variants retained robust transport activity, and therefore the role of this residue is unclear (Fig. 3b,e and Supplementary Fig. 3c).

The lack of specific polar interactions with the adenine moiety suggests that other trinucleotide phosphates should also be able to compete for binding (Fig. 3b). Indeed, both cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP) nucleotides showed strong competition for [3H]ADP uptake, with IC50 values only approximately twofold higher than that of ATP at 21 and 29 μM, respectively (Extended Data Figs. 1f and 6f). SLC35B1 showed a stronger inhibition for ADP than ATP, and consistently, UDP and CDP were more effective at competition for [3H]ADP uptake than UTP and CTP (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Furthermore, preloading liposomes with either CTP or UTP confirmed that these nucleotides could also catalyse [3H]ADP import, although at approximately 30% of the levels measured for ATP preloading (Extended Data Fig. 6g). By contrast, the addition of GTP showed only weak competition with an IC50 of 3.5 mM, as well as poor thermostabilization and low STD NMR signals (Extended Data Figs. 1b,d,f and 6f). Because guanosine is the most hydrophilic nucleobase among the trinucleotide phosphates tested31, we therefore conclude that the hydrophobic patch coordinating adenine in the nucleotide-bound SLC35B1 structures is incompatible with the binding of more polar GTP.

Similar to many transporters, DMT-fold members operate by means of a rocker-switch alternating-access mechanism27,28,30,32, in which structurally similar bundles move around a centrally located substrate. However, in SLC35B1, the adenine moiety binds at a position close to the cytoplasmic surface, which is incompatible with such a mode of transport. Upon superimposition of the AMP–PNP-bound SLC35B1 structure with the occluded structure of SLC35A1 (ref. 29), we found that the position of adenine would physically clash with the predicted inward movement of the TM8–TM9 gating helices (Extended Data Fig. 6h). To determine how adenine nucleotides would be translocated, we examined whether the E33A variant might have shifted the SLC35B1 population to an ER lumen-facing conformation (Fig. 2d). The E33A variant was selected because it retained robust ATP binding and had a similar IC50 value to that of wild-type SLC35B1 at 11.7 μM (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 3a and Extended Data Figs. 5c and 7a,b). Because ADP was the physiological substrate from the ER luminal side, we collected cryo-EM datasets with either ADP or AMP–PNP and after refinement, cryo-EM maps could be reconstructed to a resolution of 3.2 and 3.1 Å, respectively (Methods, Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7 and Extended Data Table 1). Satisfactorily, the E33A variant had adopted the ER luminal-facing conformation, and cryo-EM maps enabled the unambiguous assignment of ADP and AMP–PNP nucleotides (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d).

Comparing cytoplasmic- and luminal-facing structures, we found that TM8–TM9 helices had moved inwards to form cavity-closing contacts with TM6 and TM7 on the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 3f). On the ER luminal side, the TM1, TM3, TM4a, TM6 and TM9 helices had most predominantly moved outwards (Fig. 3f). Notably, the cavity-closing contacts formed on the cytoplasmic side are comparatively weaker than those on the ER luminal side and are primarily made up of hydrophobic and main-chain interactions (Fig. 4a). The AMP–PNP and ADP nucleotides were positioned similarly, although the cavity was somewhat narrower in the ADP-bound state (Fig. 4b). Between cytoplasmic-facing and luminal-facing states, the adenine nucleobase had been vertically translocated approximately 6.5 Å by the closure of TM8–TM9 gating helices (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). Rather than different substrate-coordinating residues, most of the nucleotide-binding residues used in the cytoplasmic-facing state had readjusted their position to maintain the coordination of the nucleotide in the luminal-facing conformation (Fig. 4c). Both AMP–PNP and ADP adopt a more canonical position, with the nucleobase positioned at the bottom of the cavity in the same hydrophobic patch formed by the TM8–TM9 residues I257, V261, C269 and F258 (Fig. 4c). The phosphate moieties extend vertically in both ADP and AMP–PNP nucleotides and maintained their interactions with the positively charged residues (Fig. 4c).

Source data

The key to the malleability of substrate binding seems to be the flexible TM4a–TM4b helix, which harbours K117 and K120 residues. Specifically, although R276 and K277 in TM9 maintained their interaction with the α-phosphate of AMP–PNP in both cytoplasmic-facing and luminal-facing conformations, K120 had shifted from interacting with the β- and γ-phosphates to forming a π–cation interaction with adenine instead (Figs. 3b and 4c). The K117 residue, which was too distant to interact with either AMP–PNP or ADP in the cytoplasmic-facing state, now coordinates the β-phosphate of AMP–PNP in the luminal-facing state (Figs. 3b,d and 4c). K117 was still not required for ADP coordination and, instead forms a salt bridge to D183 (Fig. 4c). By contrast, R276 directly interacted with ADP in the luminal-facing state. These structures imply that although four positively charged residues are required for ATP4− translocation, only three are required for ADP3−, and K117 can interact with either a phosphate or D183, depending on the substrate. Finally, Q190 and Q254 formed polar interactions with the nucleobase, which contrasts with the cytoplasmic-facing state in which only hydrophobic contacts were observed (Fig. 4c). Similar to Q254A, the Q190A variant showed a comparatively poorer transport activity than the wild-type protein (Fig. 3e).

Because the mutations of most nucleotide-coordinating residues were transport inactive, we used the observed ATP-induced thermostabilization as a proxy for probing the requirements for substrate binding (Methods and Supplementary Table 1). Upon increasing the nucleotide concentrations, we observed a maximal thermostabilization of wild-type SLC35B1 at 1 mM ATP (Fig. 4d, Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7e). By contrast, alanine variants of the positively charged residues K117, K120, R276 and K277 showed no clear thermostabilization (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Likewise, the hydrophobic residue variants I257E and V261T severely diminished ATP-induced thermostabilization, although C269A was still able to interact with ATP, consistent with the variant retaining robust transport activity (Figs. 3d and 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7h). We further quantified the ΔTm shift at 1 mM ATP and found that only Q190A retained wild-type-like thermostabilization (Fig. 4d), indicating that the diminished transport of Q190A could be a result of perturbed cavity closing (Fig. 3e). Mutation of the more peripheral polar residues Y25, T273 and Q254 also retained 40–60% of the ATP-induced thermostabilization observed for wild-type protein (Fig. 4d). I257E and V261T displayed diminished ATP-induced thermostabilization to the same extent as the positively charged variants, reinforcing their importance (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, R276A was found to have the greatest impact on nucleotide binding. Consistently, R276 is located in the middle of the gating helix TM9 and interacts with the α-phosphate in both AMP–PNP-bound conformations (Fig. 4c–e). Between the opposite-facing conformations, the gating helix TM9 pivoted dramatically around the central R276, with most of the large rearrangement likely already occurring between the cytoplasmic-facing and occluded-state conformations (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8a–c).

To analyse the conformational plasticity of SLC35B1, we performed 3D variability analysis (3DVA) (Methods). For the cytoplasmic-facing SLC35B1 structures, cryo-EM map distributions supported the mobility of the TM8–TM9 gating helices, consistent with their movement in transitioning to a luminal-facing state (Supplementary Videos 4 and 5). For the luminal-facing E33A variant with ADP, we unexpectedly observed map density that supported full gate closure of TM3–TM4a gating helices on the ER luminal side with the symmetry-related opening of TM8–TM9 gating helices on the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Videos 6–8). We were further able to extract E33A particles from which we could reconstruct cryo-EM maps of a cytoplasmic-facing conformation with ADP bound at a resolution of 3.1 Å, as well as improve the map quality of the previously modelled ADP-bound ER luminal-facing structure (Supplementary Fig. 6). From the E33A variant with ADP, we were therefore able to obtain a distribution of cryo-EM maps that covered the full transport cycle (Supplementary Videos 7 and 8).

In the cytoplasmic-facing E33A structure, the map quality for ADP was clearly weaker than that in all other structures, and ADP was further positioned approximately 7 Å closer to the cytoplasmic entrance than its position in the wild-type structure (Extended Data Fig. 8d–f and Supplementary Video 9). Adenosine was positioned along the same TM8–TM9 gate and, although more poorly coordinated, the β-phosphate retained an interaction with R276 together with Y25 and Q254 (Extended Data Fig. 8e). There was a further potential π–cation interaction with R194 (Extended Data Fig. 8e), which in the ER luminal-facing state, may help stabilize the luminal-facing conformation (Fig. 4a). However, given that R194A retained robust ATP binding and displayed higher transport activity than the wild-type structure, mutagenesis reinforced polar interactions with adenine do not seem to be required for nucleotide binding (Extended Data Figs. 5c and 8e and Supplementary Table 1). Because the E33A variant shifted the SLC35B1 protein to a predominantly luminal-facing state, we interpreted the nucleotide position as an ADP molecule before exiting to the cytoplasm. Consistently, the E33A cytoplasmic-facing ADP-bound structure was more open than that observed for wild-type apo, wild-type ADP or Q113F AMP–PNP structures, with a larger outward displacement of TM8–TM9, TM1 and TM4b helices (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Together, we have been able to determine human SLC35B1 cryo-EM structures to reconstruct a comprehensive transport model for both ATP and ADP translocations (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Videos 2, 3, 10 and 11).

a, Cartoon representation of the transport cycle depicting the rearrangements of SLC35B1 bundles (teal and orange) to import ATP into the ER in exchange for ADP. A homology model for the occluded (OC) state was constructed using the AlphaFold 2 model44 of the SLC35B1 homologue from Wuchereria bancrofti (AF-A0A3P7E1A7-F1-v4). AMP–PNP and ADP in the occluded state were positioned as in the experimental outward-facing (OF) states. The peripheral TM5 and TM10 helices were omitted for clarity. The insert (asterisk) illustrates that we postulated that ADP initially interacted with phosphate first from the ER luminal side but was then flipped in the binding pocket to the coordination observed by cryo-EM. IF, inward-facing. b, Hydrophobic surface representation of the AMP–PNP-bound (cyan) luminal-facing structure (above) and cytoplasmic-facing structure (below), highlighting that adenine in AMP–PNP was accommodated by a hydrophobic patch of residues in an otherwise positively charged substrate-binding site. c, Top, surface representation of cytoplasmic- and luminal-facing structures. Pink surfaces highlight that the position of the hydrophobic residues interacting with the adenine moiety was relatively closer to the cytoplasm in the inward-facing state than it was to the ER lumen in the outward-facing state, that is, the substrate-binding site was asymmetric. Bottom, as in the top panel with AMP–PNP (sticks; cyan). d, Top, in the canonical rocker-switch mechanism, the protein moves around the centrally positioned substrate (S). Bottom, in the rocker-switch mechanism seen here for SLC35B1, the substrate-binding site was asymmetric, and, as such, the substrate was vertically repositioned during substrate translocation. Graphic in a was created using BioRender (https://biorender.com).

It was shown over 30 years ago that ATP is transported into crude ER microsomes with Km of 3–5 µM (ref. 23). Here we combined genetic, biochemical and structural analyses to confirm that SLC35B1 is not an NST but the route for ATP entry into the ER. A recent biochemical study has obtained robust ADP/ATP transport kinetics for SLC35B1 in proteoliposome assays33, further supporting our independent analysis. In fact, the closest isoform to SLC35B1 is SLC35B2, for which biochemical analysis has shown is not an NST but an importer of 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate34 — a molecule structurally similar to ADP (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). The SLC35B2 transporter delivers 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate to the Golgi, where it is used as a donor for the sulfation of glycan sugars, such as heparan sulfate, which is a crucial post-translational modification in cellular physiology35. Although SLC35B1 and SLC35B2 share approximately 30% sequence identity, the similar substrates and conservation of substrate-binding residues (Supplementary Fig. 8a) indicate that they are likely to operate by means of a similar transport mechanism.

Transporters must attract the right solutes to their cavity, and because ATP is highly negatively charged, a positively charged cavity was expected. Compared with the NSTs for GDP-mannose19 (Vrg4) and CMP–sialic acid29 (SLC35A1), however, the luminal- and cytoplasmic-facing cavities are narrower and more positively charged in SLC35B1 (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Furthermore, because both ADP and AMP–PNP adopted an unusual bent conformation in the cytoplasmic-facing state, adjusting to the position of the hydrophobic and positively charged surfaces, it is unlikely that the polar and bulkier nucleotide sugars could be accommodated in this substrate-binding site (Figs. 3a,d and 5b). The problem encountered is that ATP is now positioned only part-way down the cavity. At this position, the small protein cannot move around the nucleotide, as it typically would in a conventional rocker-switch mechanism32,36. It seems SLC35B1 has evolved a unique way to counter this problem.

First, the adenine moiety is rather hydrophobic, and so becomes initially positioned in a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 5b,c). Rather than being restrained by polar residues, we postulate that hydrophobic interactions are important because they enable the nucleobase to easily readjust its position with the closure of TM8–TM9 gating helices (Fig. 5a–c). The trade-off for a less discriminative nucleobase binding site might be the lack of selectivity observed against other dinucleotide or trinucleotide phosphates. In this case, however, this might be tolerated because the cytoplasmic concentration of ATP is sixfold to tenfold higher than that of any other trinucleotide phosphates37. Second, between cytoplasmic-facing and luminal-facing conformations, the closure of the TM8–TM9 gating helices has physically moved the ATP analogue in the vertical direction by some approximately 6.5 Å (Figs. 4c and 5d). The key to stepwise ATP analogue rearrangement seems to be the sustained association between the α-phosphate and R276 in TM9 and a concomitant readjustment of the lysine residues positioned on the flexible TM4a and TM4b gating helices. Specifically, TM9 undergoes a large rigid-body movement during translocation around R276, whereas TM4a–TM4b helices can independently adjusted their position to sustain coordination with the nucleotide (Fig. 4c). In the ER luminal-facing state, both AMP–PNP and ADP are in a more canonical position with the nucleobase now positioned at the bottom of the cavity. However, in the return step, we propose that it is unlikely that ADP would bind nucleobase first when entering from the ER luminal side because electrostatic interactions attract over a longer distance and adenine nucleotides bind phosphate first from the cytoplasmic side. Instead, we propose that ADP transiently binds phosphate first when entering from the ER luminal side but then flips around the positively charged residues to the position observed in the cryo-EM structures. Notably, the luminal-facing cavity is hydrophobic on one side, which would enable repositioning of the greasy adenine moiety (Extended Data Fig. 8i). In the return step, we think that ADP will first be repositioned approximately 6.5 Å to the state observed for ADP in the wild-type cytoplasmic-facing state, whereas the distal site observed in the E33A variant structure is likely to be only transiently occupied. Although there might be further en route intermediates, we conclude that because the substrate-binding site in the cytoplasmic-facing state is asymmetric compared to its location in the luminal-facing state, ATP import into the ER by SLC35B1 must use a stepwise mechanism, which further includes vertical repositioning of the substrate (Fig. 5c,d).

An emerging theme in the transport of amphipathic substrates, such as lipids and nucleotides, is that they can populate several positions along the translocation pathway38,39,40. Most relevant to SLC35B1 is that exhaustive biochemical and structural analyses strongly indicate that a stepwise translocation mechanism is likely adopted by the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier SLC25A4, although nucleotide-bound states are yet to be obtained to confirm this21. Although each transporter is fine-tuned differently, evolution may have converged on similar solutions for the transport of large amphipathic substrates. Finally, given the high demand for ATP in the ER for protein folding and adaptive ER stresses41,42,43, it will be important to establish how and if ATP import by SLC35B1 is regulated by the levels of ATP produced and exported by the mitochondria14. In conclusion, our fundamental mechanistic insights into the import of ATP into the ER not only expand our understanding of SLC transport mechanisms, but solidifying its function also provides an important framework for exploring new avenues in cellular metabolism and physiology.

Human SLC35B1 was previously cloned into the yeast GAL1 inducible vector pDDGFP2 (ref. 45), resulting in a construct containing a C-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV)–GFP–His8 tag. SLC35B1 variants were constructed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis and recloned, as previously described46. The resulting vectors were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FGY217 (MATα, ura3-52, lys2Δ201 and pep4Δ)47. Cells harbouring GFP-fused SLC35B1-expressing plasmids were incubated in 12 l of URA medium containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose at 30 °C in 2-l shaking flasks. Protein expression was induced by the addition of galactose to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. After a 22-h incubation at 30 °C, the cells were harvested, resuspended in a buffer (containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA and 0.6 M sorbitol) and lysed using a high-pressure cell disruption system (Constant Systems). Membranes were isolated by means of ultracentrifugation at 4 °C and 195,000g for 2 h, homogenized in a buffer (containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 M sucrose and 0.1 mM CaCl2), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use.

SLC35B1 and its variants were purified, as previously described46. In brief, isolated membranes from S. cerevisiae cultures containing GFP-fused SLC35B1 were diluted to a total protein concentration of 3.5 mg ml−1 in a buffer containing 1× PBS, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM). The membranes were solubilized by mild agitation at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 120,000g at 4 °C for 45 min to remove the non-solubilized material. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the mixture was incubated with 10 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate affinity resin (Ni-NTA; QIAGEN) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 30 column volumes of a buffer containing 1× PBS, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) DDM and 60 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted in 3 column volumes of 1× PBS, 150 mM NaCl, 0.03% (w/v) DDM and 250 mM imidazole and concentrated to 2 mg ml−1. The concentrate was applied to a PD-10 desalting column (Sephadex G-25; GE) pre-equilibrated in a buffer containing 1× PBS and 0.02% (w/v) DDM. The initial 1.6 ml of the flow-through was collected and concentrated using a 50-kDa molecular weight cut-off spin concentrator (Amicon; Merck Millipore). The same procedure was used to purify each mutant that was fused with GFP. Before large-scale culturing, the membranes of each respective mutant were assessed for monodispersity by fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) using a Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) LC-20AD/RF-20A (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 512 nm) and Enrich SEC 650 10 × 300 column (Bio-Rad) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.03% (w/v) DDM.

GFP thermal shift experiments were performed, as previously described48,49. In brief, purified SLC35B1–GFP was diluted to 0.6 µM in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 1% (w/v) DDM. Substrates of interest were added to the purified SLC35B1–GFP to a final (v/v) concentration of 1 mM, and the resulting mixtures were incubated for 10 min on ice. After incubation, the detergent β-n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). Subsequently, the samples were transferred to PCR tubes and heated for 10 min at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C using a Veriti 96-well thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were centrifuged at 5,000g for 45 min at 4 °C to pelletize the larger protein aggregates. The resulting supernatants were transferred to a 96-well black plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and GFP fluorescence (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 512 nm) was measured using a Fluoroskan microplate fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The apparent Tm for each titration was calculated by plotting the average GFP fluorescence intensity from two technical repeats at each temperature and fitting the curves to a sigmoidal dose–response equation using GraphPad Prism v.8.4. ΔTm was calculated by subtracting the average Tm with nucleotide (calculated from three titrations) from the average Tm without nucleotide (calculated from three titrations).

The relative difference in concentration-dependent ATP-induced thermostabilization was assessed from the final 1 µM to 5 mM, as previously described, but at a single temperature of 37 °C, which was based on wild-type Tm + 4.2 °C, because we previously found a 4–6 °C temperature increase from the Tm was optimal for monitoring ligand binding49. The normalized fluorescence at each concentration of ATP was calculated relative to the GFP fluorescence measured at the starting (lowest) concentration of ATP. Each titration was performed in triplicate.

Purified SLC35B1 was reconstituted into liposomes following the freeze–thaw extrusion method. Lipid extract from bovine brain 7 (Sigma-Aldrich) and cholesteryl hemisuccinate (Sigma-Aldrich) were added at final concentrations of 30 and 5 mg ml−1, respectively, in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2 mM MgSO4. To preload liposomes with nucleotides, 5 µl of a 0.1 M nucleotide stock in 0.5 M Tris (pH 7.5) was added to a 500-µl lipid mix, yielding a final nucleotide concentration of 1 mM. The mixture was flash-frozen and thawed at room temperature before sonication to make unilamellar liposomes. Then 10–20 µl of protein (20 µg total) was added to the liposomes, which were then extruded (LiposoFast; AVESTIN; 400-nm membrane pore size), resulting in large unilamellar proteoliposomes. Liposomes were then diluted in 25 ml of buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2 mM MgSO4 (transport buffer) and pelleted at 250,000g for 45 min to remove free nucleotides. Finally, the proteoliposomes were resuspended in a transport buffer to a final concentration of approximately 60 mg ml−1. Liposomes without protein (protein-free liposomes) were prepared in the same way but with the addition of the same volume of buffer instead of protein.

To calculate the protein reconstitution efficiency, 120 µl of proteoliposomes and protein-free liposomes at 60 mg ml−1 were solubilized in 1× PBS, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5) and 1% (w/v) DDM to a final volume of 300 µl for 1 h at 4 °C. Non-solubilized material was pelleted at 250,000g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was injected into an ENrich SEC 650 10 × 300 Column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.03% (w/v) DDM and ran at 1 ml min−1 using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu) in the same buffer. In addition, 0.6 µg of purified SLC35B1 was injected onto the same column and run as stated previously. This amount of protein should represent 100% theoretical protein reconstitution. Area under the curve (AUC) was obtained from the size exclusion chromatography traces using the AUC function (GraphPad Prism). The AUC values from empty liposomes were subtracted from the AUC proteoliposomes and normalized to the control injection of 100% protein reconstitution. An estimated protein reconstitution of 11% was calculated and used for subsequent calculation of kinetic analysis.

For uptake measurements, 5 µl of proteoliposomes was diluted into 45 µl of transport buffer with either [3H]ATP (0.14 μM) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals and Moravek Biochemicals) or [3H]ADP (0.3 μM) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and incubated at 25 °C. Transport was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of transport buffer and by rapid filtration through a 0.22-µm mixed cellulose hydrophilic filter (Millipore). Filters with liposomes were then washed with 6 ml of transport buffer, transferred to scintillation vials and emulsified in 5 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation liquid (PerkinElmer) before scintillation counting (TRI-CARB 4810TR 110 V; PerkinElmer). For the IC50 data acquisition, disintegrations per minute values recorded from protein-free liposomes after 2 min were used for baseline subtraction of the respective tested conditions, and the data were later internally normalized. The IC50 values were obtained by fitting a nonlinear regression of [inhibitor] versus the normalized response with a variable slope using GraphPad Prism v.8.4.

For competitive uptake assays, the uptake of external [3H]ADP (0.14 μM) was monitored in the presence of 1 mM cold nucleotide in a transport buffer after 60 s. For kinetic analysis, the initial velocities were estimated from the initial 30 s of the time-course experiment. A mixture of radiolabelled ADP and ADP at a 1:18 molar ratio was used for the initial points of the curve (0.2–5 µM), and ratios of 1:36 and 1:64 were used for the last points (10 and 20 µM). These different ratios were later corrected when transforming raw radioactive ADP counts to the amount (pmol) of ADP transported. For each concentration of ADP, the disintegrations per minute values from protein-free liposomes were subtracted from their respective proteoliposome values. Final Km and Kcat values were obtained by fitting Michaelis–Menten kinetics using GraphPad Prism v.8.4.

NMR samples were prepared as a mixture of 10 μM purified SLC35B1–GFP into proteoliposomes consisting of total bovine brain lipid extract 7 (Sigma-Aldrich), cholesteryl hemisuccinate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 500 μM of the respective substrate, which were pre-dissolved in a buffer in D2O containing 25 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.2) and 50 mM NaCl. All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker 500 or 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with cryogenic probes. The NMR spectra were processed using the TopSpin software (Bruker). On- and off-resonance irradiations were applied at chemical shifts of −0.5 and 60 ppm, respectively. Proteins were saturated using a train of Gaussian-shaped 50-ms-long pulses. The total length of the saturation train was set to 2 s. All NMR spectra were acquired with 4,096 scans per dataset. The STD amplification factors were calculated using the following equation to compare the binding intensities22,50.

where I0 are integrated peaks in off-resonance spectra, and I0 − Isat are integrated peaks of the STD spectra.

HCT 116 (Research Resource Identifier: CVCL_0291) cells were transduced in triplicates with lentiviral particles containing a transporter-focused CRISPR–Cas9 library (Addgene, 213695) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.3. Cells were selected with blasticidin for 13 days to remove non-transduced cells and passaged in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (R8758, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10270-106, lot 42F8381K, Gibco) and penicillin–streptomycin (15140-122, Gibco) for 5 weeks. We performed genomic DNA purification, PCR amplification of the single guide RNA (sgRNA) regions and Illumina sequencing, as previously described51. The sgRNA sequences were quantified using MAGeCK count v.0.5.9.2 (ref. 52). Only sgRNAs targeting SLC transporters and control genes were included in further analysis. Raw count tables were used to determine the significant depletion and enrichment of sgRNAs from the pool using the MAGeCK test v.0.5.9.2 with default parameters. The data analysis was performed on the Galaxy platform53. Raw sequencing data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE277685). The HCT 116 (CCL-247) cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and authenticated by means of short tandem repeat profiling. PCR testing confirmed the absence of Mycoplasma infection.

All animal experiments conformed to the guidelines of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Japan and were approved by the Kyoto University Animal Experimentation Committee. Full-length human SLC35B1 containing residues 1–322 (UniProt accession number P78383) was expressed in the Sf9-baculovirus system and purified. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against SLC35B1 were raised essentially, as previously described54. In brief, a proteoliposome antigen was prepared by reconstituting purified SLC35B1 at a high density into phospholipid vesicles consisting of a 10:1 mixture of chicken egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (egg PC; Avanti Polar Lipids) and adjuvant lipid A (Sigma-Aldrich) to facilitate an immune response. MRL/lpr mice were immunized with proteoliposome antigen using three injections at 2-week intervals. Antibody-producing hybridoma cell lines were generated by using a conventional fusion protocol. Biotinylated proteoliposomes were prepared by reconstituting SLC35B1 with a mixture of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(cap biotinyl) (16:0 biotinyl Cap-PE; Avanti) and used as binding targets for conformation-specific antibody selection. The targets were immobilized on streptavidin-coated microplates (Nunc). Hybridoma clones producing antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes in human SLC35B1 were selected using an ELISA on immobilized biotinylated proteoliposomes (liposome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), allowing positive selection of antibodies that recognized the native conformation of SLC35B1. Further screening for reduced antibody binding to SDS-denatured SLC35B1 was performed for negative selection against linear epitope-recognizing antibodies. The stable complex formation between SLC35B1 and each antibody clone was checked using FSEC55. A monoclonal antibody (clone number YN4027) that specifically binds to and stabilizes the conformational epitopes in SLC35B1 was selected. The sequence of Fab YN4027 was determined by means of standard 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the total RNA isolated from hybridoma cells.

The Fab molecules have a pseudo-symmetrical axis. When the angle between the Fab and target membrane protein is perpendicular, it can be difficult to align the particles correctly in the detergent. To overcome this problem, we created an asymmetric fiducial marker with a single synthetic polyprotein consisting of the YN4027 variable-light domain, short linker, MBP, another linker and YN4027 variable-heavy domain. The resulting Fv–MBP fusion protein was used as a cryo-EM fiducial marker for SLC35B1.

The Fv–MBP fusion protein was produced by secretion from the gram-positive bacterium Brevibacillus choshinensis. The DNA sequence of Fv–MBP was inserted downstream of and in frame with the secretion signal sequence of the plasmid pNY326 (Takara Bio/Clontech). To facilitate purification of the secreted proteins, the TEV protease cleavage site sequence, His6 tag and HA tag were added at the C-terminal. B. choshinensis cells harbouring the Fv–MBP expression plasmid were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in 2SY medium (40 g l−1 of soytone, 5 g l−1 of yeast extract, 20 g l−1 of glucose and 0.15 g l−1 of CaCl2) supplemented with 50 mg l−1 of neomycin for 65–70 h. The recovered culture supernatant was adjusted to a final ammonium sulfate concentration of 60% saturation. The resulting precipitate was pelleted, dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl) and dialysed overnight against the same buffer. The dialysed sample was purified using Ni-NTA resin, mixed with TEV-His6 and dialysed overnight again against the TBS buffer. The cleaved His6-HA tag and TEV-His6 were removed using a HisTrap column. The flow-through fractions were further purified using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (Cytiva) equilibrated with the TBS buffer. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

For cryo-EM sample preparation, the purified SLC35B1–GFP fusion was incubated at 4 °C overnight with equimolar TEV protease during dialysis in a 3-l buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.006% (w/v) glyco-diosgenin (GDN). The dialysed mixture was applied to a 5-ml HisTrap HP column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole and 0.006% GDN, and the flow-through was collected, concentrated to around 2 mg ml−1, flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C.

The purified SLC35B1 protein was incubated on ice with Fv–MBP antibody at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 for 30 min. The complex was isolated by size exclusion chromatography in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.006% (w/v) GDN detergent. Peak fractions corresponding to the SLC35B1–Fv–MBP fusion complex were concentrated to 5.7 mg ml−1 (wild type), 7.1 mg ml−1 (E33A) and 8.0 mg ml−1 (Q113F) using a 100-kDA cut-off centricon. For data collection with nucleotides, either 5 mM AMP–PNP or 5 mM ADP was added to the protein–Fv–MBP complex at 4 °C before blotting. The concentrated protein sample (3 µl) was applied to either QUANTIFOIL Cu R2/1 (wild type and Q113F) or QUANTIFOIL Cu R1.2/1.3 (E33A) grids and blotted for the optimal time for each construct (3 s for wild type and 1.5 s for E33A and Q113F) at 4 °C under 100% humidity and plunge frozen in liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Cryo-EM datasets were collected using a Titan Krios G3i microscope equipped with a Gatan BioQuantum K3 detector in the super-resolution hard-binned mode. The videos were collected at ×130,000 magnification with aberration-free image shift and fringe-free imaging using EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The other data collection parameters are summarized in Extended Data Table 1.

Image processing for all datasets was performed using the CryoSPARC software56. The video frames were aligned using the Patch Motion correction function, and the contrast transfer function was estimated using the Patch CTF algorithm. For apo data, 31,550 videos were recorded. After the CTF estimation, micrographs with an estimated resolution worse than 5.5 Å were rejected. 2D templates were generated from a set of 1,000 micrographs by means of blob picking and 2D classification. Around 9.9 million particles were extracted after template-based picking from the entire dataset. These particles were then subjected to several rounds of 2D classification. Around 1.1 million particles belonging to good 2D classes were selected and subjected to multimodel ab initio reconstruction. A good class containing 443,730 particles was selected and subjected to another round of hetero-refinement and multimodel ab initio reconstruction to remove the particles corresponding to the junk classes. Finally, 180,530 particles were selected for the final round of non-uniform refinement, resulting in a 3D reconstruction with a gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) resolution of 3.7 Å. To improve the alignments, the flexible MBP domain was masked out and local refinements were performed, which gradually improved the gold-standard FSC resolution to 3.37 Å.

For the SLC35B1 AMP–PNP-bound structure, 16,532 of 17,914 micrographs had an estimated CTF resolution better than 6 Å and were selected for further image processing. Around 8.7 million particles were extracted after template-based picking and subjected to several rounds of 2D classification. Around 420,000 particles were selected, and the initial 3D volumes were obtained using multi-class ab initio reconstruction. We further cleaned up 218,098 particles corresponding to a good 3D reconstruction using several rounds of hetero-refinement. Finally, 114,510 particles were selected and refined to a high resolution using non-uniform refinement. To improve the map features for the transporter region, the volume corresponding to Fv–MBP was masked out and local refinements were performed. The final reconstruction had an overall resolution of 3.44 Å on the basis of the gold-standard FSC at 0.143.

For the SLC35B1 ADP-bound structure, 25,806 of 28,798 micrographs had an estimated CTF resolution better than 6 Å and were selected for further image processing. Around 4.5 million particles were extracted after template-based picking and subjected to several rounds of 2D classification. We selected 1,082,175 particles and obtained the initial 3D volumes using multi-class ab initio reconstruction. We further cleaned up 665,896 particles corresponding to a good 3D reconstruction using several rounds of hetero-refinement. Finally, 323,707 particles were selected and refined to a high resolution using non-uniform refinement. To further improve the map features, the volume corresponding to MBP was masked before local refinement. The final reconstruction had an overall resolution of 2.85 Å on the basis of the gold-standard FSC at 0.143.

For the SLC35B1(Q113F) AMP–PNP-bound structure, 33,714 of 34,801 micrographs had an estimated CTF resolution better than 6 Å and were selected for further image processing. Around 7.7 million particles were extracted after template-based picking and subjected to several rounds of 2D classification. Around 1.2 million particles were selected, and initial 3D volumes were obtained using multi-class ab initio reconstruction. We further cleaned up 590,082 particles corresponding to a good 3D reconstruction using several rounds of hetero-refinement. Finally, 332,121 particles were selected and refined to a high resolution using non-uniform refinement. To further improve the map features, reference-based motion correction was performed, and the volume corresponding to MBP was masked out before local refinements. The final reconstruction contained 329,709 particles and had an overall resolution of 3.0 Å on the basis of the gold-standard FSC at 0.143.

For the SLC35B1(E33A) AMP–PNP-bound structure, 33,579 of 34,144 micrographs had an estimated CTF resolution better than 6 Å and were selected for further image processing. Around seven million particles were extracted after template-based picking and subjected to several rounds of 2D classification. We selected 658,505 particles and obtained the initial 3D volume using multi-class ab initio reconstruction. We selected 313,397 particles and refined them to a high resolution using non-uniform refinement. To further improve the map features, reference-based motion correction was performed, and the volume corresponding to MBP was masked out before local refinements. A round of hetero-refinement was performed to further clean up the data, and a high-resolution reconstruction containing 223,502 particles was obtained after another round of local refinement. The final maps had an overall resolution of 3.0 Å on the basis of the gold-standard FSC at 0.143. The dataset for the ADP-bound SLC35B1(E33A) structure was also processed using CryoSPARC, as described for the other variants (Supplementary Fig. 6). A 3.16-Å resolution map was initially obtained after the local refinement from 306,109 particles with the transporter protein in an outward open conformation. A 3D variability analysis indicated the presence of several conformations; as such, 3D classification without alignment was performed using some of the frames from 3DVA as input volumes. For E33A, ADP-bound states for both the cytoplasmic-facing and luminal-facing conformations were obtained. MBP was masked, and local refinements were performed. The final reconstructions had overall resolutions of 3.15 and 3.12 Å.

The predicted AlphaFold 2 (ref. 44) model of human SLC35B1 was in the outward open conformation and showed poor side-chain fitting in the cryo-EM maps. To determine the protein conformational state, de novo model building into the apo SLC35B1 maps was instead performed using ModelAngelo software57. The output model was examined and manually adjusted using Coot58. The structure of the Fv fragment was also built de novo using ModelAngelo57 and manually examined and adjusted using Coot58. Because the density corresponding to MBP was masked during the 3D reconstruction, it could not be confidently built into the final maps. The final model containing the SLC35B1 transporter-Fv fragment was refined using real-space refinement in Phenix59.

For model building of the AMP–PNP-bound structure, the model of the apo SLC35B1 structure was fitted to the map density using the Fit in Map utility of ChimeraX60. AMP–PNP was modelled into the extra non-proteinaceous density present at the binding site using Coot58, and the model was refined in Phenix59 using real-space refinement. As the volume corresponding to Fv–MBP was masked during the 3D reconstruction, only the transporter was built into the AMP–PNP complex structure maps. Model building for the ADP-bound SLC35B1 and AMP–PNP-bound SLC35B1(Q113F) variants was also performed using the apo structure as a starting model, followed by manual adjustment in Coot58. Because MBP was masked during refinement, only Fv and the transporter domains were built. The models were refined in Phenix59 using real-space refinement.

For model building of the luminal-facing AMP–PNP- and ADP-bound SLC35B1(E33A) reconstructions, a model obtained from AlphaFold 2 (ref. 44) was fitted to the maps using ChimeraX60. The models were manually examined and adjusted using Coot58 and refined using Phenix59 real-space refinement. For the E33A-ADP cytoplasmic-facing reconstruction, the model of the SLC35B1 structure was fitted to the map. The model was manually adjusted using Coot and refined using Phenix real-space refinement. As MBP was masked out during data processing, only the Fv fragment was built and refined in the final maps of all the structures of the SLC35B1(E33A). Illustrations of the structure and cryo-EM maps were carried out in PyMOL61 and ChimeraX60.

Stepwise ATP translocation by human SLC35B1. Video showing the morph between the SLC35B1 cryo-EM structures of AMP-PNP bound in the cytoplasmic (WT) and ER luminal-facing (E33A) conformations. The transport domains are coloured in orange (TM1, TM2, TM8 and TM9) and teal (TM3, TM4a–b, TM6 and TM7). The conserved nucleotide-binding site residues are shown as sticks.

Metrics details

Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear1,2. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution3,4,5. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.

Cellular heterogeneity, including genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity, is pervasive in nature, yet insufficiently represented in ensemble behaviours of cell populations6,7,8. Stochastic processes in cells, such as the ones involved in transcription, translation, protein turnover and cell division, cause fluctuations in cellular components and in biochemical reactions that can drive phenotypic variability. Such stochastic variation may be buffered or amplified by deterministic factors, most of which are unknown9,10.

Phenotypic plasticity is a hallmark of cancer, and most tumours show genetic and non-genetic spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which affects adaptability and resistance to cancer therapies11,12. Classical Darwinian somatic evolution driven by mutations, selection and clonal expansion appears to be insufficient to fully explain cancer progression and responses to therapies13,14. Moreover, genomic lesions that shape cancer genome evolution and adaptation are typically not resolved within a single cell cycle but, instead, segregate into subsequent cell generations15,16. How genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity are intertwined and the dynamics with which phenotypic heterogeneity emerges and is propagated across cell generations are poorly understood.

Polyploidization by whole-genome duplication occurs frequently in cancer and is associated with enhanced phenotypic variability17,18. Polyploidization can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy19,20,21, which correlate with therapy resistance and poor patient outcomes22,23. Aneuploidy can arise through erroneous cell division, and asymmetric cell divisions promote cell-to-cell variability, including both genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity24,25. Alternative routes to polyploidization exist, but how they affect genome integrity and cellular variability between cancer cells remains unclear.

A main driver of carcinogenesis is oncogene-induced replication stress26. Endogenous and oncogene-induced replication stress give rise to heritable DNA lesions that are transmitted through cell division to daughter cells27. Such heritable lesions may be an inevitable consequence of stochastic replication origin activation, resulting in under-replicated DNA in large replicons of the human genome28. In daughter cells, inherited genomic lesions regulate G1 duration and determine the decision between quiescence and cell cycle commitment29,30,31,32,33. They are bound by the chromatin reader 53BP1, which protects them from nucleolytic degradation27 and regulates their replication timing in the next S phase34. While representing a paradigm for inheritance of genomic lesions, whether 53BP1-marked chromatin scars affect sister cell heterogeneity and are propagated to subsequent cell generations is unclear.

Here, to overcome limitations of cell tracking and complement genomics-focused retrospective analyses of cancer cell evolution, we devised an approach for quantitative multigenerational single-cell tracking and lineage analysis. The approach is based on endogenous protein labelling through CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing, tailored cell segmentation and tracking algorithms, and single-cell end-point measurements by iterative staining. Applied to various conditions of oncogenic replication stress and DNA damage, it provides time-resolved insights into damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell asymmetry, and sheds light on routes towards polyploidization and associated phenotypic variability that may contribute to cancer evolution.

To develop an experimental framework enabling simultaneous tracking of individual cells and their fates across multiple cell generations, we first used cells stably expressing ectopic H2B–GFP. The bright nuclear H2B–GFP signal facilitated software-assisted image segmentation, enabling us to define conditions for multi-day live-cell imaging and design custom scripts for semi-automated single-cell tracking (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To test whether multigenerational single-cell tracking could be combined with tracking DNA lesions in individual cells, we turned to cells stably expressing ectopic mEGFP–53BP1. The nuclear mEGFP–53BP1 signal was bright enough for automated image segmentation and cell tracking (Fig. 1a), and the appearance and disappearance of nuclear 53BP1 bodies resembling replication-stress-associated DNA lesions could be quantified in a time-resolved manner in the daughter and granddaughter cell generation and could be depicted as cell lineage trees (Fig. 1b).

Having established that endogenous DNA lesions marked by 53BP1 can be tracked quantitatively across multiple cell generations, we aimed to overcome limitations associated with ectopic protein overexpression by using CRISPR–Cas9-engineered cells containing the coding sequence for mScarlet-I in-frame with the last exon of TP53BP133. To combine time-resolved measurements of heritable DNA lesions with DNA replication patterns, we also tagged the replication factor PCNA by CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knock-in of mEmerald in frame with the last exon (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). The engineered double-tagged cells showed normal proliferation, unperturbed cell cycle profiles and a normal response to DNA damage compared to the parental cells (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d–f). No detectable phototoxicity was observed in time-lapse microscopy experiments, as measured by cell cycle profiling, EdU incorporation and cell-cycle-resolved analysis of the DNA damage marker γH2AX (Extended Data Fig. 1g–i). Like mEGFP–53BP1 cells, endogenous DNA lesions could be measured with sufficient resolution using the endogenous 53BP1 protein signal (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and 53BP1–mScarlet formed nuclear repair condensates at endogenous DNA lesions and at sites of induced DNA damage (Fig. 1d). The endogenous 53BP1 foci detected through the mScarlet signal co-localized with foci from 53BP1 immunofluorescence, and their specificity was validated by 53BP1 knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). The endogenous PCNA–mEmerald signal marked regions of active replication in S phase, which were confined to EdU-positive cells (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). Segmentation of the PCNA replication pattern enabled cell cycle staging in single-cell lineages of asynchronously growing cells (Fig. 1f–h), and cell cycle distributions based on PCNA replication patterns from live-cell imaging closely matched cell cycle distributions based on 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI)/EdU profiles from fixed cell populations (Fig. 1i–k and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Moreover, the endogenous PCNA signal in the double-tagged cells could be used for multigenerational cell tracking (Supplementary Video 1).

Next, we tracked a cohort of asynchronously growing cells for 30 h and performed in silico alignment of the cell lineages according to cell cycle position based on the PCNA signal (Extended Data Fig. 3a). As expected, 53BP1 nuclear bodies marking regions of inherited endogenous replication stress appeared primarily after cell division in G1 and were cleared as cells entered S phase (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). By contrast, when mild replication stress was induced by a low dose (200 nM) of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (APH), which did not induce measurable amounts of DNA damage as detected by western blot analysis of the DNA damage markers phosphorylated KAP1 (pKAP1) and pRPA (Extended Data Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 1), 53BP1 foci formation was slightly enhanced and occurred not only in G1 cells but also during S-phase progression (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Inhibition of the central checkpoint kinase ATR resulted in more severely perturbed replication patterns and in elevated 53BP1-marked genomic lesions after cell division (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). ATR inhibition was also associated with DNA damage as detected by pKAP1 and pRPA (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Consistent with the perturbed replication patterns observed in single cells after APH and ATR inhibitor (ATRi) treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3e,g), cell population based EdU profiles were also altered (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Both treatments resulted in increased PCNA foci in cells, which, according to EdU and DNA content, would be classified as G2, indicating replication-stress-induced DNA synthesis beyond normal S phase (Supplementary Fig. 2a–d).

To extend these analyses to additional stress markers, including post-translational protein modifications inaccessible for live-cell imaging, we combined multigenerational time-lapse microscopy for lineage analyses with sequential immunofluorescence staining35 of the tracked cells in a cell-cycle-resolved manner, that is, live + quantitative image-based cytometry (Live+QIBC); Extended Data Fig. 4a). For multiplexing after live imaging, we focused on γH2AX, a DNA damage-induced histone phosphorylation, on pRb as a marker of cell cycle commitment after cell division, on the tumour suppressor protein p53, which is stabilized after DNA damage, and on its downstream target, the CDK inhibitor p21. All markers showed nuclear signals that could be eluted efficiently (Extended Data Fig. 4b). No cross-talk between sequential stainings was observed, as demonstrated by the inversely correlated signals of pRb and p21 when imaged in the same colour channel (Extended Data Fig. 4c–e). Overall, APH and ATRi treatments increased the levels of γH2AX, p53 and p21, and reduced pRb (Extended Data Fig. 4f–i), and treatment effects on single cells could be analysed in a cell-cycle-resolved manner on the basis of the DAPI signal (Extended Data Fig. 4j).

We combined single-cell tracks from multigenerational live-cell imaging for 55 h, covering up to three cell generations, with end-point measurements obtained by sequential staining. As before (Extended Data Fig. 3), unchallenged asynchronously growing cells had comparatively sharp cell cycle phase transitions, daughter cells showed little heterogeneity in G1 duration and S-phase onset after cell division, and the nuclear area increased gradually during the cell cycle until mitosis (Fig. 2a,b). DNA damage levels measured by 53BP1 were low and mostly confined to G1, and the granddaughter cell generation had background levels of γH2AX, p53 and p21, and high pRb. By contrast, asynchronously growing cells treated with a low dose of APH when they were in G2 showed perturbed S-phase entry in the daughter cell generation, with seemingly normal S-phase exit into G2 and normal cell division (Fig. 2c). However, compared with untreated cells, the granddaughter cells had elevated γH2AX and p53 levels, and individual granddaughter cells showed high p21 and low pRb, which was associated with defective S-phase commitment (Fig. 2c). When asynchronously growing cells were treated with ATRi in G2, the next cell cycle seemed prolonged, with sister cells showing perturbed DNA replication and heterogeneity in S-phase duration, as well as 53BP1 foci formation, and γH2AX and p21 induction (Fig. 2d).

Sequential staining intensities from individual cells of the lineage and mean intensities from the corresponding reference populations are shown. For the box plots, the box limits show the interquartile range (IQR, 25th percentile (Q1) to 75th percentile (Q3)), the median (centre line) and the whiskers define the lower and upper adjacent value; the dots show outliers smaller than Q1 − 1.5 × IQR and greater than Q3 + 1.5 × IQR; n > 35 end-point measurements per sample. Drugs in c and d were removed after 24 h.

Cells that received APH during S-phase progression showed S-phase prolongation and signs of DNA synthesis in an extended G2 phase, yet their progeny entered S phase seemingly normally (Extended Data Fig. 5a). However, cells that received ATRi during S-phase showed G2 acceleration and increased sustained 53BP1 foci in the next cell generation, associated with heterogenous and strongly impaired S-phase entry (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Finally, cells that received APH before S-phase entry in G1 showed greatly prolonged cell cycle duration without further cell division during the 55 h of the experiment (Extended Data Fig. 5c), whereas sister cells that received ATRi in G1 exhibited asymmetric S-phase duration and DNA damage accumulation, which was associated with p21 induction and loss of pRb (Extended Data Fig. 5d). When scored across multiple sister cell pairs, sister cell heterogeneity was increased at the level of 53BP1 nuclear bodies, γH2AX levels, and p53 and p21 induction (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Other markers of impaired cell cycle progression and increased heterogeneity were also elevated after APH or ATRi treatment, including perturbed replication (assessed by PCNA patterns), periods with highly elevated nuclear 53BP1 foci and reduced numbers of cell division during the time-lapse imaging period (Supplementary Fig. 2e).

Considering the observed p53–p21 induction and their tumour-suppressive functions, we performed multigenerational cell tracking after p53 or p21 depletion. Both knockdowns seemed to accelerate cell cycle progression and to synergize with APH and ATRi to cause perturbed replication, increased DNA damage and enhanced cellular heterogeneity (Supplementary Fig. 3a–k and Supplementary Fig. 4a–i). Moreover, depletion of the tumour suppressor AMBRA1, which controls the G1/S transition through cyclin D regulation36,37,38, synergized with APH and especially ATRi (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).

Collectively, these results shed light onto how replication stress (here induced by APH or ATRi), defective checkpoint signalling (here induced by ATRi) or loss of tumour suppressor functions (here induced by p53, p21 or AMBRA1 depletion) induce cellular heterogeneity. Although analysed merely at the phenotypic level, it is conceivable that such changes may accelerate cellular transformation and evolution of drug resistance.

To validate these findings in an independent cell system, we used CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome engineering to fluorescently label endogenous 53BP1 and PCNA in hTERT-immortalized, non-cancer RPE-1 cells. Endogenous 53BP1–mScarlet foci were easily detectable, induced after ionizing radiation (IR), could be segmented, co-localized with antibody-stained 53BP1 and were specific as revealed by 53BP1 knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Endogenous PCNA–mEmerald patterns in RPE-1 cells were also detectable, could be segmented and marked EdU-positive S-phase cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c–e). Similar to U-2 OS cells, APH and ATRi increased γH2AX, p53 and p21 levels, and reduced pRb (Extended Data Fig. 6f–i), with APH hampering more the G2/M transition, as judged by the increase in 4N cells with low pRb and high p21, and ATRi causing cells to accumulate in G1 with low pRb and high p21 (Extended Data Fig. 6f–i). This is consistent with APH-mediated slowing of DNA replication and ATRi-mediated inhibition of the G2/M checkpoint. Similar to U-2 OS cells, APH caused mild and ATRi more severe DNA damage, as measured by KAP1 phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 6j). Tracking of endogenously tagged RPE-1 cells across multiple cell generations was possible yet more difficult owing to their high motility (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Moreover, iterative staining was complicated by their loose attachment, resulting in cell loss during sequential rounds of washing and signal elution. Nevertheless, single-cell lineages confirmed the main phenotypes observed in U-2 OS cells, including asymmetric S-phase onset and perturbed replication patterns in individual sister cells after APH, ATRi and IR (Supplementary Fig. 7b–e).

To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity, we first performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, revealing differentially expressed genes after IR-induced DNA damage (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We found that DNA damage response and cell cycle regulating genes were enriched (Extended Data Fig. 7b), with CDKN1A (encoding p21), FAS, GADD45A and MDM2 being among the most highly induced genes (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7c). By contrast, TP53BP1 expression was not significantly induced (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7c), consistent with its constitutive expression and mechanism of action through recruitment to sites of DNA damage. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis showed very similar (Extended Data Fig. 7d) and reproducible effects (Extended Data Fig. 7e). A clustering analysis of the scRNA-seq results revealed primarily genes involved in DNA replication, repair and cell division as main drivers of DNA-damage-induced cellular heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 7f–h). We next analysed highly variable genes in the unchallenged and IR-treated conditions by computing the mean and s.d. of the normalized expression values and performing a linear fit of the log2-transformed s.d. versus the log2-transformed mean (Extended Data Fig. 7i). Highly variable genes were identified as those of which the residual of the fit was above 0.5. Significantly more highly variable genes were found in the IR-treated condition compared with in the untreated condition, including some genes of the DNA damage response pathway, which are highlighted by closed circles (Fig. 3b). Further analysis showed that genes with high variability (residuals above 0.5) only in the IR condition were predominantly involved in cell cycle regulation (Fig. 3c), suggesting that DNA damage-induced increased cellular heterogeneity is linked to cell-to-cell differences in cell cycle control.

Source data

To investigate potential sources of non-genetic heterogeneity beyond induced gene expression changes, we turned to 53BP1, the expression of which was not significantly changed after DNA damage (Extended Data Fig. 7c). 53BP1 requires self-association through its oligomerization domain for foci formation at sites of DNA damage and shows features of phase separation, which is greatly affected by protein concentration33,39. Consistently, we found that nuclear 53BP1 concentration, at the single-cell level (analysed specifically in G1 cells to avoid interference from DNA replication), limits 53BP1 foci formation in response to increasing doses of IR (Fig. 3d). Consistently, we identified single-cell lineages, in which nuclear 53BP1 levels correlated with the strength of 53BP1 foci formation after IR in sister cells (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these results suggest that 53BP1 recruitment is limited by its nuclear concentration, and that heterogeneity in 53BP1 between individual cells impacts the response to DNA damage. Consistent with 53BP1 being limiting for the response to DNA damage at single-cell level, when cells were pretreated with ATRi to trigger replication stress-induced 53BP1 condensates in G1 cells, before acute DNA damage induction by IR, the formation of ATRi-induced 53BP1 condensates impaired the 53BP1 response to acute DNA damage (Fig. 3f). Different from γH2AX foci, which showed an additive increase after ATRi and IR, 53BP1 recruitment to IR-induced breaks was reduced due to its sequestration at replication stress-induced DNA lesions, which in turn resulted in IR-induced γH2AX foci not being served by 53BP1 (Fig. 3f).

To investigate further how a singular event of acute DNA damage affects cellular heterogeneity, we focused on IR. As IR, in principle, induces DNA strand breaks at random sites in replicating genomes, which can lead to non-symmetric damage loads in duplicated DNA, we deliberately focused on cells that received IR in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. DNA breakage in G1 and their subsequent repair, indicated by the induction and disappearance of 53BP1 foci, was associated with pronounced heterogeneity in the next cell generation between sister cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Similar effects could be observed in RPE-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7e).

To test whether we could recapitulate these findings in a larger cohort of cells, we sequentially pulse-labelled asynchronously growing cell populations with EdU and BrdU to identify cells that, at the time of irradiation, were in G1 and that had then, after transient cell cycle arrest, gone through a complete cell cycle until being analysed in their next G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Notably, the irradiated cycled cells had more 53BP1 nuclear bodies in G1 compared with their controls (Extended Data Fig. 8c), consistent with the live-cell tracking data. As IR causes not only DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), but can, through direct and indirect routes, induce a variety of DNA lesions, we used DSB inducible via AsiSI (DIvA) cells for endonuclease-mediated DSB formation40. DSBs were induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) as measured by 53BP1 and γH2AX foci formation, and most of these foci disappeared after indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-mediated degradation of the AsiSI endonuclease fused to an auxin-inducible degron, indicating repair (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). 4-OHT-induced repairable DSBs were also detected by live imaging of DIvA cells, and they were associated with DNA lesions and sister cell heterogeneity in daughter and granddaughter cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f), similar to IR-induced DNA breaks. Likewise, cycled DIvA cells after transient AsiSI induction had more 53BP1 nuclear bodies in G1 compared with their uninduced controls (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Consistent effects were observed in RPE-1 cells, especially after p53 loss (Extended Data Fig. 8h).

When we quantified cellular heterogeneity across multiple pairs of tracked sister cells of which the parental cells had received IR in G1, sister cell asymmetry was increased at several levels (53BP1, γH2AX, p53, p21) compared with the untreated control cells (Extended Data Fig. 8i and Supplementary Fig. 8b). Thus, even a single, transient genotoxic event in the parental DNA may result in a persistent genomic scar that affects cell cycle commitment and replication timing in the next cell generation, leading to increased asymmetry between sister cells and increased phenotypic heterogeneity within a cell population. Alternatively, damaged DNA might sequester proteins with dual functions in DSB repair and replication fork protection away from replication factories, thereby affecting replication fidelity indirectly, or aberrant repair processes such as breakage–fusion–bridge events might induce sister cell heterogeneity. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and they jointly imply that a single genotoxic event can induce heterogeneity and lasting phenotypic changes in a cell population.

One way to rapidly increase phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells is through polyploidization17,18. Polyploidization can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, which are frequently observed in cancers19,20,21 and which correlate with therapy resistance and poor patient outcomes22,23. Using time-resolved single-cell tracking, based on the PCNA signal, we observed examples of notably asymmetric replication patterns in sister cells, such as two rounds of replication without cell division in one of the two sister cells, which in principle could cause polyploidization in this branch (Extended Data Fig. 8j). To assess potential routes towards polyploidization in more detail, we used the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor pevonedistat (MLN4924, TAK924), a first-in-class anticancer drug that induces DNA rereplication, that is, the replication of already replicated DNA resulting in replication bubbles within larger replicons, through CDT1 stabilization41,42,43. Consistently, pevonedistat caused polyploidization in multiple cancer and non-cancer cell lines, which was associated with replication stress and an increase in nuclear size (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a–e). Moreover, single-cell tracking combined with sequential staining and DAPI-based DNA content measurements confirmed continuous replication patterns and polyploidization, in agreement with rereplication (Fig. 4b). However, tracking of sister cells also revealed distinct, asymmetric replication patterns consistent with endoreplication (also referred to as endoreduplication or endocycling, meaning multiple rounds of DNA replication without cell division) (Fig. 4c,d). Thus, two mechanistically distinct routes may lead to pevonedistat-induced polyploidization, rereplication and endoreplication (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 9f–j).

To assess whether the route towards increased ploidy matters for genome stability, we compared the DNA damage markers obtained through sequential staining after cell tracking in polyploid cells that had gone through either rereplication or endoreplication. Despite analysing cells with comparable DNA content after rereplication versus endoreplication, rereplicating cells acquired consistently higher DNA damage markers than cells that had gone through endoreplication (Fig. 4g–k). Similar results were obtained when polyploidization was induced by depletion of the replication inhibitor and CDT1 antagonist geminin44,45 (Extended Data Fig. 9k–p).

Next, to address whether activation of common oncogenes might induce similar patterns of phenotypic heterogeneity and polyploidization, we generated cell lines that, in addition to expressing endogenously tagged 53BP1 and PCNA, overexpress oncogenic H-RAS V12 (HRAS) or cyclin E1 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). As expected, overexpression of HRAS or cyclin E1 induced replication stress, which was associated with reduced replication fork speed and an increase in micronuclei formation (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). Using these cell lines, we performed single-cell tracking and lineage analysis over 70 h, covering up to four cell generations (Extended Data Fig. 10e). Oncogene overexpression not only markedly increased cellular heterogeneity and sister cell asymmetry compared with the control, but also resulted in enhanced polyploidization (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 10e–h). Induction of polyploidy in HRAS and cyclin E1 cells was further increased by IR (Extended Data Fig. 11a–d). Supporting their proliferative potential, polyploid cells showed EdU incorporation (Extended Data Fig. 11d) and could be followed by live-cell microscopy through multiple rounds of cell division (Extended Data Fig. 11e). Notably, oncogene-induced polyploidization occurred by either rereplication or endoreplication, similar to pevonedistat-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 11f). Consistently, polyploidization was observed in RPE-1 cells with inducible cyclin E1 (Extended Data Figs. 11g,h and 12a,b). Taken together, these results suggest that routes towards polyploidization in interphase involve both rereplication and endoreplication induced by the same oncogenic triggers. We noticed that endoreplication in HRAS- and cyclin-E1-overexpressing cells was associated with increased DNA damage, marked by elevated 53BP1 foci, after the first and before the second round of DNA replication (Fig. 5a). Similarly, cells that were irradiated in G2 showed more frequent endoreplication compared with cells that were irradiated in G1, whereas the opposite was true for replication patterns indicative of rereplication (Extended Data Fig. 12c). DNA damage experienced early in the cell cycle therefore increases the risk of replication stress and rereplication in the ensuing S phase, while DNA damage experienced late in the cell cycle increases the risk of endoreplication.

Having observed that both routes cause aberrant genome duplication yet by different mechanisms and at different costs for genome integrity, we investigated differential gene expression patterns among polyploid cells. To this end, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for scRNA-seq analysis of polyploid and non-polyploid (2N–4N) cells after pevonedistat treatment or HRAS overexpression, comparing them to non-polyploid empty vector (EV) control cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Reassuringly, the polyploid HRAS and pevonedistat-treated cells segregated from the EV and their non-polyploid (2N–4N) control populations (Fig. 5b). For both, polyploid HRAS and pevonedistat-treated cells, differentially regulated genes were identified (Supplementary Fig. 9b,c and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Despite the difference in treatment, 150 differentially regulated genes were common between the HRAS and pevonedistat-treated polyploid cells (Supplementary Fig. 9d,e). We then performed a subcluster analysis of the HRAS polyploid cells (Fig. 5c). Pairwise analysis of differential gene expression between the subclusters followed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed cell cycle regulation and chromosome segregation during mitosis as well as DNA replication and DNA damage signalling consistently as the most highly enriched GO terms, in agreement with these processes being relevant for polyploidization (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). Performing the same subcluster analysis for pevonedistat-treated polyploid cells yielded very similar results with the same highly enriched GO terms (Supplementary Fig. 10d–f). We therefore focused on the overlap between the HRAS and pevonedistat-treated polyploid samples and particularly on the four subclusters with the strongest differential gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 11). Among those four subclusters, 148 differentially regulated genes were identified using a cut-off of 0.001 for false-discovery rate (FDR) and P value and a fold-change (FC) cut-off of 1.5 (Supplementary Fig. 12a and Supplementary Table 3). A GO analysis of this group of genes yielded terms related to cell cycle regulation and chromosome segregation as the most significantly enriched terms (Supplementary Fig. 12b). Similar results were obtained from an independent replicate scRNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Fig. 12c–f). Using more stringent criteria for FC, FDR and P values (FC > 4, FDR < 0.00001, P < 0.00001), we extracted 28 genes from the original list of 148 genes, which were most significantly deregulated among the subclusters (Supplementary Table 4). These 28 genes were still enriched for GO terms related to cell cycle and mitotic cell division (Fig. 5d) and showed high connectivity in functional network analysis (Fig. 5e). In total, 22 of these 28 genes were identified in the independent replicate scRNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Table 4). At the centre of this network are the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1, cyclin A, aurora kinase B (AURKB) and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 12g,h). To further explore the functional relevance of this network, we analysed nuclear cyclin A expression at protein level using QIBC and observed distinct subpopulations among polyploid cells with high/low nuclear cyclin A levels (Fig. 5f). Moreover, while pevonedistat induced both endoreplication and rereplication (with roughly identical shares), TOP2A inhibition by etoposide induced predominantly rereplication, whereas CDK1 inhibition by RO3306 caused mainly endoreplication (Fig. 5g). These differences were reflected by the cell cycle patterns of chromatin-bound MCM2, MCM4 and MCM7, constitutive components of the replicative helicase MCM2-7: while etoposide caused heterogenous MCM chromatin loading in S phase and G2, consistent with rereplication during S phase and endoreplication after S-phase completion, CDK1 inhibition by RO3306 primarily caused new loading of MCM in late S/G2, consistent with endocycles (Supplementary Fig. 12i–l). Thus, the identified gene network has functional implications for polyploidization by endoreplication versus rereplication.

Cellular heterogeneity is widespread in nature, yet how it emerges remains poorly understood. Stochasticity is involved in replication origin activation, and multiprotein complexes like the replisome show inherent stochastic behaviour at the molecular level46. Moreover, sister cell heterogeneity after replication stress experienced in the previous cell cycle may result from mosaic inheritance of new DNA synthesized by leading- and lagging-strand synthesis, respectively47. Acute DNA damage experienced in G1 also induced sister cell heterogeneity in the next cell generation, including marked differences in S-phase commitment. Although strand-specific DNA lesion segregation, as previously observed for replication-associated damage, DNA single-strand breaks, UV-induced lesions and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage15,16,48,49,50,51,52, can contribute to sister cell heterogeneity, additional mechanisms probably exist. One possibility is the sequestration of proteins with dual functions in DNA damage repair and replication at DSBs, therefore limiting their availability at replication forks after S-phase entry, which in turn could trigger heritable strand-specific changes. Indeed, 53BP1 and its upstream regulators RNF8 and RNF168 are limiting for the response to DSBs53, and they are also involved in replication fork protection54,55. Conversely, sequestration of RNF8, RNF168 and 53BP1 at replication-stress-associated heritable DNA lesions in G1 can limit their ability to respond to acute DSBs, and asymmetric distribution of these proteins or their mRNAs during mitosis may amplify such limitations in individual sister cells.

Moreover, DNA damage-induced chromatin changes may have a more long-lasting effect on genome organization. Although controlled DSB induction in primary mouse cells did not cause persistent transcriptional repression56, chromatin alterations after completion of DSB repair in HeLa cells were recently found to manifest as heritable impairments of gene expression57. Moreover, changes in gene expression after micronucleus formation can become heritable after reincorporation of micronuclear DNA into the main daughter cell nucleus58. Similarly, DNA-damage-induced changes in genome organization, beyond the process and duration of genome repair, might affect replication timing in the next cell generation. Considering that replication stress is a major source of endogenous DNA damage, a transformative loop from replication perturbations to DNA damage-induced stable chromatin changes (epigenetic scars) might be induced, which could alter transcription programs and replication timing in the next cell cycle, thereby promoting further replication stress and fuelling cellular plasticity. Possible implications are that transient DNA lesions may have long-lasting effects on genome function through inducing and amplifying cellular heterogeneity.

All cell lines were grown at 37 °C under standard cell culture conditions (humidified atmosphere, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) containing 10% FBS (Corning) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotics.

U-2 OS and RPE-1 cells were reauthenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling in 2025 with 100% match and no detectable contamination (RRID: CVCL_0042 and CVCL_4388). All cell lines used in this study were grown in sterile conditions and routinely tested for mycoplasma.

The following compounds were used in this manuscript: aphidicolin (Sigma-Aldrich), ATRi (AZ-20, TOCRIS), CDKi RO3306 (Sigma-Aldrich), pevonedistat (MLN4924, Selleckchem), etoposide (Selleckchem), 4-OHT (Sigma-Aldrich), IAA (Sigma-Aldrich) and doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich). Transfections were performed with Ambion Silencer or Silencer Select siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a final concentration of 25 nM.

The following siRNAs were used (5′–3′): TP53BP1 (s14313; GAAGGACGGAGUACUAAUATT); GMNN (134697; GGAGUCAUUUGAUCUUAUGTT); CDKN1A (s416; GCACCCUAGUUCUACCUCATT); TP53 (s606; GAAAUUUGCGUGUGGAGUATT); and AMBRA1 (s31112; GCUCAACAAUAACAUUGAATT).

Cloning was done using chemically competent bacteria generated in-house, derived from Library Efficiency DH5a competent cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primer sequences are provided separately (Supplementary Table 5). Correct cloning and integration into target vectors was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth).

The mEmerald-P2A-BlasticidinR pUC18 template was cloned by a three-piece Gibson assembly. The pUC18 vector was linearized by PCR using primers pUC18_lin_fwd and pUC18_lin_rev. The mEmerald gene was amplified by two rounds of PCR from the mEmerald-C1 plasmid template (Addgene, 53975) using first primers mEm_GA_fwd and mEm_P2A_rev and the product amplified with GA_pUC18_fwd and mEm_P2A_rev. The blasticidin gene was amplified with primers BlastR_P2A_fwd and BlastR_pUC18_rev. The individual pieces were purified by gel extraction and assembled with Gibson assembly followed by transformation of the product, isolation of plasmids and verification by sequencing.

The sgRNA duplex to target Cas9 endonuclease in pX459 (Addgene, 48139) to the endogenous PCNA C-terminal near the stop codon was generated as described61. In brief, primers PCNA_sgRNA_top and PCNA_sgRNA_bot were phosphorylated with T4 phosphonucleotide kinase (NEB) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by a temperature gradient from 95 °C to 25 °C decreasing 5 °C min−1. The product was diluted 100-fold in water and assembled into the vector by Golden Gate assembly using BbsI (NEB) and T4 DNA ligase (NEB) through 12 cycles between 5 min at 37 °C and 5 min at 16 °C followed by transformation, plasmid isolation and sequencing verification of correct insertion.

The repair template for tagging endogenous PCNA by homology-directed repair was amplified by PCR from the mEmerald-P2A-BlasticidinR pUC18 plasmid generated as described above using Q5 (NEB) polymerase amplification with primers PCNA_HDR_mEm_fwd and PCNA_mEm_blst_rev followed by PCR purification with a QIAquick PCR purification column according to the manufacturer's instructions.

U-2 OS cells with endogenously tagged 53BP1–mScarlet were described previously33. RPE-1 cells with endogenously tagged 53BP1–mScarlet were generated in the same manner. These cell lines were then used as the starting point for endogenous tagging of PCNA with the monomeric green fluorescent protein mEmerald. A total of 40,000 cells was seeded into two wells of a six-well plate one day before transfection. The PCR amplified PCNA mEmerald-P2A-BlasticidinR HDR template and the pX459 Cas9 plasmid generated as described above were used for transfection. Then, 1 µg of the HDR template and 1 µg of the pX459 plasmid were diluted with 250 µl OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and mixed with 6 µl TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). pX459 without the HDR template was prepared similarly as a negative control. This was allowed to stand 15 min before adding it to the cells. Next, 24 h later, cells were transferred to 15 cm dishes. Then, 48 h after transfection, blasticidin (InvivoGen) was added to a final concentration of 4 µg ml−1 for selection the next 7 days. After selection and death of cells transfected without the HDR template, individual colonies were picked by trypsin detachment in cloning cylinders and transferred to a 96-well plate (Greiner µ-clear) for expansion and validation of the presence of green fluorescence. Clones with fluorescence were further expanded and cells collected for genomic PCR with the primers PCNA_genCterm_fwd and PCNA_genCterm_rev to confirm the insertion of DNA with a size corresponding to the mEmerald-P2A-BlasticidinR module by agarose gel electrophoreses imaged on Infinity ST5 Xpress v16.16d. To visualize endogenous 53BP1 and endogenous PCNA with minimal interference of their cellular functions, monoallelic targeting was considered sufficient. The mEmerald-C1 plasmid was a gift from M. Davidson (Addgene, 53975), pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) was a gift from F. Zhang (Addgene, 48139)61, pmScarlet-i_C1 was a gift from D. Gadella (Addgene, 85044)62.

For retroviral transduction, retroviral vectors pBABEneo-HRASV12, a gift from J. Debnath (Addgene, 71304)63 and pBABEneo were used. For them to be compatible with the stable PCNA–mEmerald 53BP1–mScarlet U-2 OS cells, the resistance of the pBABE plasmids was exchanged from neomycin to hygromycin. The pBABE_EV (EV = empty vector) and pBABE_HRAS V12 backbones were amplified by PCR amplification using primers Backbone_fwd and Backbone_rev while adding AscI and MfeI restriction sites. The HygroR insert was also generated by PCR amplification using primers Hygro_fwd and Hygro_rev, adding AscI and MfeI restriction sites. This was followed by incubation with DpnI (NEB) for 2.5 h at 37 °C. PCR-cleanup was done according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen). Both the backbones and HygroR inserts were incubated with AscI (NEB) for 10 h, followed by heat inactivation of the restriction enzyme at 80 °C for 20 min. This was followed by incubation with MfeI (NEB) for 10 h at 37 °C. Backbones were dephosphorylated using rSAP (NEB) for 1 h followed by gel purification (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen). The ligation of the backbones and HygroR inserts was done at 16 °C for 16 h. Transformation was performed using chemically competent DH5α generated in house, derived from Library Efficiency DH5α competent cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Correct sequences were confirmed by control digestion and sequencing.

The pBABEneo-cyclin E1 plasmid for retroviral transduction was a gift from P. Janscak (University of Zurich). To exchange the resistance from neomycin to hygromycin, the pBABE_cyclin E1 plasmid was linearized using primers pBABE_lin_fwd and pBABE_lin_rev. The insert was generated using the primers pBABE_Gibson_fwd and pBABE_Gibson_rev. After gel extraction, Gibson assembly and transformation were performed. Correct sequences were confirmed by control digestion and sequencing.

The pLVX-TetONE plasmid was linearized using the primers pLVX-TetONE_lin_rev and pLVX-TetONE_lin_fwd and the insert for cyclin E1 was amplified with primers pLVX-TetONE_to_cyclinE1_GA_amp_fwd and pLVX-TetONE_to_cyclinE1_GA_amp_rev. After gel extraction, Gibson assembly and transformation were performed. Correct insertion was confirmed by control digestion and sequencing.

For the generation of U-2 OS PCNA 53BP1 cells with overexpression of HRAS V12 or cyclin E1, the U-2 OS PCNA 53BP1 cells were used for retroviral transduction. For this, HEK293T Phoenix retrovirus producer cells for transduction were prepared by plating them 48 h before infection in DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (Corning) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotics (Gibco). For transduction, chloroquine was added to each plate of HEK293T Phoenix cells at a final concentration of 20 µM 1 h before transduction. For the formation of the calcium-phosphate-DNA co-precipitate deionized water, 10 µg DNA and CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 1.25 M were mixed for a final volume of 500 µl per 10 cm plate. This mix was added dropwise to 500 µl 2× HBS (50 mM HEPES (ChemieBrunschwig), 10 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 12 mM dextrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 280 mM NaCl (Merck), 1.5 mM Na2HPO4·7H2O (Merck)) solution while vortexing vigorously. After incubating for 5 min, the H2O/DNA/CaCl2/HBS mix was added dropwise to the HEK293T Phoenix cells and then gently distributed. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C under standard cell culture conditions (humidified atmosphere, 5% CO2), the medium was exchanged to fresh growth medium. Then, 48 h after transduction, the supernatant from the transfected HEK293T Phoenix cells was collected and centrifuged and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 8 µg ml−1. After removal of the medium from the target cells, the viral supernatant was added. After 3 h, the infection was repeated with fresh viral supernatant. After 24 h, the viral supernatant was exchanged to selection medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS (Corning), 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotics (Gibco), 4 µg ml−1 blasticidin (InvivoGen), 500 µg ml−1 geneticin (Gibco) and 100 µg ml−1 hygromycin B (Invitrogen)). After selection, the expression levels and functionality were validated by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis.

For the generation of RPE-1 cells with inducible overexpression of cyclin E1, RPE-1 cells expressing endogenously tagged PCNA–mEmerald and 53BP1–mScarlet were subjected to lentiviral transduction. For this, a DNA/CaCl2/H2O mix was prepared by mixing 6 µg of LTR plasmid and 6 µg of pCDN-LBH plasmid with 12 µg of oncogene-encoding plasmid with CaCl2 at a final concentration of 250 mM in H2O. To this mixture, 500 µl 2× HBS (50 mM HEPES (ChemieBrunschwig), 10 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 12 mM dextrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 280 mM NaCl (Merck), 1.5 mM Na2HPO4·7H2O (Merck)) was added dropwise, while vortexing. After incubating the precipitate for 5 min at room temperature, it was added to HEK293T cells and left overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The next day, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and cells were incubated again overnight. The virus was then collected on two consecutive days, the fractions were pooled and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and stored at 4 °C. The viral supernatant was diluted with medium 1:2 and added together with 8 µg ml−1 polybrene to the target cells. After overnight incubation, the virus-containing cell supernatant was replaced with fresh medium and cells were incubated for 48 h. Then, puromycin was added at a final concentration of 0.5 µg ml−1 for selection. After selection, the expression levels and functionality were validated by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis.

On the day before imaging, cells were seeded in Fluorobrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1896701) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning), penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) and GlutaMAX (Gibco) into 96-well µ-plates (Ibidi, 89626). In the case of RPE-1 PCNA–mEmerald 53BP1–mScarlet cells, before cell seeding, the 96-well imaging plates were coated with collagen diluted in water (1:50) (PureCol-S, 5015-20ML, Advanced Biomatrix) according to the protocol provided by the company. The plate was sealed with a Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Sigma-Aldrich, Z380059). Live-cell imaging of cells was done using a previously described automated widefield GE InCell Analyzer 2500HS high-content screening microscope33 with environmental control for gas (5% CO2 and 20% O2) and temperature (37 °C) using the GE InCell Analyzer 2500 V7.4 acquisition software. The system contains a seven-colour solid-state illuminator (SSI), a PCO-sCMOS camera system (16 bit, 2,048 × 2,048 pixel, pixel size 6.5 × 6.5 μm, readout speed: 272 MHz), two quad band-pass polychroic mirrors and single band-pass emission filters. For Live+QIBC experiments, the polychroic beam splitter BGOFR_1 (blue (excitation BP 390/22, emission BP 435/48), green (excitation, BP 473/28; emission, BP 511/23), orange (excitation, BP 542/30; emission, BP 597/45), far red (excitation, BP 631/28; emission, BP 684/24)) and a CFI Plan Apo Lambda ×20 Air objective (NA 0.75, WD 1.0 mm) with hardware autofocus were used. Single-plane widefield images were acquired at 100 ms exposure for green and 300 ms exposure for orange; no binning was performed. Nine fields per well were acquired at 30 min intervals for up to 72 h, with typically 2–3 wells per experimental condition and at least 3,000 cells seeded per well.

To irradiate the cells, the plate acquisition was temporarily paused for irradiation at 130 kvp for 33 s per 1 Gy of irradiation in a Faxitron Cabinet X-ray System Model RX-650. Unless indicated otherwise, irradiation was performed with 4 Gy. The addition of drugs was done likewise. At the end of the live imaging, cells were washed once with PBS followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 18 min, before being washed once more with PBS followed by storage at 4 °C until multiplex staining.

Cells fixed after live-cell imaging were processed for iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) as described previously35. The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min followed by washing with PBS. Cells were then stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min, washed with PBS and images of the fixed cells with endogenous labels and DAPI were acquired. The signals from the fluorescent proteins were removed by denaturation with elution buffer (0.5 M glycine (BioSolve Chemicals), 3 M urea (Eurobio Scientific), 3 M guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mM TCEP (Sigma-Aldrich) in water, pH 2.5) for 10 min, 2 times, followed by three washes with double-distilled H2O. Images were acquired to control for the loss of signal. The cells were then blocked and free cysteines were conjugated by incubation with sBS buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 150 mM maleimide (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h. After two washes with PBS the cells were incubated with 100 μl cBS (1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, pH 7.4) with primary antibodies anti-γH2AX (1:1,000, mouse, BioLegend 613402) and anti-pRb (1:500, rabbit, Cell Signaling Technologies, 8516S) for 2 h. After two PBS washes, cells were incubated with 100 µl cBS with secondary antibodies anti-mouse A488 (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11029) and anti-rabbit A647 (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21245) for 1 h. Finally, cells were stained with DAPI. Elution and acquisition of images after elution was repeated as above, followed by sBS blocking for 1 h and washing. Then cells were stained with anti-p21 (1:500, rabbit, Abcam, ab109520) and anti-p53 (1:500, mouse, Thermo Fisher Scientific, AHO0152) for 2 h. After two PBS washes, cells were incubated with anti-mouse A488 (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11029) and anti-rabbit A647 (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21245) for 1 h. For every staining or elution round, imaging buffer (700 mM N-acetyl-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) in double-distilled H2O, pH 7.4) was added before imaging. Imaging was performed using the automated widefield GE InCell Analyzer 2500HS high-content screening, which was also used for live-cell imaging (seven-colour SSI, PCO-sCMOS camera system (16 bit, 2,048 × 2,048 pixel, pixel size: 6.5 × 6.5 μm, readout speed: 272 MHz), two quad band-pass polychroic mirrors, single band-pass emission filters). The polychroic beam splitter BGOFR_1 (blue (excitation BP 390/22, emission BP 435/48), green (excitation BP 473/28, emission BP 511/23), orange (excitation BP 542/30, emission BP 597/45), far red (excitation BP 631/28, emission BP 684/24)) and a CFI Plan Apo Lambda ×20 Air objective (NA 0.75, WD 1.0 mm) were used, with hardware laser autofocus for acquisition of single plane images. No binning was performed. Nine fields per well were acquired, with typically 2–3 wells per experimental condition and at least 3,000 cells seeded per well. For all imaging and staining rounds the acquisition settings were kept constant.

Images from the live imaging were processed using a time-lapse script (https://github.com/AltmeyerLab/SingleCellTracking_Timelapse), which involves generation of .tif stacks and generation of Olympus ScanR Analysis (v.3.0.1, 3.2 and 3.3.0) compatible images. This was followed by custom conversion in Olympus ScanR Analysis software (v.3.0.1, 3.2 and 3.3.0) to generate the required metadata and the experiment file. Segmentation of cells was performed on a smoothened mask of the PCNA channel. Parameters for total and mean intensities of the two channels, nuclear area (1 pixel ≅ 0.1056 µm2), circularity factor, perimeter, elongation factor, foci counts for PCNA and 53BP1, integrated intensities of foci in each channel, time slices, well number, position, centre x coordinate and centre y coordinate were extracted and tabulated for each cell in every timeframe.

For alignment of 4i imaging data, an alignment script was used (https://github.com/AltmeyerLab/SingleCellTracking_Multiplex-Alignment), which renders images from multiple rounds of staining compatible with downstream analysis using the Olympus ScanR Analysis software (v.3.0.1, 3.2 and 3.3.0). Custom conversion and image analysis was performed with the Olympus ScanR Analysis software (v.3.0.1, 3.2 and 3.3.0). In addition to the parameters outlined above, the mean and total intensities for all stainings as well as γH2AX foci counts and integrated intensities of γH2AX foci were extracted and tabulated for each cell.

Tables with data from a field of view from the post-fixation 4i acquisition were appended to data from the live-cell imaging for the same field of view. The frame numbers and x–y coordinates were used as the basis for a previously published MATLAB (MathWorks, MATLAB R2019b, R2020b, R2023a) script to automatically generate live-cell tracks for each cell. The same script along with the ImageJ/Fiji 64-bit (v.1.53f, 1.53t, 1.54f, 1.54m) plugin ‘Manual Tracking' was used together with the corresponding image stacks to visualize, correct and manually reassign cells for lineage-based analysis. After reassignment, MATLAB scripts (both scripts are available at GitHub; https://github.com/AltmeyerLab/MatlabTracking/; script 1, Cell_tracking.m; and script 2, KeyDataExtractions.m) were used to generate lineage assignments and data from curated and reassigned cells was written into .csv files and loaded into TIBCO Spotfire (v.7.9.1, 10.10.1) for visualization of the lineage trees together with the post-fixation 4i data. For U-2 OS cells, at least 20 individual cell lineages per condition, corresponding to up to 80 granddaughter cells, were tracked. For RPE-1 cells, at least ten individual cell lineages per condition, corresponding to up to 40 granddaughter cells, were tracked. For all extended live-cell imaging experiments with lineage tracking and multiplex staining (Live+QIBC), at least two independent biological replicate experiments were performed. Area measurements are shown in pixel with 1 pixel ≅ 0.1056 µm2. In some instances, although the median and the complete Q1–Q3 range are shown for whole-population box plots associated with Live+QIBC results, not all individual values are displayed to allow for visualization of population effects with consistently scaled axes.

After validating that PCNA foci were mostly confined to EdU-positive S-phase cells, thresholds were established for S-phase categorization as well as for G1–S and S–G2 transitions based on live-cell tracking of untreated control cells. In brief, unchallenged cells transitioned from G1 to S phase quickly (typically within a 30-min interval), indicated by a marked increase in PCNA foci (≥10 foci). Likewise, unchallenged cells transitioned from S phase to G2 quickly (typically within 1–2 30-min intervals), indicated by a marked decrease in PCNA foci (≤4 foci). Thresholds were therefore defined as follows: 0–4 PCNA foci for G1; ≥10 PCNA foci for ≥2 consecutive timepoints for S phase (G1–S transition); ≤4 PCNA foci for ≥2 consecutive timepoints for G2 phase (S–G2 transition). Periods in between were considered transition periods.

53BP1 foci heterogeneity was evaluated on the basis of the endogenous 53BP1 foci in the F1 generation measured from the live imaging data. For the other markers, heterogeneity was evaluated from multiplexed end-point measurements. Three categories of sister cell heterogeneity were introduced based on the differences in foci counts or nuclear intensity levels; thresholds were dependent on the individual experiment: for Extended Data Fig. 5e, 53BP1 foci heterogeneity was categorized as follows: low (0–1 focus difference), medium (2–4 foci difference), high (>4 foci difference). γH2AX fluorescence intensity was categorized as follows: low (0–100 a.u. difference), medium (100–200 a.u. difference), high (>200 a.u. difference). p53 fluorescence intensity was categorized as follows: low (0–50 a.u. difference), medium (50–100 a.u. difference), high (>100 a.u. difference). p21 fluorescence intensity was categorized as follows: low (0–100 a.u. difference), medium (100–500 a.u. difference), high (>500 a.u. difference). For Extended Data Fig. 8i, 53BP1 foci heterogeneity was categorized as follows: low (0–1 focus difference), medium (2–4 foci difference), high (>4 foci difference). For γH2AX fluorescence intensity, heterogeneity was categorized as follows: low (0–50 a.u. difference), medium (50–100 a.u. difference), high (>100 a.u. difference). For p53 fluorescence intensity, heterogeneity was categorized as follows: low (0–200 a.u. difference), medium (200–500 a.u. difference), high (>500 a.u. difference). For pRb fluorescence intensity, heterogeneity was categorized as follows: low (0–500 a.u. difference), medium (500–1,000 a.u. difference), high (>1,000 a.u. difference). For Supplementary Fig. 8b, 53BP1 foci heterogeneity was categorized as follows: low (0–1 focus difference), medium (2–4 foci difference), high (>4 foci difference).

Automated multichannel widefield microscopy for high-content imaging and QIBC was performed using the Olympus ScanR High-Content Screening System as described previously33,64. The system is equipped with an inverted motorized Olympus IX83 microscope, a motorized stage, IR-laser hardware autofocus, a fast emission filter wheel with one set of band-pass filters for multi-wavelength acquisition (DAPI (excitation BP 395/25 or BP 390/22, emission BP 435/26), FITC (excitation BP 470/24 or BP 475/28, emission BP 515/30), TRITC (excitation BP 550/15 or BP 555/28, emission BP 595/40), Cy5 (excitation BP 640/30 or BP 635/22, emission BP 705/72)), and a Hamamatsu ORCA-FLASH 4.0 V2 sCMOS camera (12 bit, 2,048 × 2,048 pixel, pixel size 6.5 × 6.5 μm) with a ×40 UPLSAPO (NA 0.9, WD 0.18 mm), a ×20 UPLSAPO (NA 0.75, WD 0.6 mm) and a ×10 UPLSAPO (NA 0.4, WD 3.1 mm) air objective. Images of cell populations were acquired under non-saturating conditions (Olympus ScanR Image Acquisition software (v.3.0.1, 3.2 and 3.3.0)), typically 25 (5 × 5) to 81 (9 × 9) images per well, depending on the objective and cell density, and identical settings were applied to all samples within one experiment. Hardware and software autofocus on the DAPI channel were used. No binning was performed. Images were analysed using the inbuilt Olympus ScanR Analysis software (v.3.0.1, 3.2 and 3.3.0), a dynamic background correction was applied and nucleus segmentation was performed using an integrated intensity-based object detection module based on the DAPI signal. Downstream analyses were focused on properly detected nuclei containing a 2N–4N DNA content as measured by total and mean DAPI intensities, unless increased ploidy in cells with >4N DNA content was also analysed. Fluorescence intensities were quantified and are depicted as arbitrary units. Colour-coded scatterplots of asynchronous cell populations were generated with TIBCO Spotfire (v.7.9.1, 10.10.1). Within one experiment, similar cell numbers were compared for the different conditions. For visualizing discrete data in scatterplots, mild jittering (random displacement of data points along discrete data axes) was applied to demerge overlapping datapoints. Representative scatterplots and quantifications of independent experiments, typically containing several thousand cells each, are shown.

A Leica THUNDER (Las X 3.7.6.25997) Imager 3D Live Cell system was used for DNA fibre analysis. The system is equipped with a Leica DMi8 inverted widefield microscope, a motorized stage, a Leica LED8 light source (390 nm, 440 nm, 475 nm, 510 nm, 555 nm, 575 nm, 635 nm, 747 nm) and a Leica monochrome fluorescence DFC9000 GTC sCMOS camera (12/16 bit, 2,048 × 2,048 pixel, pixel size: 6.5 × 6.5 μm). Dual-labelled DNA fibres (Alexa Fluor 488 and 555) were imaged with the 475 nm and 555 nm LEDs, the DFT5 Quad filter (excitation filters: 375–407, 462–496, 542–566, 622–654; main beam splitter: 415, 500, 572, 660; emission filters: 420–450, 506–532, 581–607, 666–724), additional emission filters 535/70 and 642/80 from an external clean-up filter wheel, and a Leica HC PL APO CS2 (NA 1.4, WD 0.14 mm) ×63 oil objective.

For standard immunofluorescence staining, high-content microscopy and QIBC analyses, cells were seeded on sterile 12 mm glass coverslips or 96-well plates and were allowed to proliferate until they reached a cell density of 70–90%. Cells were then fixed in 3% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature, washed once in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, washed twice in PBS and incubated in blocking solution (filtered DMEM containing 10% FBS (Corning) and 0.02% sodium azide (Merck)) for 15 min at room temperature. When the staining was combined with an EdU Click-iT reaction, the reaction was performed before the incubation with the primary antibody according to manufacturer's recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Where indicated, cells were pre-extracted in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 2 min on ice before formaldehyde fixation. Denaturing, where indicated, was performed in 2.5 M HCl for 10 min. All primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 555, 568, 647 anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-goat and anti-rat IgG, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were diluted 1:500 in blocking solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 10 min with DAPI (0.5 mg ml−1) in PBS at room temperature. After three washing steps in PBS, the coverslips were briefly washed with distilled water and mounted onto 6 µl Mowiol-based mounting medium (Mowiol 4.88 (Calbiochem) in glycerol/Tris), whereas the wells of the 96-well plates were kept filled with PBS.

Proteins were separated by standard SDS–PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies over night at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed again three times with PBS-T and protein signals were detected using ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an OPTIMAX X-Ray Film Processor (PROTEC Medizintechnik). To enable detection of multiple target proteins on the same membrane without stripping (typically 2–3 target proteins per membrane with sufficiently distinct molecular weight), membranes were cut horizontally, each piece was probed with specific primary and secondary antibodies, and the membrane was then reassembled for ECL detection. Original western blot scans are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs were seeded at single-cell density and exposed to the indicated drugs at the indicated final concentrations. All conditions were performed in triplicates. Cells were then incubated for 10 days and the number of colonies with more than 50 cells was counted after staining with crystal violet (0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 20% ethanol). GraphPad Prism (v.9 and 10) was used to display clonogenic survival data.

For SORT-seq, cells were sorted on a FACS Aria III 5L (FACS Diva Software v.8.0.1) system equipped with a 488 nm laser line. For the polyploidy dataset, pevonedistat-treated cells were treated with 175 nM of pevonedistat for 24 h. Before single-cell sorting, all live cells were incubated for 1 h with a final concentration of 5 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All reagents used until the moment of sorting also contained 5 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the scSeq dataset, where IR-treated cells were compared to untreated cells, U-2 OS cells were treated with 4 Gy of IR 48 h before sorting or left untreated. Cells were sorted into 384-well plates that were acquired from Single Cell Discoveries (Bio-Rad, HSP3801), each well containing 10 µl sterile mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich, M5310) and 50 nl DNA oligo primer (Sigma-Aldrich, M8410). Cells with increased ploidy were gated according to their Hoechst signal and, as a reference for the whole population, the gate was adjusted in the same sample. After sorting, plates were immediately centrifuged and placed on dry ice. They were stored at -80 °C and were shipped on dry ice to Single Cell Discoveries, where scRNA-seq was performed according to an adapted version of the SORT-seq protocol65 with primers described previously66. Cells were heat-lysed at 65 °C followed by cDNA synthesis. After second-strand cDNA synthesis, all of the barcoded material from one plate was pooled into one library and amplified using in vitro transcription (IVT). After amplification, library preparation was performed according to the CEL-Seq2 protocol67 to prepare a cDNA library for sequencing using TruSeq small RNA primers (Illumina). The DNA library was paired-end sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 system, high output, with the 1 × 75 bp Illumina kit (read 1: 26 cycles, index read: 6 cycles, read 2: 60 cycles).

During sequencing, read 1 was assigned 26 bp and was used to identify the Illumina library barcode, cell barcode and UMI. Read 2 was assigned 60 bp and was used to map to the reference genome Homo sapiens GRCh38.p13 with STARSolo (v.2.7.10b)68. In brief, mapping and generation of count tables were automated using the STARSolo v.2.7.10b and aligner. For mapping, no UMI cut-off was used and intronic reads were not included. Multi-gene reads were not counted. Unsupervised clustering and differential gene expression analysis was performed with the Seurat R toolkit69. For this, logarithmic normalization was applied, which normalizes to the total RNA counts in each cell. This approach consists of dividing each raw UMI count by the total detected RNAs in that cell, multiplying by a scale factor (10,000), adding a pseudocount (1) and performing log transformation. For visualization of the t-SNE, the clustering algorithm used was the original Louvain algorithm where the first 19 principal components were used with a k parameter of 30 and a resolution of 0.5.

Subclustering of the polyploid samples was performed with Louvain resolution of 0.5 for both samples with 50 principal components as identified by principal component analysis. Differential gene expression analysis for all comparisons was done using the Venice method, a nonparametric statistical test for single-cell data70 in BioTuring BBrowser X software (BioTuring). Tables were extracted and plotted in TIBCO Spotfire (v.7.9.1, v.10.10.1). For the AUCellScores the integrated tool in BioTuring BBrowser X was used. For GO-analysis, ShinyGO (v.0.77 and v.0.80) available online (https://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/)71 was used. For generation of Venn diagrams, the tool InteractiVenn (https://www.interactivenn.net)72 was used.

The data analysis for the replicate samples was done as described above, except that a different version of the mapper STARSolo (v.2.7.11b)68 was used. For subclustering of the polyploid cells of the replicate sample, a Louvain resolution of 0.5 was used for the HRAS polyploid sample and a Louvain resolution of 1.0 was used for the Pevo polyploid sample. Sequencing raw data and processed Poisson-corrected data files for both replicates of the polyploidy data set are accessible on GEO (GSE255874).

Cell clustering analysis of the IR-treated samples was performed with the Seurat R Bioconductor package69, using the SC transformed counts generated using the ‘v2' vst flavour, with Louvain resolution of 0.6 and the first 20 principal components as identified by principal component analysis, for both samples. Dimension reduction was performed using the UMAP method, using the first 20 principal components. Differential expression was performed between treated versus untreated cells using the FindMarkers() function, using the option to return only positive genes. Enriched pathways per cluster were generated using the enrichGO function of the clusterProfiler Bioconductor R package73 or the Enrichr gene list enrichment analysis tool74, using the marker genes identified per cluster from the FindMarkers() function. All R functions were executed on R v.4.4.2 (https://www.R-project.org) and Bioconductor v.3.20. All scRNA-seq and SORT-seq analyses were performed on two independent sets of samples. Sequencing raw data and processed data files for the IR-treated versus UT dataset are accessible on GEO (GSE288487).

Cells were treated for 24 h with 4 Gy of IR or left untreated. RNA was extracted from triplicate samples using the TRIzol RNA MiniPrep Plus Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted RNA was prepared for sequencing by the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ) using the Illumina TruSeq Total RNA Library Prep assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system using the S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (100 cycles) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Demultiplexing was performed using the Illumina bcl2fastq Conversion Software (v.2.20.0.422). Individual library sizes ranged from 22 million to 52 million reads.

RNA-seq analysis was performed using the SUSHI framework75, which encompassed the following steps: read quality was inspected using FastQC, and sequencing adaptors were removed using fastp76; pseudoalignment and transcriptomic counts of the RNA-seq reads was performed using the Kallisto Bioconductor R package77 with the GENCODE human genome build GRCh38.p13 (release 37)78; differential expression using the generalized linear model as implemented by the edgeR Bioconductor R package79; and Gene Ontology (GO) term pathway analysis using the hypergeometric over-representation test with the enrichGO function of the clusterProfiler Bioconductor R package73 or the Enrichr gene list enrichment analysis tool74. Additional figures were generated using the exploreDE Shiny app (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13927692).

Apart from time-lapse microscopy, no samples were measured repeatedly, and all other measurements were taken from distinct samples. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism (v.9 and 10). Two-tailed unpaired t-tests, χ2 tests, Fisher's exact tests or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test were performed as indicated in the figure legends. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001. All extended time-lapse experiments were performed at least twice for each experimental condition (that is, independent biological replicates with different batches of cells and the live-cell microscopy performed in different weeks), each experiment with 1–5 wells per experimental condition (typically 2–3 wells per condition) and multiple images taken per well (typically 9 images per well). Bulk RNA-seq was performed in triplicates, scRNA-seq was performed in duplicates.

Control western blots (Supplementary Figs. 3a,b and 6b) were performed once, control DNA fibre experiments (Extended Data Figs. 9c and 10c) were performed twice. All of the other experiments were performed at least three times, and the presented results were reliably reproduced.

No restrictions apply to data availability. Additional data (original high-content microscopy, time-lapse microscopy and Live+QIBC raw data) are available on request. Gel source data are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Single-cell sequencing data have been uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession numbers GSE255874, GSE288487 and GSE288485. GENCODE human genome build GRCh38.p13 (Release 37) was used as a reference genome77. Source data are provided with this paper.

No restrictions apply to code availability. ImageJ/Fiji and MATLAB scripts that were used in this study are available at GitHub (https://github.com/AltmeyerLab/). Detailed instructions can be found at Zenodo80 (https://zenodo.org/records/14921691) in the file ‘Live+QIBC_guide.pdf', together with a test dataset, which contains data for pre-imaging (Pre-imaging.zip), post-imaging (Post-imaging.zip) and iterative staining (Iterative staining.zip), and a README file (README_TestData.pdf). Moreover, there are .txt files, which correspond to analyses performed with the test dataset and the Olympus ScanR Analysis software (v.3.0.1, 3.2 and 3.3.0; analysis_live.txt and analysis_iterative_staining.txt) to be used with the MATLAB scripts without having to perform the image analysis. Finally, there is a Tracking_fiji.xls file, which is used to copy the values generated from the ‘Coord' table in the MATLAB script to import into the tracking plugin in ImageJ/Fiji 64-bit (v.1.53f, 1.53t, 1.54f, 1.54m), so that the tracks can be overlayed with the stack of the corresponding cells.

Metrics details

Decades of research have demonstrated that recovery from serious neurological injury will require synergistic therapeutic approaches. Rewiring spared neural circuits after injury is a long-standing goal of neurorehabilitation1,2. We hypothesized that combining intensive, progressive, task-focused training with real-time closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation (CLV) to enhance synaptic plasticity3 could increase strength, expand range of motion and improve hand function in people with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury. Here we report the results from a prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized study combining gamified physical therapy using force and motion sensors to deliver sham or active CLV (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04288245). After 12 weeks of therapy composed of a miniaturized implant selectively activating the vagus nerve on successful movements, 19 people exhibited a significant beneficial effect on arm and hand strength and the ability to perform activities of daily living. CLV represents a promising therapeutic avenue for people with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury.

Single therapies have demonstrated limited success in promoting recovery in people with chronic neurological injury. It has become increasingly apparent that the combination of complementary interventions represents a more promising strategy, such as recent applications that use electrical stimulation during rehabilitation to facilitate engagement of weakened networks4,5,6. CLV integrates targeted, intensive rehabilitative training with precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to promote recovery7,8. Rehabilitative training produces neural activation in spared pathways that control target musculature, which promotes plasticity through canonical mechanisms9,10, but is typically insufficient to support meaningful recovery on its own. CLV combines this training with VNS, which drives rapid, phasic release of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin throughout the central nervous system11,12,13,14,15. The resultant engagement of neuromodulatory networks within the seconds-long synaptic eligibility trace serves to enhance plasticity in networks activated by rehabilitation16. Conceptually, this approach of triggering stimulation to influence neuromodulatory networks during rehabilitation differentiates CLV from other combinatorial strategies that seek to directly facilitate the circuits engaged in movement6. In CLV, VNS and rehabilitation operate synergistically to mitigate the notoriously difficult credit assignment problem of identifying which synapses in a damaged network should be modified to produce more effective recovery of motor control10,17.

CLV was initially developed and refined in a range of animal models, including traumatic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI)3,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. These studies have revealed that the combination of high-intensity rehabilitative training with real-time VNS produces synaptic plasticity in motor control networks in the cortex, subcortical structures and spinal cord to engender functional recovery that is not possible with training alone. Concurrent implementation is a key component, as decoupling the delivery of VNS by even tens of seconds from the appropriate movements fails to promote recovery, consistent with the reliance on the synaptic eligibility trace3,25. Moreover, efficacy is dependent on hundreds of VNS–movement pairings per day for many weeks26,27.

We sought to evaluate this approach in humans with chronic, incomplete SCI. To do so, we developed an integrated two-element system to govern both high-intensity rehabilitation and real-time neuromodulation (Fig. 1a). The first element utilizes devices instrumented to collect a range of movement parameters to allow each user to control an individualized set of video games incorporating dozens of different exercises to target specific muscles with limited function28. Difficulty was continuously adjusted so that the speed, force and range of motion needed to control gameplay were individualized to the peak performance abilities of each participant throughout the course of therapy. The second element, a miniaturized implanted VNS device, delivers concurrent real-time neuromodulation. The implanted stimulator29, which is 50 times smaller than existing systems and implanted via a simplified procedure, was wirelessly activated by a therapist or the gameplay software using a low-latency, adaptive real-time algorithm to deliver stimulation concurrent with movements that best approximate the desired outcome30 (Fig. 1b). After integrating these components and gaining regulatory approval, including investigational device exemption and designation as a breakthrough device from the FDA, we performed a double-blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that CLV could enhance recovery of arm and hand function in 19 individuals with chronic, incomplete cervical SCI (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1).

a, CLV combines intensive, task-oriented rehabilitation and concurrent VNS delivered with a miniaturized implanted stimulator to promote adaptive changes in the central nervous system and facilitate recovery of function. b, CLV integrates external and implanted hardware to deliver high-intensity arm and hand therapy enhanced by real-time neuromodulation. The miniaturized implant is powered and controlled by an external device placed on the neck during rehabilitation sessions. A suite of sensors enables the rehabilitation software to provide continuous visual feedback of hand position and force production during individualized rehabilitative exercises and facilitate real-time delivery of VNS during above average movements. c, In this study, we observed that CLV (red) produced accumulating improvements in upper limb recovery exceeding those with intensive rehabilitation with sham stimulation (blue). d, CONSORT diagram summarizing the enrolment stages and the per protocol completion rate (detailed in Extended Data Fig. 1). A description of reasons participants did not meet criteria can be found in Extended Data Table 2. All participants that met enrolment criteria were implanted and completed the study per protocol, which involved 42 visits total, including 36 physical therapy sessions. Participants were block randomized to receive 18 sessions of rehabilitation with either active CLV (1× CLV) or sham stimulation (1× rehab) during the RCT phase, followed by an additional 18 sessions of rehabilitation with active CLV regardless of previous group assignment. Participants that received 36 sessions of rehabilitation with active CLV are labelled as 2× CLV. This design allows comparison with sham stimulation and of two dosing regimens of CLV. e, The proportion of injury type, ethnicity and age of individuals in this study are comparable with averages reported by the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center.

Recruiting participants that reflect the demographics of the broader clinical population is crucial to the generalizability of study results31,32. This trial followed the recommendations of the International Campaign for Cures of Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis panel33 and succeeded in enrolling a reasonably diverse set of participants whose injury type, ethnicity and age were generally consistent with the national averages reported by the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). This study had a somewhat higher proportion of female individuals and individuals within 5 years since injury. There is evidence that interest in clinical trials may lessen with time after injury34, which could explain why we did not recruit a larger proportion of individuals who were more than 5 years post-injury. The 19 people who met the study criteria ranged considerably in age (21–65 years of age, median 40), time since injury (13–541 months, median 54), injury severity classification (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) B, C and D) and resultant arm and hand deficits (33–101 GRASSP, median 64). This diverse study population allows for initial exploration of the impact of demographic factors that could influence response to CLV.

Our baseline assessments confirmed earlier studies showing that clinical impairment in upper limb function as measured by the Graded and Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) score is highly correlated with the peak pinch force that participants could produce between their thumb and index finger35 (Pearson correlation, R2 = 0.77, P = 1 × 10−6; Fig. 2a). GRASSP was also well correlated with the peak torque participants could produce with their wrist (Pearson correlation, R2 = 0.68, P = 1×10−5; Fig. 2b). The linear combination of these two measures of hand strength produced a model that explains 87% of the variance in disability in this population, with each factor providing a statistically significant contribution to the model (Pearson correlation, P = 7 × 10−9; Fig. 2c). The strong association of clinical impairment with finger and wrist strength provides a rigorous therapeutic rationale for the use of exercises designed to target these muscles.

a,b, Clinical impairment as measured by GRASSP is well correlated with pinch force (a) and wrist torque (b). c, Both metrics make statistically significant contributions to a linear model that accounts for most of the variance in clinical impairment. The strong correlation between clinical impairment and distal strength supports the selection of rehabilitative exercises designed to target these muscles. d, Each participant displayed a unique set of impairments as measured by the GRASSP score. The Pearson correlation coefficient between individuals was 0.34 ± 0.35 (mean ± s.d.). The colour represents the degree of function on each of the 25 components of the GRASSP assessment. This diversity in function motivated the creation of individualized rehabilitative regimens.

Although some degree of finger and wrist weakness is ubiquitous in this patient population, there is a great deal of individual heterogeneity in the nature and magnitude of functional impairments. As expected, all participants in this study presented with a unique pattern of impairment, illustrated by variable deficits in GRASSP category scores (Fig. 2d). To ensure that each participant received exercises tailored to their specific impairment, the rehabilitative training regimen for each participant consisted of a personalized set of six to nine exercises and accompanying games (Fig. 3a,b, Supplementary Video 1 and ‘Individualized therapy sessions' in Supplementary Information). Exercises were further individualized by adjusting the degree to which the force, torque or range of motion produced on each exercise was multiplied by a linear assistance factor (that is, gain) to make the games challenging but playable. The average assistance factor applied to each participant during rehabilitation was well correlated with their GRASSP score (Pearson correlation, R2 = 0.63, P = 5 × 10−5; Fig. 3c). Therapists observed exercises and, when possible, progressively increased task difficulty by gradually reducing the assistance factor. Therapists also adjusted task difficulty by increasing the level of each game, which necessitated greater speed and precision (Fig. 3d). Over the course of the study, exercise difficulty was adjusted 154 ± 15 times per person to ensure that participants were maximally challenged and at the limits of their ability, as documented by a stable rate of errors during gameplay. The observations that game error rate (1.1 ± 0.3 errors per minute, R2 = 0.00, P = 0.9), time actively engaged with task training (38.6 ± 0.7 h, R2 = 0.03, P = 0.5) and number of exercise repetitions per day (1,537 ± 74 repetitions, R2 = 0.002, P = 0.8) were not correlated with GRASSP confirm that the therapy parameters were set to be highly challenging despite a wide range in impairment nature and severity. Stimulation triggering was governed by an algorithm that scaled adaptively based on performance measured with the sensorized controllers30, which resulted in stable delivery of VNS across a wide range of impairments and over the course of rehabilitation sessions (Extended Data Fig. 2).

a, Each CLV session was individualized and emphasized a variety of exercises. The rehabilitative regimen used a range of sensors, including a wireless accelerometer, strain gauge, rotary encoder, keyboard, video camera and touchscreen. An algorithm utilized the sensor data to select above-threshold movements during exercises and deliver real-time VNS. Panel a adapted from ref. 28, Sage (traffic racer and breakout); ref. 35, under a CC BY 4.0 license (finger module, and isotonic wrist pronation and supination ROM device); and from VectorStock (hand holding tablet). Colours correspond to the key in panel b. b, Over 36 days of therapy, participants completed approximately 4,800 activities, individualized to their level of impairment and residual hand and arm function. Participants performed 6–9 different activities per session, with each activity lasting an average of 3.3 min (IDR: 0.7–5.5 min) and typically repeated twice per session. The colour of the circle indicates the category of rehabilitative exercise performed during the activity, and the area of each circle reflects the number of minutes actively engaged in each task. We observed a 100% compliance rate, with all participants completing 36 sessions of therapy. A supplementary interactive HTML version of this figure provides comprehensive information on each session for each participant, including the number of VNS events, the number of repetitions, the assistance factor, the difficulty level, motor performance, and whether active or sham VNS was delivered. c, A therapist guiding exercises increased the linear assistance factor (gain), which was multiplied by the force or range of motion for each exercise for each person until they could succeed in gameplay. The average value was highly correlated with baseline GRASSP scores, which confirms that exercises were individualized and challenging. d, In addition, the overseeing therapist increased game level to ensure that tasks were challenging at every stage of therapy. Higher game levels required greater speed and precision. The average game level increased steadily over the 36 days of therapy for all participants (Pearson correlation, P < 0.001).

Isometric pinch and knob exercises were included in the therapy programme developed for every person, as distal hand function was consistently impaired (Fig. 2d). Consequently, we used these metrics to track progress in all participants and assessed whether a course of CLV would produce improvements in these commonly impaired measures. Thirty-six sessions of therapy produced statistically significant increases in pinch force for 18 out of 19 people. The average pinch force increased by 936 ± 247 g, a gain of 393 ± 102% over baseline (two-tailed, paired Student's t-test, n = 19, P = 5 × 10−8; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Video 2). Similarly, the wrist torque that participants could exert on a door knob increased significantly in 13 out of 19 people, with an average increase of 28.5 ± 16.8 N cm, representing a 152 ± 87% improvement (two-tailed, paired Student's t-test, n = 19, P = 0.007; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Video 3). Over the course of therapy, the force, speed and range of motion produced during various different exercises were approximately doubled (Fig. 4c–i and Extended Data Fig. 3). These gains exceed the preregistered outcomes. As expected from earlier studies in chronic cervical SCI, some participants failed to make statistically significant gains on some exercises36. These observations suggest that CLV can significantly improve hand strength in people with chronic cervical SCI, although rigorously validated methods are necessary to ensure that changes in force production are clinically meaningful.

a,b, Pinch force (a) and knob torque (b), exercises performed by all participants, steadily increased over the course of therapy in the substantial majority of individuals. c–i, Similarly, strength, speed and range of motion (ROM) increased across a wide range of isometric and dynamic exercises. A linear mixed model was fitted to the data for each task, which was collected from daily rehabilitative training sessions. There was a significant fixed effect of therapy day for each task, as noted by the P value on each of the figure's panels. n denotes the number of participants that performed the task as part of their individualized therapy. The thick lines indicate participants who made statistically significant increases in task performance as a function of therapy day. The y axis maximum represents the median of unimpaired controls. Note that because exercise regimens were individualized, not all participants performed all exercises.

We next evaluated whether these gains in hand and arm capabilities translated to improvements in clinical metrics. Collectively, we observed a statistically significant improvement in GRASSP score after CLV (two-tailed, paired Student's t-test, n = 19, 4.1 ± 1.5 points, P = 0.01; Fig. 5a). This improvement exceeds the preregistered outcome and casts doubt on the long-held notion that additional gains are not possible in people with traumatic SCI more than 1 year post-injury and highlights the potential of CLV as a novel therapy for SCI37,38,39,40,41. Thirty-six sessions of CLV produced accumulating gains approximately double that observed after 18 sessions (Fig. 5a). In addition, the cumulative gains are consistent with the hypothesized mechanism of action by which real-time VNS promotes synaptic plasticity in spared networks25. We also observed modest gains in the untrained arm (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

a, In the double-blinded, sham-controlled phase of the study, GRASSP score was significantly improved compared with baseline in all participants after 18 sessions of CLV and in the subset of participants that received 36 sessions of CLV. No gains were observed in the group that received intensive rehabilitation with sham stimulation (stim). CLV produces a medium effect in improvement in upper limb function (Cohen's d effect size > 0.5). b, After the completion of 36 sessions of therapy (after therapy), 8 individuals made meaningful increases in the GRASSP score. This effect appears to be larger in individuals with motor incomplete injuries (AIS C and D). Dashed line indicates the cut-off for a meaningful increase, as defined by a 6-point or greater increase in GRASSP score. c, Meaningful improvements (denoted with bold lines) were observed across participants with severe, moderate and mild impairments in hand and arm function. d, Single characteristics, including the baseline GRASSP score, were not correlated with treatment response. Dashed line denotes no change in GRASSP score. e, However, a multiple linear regression model (detailed in Extended Data Table 3) with the AIS grade, GRASSP strength subscore, and GRASSP palmar and dorsal sensory subscores as inputs was highly correlated with the change in the GRASSP score from baseline to completion of 18 sessions of CLV. f, The strength subscore of GRASSP was significantly improved compared with baseline with CLV and unchanged with equivalent rehabilitation with sham stimulation. g, A range of the ten muscle groups evaluated during the GRASSP assessment improved with therapy. Muscles are colour coded to illustrate the percent of responders who exhibited measurable improvements in each muscle. Deltoid, pollicis longus, elbow extensors and wrist extensors were among the most commonly improved muscles. Panel g adapted using Sketchfab under a CC BY 4.0 license. Panels a,c,f used two-way paired Student's t-test versus baseline for CLV, and Wilcoxon signed-rank versus baseline for sham stimulation; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. Group data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.

The magnitude of recovery appeared to be dependent on the completeness of the injury. The majority of people with motor incomplete injuries (7 of 13, AIS C or D) exhibited a meaningful response to therapy, as defined by a six-point or greater increase in GRASSP score (Fig. 5b). By contrast, only one of the six people with motor complete injuries (AIS B) made a meaningful improvement. The greater recovery observed in individuals with motor incomplete injuries may suggest that individuals with motor complete injuries do not benefit from CLV. Alternatively, the observation that this population exhibited half the benefit seen in those with motor incomplete injuries benefit (2.3 ± 1.3 versus 4.9 ± 2.1 points) could be explained if this population requires twice as much therapy to produce the same benefit. Future studies are needed to distinguish between these possibilities.

In addition to GRASSP scores, we performed an exploratory analysis to evaluate whether CLV would enhance performance of common activities of daily living, as measured with the Jebsen–Taylor hand function test. At the conclusion of CLV, the Jebsen–Taylor hand function score increased by 7.5 ± 3.1 points (two-tailed, paired Student's t-test, n = 19, P = 0.03) compared with baseline (Extended Data Fig. 4b). An exploratory analysis revealed that the Spinal Cord Independence Measure Version 3 (SCIM-III) components that emphasize arm and hand use demonstrated significant improvement after CLV (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, +1.3 ± 0.7 points, n = 19, P = 0.04). Collectively, these results demonstrate that hand and arm function can be improved in people with chronic, incomplete cervical SCI.

Given the heterogeneity along a range of participant characteristics, we sought to determine whether there were potential relationships between these baseline features and treatment response. Single characteristics, including baseline impairment severity (Fig. 5c,d; Pearson correlation, R2 = 0.1, P = 0.2), time since injury (R2 = 0.005, P = 0.8) and age (R2 = 5 × 10−4, P = 0.9), were not associated with treatment response. This observation is consistent with findings in stroke42 and suggests that this approach could be potentially valuable for a large number of people living with chronic, incomplete SCI. Multiple linear regression modelling indicates that treatment response is greatest in individuals classified as motor incomplete and that have less strength and poor palmar sensation with preserved dorsal sensation (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Table 3; R2 = 0.6, P = 0.009). This aligns with preclinical evidence showing that both lesion characteristics and pathological synaptic plasticity directed to non-functional skin surfaces shape the potential to benefit from CLV21. These initial findings highlight the importance of exploring predictors of response in a larger study.

To estimate the effect size that VNS contributed to recovery, participants were randomized to receive either sham stimulation (n = 9) or active CLV (n = 10) during the first 18 sessions of high-intensity physical therapy (Extended Data Fig. 1; additional description of trial design, clinical protocol and consent procedures are available in Supplementary Information). Because all participants were implanted with the miniaturized device, received comparable high-intensity rehabilitation and stimulation was software controlled, therapists, assessors and participants were blinded to group assignment. Participant blinding was confirmed by questionnaires at the end of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) phase, which revealed that 58% of participants (11 of 19) were incorrect or uncertain about whether they received active VNS or sham stimulation, comparable with previous studies that used a similar blinding strategy43.

The RCT phase of the study confirmed that adding VNS to rehabilitation provides a medium-sized effect size over equivalent rehabilitation with sham stimulation, although this study was not powered to reach statistical significance (Fig. 5a; Cohen's d = 0.58, P = 0.3). The effect size observed in this study was comparable with that observed in people with ischaemic stroke, which is now an FDA-approved therapy43. These findings highlight the need for a prospectively powered study to evaluate the efficacy of CLV in individuals with chronic SCI. On average, the eight responders lost 23 ± 4% of their disability as measured by GRASSP. Future studies are needed to determine whether greater gains are possible with additional therapy sessions and whether some proportion of the non-responders can be converted to responders by adjusting VNS intensity. Although animal studies have consistently shown that the treatment effects of VNS during therapy are an inverted-U function of stimulation intensity44,45,46,47, this study did not seek to individualize VNS current.

To clarify the degree to which the current set of rehabilitative tools and exercises was able to improve specific muscle groups, we evaluated the probability that each of the ten muscles tested in the GRASSP assessment were improved in responders (Fig. 5f). Improvements were observed in proximal muscles of the arm and intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the hand (Fig. 5g). The only muscle that did not improve was the opponens pollicis, which opposes the thumb. Additional work is needed to ensure that rehabilitative exercises are developed to target this muscle, as well as additional muscles that are not included in the GRASSP assessment but that may benefit from targeted exercises.

The core premise of CLV is the coupling of task-specific training and real-time neuromodulation. On average, during sessions in which active VNS was paired with rehabilitative training, participants received 341 ± 15 half-second stimulation bursts to coincide with selected movements. Participants in the active group received 11,793 ± 990 total stimulations over the course of therapy. We utilized two strategies to govern the triggering of stimulation during movement. Initially, for the first 96,000 stimulation events, triggering decisions were made by therapists observing rehabilitative exercises using a dedicated software application. Manual triggering resulted in VNS events coinciding with movements that were twice the average amplitude above a non-targeted periodic triggering scheme, confirming that the therapists successfully coupled stimulation with task-focused movements (Extended Data Fig. 5; unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test, P = 2 × 10−74). Using the therapists triggering scheme as a ground truth, we developed and validated an automated algorithm to monitor movement and trigger stimulation30. As expected, the automated triggering method significantly outperformed therapists (unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test, P = 2 × 10−34). The algorithm governed stimulation for the remaining 137,000 stimulation events during the study, which allowed the therapists to focus solely on guiding rehabilitative exercises. Collectively, this shows that an automated approach to CLV is feasible to deliver.

In conjunction with feasibility, a key consideration in the delivery of any therapy with an implanted device is safety. After 19 implant surgeries, 760 patient visits, 3.7 million total VNS pulses and a collective 42 patient-years of device contact, there were zero serious device-related adverse events and zero unexpected device-related adverse events. All devices performed to specification, and we observed no device complications or technical failures. These findings are consistent with the larger corpus of literature using standard VNS strategies and reinforce that this approach is safe and well tolerated.

Because the CLV strategy tested in this study used a novel miniaturized VNS system, we assessed occurrence of adverse events. All study-related adverse events were classified as mild (Extended Data Table 4). As expected, the rate of post-surgical pain at the incision site was comparable with published rates using VNS in individuals with stroke48. By contrast, rates of voice alteration appear to have been reduced in this study. This probably reflects the reduced device size and simplified surgical procedure that obviates subcutaneous tunnelling in the neck, and the dramatically lower total charge delivery required for CLV relative to conventional VNS for epilepsy.

The use of CLV raises the potential for a specific safety concern in the context of SCI. Because the vagus nerve exerts control of autonomic function, it is conceivable that VNS could influence cardiovascular function and induce autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with SCI. Over the course of treatment, we observed no changes in heart rate or blood pressure between active and sham stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 6). In addition, no instances of autonomic dysreflexia were observed with stimulation. Consistent with results in animal models, these findings indicate that the stimulation parameters used for CLV do not meaningfully alter autonomic function and reinforce the safety of this strategy in individuals with SCI49.

Here we report the first-in-human use of CLV in 19 individuals with chronic, incomplete cervical SCI. Delivery of CLV using a novel, miniaturized VNS system was safe and feasible, with individuals receiving approximately 12,000 stimulations combined with weeks of intensive, personalized, task-focused rehabilitation. The majority of individuals exhibited meaningful improvements in multiple metrics of arm and hand function, and a longer course of therapy produced accumulating gains. The magnitude of upper limb recovery and proportion of responders was comparable with that observed using a similar approach in chronic stroke, which recently received the first-ever FDA approval for an intervention to improve recovery in the chronic phase. Collectively, these findings argue against the long-held belief that recovery after SCI is limited in the chronic phase and highlight the clinical potential of combinatorial treatment approaches.

Some limitations of the present study merit consideration and should be addressed in future trials. Because there are no validated biomarkers of VNS, we did not collect direct evidence of neuromodulator engagement; such a metric, as well as direct measures of plasticity, could potentially be used to individualize stimulation parameters in future implementations. Personalization of neuromodulator release or plasticity represents a potential means to increase the proportion of individuals that exhibit a clinically meaningful response, a key consideration for an implanted device. Given the limited size of this first-in-human study, subsequent trials should evaluate a larger pool of participants to examine potential predictors of recovery, including demographic characteristics or the GRASSP predictor developed here, and expand evaluation of hand and arm metrics at longer times post-therapy. In summary, this study provides strong evidence that CLV is safe, feasible to deliver and provides initial evidence of robust improvements of arm and hand function that supports investigation in a larger trial.

The trial was designed as a double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled early feasibility study (Extended Data Fig. 1). The clinical protocol and informed consent document are included in the Supplementary Information. Individuals who indicated interest in participation and met general criteria in an initial screen underwent informed consent. After enrolment, all participants underwent implantation of the miniaturized VNS device. Approximately 4 weeks after implantation, all participants received a post-implantation baseline assessment. Participants then received 18 sessions of rehabilitation with active CLV or sham stimulation in accordance with their randomization. After the initial 18 sessions, participants received an additional 18 session of rehabilitation with active VNS, regardless of their previous group assignment. The primary objectives evaluated safety, feasibility and changes in measures of arm and hand function. Outcomes were assessed after enrolment, after implantation, after completion of 18 sessions of therapy and after completion of 36 sessions of therapy. Occurrence of adverse events was screened throughout the course of the study.

The use of the miniaturized VNS device used in this study received investigational device exemption (approval from the FDA investigational device exemption approval ID G190032). In addition, all study procedures were approved by the Baylor Scott and White Research Institute Institutional Review Board, the University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Review Board, and the US Department of Defense Human Research Protections Office. The study was conducted in compliance with all relevant regulatory and ethical guidelines. The trial was preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04288245).

Participants were recruited from 5 March 2021 to 30 June 2023. Trial recruitment ended when budgeted funds for the trial were expended. Patient characteristics are delineated in Extended Data Table 1. A total of 293 potential participants contacted us or were identified through an established referral network at Baylor Scott and White Spinal Cord Injury Model System, study flyers, local advertisements and online advertisement. Of these, 19 met criteria, elected to participate, were consented and enrolled, and ultimately underwent implantation. Informed consent was obtained in a private setting after consultation with study staff to answer any questions. The informed consent process followed our established procedure, which is included in the Supplementary Information.

Participants met the following key inclusion criteria: (1) first time cervical SCI occurring at least 12 months before and resulting in AIS grade B, C or D (confirmed during the baseline visit by an experienced clinician); (2) residual movement in the upper limb and hand in either arm; (3) appropriate candidate for VNS implantation; (4) between 18 and 64 years of age; (5) a signed and dated informed consent form; and (6) willing to comply with all study procedures and were available for the duration of the study. Participants were excluded based on the following criteria: (1) SCIs by sharp objects, firearms, and non-traumatic or congenital causes; (2) evidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury; (3) excessive scar tissue in the neck; (4) concomitant clinically significant brain injuries; (5) previous injury to the vagus nerve; (6) previous or current treatment with VNS; (7) receiving any therapy that would interfere with VNS; (8) pregnant or lactating; (9) psychiatric disorders, psychosocial and/or cognitive impairment that would interfere with study participation; (10) abusive use of alcohol and/or illegal substances; (11) participation in other interventional clinical trials; (12) known immunodeficiency or receipt of chronic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, immunostimulating agents or radiation therapy within 6 months; (13) significant comorbidities or conditions associated with high risk for surgical or anaesthetic survival; (14) active neoplastic disease; (15) significant local circulatory problems; (16) any medical condition or other circumstances that might interfere with their ability to receive rehabilitation or return for follow-up visits; (17) any condition that would preclude adequate evaluation of the safety and performance of the device; (18) aphasia and other cognitive deficits that interfere with provision of informed consent; (19) recent history of syncope; (20) recent history of dysphagia; (21) currently require, or are likely to require, diathermy; (22) significant respiratory issues that would interfere with participation; (23) non-English speaking; (24) acutely suicidal and/or have been admitted for a suicide attempt; and (25) incarceration or legal detention. Full eligibility criteria can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04288245). No changes were made to eligibility criteria after trial commencement.

All 19 enrolled participants were implanted with a next-generation VNS device29. This device is over 50 times smaller than conventional VNS systems, largely due to the offloading of the battery and elimination of the need for leads. Both of these changes simplify surgical implantation by necessitating only a single incision at the neck and obviating the need for tunnelling. Implantation was performed by surgeons with experience in the implantation of VNS systems. After surgical preparation and induction of general anaesthesia, the skin and platysma overlying the left cervical vagus nerve were incised. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was mobilized laterally to reveal the carotid sheath, and the vagus nerve was dissected free circumferentially over a length of 3–4 cm. The vagus nerve was placed inside the silicone cuff, which positions the electrodes of the implanted pulse generator (IPG) in contact with the nerve. The silicone cuff was closed around the nerve with two 4-0 permanent sutures. The IPG was then positioned superficially to facilitate alignment with the external components during stimulation. Before closure of the skin, wireless communication and power functions of the IPG were verified. After confirmation of device functionality, closure of the platysma and skin with absorbable sutures was performed, followed by a second communication verification. Impedance checks confirmed that all participants were within the acceptable range. Average surgical time was 38 ± 2 min. Routine post-anaesthetic care was provided. Approximately 1 week later, participants returned to the clinic for a follow-up visit to assess recovery.

Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 18 sessions of rehabilitation with sham stimulation followed by 18 sessions of rehabilitation with active VNS (n = 9) or 36 sessions of rehabilitation with active VNS (n = 10). A blocked software-randomized design was used with a block size of two. The blocking covariate was impairment severity (treated arm GRASSP ≤ 58 versus GRASSP > 58). Ten participants were randomized to receive active (0.8 mA, 30 Hz for 500 ms) VNS for all 36 sessions of VNS. Nine participants were randomized to receive sham VNS for the first 18 sessions and active VNS for the second 18 sessions (Extended Data Fig. 1).

Before the beginning of each rehabilitation session, vital signs were collected with a digital blood pressure cuff. During rehabilitation sessions, the external power and communication module (PCM) was placed in a band around the neck of the participant with the coil aligned over the IPG. Because stimulation was only delivered during rehabilitative training sessions, the PCM was only worn during these sessions. Each 0.5-s train of VNS was delivered concurrent with exercises during rehabilitative training (as detailed below), and comprised 0.8-mA 100-µs biphasic pulses at 30 Hz, as in previous studies.

The concurrent timing of VNS and movement is based on the principle that precisely timed neuromodulatory feedback can direct specific synaptic changes to enhance recovery. After an SCI, a subset of neurons within the central nervous system is affected by the injury, and promoting long-term potentiation and depression within these networks has long been recognized as an approach to support recovery1,50,51. The ability to direct synapse-specific, adaptive plasticity within the affected networks while not influencing other networks is at the core of the credit assignment problem, which articulates the challenge of identifying which synapses should be changed to improve motor function17,52,53,54. CLV leverages the synaptic eligibility trace, a phenomenon in which the arrival of neuromodulatory reinforcement within seconds promotes plasticity in recently active networks and not in inactive networks16,55,56,57, to direct changes within specific synapses. In CLV, motor networks controlling the upper limb affected by the SCI are engaged by rehabilitative exercises, and closed-loop VNS delivered in response to a target movement triggers neuromodulatory release to produce therapeutic synaptic plasticity within these networks3,11.

All participants underwent implantation, a key feature of blinding. In addition, all participants received equivalent individualized rehabilitation regimens and donned the external device during rehabilitation sessions, regardless of active or sham group assignment. The stimulation parameters were software controlled and were preset by a study staff member who was not involved in rehabilitation, data collection or analysis, allowing therapists and assessors to maintain blinding. Most participants did not perceive the stimulation or only felt the first few stimulations each day and rapidly adapted to the sensation. To maintain blinding, at each rehabilitation session, participants in the sham group received active stimulations of reducing strength beginning at 0.8 mA and decreasing with each trigger to 0.6 mA, then 0.4 mA, then 0.2 mA, then 0.1 mA and then 0 mA for the remainder of the session. Preclinical and clinical studies indicated that this amount of stimulation was insufficient for therapeutic effect and sufficient to ensure blinding. Participants were instructed that they may initially perceive stimulation, but the perception may fade. Participant blinding was confirmed with a questionnaire at the end of phase 1 of the study, in which 11 of 19 participants were incorrect or uncertain about group assignment. Although therapists and assessors were blinded, blinding status was not directly surveyed in these individuals and should be assessed in future studies to confirm effective concealment.

All 19 participants completed 36 sessions of intensive rehabilitation at a rate of approximately 3 per week. Each session was approximately 90 min long. Both groups followed the same visit schedule and received equivalent rehabilitation of one arm. Clinical judgement was used to select the arm that was most likely to benefit from therapy.

Personalized exercise regimens were selected based on the ability profile of each participant. Each regimen incorporated conventional rehabilitative exercises and training on a computer-based rehabilitation system28. As appropriate for their level of ability and expressed interest, participants also performed functional tasks (labelled as object manipulation in Fig. 2 and ‘Individualized therapy sessions' in Supplementary Information), including jar opening, threading a nut on a bolt, lifting cans, writing, and inserting and turning keys. Participants generally cycled between relatively short (1–5 min) sets of each exercise to mitigate substantial fatigue. Difficulty was continuously monitored by licensed therapists to ensure that the therapeutic exercises were challenging. If performance improved, difficulty was increased by reducing the linear assistance factor (that is, gain) and increasing the game level of the computer-based rehabilitation system, which had the effect of increasing the required movement speed, accuracy and force28. Assistance factor adjustments to the exercise regimens were made systematically, such that a typical progression for a single exercise included decreasing the input multiplier from the controller by 20%. In addition, progression involved increasing the number of repetitions or extending the duration of the exercise.

The closed-loop triggering scheme to deliver VNS concurrent with movements used two strategies. In the first strategy, the therapist overseeing the rehabilitation session used a button press in a software app to trigger stimulation on movements identified as above-average attempts based on specific performance metrics, such as increased force, speed, accuracy or fluidity of motion. This is the stimulation approach that has been applied in conventional studies using paired VNS therapy43,58,59. In the second approach, triggering was automatically controlled by a software algorithm, as previously described30. This strategy used real-time movement signals collected from the sensors in the rehabilitative training devices and delivered stimulation on movements that exceeded a continuously updated threshold. The relevant aspect of the movement for triggering was dependent on the gameplay; for example, gameplay controlled by pinch force used the force signal to determine triggering, whereas gameplay controlled by wrist rotation used degree of rotation to determine triggering28,35. The algorithm initiated stimulation within 500 ms when movement exceeded the 95th percentile of previous repetitions. The algorithm produced stable triggering across a range of impairments and over the course of rehabilitative sessions (Extended Data Fig. 2). Most participants received a combination of both stimulation-triggering strategies.

Individuals with lived SCI experience, including study participants, were iteratively involved in the design of the CLV system and therapy, including the development and implementation of the PCM and neckband, the rehabilitation devices and the design of the rehabilitative regimens. The components were designed to emphasize adoption among individuals with SCI, maximize comfort and promote engagement with the therapy. Consistent with this, study participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the therapy (4.6 ± 0.2 on a 5-point Likert scale surveyed at the end of the study), a critical consideration for eventual clinical adoption.

The GRASSP (version 1) is a clinician-administered assessment quantifying three domains describing upper limb function and impairment60. This assessment was specifically designed to evaluate the effect of novel interventions on upper limb impairment in the traumatic tetraplegic population. The preregistered clinical end point was a greater than four-point increase in GRASSP. An improvement of six points or more in the trained limb was considered a meaningful difference. Higher scores are associated with improved arm and hand function. GRASSP scores are categorical and were collected at each assessment session. Percent disability, as reported in the main text, was derived from GRASSP scores. This metric was calculated as the number of GRASSP points gained during therapy as a proportion of the difference between baseline pre-therapy score and the total number of available points to reach a maximum score.

A suite of rehabilitative tools was used to assess force and range of motion in the hand and wrist throughout the course of the study28,35. The system includes modules to quantify wrist rotational range of motion and torque on a doorknob and a revolving D-handle, wrist flexion–extension range of motion and torque, and finger flexion–extension force. These continuous values were collected at each rehabilitation session, as appropriate for the assigned exercises for each participant. The preregistered strength end points were greater than 10% increases in finger pinch and flexion force following active VNS, 10% increases in wrist flexion and extension force following active VNS, and 10% increases in wrist pronation and supination force following active VNS.

The Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test is a widely used standardized and objective measure of fine and gross motor hand functions that uses simulated activities of daily living61. This was an exploratory end point.

As this study only performed hand and arm rehabilitation, we did not expect to see improvements in respiration, lower body function, bowel function, bladder function or mobility. We thus excluded these metrics from SCIM-III to produce an 18-point measure of independence associated with arm and hand function. This composite score includes feeding, grooming, toileting, upper body bathing and upper body dressing, all of which require arm and hand function. This was an exploratory end point.

The AIS is the gold-standard assessment to evaluate level and completeness of injury in individuals with SCI. In this study, AIS was evaluated by R.G.H., a clinician with extensive expertise in SCI, at baseline and at the end of each phase. AIS grade was used to confirm study eligibility.

The primary and secondary study outcomes were reviewed by the regulatory bodies and were preregistered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04288245). Data in the figures and text are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean unless otherwise indicated. Comparisons across groups were made using unpaired Student's t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. As appropriate, comparisons across time were made using paired Student's t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Before conducting any parametric test, the assumption of normality was first checked using the Jarque–Bera goodness-of-fit test. For Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3, a linear mixed model was fitted to the data from each task, and statistics were performed using that model. Pearson correlation tests were used to determine the correlation between a number of elements and GRASSP score changes. Standardized effect size was calculated using Cohen's d. As there was high test–retest reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient, R = 0.95, P < 0.00001) for the baseline assessments performed before and after implantation and no significant difference (P > 0.05), these two values were averaged to serve as the baseline assessment. All comparisons used an α = 0.05.

(a) The study was designed to establish safety and feasibility as well as to estimate the effect of closed-loop delivery of VNS during high-intensity physical therapy compared to high-intensity physical therapy alone. After enrollment, all subjects were implanted with the VNS device. Participants were block randomized to receive 18 sessions of rehabilitation with either active CLV (1x CLV; n = 10 participants) or sham stimulation (1x Rehab; n = 9 participants) during the RCT phase, followed by an additional 18 sessions of rehabilitation with active CLV regardless of prior group assignment. Participants that received 36 sessions of rehabilitation with active CLV are labelled as 2x CLV. This design allows comparison with sham stimulation and of two dosing regimens of CLV. Assessments were completed before and after surgery, after eighteen therapy sessions, and after thirty-six therapy sessions. The final assessment was conducted 9.7 ± 2.1 days after the last day of VNS. (b) Depiction of change in GRASSP scores from baseline, the main functional outcome of the study, at each assessment during the RCT. Gray markers indicate individual participants. Paired Student's t-test v. baseline; * indicates p < 0.05; data presented as mean ± SEM.

The number of VNS events delivered during a rehabilitation sessions was not correlated with either baseline GRASSP score (a) or change in GRASSP score (b), indicating that the therapy was scaled by the level of impairment to ensure a consistent number of stimulations. Symbols denote individual participants. (c) Additionally, stimulation rate was stable across the duration of rehabilitative sessions, indicating that the algorithm was robust against effects of fatigue or other sources of variability in performance. Data are presented as mean ± SD number of VNS events per 10-minute bin over the course of each rehabilitation session for each participant.

a) Pinch force and b) knob torque, exercises performed by all participants, steadily increased over the course of therapy in the substantial majority of individuals. c-i) Similarly, strength, speed, and range of motion increased across a wide range of isometric and dynamic exercises. A linear mixed model was fitted to the data for each task. There was a significant fixed effect of therapy day for each task, as noted by the p-value on each of the figure's panels. n denotes the number of participants that performed the task as part of their individualized therapy. Performance metrics for each day are shown as dots. Thick lines indicate participants who made statistically significant increases in task performance as a function of therapy day. The y-axis maximum represents the median of unimpaired controls. (j-r) Same as above, but plotted on a linear scale.

(a) GRASSP score in the untrained arm was significantly improved compared to baseline in all participants after 18 sessions of CLV and in the subset of participants that received 36 sessions of CLV. No gains were observed in the group that received intensive rehabilitation with sham stimulation. Gains in the untrained arm were more modest than those observed in the trained arm. Improvement in the untrained arm was not expected because VNS-induced plasticity is specific to the paired training. However, these improvements may be explained by some amount of bilateral involvement in training, generalization, or VNS-dependent pruning of synaptic connectivity in hyperconnected networks, each of which could reduce spasticity or otherwise produce benefits to the untrained arm. Future physiological studies are needed to understand why small, but statistically significant, improvement was observed in the untrained arm. (b) Additionally, participants that receive 36 sessions of CLV exhibit improved Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function scores in the trained arm compared to baseline. (c) Though not significant in the whole population, an exploratory analysis of only motor incomplete participants demonstrates a significant correlation between change in GRASSP score and JTHF score at the end of therapy (R = 0.59; p = 0.034), potentially indicative of clinical and functional gains. Symbols (and n) indicate individual participants. For panels a and b: Paired Student's t-test v. baseline, * indicates p < 0.05. Group data are presented as mean +/− SEM.

Closed-loop triggering produces bursts of VNS that coincide with the largest movements that occurred during therapy. Both therapist and an automated algorithm were able to outperform open-loop (e.g. periodic) triggering. Automated closed-loop triggering using real-time sensor data was able to outperform therapists using visual inspection to determine stimulation timing. Symbols denote individual exercises for participants that received both manual and automated triggering, and boxes show median and interquartile range. Unpaired Student's t-test across conditions, *** indicates p < 1 × 10−17.

To determine whether CLV would impact measures of cardiovascular function, we measured vital signs prior to the initiation of therapy (baseline) and after the completion of the first 18 sessions of CLV (n = 19 participants). Heart rate (a), systolic blood pressure (b), and respiratory rate (c) were not influenced by CLV. Data are presented as mean ± STD. Symbols denote individual participants.

Description of the statistical methods and outcomes from statistical testing regarding assumptions of normality and linear mixed modelling.

Raw Assessment Dataset. Demographic data for each person, GRASSP subscores at 4 assessment time points, baseline forces, and forces recorded during sessions.

Individualized Therapy Sessions.

Exercise type was customized for each participant based on their ability. Initial exercise selection was based on the GRASSP profile (Fig. 3d) of each participant. Exercises were refined and progressed by licensed physical therapists to ensure tasks were consistently challenging. Participants completed computer-based exercises that were progressed by increasing the speed and precision required for success and by reducing the assistance factor so that more force or range of motion was needed. Every participant completed exercises with isometric pinch and knob inputs because all study participants exhibited reduced pinch force and knob torque. Each participant also completed exercises with real-world objects to ensure natural tactile stimulation and support skills needed for activities of daily living. During reach across exercises, participants pressed pucks in different locations while holding objects that required specific grips (e.g. key or cylindrical) to improve range of motion and grip strength. Other exercises included typing, touchscreen use, and stereognosis.

CLV improves pinch force. The video shows maximum pinch force at the beginning of therapy and at the end of therapy for participant MI12. Positive values reflect closing (flexion) of the index finger and thumb. Negative values indicate opening (extension). Participants were given real-time feedback that was scaled to their maximum performance to enable them to see when they were producing greater than average forces. In this game (called repetition mode), the software counts the individual events and triggers VNS on the largest events. The video ends with an overlay of the forces produced before and after therapy.

CLV improves range of motion. The video shows maximum torque at the beginning of therapy and at the end of therapy for participant MI12. Positive values reflect pronation of the wrist. Negative values indicate supination of the wrist. The video ends with an overlay of the range of motion that was available before and after therapy.

Metrics details

Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering1,2 or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants3,4, which limits their wide application. Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity. We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation5 at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information. To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells. In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells6 are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age. In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis7 are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases. EPI-Clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing on hematopoietic cell state landscapes at scale.

Lineage tracing using genetic or physical labels has been an important tool in developmental and stem cell biology for more than a century1,2. More recently, genetic barcoding compatible with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided information on the cellular output of hundreds of stem cell clones together with cell-state information on the stem cell itself8,9,10,11,12. Such methods require complex genetic engineering and therefore have limited applications, for example, in humans or during native ageing. Thus, methods are needed that rely on endogenous clonal markers (for example, somatic mutations) and allow tracing of various stem cell clones in parallel. Whole-genome sequencing can reconstruct cellular phylogenies3 but has limited throughput. It also lacks information about cell states, which precludes clonal tracking across cellular differentiation landscapes. Conversely, spontaneous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations can be captured together with cell-state information by scRNA-seq or ATAC–seq4,13,14. Although mtDNA variants can be clonally informative, it is unclear whether mtDNA variants can reconstruct cellular phylogenies15,16.

Clonal signals have been identified in bulk DNA methylation data obtained from cancer and healthy tissues17,18. Somatic epimutations, defined as spontaneous but heritable losses and gains of DNA methylation, have been explored as a potential clonal label in cancer19,20. However, differentiation-associated changes in DNA methylation may mask clone-associated differences21,22. Furthermore, current single-cell DNA methylation methods23,24 suffer from data sparsity, which makes it challenging to exploit the stochasticity of epimutations at individual CpGs.

A compelling case for the use of lineage tracing is haematopoiesis, whereby, in humans, 50,000–200,000 stem cell clones generate blood throughout life3. Ageing induces clonal expansion with substantial loss of clonal diversity. In mice, much of our understanding of clonal behaviour in ageing either comes from transplantation experiments25 or mathematical modelling26, which may not recapitulate steady-state haematopoiesis or lacks the resolution of single-cell lineage analysis. In humans, literature focuses on the role of driver mutations in clonal haematopoiesis (CH), but clonal expansions without (known) drivers are common with age and are associated with an increased all-mortality risk27. So far, the lineage output of clones with or without (known) CH driver mutations have not been compared because of a lack of suitable methods.

Here we develop EPI-Clone, a method that exploits the targeted single-cell readout of DNA methylation at single-CpG resolution to track clones while providing detailed cell-state information. EPI-Clone builds on single-cell targeted analysis of the methylome (scTAM-seq), which is implemented on the Mission Bio Tapestri platform to read out methylation states of several hundred CpGs in thousands of single cells at a time, with a dropout rate of around 7%5. scTAM-seq uses a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme to selectively digest unmethylated CpGs and thus generates sequencing reads only from methylated CpGs. We applied EPI-Clone to lineage-barcoded cells and in native human and mouse haematopoiesis to characterize the decline in clonal complexity and the functional properties of age-expanded clones in mouse and human ageing.

We performed a series of experiments, which, for clarity, are defined as follows: scTAM-seq applied to eight different settings in mice (experiments M.1–M.8; Extended Data Fig. 1a); scTAM-seq applied to two human cohorts (A.1–A.7 and B.1–B.5); and experiments demonstrating the combination of scTAM-seq with RNA-seq and mitochondrial lineage tracing from the same cell (X.1 and X.2). An overview of all data is provided in Supplementary Table 1.

To create a ground-truth dataset of clonal identity and DNA methylation, we labelled mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with lentiviral barcodes using the LARRY system8. Labelled HSCs were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice and the mice were profiled 5 months later, a time point at which all blood populations should be reconstituted. Sorted haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow (sorted as LIN−KIT+ (LK) cells with additional enrichment of LIN−SCA1+KIT+ (LSK) cells) were profiled by scTAM-seq (experiment M.1, the main LARRY experiment; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The experiment was repeated (experiment M.2, replicate LARRY experiment) and we profiled LK and LSK bone marrow from untreated mice (experiment M.3, native haematopoiesis). Specifically, we analysed methylation of 453 CpGs that were selected as differentially or variably methylated from bulk HSPC DNA methylation data22 (Fig. 1b, Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). The LARRY barcode was read out directly from the DNA by including a LARRY-specific amplicon in our targeting panel for scTAM-seq. Finally, the expression of 20 surface proteins (Supplementary Table 2) was simultaneously profiled using oligonucleotide-tagged antibodies to obtain independent information on cellular differentiation. In summary, for experiments M.1–M.3, we profiled DNA methylation at 453 CpGs and the expression of 20 surface proteins across HSPCs. In experiments M.1 and M.2, we also profiled LARRY barcodes from the same cells.

Source data

We applied Seurat's default batch-correction method to integrate methylation data from 28,782 cells across the three experiments. We thereby obtained a low-dimensional embedding in which most variation was driven by differentiation along four trajectories (Fig. 1c). To annotate cell states from the DNA methylation data, we used three layers of information: (1) bulk methylation profiles (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a); (2) the methylation states of important lineage-specific transcription-factor-binding sites (TFBSs; Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b); and (3) the expression of surface proteins (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). We identified cell-state-specific demethylation of CpGs that neighboured crucial TFBSs, including GATA2 (an erythroid factor), EBF1 (a lymphoid factor) and SPI1 (a myeloid factor) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b). scTAM-seq data revealed a cluster of HSCs and early multipotent progenitors (MPP1, also called short-term or active HSCs), several additional MPP subsets (MPP2, MPP3 and MPP4), myeloid, erythroid and B cell progenitors, as well as two subsets of megakaryocyte progenitors (MKPs). As we also performed scRNA-seq on different cells obtained from the same samples, we could compare low-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) generated by DNA methylation with a UMAP generated from transcriptomic data (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We observed an overall similar topology (Extended Data Fig. 2b) with the four main differentiation trajectories. Overall, through data integration of several experiments, we obtained a DNA-methylation-based map of mouse HSC differentiation at single-CpG resolution. This map contains two orders of magnitude more cells than two previous, single-cell bisulfite sequencing datasets of the haematopoietic system28,29.

Computational batch-correction methods, by definition, remove most individual-specific signals (Extended Data Fig. 2c). As clonal information is individual-specific, we computed a UMAP display of the data from experiment M.1 only. This analysis revealed that DNA methylation jointly captures two layers of information: differentiation state and clonal identity. Specifically, although cells clustered according to differentiation states (Fig. 1g), they also clustered by their clonal identity as defined through LARRY barcodes (Fig. 1h). To use this clone-specific signal for lineage tracing, we sought to determine whether clonal identity and differentiation affect different subsets of CpGs. We tested for the association of every CpG with the expression of any surface protein and thereby identified differentiation-associated, dynamic CpGs. Performing dimensionality reduction using only these dynamic CpGs (Extended Data Fig. 2d) or only the expression of surface proteins (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f) resulted in a similar landscape to that obtained by batch correction. This finding indicates that dynamic CpGs and surface antigens independently capture differentiation state well. The remaining, static CpGs were frequently associated with clonal identity, as defined through LARRY barcodes (Fig. 1i). Dynamic CpGs were enriched in enhancer elements, whereas the static CpGs were preferentially located in heterochromatic regions (Fisher test P = 2.2 × 10−5; Fig. 1j). Moreover, static CpGs were enriched in late-replicating domains (Fisher test P = 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 2g). In summary, clonal identity and differentiation state affect the methylation of different sets of CpGs in haematopoietic cells, which creates a valuable tool to read out both processes simultaneously at the single-cell level.

We focused on exploiting static CpGs to analyse clonal identity. To this end, we developed EPI-Clone, which is divided into three steps: (1) identification of static CpGs, as described above; (2) identification of cells from expanded clones by using cell density in the DNA methylation space defined by the static CpGs; and (3) clustering of cells from the expanded clones (Fig. 2a and Methods).

Using this algorithm, expanded LARRY clones with relative clone sizes larger than 0.25% clustered separately, with no influence of cell state (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Fig. 3). By contrast, cells from small LARRY clones with relative sizes less than 0.25% were interspersed between clusters (Fig. 2d). EPI-Clone identified cells that belong to expanded clones on the basis of the high local density in principal component analysis (PCA) space spanned by the static CpGs (Fig. 2b,d). EPI-Clone correctly identified cells from expanded clones with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.79 when using the LARRY clone sizes as ground truth (Fig. 2e). Subsequently, EPI-Clone clustered cells from expanded clones by clonal identity, achieving an adjusted rand index (ARI) of 0.88 relative to ground-truth LARRY barcodes (Fig. 2f). Quantitatively and qualitatively similar results were obtained from a biological replicate that used the same parameters and cut-off values in the EPI-Clone analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3; AUC = 0.68, ARI = 0.82). These results demonstrate that epimutational clonal signals are stably maintained in blood stem and progenitor cells over long periods of time (5 months from transplant to analysis).

We next asked whether EPI-Clone can determine clonal identity in mature immune cells. To that end, we collected mature immune (lymphoid and myeloid) cells from bone marrow and spleen (experiment M.5; Fig. 2g, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4) and profiled surface-antigen expression and DNA methylation at the same CpGs as in experiments M.1–M.3. Using the static CpGs defined from experiment M.1, EPI-Clone again produced clonal clustering that recapitulated ground-truth clonal labels (Fig. 2h). We separately computed ARI values between EPI-Clone results and LARRY barcodes. ARI values were higher than 0.7 for monocytes, neutrophils, other myeloid cells, CD8+ T cells and one B cell subset, higher than 0.4 for CD4+ T cells and low for macrophages and a second B cell subset (Fig. 2i,j). Most T cells and B cells belonged to lymphoid-dominated (LARRY and EPI-Clone) clones (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 4d), which implicated an origin in lymphoid-biased or restricted progenitors30. In a separate experiment (M.4), we profiled mature myeloid cells from lung, bone marrow and peripheral blood, and found that myeloid cell types, except macrophages, retained this clonal mark also outside of the bone marrow (Extended Data Fig. 4). These results show that clonal information encoded in the DNA methylation state is maintained in most lineages until terminal differentiation and 10 months after the lentiviral labelling event (Discussion).

Finally, we asked whether EPI-Clone can be applied to tissues other than blood. We used the same CpG panel to sorted endothelial cells (ECs) from lung of an aged mouse. ECs share a common developmental origin with blood (experiment M.6; Extended Data Fig. 5a). Using the dynamic CpGs defined in haematopoiesis and CD31, SCA1 and podoplanin protein-expression information, we identified two previously described types of capillaries and lymphatic ECs31 (Extended Data Fig. 5b–f). Using the same set of static CpGs as in haematopoiesis, EPI-Clone revealed cell-state-independent, yet statistically supported, clusters containing all three cell types (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). We conclude that a similar set of static and dynamic CpGs defines clones and differentiation states, respectively, in endothelia and haematopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 5i).

In summary, DNA methylation patterns at static CpGs constitute a broadly applicable clonal barcode.

EPI-Clone can provide joint information on the cell state of progenitors, clonal identity and clonally derived progeny. Therefore, it is an ideal method to characterize the clonal dynamics of native (unperturbed) haematopoiesis. In contrast to the transplantation setting, native haematopoiesis has been described as polyclonal32,33, whereby several thousand clones contribute to blood formation. To investigate whether EPI-Clone also identifies clones in native haematopoiesis, we applied it to bone marrow samples from two untreated, young mice (experiment M.7, 12 weeks old; Supplementary Fig. 5a). Approximately 50% of cells were part of large clones (defined as a relative size larger than 1%) that individually made up 1–4% of total HSPCs (Fig. 3a,c). These clone sizes are in line with a study that genetically barcoded adult haematopoietic clones in situ33 (Fig. 3c). The remaining cells were classified as belonging to small and non-expanded clones. A limitation of EPI-Clone is that only cells belonging to expanded clones can be assigned to their clone of origin. Cells belonging to very small clones (<0.25% of cells after transplant and <1% in native haematopoiesis) could be identified as not belonging to expanded clones, but their clonal identity could not be inferred with the cell numbers used here.

We next applied EPI-Clone to study ageing by comparing the data from young mice (12 weeks old) to 100-week-old mice in two biological replicates (experiment M.7; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5a). We observed weak shifts in cell-type proportions between the young and the old mice, a result that confirmed previous observations34 (Supplementary Fig. 5b–e). When comparing the EPI-Clone result, we observed more expanded clones in the old mice than in the young mice (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Expanded clones in the old mice were individually also larger than in the young mice (Fig. 3c; two-sided Wilcoxon test P = 0.012). This gradual loss of clonality with age resembles certain properties of human HSC ageing (see below).

Next, we measured the distribution of cell types for each clone across the various stem and progenitor clusters. In the old mice, we observed several expanded clones that contained mostly HSCs across both of our replicates (Fig. 3d–f and Supplementary Fig. 7d,e; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test P < 0.05), which were not present in the young mice. These HSC-expanded clones contained large numbers of stem cells apparently incapable of proceeding with differentiation and contained little progeny. Old mice showed a moderate increase in the number of myeloid-biased clones, which was in contrast to results from classical transplantation experiments35,36,37,38 (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). However, the rare HSC-expanded clones were mostly myeloid-biased (Fig. 3g; Wilcoxon test P = 0.01 (replicate 1) and P = 0.076 (replicate 2)).

To determine the long-term stability of the HSC-expanded clonal behaviour, we performed a transplantation assay using an aged donor mouse. We used EPI-Clone to compare the clonal composition of the haematopoietic system in the native state (before transplant) and after transplant, and used LARRY barcoding as an additional control during transplantation (experiment M.8; Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Clonal identities defined using EPI-Clone remained stable during transplantation (Extended Data Fig. 6b–e). HSCs with abundant progeny before transplant showed poor engraftment, a result in line with serial transplantation studies using lentiviral barcoding8,33 (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 6f). Notably, HSC-expanded clones also engrafted poorly, and we identified non-expanded HSCs as the major drivers of transplantation haematopoiesis (Fig. 3j). Clones with quantifiable output before and after transplant showed a stable lineage bias that was inherited after transplantation (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 6g).

In summary, our data demonstrate age-related loss of clonal complexity in mouse ageing that is accompanied by an emergence of HSC-expanded clones with low engraftment capacity. We propose that these rare but expanded clones drive the increase in stem cell number and decrease in output that had typically been associated with aged haematopoiesis in transplantation studies39,40,41 and in Cre-lox-based native lineage-tracing studies42. Our transplant data support the idea that HSCs that do not expand with age persist and drive regeneration.

To relate these results to human ageing, we next adapted EPI-Clone for use on human samples. We designed a panel that targeted 448 CpGs with variable methylation between or within blood progenitor populations (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). We also included 147 genomic regions commonly mutated in CH and 20 regions that targeted chromosome Y to serve as a partial ground truth for clones identified by EPI-Clone.

We collected CD34+-enriched total bone marrow (TBM) samples from seven donors of different ages (donors A.1–A.7). We also assembled a dataset of CD34+ cells from bone marrow from nine donors (donors B.1–B.5 and X.1, and donors A.1, A.3 and A.4, for whom >1,000 CD34+ cells had been captured from TBM) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1). Three of the TBM donors had previously been characterized for CH mutations43, and we de novo identified CH mutations or loss of the Y chromosome (LoY) for four additional donors from scTAM-seq data (Methods). In total, we identified ten CH mutations and one LoY event in our cohort. Samples were stained with an antibody panel targeting 45 surface proteins to provide phenotypic characterization. Across all donors, we profiled 135,432 single cells using scTAM-seq.

We followed the same analytical strategy as for the mouse experiments, but with minor adaptations (Methods). Specifically, we detected expanded clones using a statistical criterion (CHOIR44; Extended Data Fig. 3g), and we identified cell types and differentiation states using a combination of both dynamic CpGs and surface proteins (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). We then used all myeloid cells to identify a consensus set of static CpGs across individuals (Extended Data Fig. 7f–h). To assess the fidelity of static CpGs to identify clones, we exploited the CH mutations and LoY events as a clonal ground-truth. CH clones clustered together in static CpG UMAPs in all cases (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8a). EPI-Clone recapitulated the CH clones in all donors except A.5, which was covered with substantially fewer cells than the rest of the TBM cohort (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 8b). Quantitatively, the epimutational clones dominated by CH mutant cells were on average 78.8% mutant and those dominated by wild-type cells were on average 95.4% wild-type (Fig. 4e). These numbers probably underestimate the true overlap between the identified clones and CH clones owing to allelic dropout of CH mutations. We observed a stronger separation of clones identified using our algorithm and better overlap with CH mutations in older donors than in young donors. This result suggests that EPI-Clone most accurately identifies clones in haematopoietic systems of reduced clonal complexity. Besides the CH clones, EPI-Clone identified a total of 67 other clonal expansions in the seven TBM donors, a result that highlights the capacity of this algorithm to recapitulate clonal expansions driven by known and unknown drivers.

We included natural killer (NK) cells and immature B cells in our analysis and used CH mutations to validate that these cells also clustered by clone (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). When T cells and mature B cells were included, they associated with lymphoid-dominant clusters, a finding in line with the results from mice (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 8e) and indicating their distinct clonal origins compared with the other cells. In donor A.4, in whom a large CH clone contributed to T cells, mutant T cells clustered with the remaining CH-derived cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Together with the results from the mouse LARRY experiment, this finding constitutes evidence that the identified clones remain stable from HSCs to myeloid, T cells, NK cells and immature B cells.

To establish a conservative estimate for a minimum clone size of EPI-Clone in humans, we determined the smallest CH clone identified using this method. The clone DNMT3A(C666Y) in donor A.4 had 145 cells or a relative size of 1% in the myeloid compartment. Furthermore, we observed that several large CH clones (for example, DNMT3A(R659H) in donor A.4; Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 8) had diversified into two clones with a similar but distinguishable static CpG profile. This result suggests that over decades, epimutations can continue to accrue phylogenetic information. In conclusion, these analyses demonstrate the ability of EPI-Clone to identify expanded haematopoietic clones of a wide range of sizes in human bone marrow and blood.

We leveraged the ability of EPI-Clone to trace both CH clones, which are well characterized in humans28,43, and clones without known driver mutations (non-CH clones) to functionally compare these two types of clonal expansions in our TBM and CD34+ cohorts. Owing to their putatively distinct clonal origins, we excluded T cells and mature B cells from this analysis. As expected3, in the TBM cohort, we observed an age-dependent accumulation of expanded CH and non-CH clones (Fig. 4f). Notably, in the CD34+ cohort, which was mostly sampled from individuals aged 50–60 years, we identified a correlation between the fraction of granulocyte–macrophage progenitors (GMPs) in the sample and the accumulation of expanded clones (Fig. 4g), which suggested that cues that enhance myelopoiesis also lead to more clonal expansions.

CH clones tended to be more expanded than non-CH clones, but were not always among the largest ones (Fig. 4h). Expanded clones were significantly depleted (compared with cells from non-expanded clones) from the B cell and erythroid lineages (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 8f), which implicated a link between myelopoiesis and expansion even for non-CH clones. Compared with non-CH clones, CH clones were significantly enriched in HSCs and MPPs but depleted from the B cell and erythroid lineages (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). These results highlight a stem-cell bias in age-expanded clones that is conserved across mice and humans, and they support a model whereby CH clones are part of a spectrum of such age-expanded clones.

Grey dots are clones with no known driver mutation, dots in colour are clones with a CH mutation (see Fig. 4c for the colour scheme). b, Dot plot depicting P values for enrichments and depletion of cell types in expanded versus non-expanded and CH versus non-CH clones. For this analysis, cell-type composition of clones (for example, the percentage of clone CD34+) were transformed using a logit transform and P values were computed using a mixed-effect model, using donor as a random effect and clone type (expanded or non-expanded or CH or non-CH) as a fixed effect (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). c, Schematic of the scTAMARA-seq protocol (for the X.1 experiment; Extended Data Fig. 9). d, Clones discovered using EPI-Clone were identified on CD34+ cells from donor X.1 using DNA methylation data.

To resolve transcriptional differences between clones in the HSC and MPP (HSC/MPP) compartment, we added targeted RNA-seq to the scTAM-seq protocol (single-cell targeted analysis of the methylome and RNA (scTAMARA-seq); Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9a). To that end, we combined SDR-seq45, a recently described targeted RNA-seq protocol for Mission Bio Tapestri, with scTAM-seq. We profiled one of the CD34+ bone marrow samples (X.1) and obtained high-quality DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from 2,745 cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b–e). scRNA-seq data confirmed the accuracy of DNA-methylation-based cell-state annotation and showed an increased resolution of transcriptomic data at the level of erythromyeloid progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). We then investigated the gene-expression pattern of distinct clones. HSC/MPP-biased clones expressed low levels of TAL1, SLC40A1 and CDC45 at the HSC/MPP level and high levels of CEBPA, which suggested that clonal fate biases are correlated with gene-expression changes at early stem and progenitor states (Fig. 5d). These results further demonstrate the compatibility of EPI-Clone with targeted RNA-seq from the same cell.

In the field, there is controversy regarding the potential of other somatic events, in particular low-heteroplasmy mtDNA variants, for lineage tracing14,15,16. To perform a direct experimental comparison, we used EPI-Clone to analyse peripheral blood from a 38-year-old healthy donor (X.2) that had previously been characterized by a state-of-the-art single-cell mitochondrial lineage tracing method, mt-scATAC-seq13,46. We identified 44 clones from this sample, which displayed prominent clonal expansions of NK cells and T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a). By including a mitochondrial targeting panel into scTAM-seq, we achieved a median coverage of 176 reads per cell on the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). Of the 23 mtDNA variants previously identified46 (Supplementary Table 3) in this donor and covered in scTAM-seq, 5 had clear phylogenetic relationships with the clones identified using EPI-Clone. That is, they were either subclones of single clones or were parental to several of the identified clones (Fig. 5f), and one variant was observed in two clones. A highly abundant variant (mt:7076A>G) was strongly enriched or depleted in 17 T cell or NK cell clones identified using EPI-Clone, but was observed in approximately 50% of cells of the remaining, mostly multilineage or B cell, clones identified (Fig. 5g). This variant was probably present before epimutational patterns were established and repeatedly underwent selection throughout development and adulthood. Therefore, T cell clones with a recent history of expansion may or may not carry the variant, whereas multilineage clones that expanded before selection of the variant contain a mix of mutant and wild-type cells. Finally, the remaining 16 low-heteroplasmy mitochondrial variants did not segregate with clones identified using EPI-Clone (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e). These findings are in line with a recent report15 observing that only some observed mitochondrial variants carry phylogenetic information, and illustrate the complexity of mitochondrial genetics, for which selection of variants can happen repeatedly during differentiation46. These results also provide additional orthogonal validation of the value of EPI-Clone outside the setting of CH.

In summary, DNA methylation at a few hundred CpGs is sufficient to simultaneously identify clones and cell states of haematopoietic cells and ECs, whereas individual CpGs are either informative of cell states or clones. Somatic epimutations seem to be a stable, long-term lineage tracer. Indeed, 5–10 months had elapsed between introduction of the ground-truth clonal label and collection of cells after transplantation. In humans, previous studies have indicated that decades pass between the initial acquisition of CH or LoY and the observation of expanded clones in age3.

This result raises the question of where and how clonal epimutations arise. We found that they randomly occur but remain stable over many cell divisions. Moreover, their numbers do not increase during differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 9a) and they are enriched for heterochromatic and late-replicating domains. We propose that some developmental events that are characterized by rapid cellular proliferation and/or a remodelling of the DNA methylome, such as the specification of HSCs47, essentially randomize the methylation state of CpGs in heterochromatic and late-replicating regions. A potential explanation of this effect is that in rapidly dividing cells, DNMT1 may not act sufficiently to copy the DNA methylation state to the nascent DNA strand (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Consistent with this idea, a recent study of bulk methylome profiles from blood cells in monozygotic twins suggested that clone-associated variation of the methylome may be established during embryonic development48. In the case of some large CH clones, we observed additional diversification of epimutational patterns.

We therefore propose that variably methylated CpGs in non-regulatory genomic regions can act as a digital barcode of clonal origin. The digital and stochastic nature of epimutations makes single-cell methods that are capable of mapping the methylation state of single CpGs at high confidence, such as scTAM-seq, a powerful tool for lineage tracing. While this article was under review, a method termed MethylTree49 demonstrated identification of clonal identity from sparse whole-genome, single-cell DNA methylation data. Compared with MethylTree, our approach is more scalable, less expensive and less computationally intense. Conversely, scTAM-seq requires the design of a species-specific targeting panel.

The robustness of EPI-Clone is best evidenced by its capacity to identify high-resolution clonal patterns in native haematopoiesis. We demonstrated that both native human and mouse haematopoiesis shifts from highly polyclonal to oligoclonal blood production, and we investigated clone function in these two species using a coherent, unified method. Expanded clones in mice tended to be more numerous, but individually smaller, and poorly contribute to haematopoiesis in transplants. This observation seems to be in line with the larger and more polyclonal stem cell compartment in humans, but a much longer period of clonal selection and drift. In our human data, oligoclonal blood production became detectable at an age of around 50 years and manifested itself as an inevitable and potentially clock-like process after the age of 60 years.

Our data further put CH mutations into a perspective with clonal expansions without known drivers. That is, CH clones are more strongly biased towards the myeloid lineage and towards an expansion of stem cells, but together with non-CH clones form part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar functional properties. In aged mice, we similarly detected large HSC-expanded clones that had reduced regenerative capacity. Together with recent transplantation studies of human HSCs50, this result suggests that there is conservation of the processes that drive haematopoietic ageing and decline in clonal complexity, and it highlights that CH mutations might not be the main driver of this process. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased mortality risk in carriers of driver-free expanded clones27. These results call for a broader investigation of age-related decline in clonality instead of a strict focus on CH.

An overview of all experiments performed for this study is included in Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1. For the mouse experiments with an available ground truth from the LARRY lentiviral barcoding system (experiments M.1, M.2, M.4, M.5), LARRY barcoding vectors were constructed and lentiviruses were produced (see the section ‘Lentiviral barcoding using the LARRY system'). Stem cells were then collected from mice, transduced with the LARRY lentiviruses and transplanted, and different cellular compartments were collected 5–10 months later for profiling by scTAM-seq (see the section ‘Experimental procedures (mouse study)'). Additional experiments were performed on biological material from non-treated mice of different ages (experiments M.3 and M.6–M.8; see the section ‘Experimental procedures (mouse study)'). For the human study, primary bone marrow samples were analysed (see the section ‘Experimental procedures (human study)').

All biological material was analysed by scTAM-seq5 (see the section ‘Single-cell DNA methylation profiling with scTAM-seq'). scTAM-seq is a targeted method for DNA methylation analysis based on the Mission Bio Tapestri platform. Specifically, up to 1,000 amplicons 200–400 base pairs in length are amplified from the genomes of single cells. Before this amplification step, scTAM-seq includes a digestion step with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, HhaI. Therefore, CpG dinucleotides in HhaI sites are only effectively amplified if methylated. The selection of the target amplicons comprising individual CpGs is a crucial step in this protocol (see the sections ‘Mouse panel design for scTAM-seq' and ‘Human panel design for scTAM-seq'). Relevant genetic information (LARRY barcodes or CH mutations) can be read out from gDNA by scTAM-seq in the same cells, specifically by covering these regions with amplicons not containing HhaI cut sites. Surface-antigen expression was read out through the inclusion of oligonucleotide-barcoded antibodies in the protocol. We also included dedicated experiments demonstrating the combination of scTAM-seq with RNA-seq from the same single cell (experiment X.1, see the section ‘Combined profiling of DNA methylation and RNA in the same cell') or mitochondrial genome sequencing (experiment X.2, see the section ‘Combined profiling of DNA methylation and mitochondrial variants').

Key steps in the data analyses (see the section ‘Bioinformatic analysis (mouse)') were to define cell states through data integration and subsequently to identify clones using the EPI-Clone algorithm. This algorithm first identifies CpGs with no surface-antigen association as potentially clone-associated or ‘static' CpGs, and subsequently performs clustering and dimensionality reduction exclusively on these CpGs (see the section ‘EPI-Clone'). For the analyses of the human data, the same overall strategy was used. Additional steps and adjustments included mutation calling and definition of a consensus set of static CpGs across donors (see the section ‘Bioinformatic analysis (human)').

A detailed protocol for performing scTAM-seq for clonal tracing with EPI-Clone is available from protocols.io51.

Barcode libraries were constructed according to a previously established protocol (https://www.protocols.io/view/barcode-plasmid-library-cloning-4hggt3w). First, the T-Sapphire or eGFP coding sequences and the EF1a promoter sequence were PCR-amplified from pEB1-T-Sapphire and pLARRY-eGFP with primers homologous to the vector insertion site in a custom lentiviral plasmid backbone (Vectorbuilder) using Gibson assembly (Gibson assembly master mix, NEB, E2611L). After magnetic bead purification, ligated vectors were transformed into NEB10-beta electroporation ultracompetent Escherichia coli cells (NEB 10-beta electrocompetent E. coli, NEB, C3020K) and grown overnight on LB plates supplemented with 50 μg ml–1 carbenicillin (carbenicillin disodium salt, Thermo Scientific Chemicals, 11568616). Colonies were scraped using LB medium and pelleted by centrifugation. Plasmid maxipreps were performed using an Endotoxin-Free Plasmid Maxi kit (Macheray Nagel), following the manufacturer's protocol. pEB1-T-Sapphire was a gift from P. Cluzel (Addgene plasmid 103977). pLARRY-eGFP was a gift from F. Camargo (Addgene plasmid 140025).

To barcode pLARRY plasmids and generate a library, a spacer sequence flanked by EcoRV restriction sites was cloned into the plasmid after the WPRE element of the vector. Custom PAGE-purified single-strand oligonucleotides with a pattern of 20 random-bases (GTTCCANNNNTGNNNNCANNNNGTNNNNAGNNNN) and surrounded by 25 nucleotides homologous to the vector insertion site were synthesized by IDT DNA Technologies. The assembly of these components and subsequent purification steps were carried out through Gibson assembly (Gibson assembly master mix, NEB, E2611L). Six electroporations of the bead-purified ligations were performed into NEB10-beta E. coli cells (NEB 10-beta electrocompetent E. coli, New England Biolabs, C3020K) using a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). After transformation, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h at 220 r.p.m. After incubation, the transformed cells were plated in six large LB–ampicillin agar plates overnight at 30 °C. Colonies from all six plates were collected by scraping with LB–ampicillin and then grown for an additional 2 h at 225 r.p.m. and 30 °C. Cultures were pelleted by centrifugation, and plasmids were isolated using an Endotoxin-Free Plasmid Maxi kit (Macheray-Nagel), following the manufacturer's protocol.

For estimating diversity, LARRY barcode amplicon libraries were prepared by PCR amplification of the lentiviral library maxiprep using flanking oligonucleotides carrying TruSeq read1 and read2 adaptors using 10 ng of the library (Supplementary Table 4). We used the minimal number of cycles that we could detect by quantitative PCR to avoid PCR amplification bias (10–12 cycles). After bead purification, 10 ng of the first PCR product was used as a template for a second PCR to add Illumina P5 and P7 adaptors and indexes (Supplementary Table 4). Two independent PCRs were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 platform (Novogene) to confirm diversity after correction of errors through collapsing with a Hamming distance of 4. After collapsing, libraries were confirmed to contain at least 50 million different barcodes, with enough diversity for uniquely labelling up to 100,000 HSCs with a minimal false-positive rate.

Lentivirus production and HSPC transduction were performed as previously described8.

All procedures involving animals adhered to the pertinent regulations and guidelines. Approval and oversight for all protocols and strains of mice were granted by the Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Parque Científico de Barcelona under protocols CEEA-PCB-22-001-ARF-P1 and CEEA-PCB-22-002-ARF-P2. The study followed all relevant ethical regulations. CD45.1 (CD45.1, B6.SJL-Ptprca Pep3b/BoyJ, 002014, The Jackson Laboratory) mice were used as transplantation recipients for CD45.2 (BL6/J) donor cells. Mice were kept under specific-pathogen-free conditions for all experiments. We used 12–100-week-old male and female mice for our experiments. Neither randomization nor blinding was used. Experiments were performed with one or two biological replicates of mice, and no statistical methods were used for sample size choice. To minimize distress, euthanasia was performed by administering isoflurane inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation to ensure the animals were fully deceased.

Following euthanasia, bone marrow was collected from the femur, tibia, pelvis and sternum through mechanical crushing, ensuring the retrieval of most of the cells. The collected bone marrow cells were then sieved through a 40 μm strainer and cleansed with a cold ‘Easy Sep' buffer containing PBS, 2% FBS, 1 mM EDTA and penicillin–streptomycin followed by lysis of red blood cells using RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend, 420302). At first, mature lineage cells were selectively depleted using a Lineage Cell Depletion kit, mouse (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-110-470), and the resulting LIN– (lineage-negative) fraction was then enriched for KIT expression using CD117 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-224). These KIT-enriched cells were washed, blocked with FcX and stained with the following fluorescently labelled antibodies: APC anti-mouse CD117, clone ACK2 (BioLegend, 105812); PE/Cy7 anti-mouse Ly6a (SCA1) (BioLegend, 108114); Pacific Blue anti-mouse Lineage cocktail (BioLegend, 133310); PE anti-mouse CD201 (EPCR) (BioLegend, 141504); PE/Cy5 anti-mouse CD150 (SLAM) (BioLegend, 115912); and APC/Cy7 anti-mouse CD48 (BioLegend, 103432). For transplants, EPCR+LIN–SCA1+KIT+CD48–CD150+ HSCs were sorted by FACS with a BD FACSAria Fusion with a 70 µm nozzle.

In vitro cultures of HSCs were done under self-renewing F12-PVA-based conditions as previously described52. To culture HSCs, 96-well flat-bottom plates from Thermo Scientific were coated with a layer of 100 ng ml–1 fibronectin (bovine fibronectin protein, 1030-FN) for 30 min at room temperature. After the sorting process, HSCs were transferred into 200 µl complete HSC medium supplemented with 100 ng ml–1 recombinant mouse TPO (PeproTech Recombinant Murine TPO, 315-14) and 10 ng ml–1 recombinant mouse SCF (PeproTech Recombinant Murine SCF, 250-03) and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. During lentiviral library transduction, the first medium change took place 24 h after transduction. Three days after labelling, the cultured HSCs were collected and subsequently transplanted into conditioned CD45.1 mice. The CD45.1 recipient mouse was preconditioned with a lethal X-ray radiation dose, administered as two separate sessions amounting to 5 Gy each, with a 4-h interval between them. To assess the engraftment of donor cells, the percentage of CD45.2+ peripheral blood leukocytes (and the percentage of fluorescent-protein-labelled cells) was determined. All mice demonstrated stable long-term engraftment until the experimental end point. Engraftment analysis, along with the measurement of labelling frequency, was carried out using BD FACS Fusion.

In all single-cell experiments, unless described otherwise in the subsequent sections, transplanted or untreated mice were euthanized at specified ages and time points after transplant, and a KIT-enriched cell fraction was isolated from the femur, tibia, pelvis and sternum, per the protocol described above. This KIT-enriched cell population was stained with FcX block to prevent nonspecific binding and subsequently stained again with the following panel of fluorescently labelled antibodies: APC anti-mouse CD117 (clone ACK2, BioLegend, 105812); PE/Cy7 anti-mouse Ly6a (SCA1) (BioLegend, 108114); and Pacific Blue anti-mouse Lineage cocktail (BioLegend, 133310). In all mouse experiments, cells were also labelled with a custom TotalSeq-B antibody cocktail (Supplementary Table 2). After staining, distinct cellular compartments were sorted as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1 and profiled by scTAM-seq (see below).

For validating EPI-Clone using a ground-truth genetic lineage-tracing experiment, we performed two experiments: the main LARRY experiment (M.1) and the LARRY replicate experiment (M.2) (Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3). For M.1, two donor mice were killed, and HSCs were labelled with LARRY constructs containing a GFP label in one case and LARRY constructs containing a Sapphire label in the other case. Subsequently, labelled cells from each donor were transplanted into two recipient mice each. Accordingly, the dataset contains cells from four mice that contain two sets of clones, labelled with GFP and Sapphire, respectively. GFP and Sapphire clones did not mix on EPI-Clone UMAPs (Extended Data Fig. 3f), which further demonstrates that clones identified using EPI-Clone are individual-specific. We profiled all four recipient mice after allowing full blood reconstitution over 5 months. We also repeated this experiment again for validating the computational method (experiment M.2) using only one donor mouse. For both experiment M.1 and experiment M.2, we collected LSK and LK cells from the bone marrow and mixed them at 60,000 (LK) plus 50,000 (LSK) before analysing the cells using the Tapestri platform (Supplementary Table 1).

In this experiment (M.3; Fig. 1), we killed a 12-week-old wild-type BL6/J (CD45.2) mouse, extracted 120,000 LK cells and subjected them to scTAM-seq (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

For profiling tissue-resident myeloid cells (experiment M.4; Extended Data Fig. 4), a single LARRY-transplanted mouse was anaesthetized 10 months after transplantation and perfused. Subsequently, lungs were extracted from the chest cavity, and a single-cell suspension was prepared using a protease and DNAse solution from a Lung Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, 130–095-927) followed by mechanical dissociation using gentleMACS ‘C' columns (Miltenyi Biotech, 130–093-237) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The dissociated cells were filtered using a 70 μm strainer and centrifuged at 400g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and red blood cell lysis was performed using RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend, 420302). Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and pelleted at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer before being passed through a 40 μm strainer and stained for the mature myeloid cell marker. Cells were stained with the following fluorescently labelled antibodies: PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse/human CD11b (BioLegend, 101227; clone M1/70) and PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse CD45.2 (BioLegend, 109829; clone 104). Cells were also labelled with TotalSeq-B antibody cocktail. We then sorted CD45.2+CD11b+LARRY(GFP)+ immune cells from lung. In parallel, we also sorted and stained LSK and LK cells and mature CD11b+ populations from both bone marrow and peripheral blood, followed by single-cell profiling.

For this experiment (M.5; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4), a single LARRY-transplanted mouse was euthanized 5 months after transplantation, and cells from the spleen and bone marrow were collected as described above. After red blood cell lysis, equal amounts of cells from both organs were pooled, washed and blocked with FcX. The cells were then stained with the following fluorescently labelled antibodies: Pacific Blue anti-mouse FcεRIα (BioLegend, 134313; clone MAR-1); PE/Cyanine5 anti-mouse CD19 (BioLegend, 115509; clone 6D5); Brilliant Violet 605 anti-mouse CD11c (BioLegend, 117333; clone N418); PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse/human CD11b (BioLegend, 101227; clone M1/70); APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse Ly-6G (BioLegend, 127623; clone 1A8); APC anti-mouse CD3 (BioLegend, 100235; clone 17A2); and PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse CD115 (CSF-1R) (BioLegend, 135523; clone AFS98). We then sorted the following populations from LARRY+ live cells based on their surface markers: T cells (CD3+CD19–), B cells (CD3–CD19+), neutrophils (CD11b+CD3–CD19–Ly6G+), monocytes (CD11b+CD3–CD19–Ly6G–CD115+) and eosinophils and basophils (CD11b+CD3–CD19–FcεR1a+).

For profiling ECs from 100-week-old mice (experiment M.6; Extended Data Fig. 5), dissociated lung cells were collected as described above. The resultant cell population was then enriched for CD31 expression using CD31 MicroBeads (mouse, 130-097-418, Miltenyi Biotec) per the manufacturer's guidelines. These CD31-enriched cells were then washed, blocked with FcX and stained with the following fluorescently labelled antibodies: PE anti-mouse CD31 (BioLegend, 102507; clone MEC13.3) and PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse CD45.2 (BioLegend, 109829; clone 104). Following staining, CD31+ and CD45.2– cells were sorted as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 1.

For this experiment (M.7; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 5–7), the KIT-enriched cell fraction was stained and subsequently sorted to collect LSK and LK populations as described above. Samples were collected from two young (12-week-old) BL6/J (CD45.2) mice and two aged (100-week-old) BL6/J (CD45.2) mice.

For this experiment (M.8; Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6), half of the HSC population from a 100-week-old mouse that was profiled as part of experiment M.7 were labelled with LARRY lentivirus and transplanted into lethally irradiated mice. Six months after transplant, mice were euthanized, and a KIT-enriched cell fraction was isolated from the femur, tibia, pelvis and sternum, following the protocol outlined above. This KIT-enriched cell population was stained with FcX block to prevent nonspecific binding and subsequently stained again with the following panel of fluorescently labelled antibodies: APC anti-mouse CD117 (clone ACK2, BioLegend, 105812); PE/Cy7 anti-mouse Ly6a (SCA1) (BioLegend, 108114); and Pacific Blue anti-mouse Lineage cocktail (BioLegend, 133310). After staining, LK and LSK cells were sorted as described above.

Bone marrow samples were obtained from different sources. Samples A.1, A.6 and A.7 were bone marrow aspirates from healthy volunteers collected at the Heidelberg University Hospital after informed written consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University (S-480/2011). Sample A.4 was a TBM sample obtained through the Banc de Sang i Teixits (Barcelona, Spain) and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona (HCB/2023/0367). Samples B.1–B.5 and X.1 were commercially available samples of purified CD34+ cells from organ donors (Ossium Health). No genomic characterization was performed on these samples before this study. Samples A.2, A.3 and A.5 were collected after informed written consent from individuals undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre under the ‘Mechanisms of Age-Related Clonal Haematopoiesis' (MARCH) study. This study was approved by the Yorkshire and The Humber–Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee (NHS REC ref: 17/YH/0382). These samples were screened for somatic mutations with a variant allele frequency of ≥0.01 by targeted DNA sequencing of a panel covering 97 genes (347 kb) recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies and CH, as previously described43. Samples with somatic mutations in DNMT3A and PPM1D were selected for analyses. Finally, sample X.2. was a peripheral blood sample collected and characterized by mt-scATAC–seq as previously described46. Informed consent was given and approved for genomics profiling by the Stanford Institutional Review Board (number 14734).

All experiments involving human samples were approved by the corresponding ethics committees and were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Bone marrow samples were thawed and stained using CD34 and CD3 sorting antibodies (BioLegend, 343517) and a pool of oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies from the TotalSeq-D Heme Oncology Cocktail from BioLegend (MB53-0053) as well as additional TotalSeq-D antibodies from BioLegend (Supplementary Table 6). Samples were then sorted for CD34+ and CD34– populations and subjected to scTAM-seq (see below). For details on sorting, see Supplementary Table 1.

Samples B.1 and B.5, B.2 and B.4, and A.2 and A.5 were in pairs, multiplexed into single Tapestri lanes. Demultiplexing was performed on the basis of germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms on autosomes with vireo53. Chromosome Y and pre-characterized somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were used as controls (Supplementary Fig. 10 and see the section on ‘Bioinformatic analysis (human)').

For profiling DNA methylation at single-cell resolution, we used scTAM-seq5, which leverages the Mission Bio Tapestri technology to investigate up to 1,000 CpGs in 1,000s of cells per experiment. In brief, we loaded 120,000–140,000 cells into the Tapestri machine and followed the default Mission Bio DNA+Protein protocol for V2/V3 chemistry for the experiments (v.2: https://missionbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tapestri-Single-Cell-DNA-Protein-Sequencing-V2-User-Guide-PN_3360A.pdf; v.3: https://missionbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tapestri-Single-Cell-DNA-Protein-Sequencing-v3-User-Guide_MB05-0018.pdf; see also Supplementary Table 1), but with the following modifications: (1) we added a DNA methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (HhaI) to digest non-methylated targets (CpGs) before amplification; and (2) in the case of the mouse experiments, we used TotalSeq-B antibodies and different primers for the amplification of antibody oligonucleotide tags. The default Mission Bio protocol uses a different type of oligonucleotide tag, TotalSeq-D, which we used here for the experiments using human samples, but which are currently not available for mouse antigens.

For the mouse samples stained with TotalSeq-B, we added 5 μl of highly concentrated HhaI (150,000 U ml–1, NEB) enzyme and 2 µl of 30 µM of a custom antibody tag primer specific for the amplification of the oligonucleotide tags of TotalSeq-B antibodies (ACTCGCAGTAGTCTTGCTAGGACCGGCCTTAAAG) to the Tapestri barcoding mix reagent. An incubation at 37 °C for 30 min was added to the start of the targeted PCR thermal cycling program to allow for the restriction enzyme digest to take place before the PCR amplification step. The use of TotalSeq-B antibodies primarily affected the ‘Protein Library Cleanup I' section of the protocol, for which we replaced the 2× binding and washing (B&W) buffer from the kit with the following buffer prepared with nuclease-free water: Tris-HCl (final concentration 10 mM, pH 7.5), EDTA (final concentration 1 mM) and NaCl (final concentration 2 M). We used 2 µl of 5 µM of our custom biotin oligonucleotide (/5Biosg/GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTG/3C6/) to isolate the antibody tags. Moreover, during the isolation of antibody tags, we performed the second wash of streptavidin beads with 1 ml nuclease-free water instead of 1× B&W buffer. Finally, each tube of streptavidin beads was resuspended in 45 µl of nuclease-free water then transferred and combined into a new tube for a total of 90 µl. To amplify the final protein target library, we used 5 µl of 4 µM of each custom indexed primers (forward: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT[i7 index]GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT; reverse: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC[i5 index]TCGTCGGCAGCGTC). Typically, we performed twice as many reactions to amplify the DNA target library, but this may be increased to achieve sufficient yield. Last, we adjusted the AMPure XP reagent-to-sample ratio in the second size-selection step in the ‘DNA Library Cleanup II' section from 0.72× to 0.65×.

For the human samples stained with TotalSeq-D, we followed the scTAM-seq protocol as previously described5.

Using the stained cells that we used as input to scTAM-seq, we also performed 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ for transcriptomic profiling of the cells, following the standard protocol. This step was exclusively performed for experiment M.1 (Supplementary Table 1). For the transcriptomic data, LARRY barcodes were later amplified using a modified version of the protocol8 (see Supplementary Table 4 for an updated list of primers).

We aimed to design a panel with CpGs dynamically methylated in HSCs, as well as in more committed progenitors (MPPs). We collected bulk whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from a previous publication22 profiling DNA methylation in three replicates of HSCs (LSK and CD135−CD48−CD150+CD34−), MPP1 (LSK and CD135−CD48−CD150+CD34+), MPP2 (LSK and CD135−CD48+CD150+CD34+), and a mixture of MPP3 (LSK and CD135−CD150−CD48+CD34+) and MPP4 (LSK and CD135+CD150−CD48+CD34+). Using these data, we selected CpGs that were variably methylated in HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) using three criteria: (1) CpGs differentially methylated between the HSCs and the different MPP populations (DMCs); (2) CpGs intermediately methylated within HSCs (IMCs); and (3) CpGs harbouring within-sample heterogeneity in HSCs (WSHs). The code for selecting CpGs is available from GitHub (https://github.com/veltenlab/EPI-CloneSelection).

For DMCs, we used RnBeads54 to determine CpGs that were specifically methylated in one of the HSPCs (that is, in HSC, MPP1, MPP2 or MPP3/MPP4) but not methylated in all the remaining HSPC populations. We only focused on CpGs that were covered by at least 10 sequencing reads in all samples and that had a methylation difference of at least 0.2 between the target cell type and the average of the remaining cell types.

IMCs had to be non-overlapping with DMCs and were then defined by a DNA methylation level in the bulk samples (HSCs) between 0.25 and 0.75. Such CpGs may be differentially methylated between two sub-cell types of HSCs. IMCs were required to have a low proportion of discordant reads (PDRs)55 together with a high quantitative fraction of discordant read pairs (qFDRPs)56. PDR and qFDRP are measures of WSH in bulk bisulfite sequencing data and quantify the concordance of methylation states on the same sequencing read (PDR) or of multiple CpGs across different sequencing reads (qFDRP).

CpGs with high WSH were non-overlapping with DMCs and IMCs. The CpGs were then identified on the basis of the high levels of both PDR and qFDRP. These CpGs were therefore located in regions showing variable methylation profiles in bulk sequencing data and might represent regions with stochastic methylation in HSCs.

After identifying all CpGs that fulfilled the above criteria, we excluded any CpGs that were not in the context of a HhaI cut site and enriched the selected CpGs for those located in the vicinity (100 bp) of at least one TFBS of an important haematopoietic transcription factor (Supplementary Table 5). We then selected 105 CpGs specifically methylated in HSCs, 70 in MPP1, 70 in MPP2, 75 in MPP3/MPP4, 210 IMCs and 80 WSH (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). We also included the following control amplicons: 20 constitutively methylated, 20 constitutively unmethylated and 50 amplicons without a HhaI cut site. Control amplicons were required to identify cells from the data because the remaining amplicons were digested depending on their methylation state. We uploaded this list to the Mission Bio Designer tool (https://designer.missionbio.com/) to receive a final list of 663 amplicons and corresponding primer sequences (Supplementary Table 5). The CpGs were further annotated according to their location in the genome with respect to chromatin states as previously defined57. From the 573 non-control amplicons, a subset of 453 amplicons with low dropout rate in an experiment without HhaI digest was used for analysis.

For amplifying the LARRY barcodes, we spiked in an additional primer into the primer pool targeting the LARRY barcode sequence (forward: GCATCGGTTGCTAGGAGAGA; reverse: GGGAGTGAATTAGCCCTTCCA). We could therefore read out the LARRY barcode together with information about the DNA methylation state from the same single cell.

The design for the human panel closely followed the strategy applied for the mouse panel. Two previously published datasets21,58 were used to similarly profile DMCs, IMCs and, additionally, CpGs with interindividual heterogeneity (IIH). Sites were selected to not include single-nucleotide polymorphisms according to dbSNP v.151 and to be located in the HhaI cut sequence.

For DMCs, we considered peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from a previous study21. Samples with an average coverage across all CpGs below 1 were removed. DMCs between HSCs, MPPs, multilymphoid progenitors (MLPs; combining MLP0, MLP1, MLP2 and MLP3), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and GMPs were computed using RnBeads. CpGs with a mean methylation difference higher than 0.1 between the cell types were identified as DMCs.

We performed IMC detection on HSC-enriched lineage-negative (LIN−CD34+CD38−) samples from eight male donors using a previously published dataset58. To deal with data sparsity, we set the maximum quantile of missing values per site to 0.005 and removed any sites that exceeded this threshold. IMCs were defined as CpGs with a DNA methylation level between 0.25 and 0.75 in at least 5 samples. When checking for a HhaI cut site, we allowed for a maximum of 25 CpG sites in the extended region around the IMC.

For CpGs with IIH, we used the same dataset to identify CpGs with a variance higher than 0.1 across all individuals of the dataset from ref. 58.

We also created genotyping amplicons that cover mutations in ASXL1, DNMT3A, TET2, TP53, JAK2, IDH2, PPM1D, SF3B1, IDH1 and SRSF2. We used 62 amplicons covering these genes from the Tapestri single-cell DNA myeloid panel by Mission Bio (https://missionbio.com/products/panels/myeloid/) as a base panel, excluding amplicons with the HhaI restriction sequence GCGC. We designed further amplicons for exons in the aforementioned genes that had a coverage of less than 60% in the default myeloid panel. To prevent these amplicons from having a recognition site, we performed a virtual digestion of the exonic sequences using the HhaI cut sequence. We then uploaded a list containing the fragmented genomic regions to the Mission Bio Designer tool, which resulted in 82 additional amplicons. We also included 20 amplicons targeting chromosome Y and 50 control amplicons without a HhaI cut-sequence. We uploaded the CpG targets and readily designed genotyping, chromosome Y, and control amplicons using the Mission Bio Designer tool. The final list comprises 665 amplicons and corresponding primer sequences. The resulting 448 CpG targeting amplicons are divided into 215 DMC, 145 IMC and 88 IIH amplicons (Supplementary Table 6).

Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 2 × 100 bp (scTAM-seq mouse), 2 × 150 bp (scTAM-seq human), 2 × 50 bp (scRNA-seq) and 2 × 50 bp (protein libraries) reads. For an overview of the sequencing statistics, see Supplementary Table 7.

To jointly profile DNA methylation and RNA in the same cell (scTAMARA-seq, experiment X.1), we took advantage of the recently published SDR-seq method45 and combined it with scTAM-seq. In total, we profiled 120 RNA and 367 gDNA (200 DNA methylation and 167 genotyping) targets (Supplementary Table 6). DNA methylation targets were a subset of the original set, excluding amplicons that were not identified as consensus static or dynamic CpGs in the total bone marrow original cohort and low-performing amplicons. RNA targets were selected from a RNA-seq reference map59 using LASSO regression to identify 120 RNAs most predictive of cell state in the CD34+ compartment. We followed the SDR-seq protocol45 using the glyoxal fixation condition. Once the cells had been fixed, permeabilized and reverse-transcribed, they were loaded onto the Mission Bio Tapestri platform and processed as for scTAM-seq. The final RNA and DNA sequencing libraries were individually generated as previously described45.

For this experiment (scTAMito-seq, experiment X.2), we performed scTAM-seq using the same 367 DNA methylation and genotyping amplicons as for scTAMARA-seq. We spiked in a pre-designed mitochondrial panel (https://designer.missionbio.com/catalogpanels/Virtual-mtDNA) at a ratio of 1:20 as previously described60.

For processing of raw data, we used a modified pipeline that was based on the originally described pipeline for scTAM-seq5 (https://github.com/veltenlab/scTAM-seq-scripts), which is available from GitHub (https://github.com/veltenlab/EPICloneProcessing). In brief, cellular barcodes were extracted from the raw sequencing files before alignment to the reference genome subset to the CpG panel. Reads mapping to each of the amplicons were quantified to generate a count matrix, and DNA methylation states were determined using a cut-off value of one sequencing read as in the original scTAM-seq publication5. We used those cellular barcodes that had more than 10 sequencing reads in at least 70% of the control (non-HhaI) amplicons. Doublets were removed using the DoubletDetection tool (https://zenodo.org/record/2678042).

At the single-cell level, we differentiated methylated from unmethylated CpGs through the presence of at least one sequencing read for the corresponding amplicon as in the original publication of scTAM-seq5. Sequencing reads can uniquely originate from amplicons with methylated CpGs, whereas the lack of sequencing reads from an amplicon originates either from an unmethylated CpG or from a dropout. To minimize the effect of dropout, we determined the primer combinations that reliably amplified in our panel using a single experiment without the restriction enzyme. For this experiment in mice, LIN−KIT+ cells from a young, wild-type mice (12 weeks) were used and we determined that 453 out of the 573 non-control amplicons (79%) amplified in more than 90% of the cells. These amplicons were used for subsequent analyses.

For the surface-protein data, the Mission Bio pipeline was used to extract sequencing reads for a particular cell-barcode–antibody-barcode combination. We restricted analyses of the protein data to those cellular barcodes identified in the DNA methylation library.

LARRY barcodes could be directly identified from the scTAM-seq sequencing library because an additional primer pair capturing the LARRY barcode was included (see the section ‘Mouse panel design for scTAM-seq'). Sequencing reads mapping to the amplicon with the LARRY barcode were extracted from the raw sequencing reads using the fluorophore sequence GCTAGGAGAGACCATATGGGATCCGAT. The LARRY barcode was determined using the base pairs following the GFP sequence, given that the sequence matches the rules by which the LARRY barcode was constructed (see the section ‘Barcode lentivirus library generation and diversity estimation'). Barcode extraction was performed using a modified version of the scripts provided in the original LARRY publication8 (https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/LARRY). Barcodes supported by fewer than five sequencing reads were discarded, and LARRY barcodes with a Hamming distance lower than three were merged for each of the experimental batches individually.

Notably, each cell can have more than one unique LARRY barcode owing to multiple lentiviral infections. In these cases, groups of LARRY barcodes were jointly passed on to the progeny. To call clones in this setting, we computed for any pair of LARRY barcodes the extent to which these two barcodes were observed in an overlapping set of cells (formally a Jaccard index). LARRY barcodes were then clustered according to this distance metric. We used a permutation test to determine LARRY barcodes that are merged together to a clone. When LARRY barcodes were merged, cells were assigned to the merged clone if any constituent LARRY barcode was observed.

We constructed Seurat61 objects for each of the scTAM-seq samples individually using the binary DNA methylation matrix. To integrate all the samples from experiments M.1–M.3, we used Seurat's IntegrateData62 function. Then we used Seurat's standard workflow without normalization to obtain a low-dimensional representation of our data using UMAP. We removed cells in low-density parts of the UMAP because we found that these cells were of lower quality using the non-digested control amplicons. To annotate the cell-type clusters we obtained as result of the Seurat workflow, we inspected the expression of surface proteins, the DNA methylation states of CpGs in bulk data and the DNA methylation states of important lineage-specific transcription factors. To compare single-cell to bulk DNA methylation we computed the relative methylation state by dividing the average methylation state of all CpGs in the given group of bulk data (for example, HSC-specific) by the mean methylation state of all CpGs. To that end, we performed differential analysis for each cell-type cluster individually and selected CpGs with a log fold change larger than 1 for each cluster. For those sites, we investigated whether they are in the vicinity (100 bp) of any of the 39 transcription factors in Supplementary Table 5 and computed enrichment P values with the Fisher exact test. A full vignette is available from GitHub (https://github.com/veltenlab/EPI-clone).

All remaining experiments (M.4–M.8) were analysed without batch correction, as the samples were processed as single batches. Annotation of the cell-type clusters was performed in dynamic CpG space (see below) using bulk methylation values, demethylation of TFBSs and surface-protein expression. In addition to this information, for experiments M.7 and M.8, we projected cell-type labels from the initial analysis (experiments M.1–M.3) using scmap63. EPI-Clone was then used with the standard parameters as described below.

For processing the protein data of scTAM-seq, we used the centred-log-ratio (CLR) normalization methods. To generate a low-dimensional representation of the protein data only, we opted to use SCTransform64, which produced an improved cell-state resolution.

For the scRNA-seq dataset, we used cellranger to generate transcriptomic and surface-protein count matrices, which were used as input to Seurat. Harmony65 was used for batch integration and the cell-type annotation was performed using known haematopoietic marker genes together with the expression of surface proteins.

The EPI-Clone algorithm is divided into three steps: (1) identification of static CpGs, (2) identification of cells from expanded clones and (3) clustering of cells from expanded clones. A detailed, step-by-step vignette is available from GitHub (https://github.com/veltenlab/EPI-clone; v.2.0 used in this article). A brief description is given below.

To identify static CpGs, for each combination of CpG and surface protein, EPI-Clone performs a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to investigate whether cells with methylated CpG differ in surface-antigen expression relative to cells with unmethylated CpG. CpGs with no significant antigen association (determined by the lowest P value for any of the surface proteins) according to a Bonferroni criterion were then selected if their average methylation across all cells was less than 90% but higher than 25% in mouse and higher than 5% in human. In the main LARRY experiment in Figs. 1 and 2, this resulted in the identification of 110 CpGs, which we annotated for enhancer–heterochromatic regions57 and early–late-replicating domains66.

To identify cells from expanded clones, cells stemming from an expanded clone should be in a higher density region of the space defined by the static CpGs than cells stemming from non-expanded clones. A density estimate was therefore computed as follows. PCA was performed on all static CpGs from step (1). In the reduced dimensional space obtained by the first n = 100 principal components, the average Euclidean distance to the k = 5 nearest neighbours was determined. Effects of cell state, batch and sequencing depth on this measure of local density were then removed by linear regression. We observed that smoothing the resulting quantity locally over 20 nearest neighbours additionally improved performance. Optimal parameters n and k of this step, as well as the density threshold for a cell to be classified as stemming from an expanded clone, were identified through a systematic grid search on experiment M.1, using LARRY barcodes as a ground truth. Here clones >0.25% in size were defined as expanded.

To cluster expanded clones, cells from expanded clones were clustered using the standard Seurat workflow, again in a space spanned by n = 100 principal components.

The parameters of steps (2) and (3) were established on the basis of the original LARRY experiment (M.1: LARRY main experiment) and used for all subsequent analyses of the mouse haematopoietic system (M.2–M.5, M.7 and M.8) without further adjustments. Static CpGs were defined in experiment M.1 and used for all remaining experiments. In particular, the performance on a replicate LARRY ground-truth experiment (M.2) is analysed in Extended Data Fig. 3.

In the native ageing experiment (M.7), we opted for a more conservative threshold for defining large, expanded clones (1%), as native haematopoiesis is more polyclonal than the transplantation setting. This threshold resembled what we found in human native haematopoiesis, using CH mutations and mitochondrial mutations as a partial ground truth (Fig. 4).

For when no or only a partial ground truth was available (mouse endothelia (M.6), see below for more details, and the human analysis), we opted instead for a parameter-free approach to identify expanded clones. We used a recently published clustering method, CHOIR44, which automatically determines clusters that have statistical support in the data. Unlike the density-based criterion, CHOIR does not have free parameters (for example, number of principal components, density threshold, number of nearest neighbours to consider). We confirmed that on the mouse LARRY experiment, CHOIR had a similar quantitative performance to the density-based criterion at optimal parameter values (Extended Data Fig. 3g).

As the first step of this experiment (M.6), all CpGs were used for dimensionality reduction and clustering. Consequently, we identified a cluster of contaminating non-endothelial (CD31–) cells that we removed. We then used the dynamic CpGs defined in experiment M.1 to construct a cell-state map of ECs. The CLR-transformed protein levels enabled us to annotate ECs as capillary, Car4 or lymphatic, in concordance with transcriptomic references. Finally, the 110 static CpGs defined in experiment M.1 were used to identify clones in these lung ECs. Binary data were used as input for CHOIR44 using false-discovery rate adjustment. Only clones with a relative clone size greater than 1% are highlighted in the figures. For comparison with transcriptomic data, the Mouse LungMAP31 was downloaded from CELLxGENE Datasets (Mus musculus + Lung + 10×3′ v.2 + Smart-seq2) and subset for adult samples. The lung EC atlas67 was also downloaded (https://endotheliomics.shinyapps.io/ec_atlas/).

To understand whether EPI-Clone robustly identifies clones before and after transplantation, we investigated replicate 2 (old mouse) of the M.7 experiment together with the transplanted mouse (experiment M.8). Notably, the HSCs that were barcoded with LARRY and used for transplantation were obtained from replicate 2 (old mouse) of experiment M.7 (donor mouse). We then performed EPI-Clone on the combined Seurat object of the transplanted mouse with its donor using the static CpGs identified in experiment M.1 without further adjustments of the parameters. Moreover, and to estimate the false-positive rate of this approach, we performed the same analysis using replicate 1 (old mouse) of experiment M.7. This mouse had no relationship with the transplanted mouse and we would not expect clonal clusters to have cells from both samples to appear from a joint analysis.

Data processing followed the methods described for mice. For sample pairs that had been multiplexed into a single Tapestri lane (B.1 and B.5, B.2 and B.4, and A.2 and A.5), vireo53 was used for donor deconvolution based on germline SNVs. SNVs were called with cellsnp-lite using a minimum allele frequency of 0.05 and a count threshold of 5. Donor assignments were validated by detecting the presence of the Y chromosome in cases when male and female donors had been multiplexed, and/or the presence of previously known donor-specific CH mutations (Supplementary Fig. 9).

For samples with previously characterized CH mutations, the mutational status of each cell was determined using a custom script written in pysam. Any cell for which more than 5% of reads covering the relevant genomic site displayed the CH mutation were classified as mutant. Cells with a low number of reads covering the site were excluded, using a read threshold that was determined as a function of total site coverage.

Additional CH mutations were identified using SComatic68 based on the assumption that T cells and B cells are depleted from CH mutations. For that purpose, the BAM files of the TBM cohort were split by cell type. Base counts per cell type were calculated using BaseCellCounter with a minimum mapping quality of 30 and a maximum depth proportional to the number of cells in each group. Beta-binomial parameters were estimated across 35,000 genomic sites to model the distribution of reference and alternate alleles. Final mutation calling was performed using BaseCellCalling, considering all identified cell groups and estimated beta-binomial parameters. Mutations of interest were then identified by comparing T cells to myeloid cells. This strategy led to the identification of CH mutations in donors A.4 and A.7. Finally we repeated the same analysis for the TBM and CD34+ cohorts and comparing cells that EPI-Clone had annotated as expanded clones to cells annotated as stemming from non-expanded clones. This enabled us to identify the CH mutation in donor B.5, and the DNMT3A(C666Y) variant in donor A.4.

Unlike in mouse data, data integration across all CpGs in the human dataset did not effectively remove interindividual differences (for example, large CH clones still clustered apart). However, a larger set of CITE-seq antibodies was included in the human cohort. We therefore identified surface-protein associated (‘dynamic') CpGs across all cells in the TBM cohort and performed data integration using three approaches: CITE-seq data alone, dynamic CpG data alone or a combination of both modalities concatenated into a single feature matrix. All three strategies produced similar results (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Notably, the inclusion of both modalities provided more consistency across donors than dynamic CpGs alone, and was less susceptible to technical variation within the donors than CITE-seq data alone. Data integration was performed using scanorama69, as it offered a higher biological resolution of cell types or cell states compared with Seurat integration. In the TBM cohort, we identified a cluster of overstained cells (positive for all antibodies) that were removed before further analyses.

The same strategy was followed as for mouse; however, several adjustments were made as described below.

EPI-Clone analyses were performed while excluding mature T cells and B cells, unless denoted otherwise.

For identification of static CpGs, we proceeded as described above for each donor from cohort A (TBM) individually. We then defined consensus static CpGs as those CpGs that were identified as ‘static' in at least five donors. Eventually, the same set of 94 consensus static CpGs was used for EPI-Clone analysis in all samples. The use of consensus static CpGs in some donors led to substantial improvements in the performance of EPI-Clone with respect to the ground-truth clonal labels (for example, CH mutations). Moreover, it eliminated the need for a static CpG identification step in future studies, as it established a reference set of static CpGs.

We used CHOIR44 with false-discovery rate adjustment for identifying expanded clones, see the section on EPI-Clone (above)

For this experiment (X.1), DNA methylation data were projected to the CD34+ reference (Fig. 4b) using scmap63. The RNA-seq reads were processed as previously described45, and data were analysed using default Seurat routines. EPI-Clone was used on the DNA methylation data with identical settings to all other human samples.

For this experiment (X.2), cell types were identified by clustering on all surface antigens. EPI-Clone was then applied using consensus static CpGs. Heteroplasmies of mitochondrial mutations that had previously been identified for that sample using mt-scATACseq46 were called in single cells using pysam by dividing the number of reads supporting the mutant allele by the total number of reads covering the site. Cells with fewer than ten reads on the site were excluded as potential dropout.

Plots were generated using the R packages ggplot2 (ref. 70) and ComplexHeatmap71. Boxplots are defined as follows: the middle line corresponds to the median; the lower and upper hinges correspond to first and third quartiles, respectively; the upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5× the interquartile range (or the distance between the first and third quartiles) from the hinge and the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5× the interquartile range of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called ‘outlying' points and are plotted individually. For computing lineage-specific output as shown in Fig. 3, we defined output as the fraction of all HSC/MPP1 or myeloid cells per EPI-Clone cluster compared with all HSC/MPP1 or myeloid cells per experiment. In the bubble plots of Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7, the radius of the circles scales with the square of frequency.

a. Experimental design of the mouse experiments M.1-M.8. See also Supplementary Table 1. LSK: LIN−SCA1+KIT+, LK: LIN−KIT+. b. Distribution of the CpGs covered by all 663 amplicons in our panel. From this set of amplicons, 453 WSH/DMC/IMR CpGs were selected based on a low dropout in a control experiment, see methods. c. Schematic overview of the CpG selection for scTAM-seq. Bulk DNA methylation data was collected from Cabezas-Wallscheid et al.22. We identified three classes of CpGs, which we included in the final panel design shown in Fig. 1b: DMCs, IMCs, and WSH. DMCs are defined by comparisons between cell types, IMCs are regions with intermediate methylation in HSCs, and WSHs are regions with intermediate methylation in HSCs and a high degree of intra-molecule variability. The lines represent sequencing reads, where filled circles stand for methylated and unfilled circles for unmethylated CpGs, respectively.

a. UMAP of transcriptomic data from the same cell pool as for DNAm for experiment M.1. b. Confusion matrices between scRNA-seq celltypes and scTAM-seq celltypes (Fig. 1c vs. panel A). To compute the confusion matrix, a random forest classifier was trained to predict cell type from surface antigen expression data, using the scRNA-seq modality. The confusion matrix for that classifier during 10-fold cross validation is shown in the plot on the left. The same classifier was then applied to predict cell type in the scTAM-seq experiment, where the same surface antigens were measured using the same TotalSeq-B cocktail. Label transfer accuracy is shown. c. Integrated UMAP of the LARRY main experiment, replicate, and native haematopoiesis (experiments M.1-M.3) as in Fig. 1c, highlighting the LARRY barcodes and donor mouse. d. UMAP defined only on the dynamic CpGs. The plot shows all 13,885 cells from the experiment M.1 (LARRY main experiment). Indicated in colors are the cell types defined in Fig. 1c. e. Surface protein UMAP of experiment M.1 (13,885 cells) with the cell type labels obtained from the DNA methylation UMAP as shown in Fig. 1c. Protein data was normalized using SCTransform64 prior to generating a low-dimensional representation with PCA and UMAP. f. Expression of selected surface proteins in the protein UMAP. g. Bar chart depicting the percentage of static and dynamic CpGs within early/late replicating domains66, respectively.

Source data

a,b,c. Clonal UMAP based on static CpGs as in Fig. 2b, computed for experiment M.2: LARRY replicate experiment. Indicated are the cell state (A) and the LARRY barcode (B). C highlights cells that were selected as part of expanded clones, based on local density in PCA space. d. Receiver-Operating Characteristics Curve characterizing the performance of the local density criterion in selecting expanded clones for the biological replicate. e. Overlap between clones defined using EPI-clone and ground truth labels for the biological replicate. The remark ‘small clones' indicates all LARRY clones with a relative size less than 0.25%. f. Same UMAP as in Fig. 2b highlighting the LARRY donor labeled by two unique fluorophore sequences. For experiment M.1, two donor mice were sacrificed and HSCs were labeled with LARRY constructs containing a GFP label in one case, and LARRY constructs containing a Sapphire label in the other case. Subsequently, labeled cells from each donor were transplanted into two recipient mice each. Accordingly, the data set contains cells from four mice that contain two sets of clones, labeled with GFP and Sapphire, respectively, see also methods. g. Comparison between the performance of the density-based clustering of EPI-Clone with the performance of CHOIR44, a parameter-free clustering method. Precision and recall were calculated for the identification of cells from expanded (>0.25%) clones. ARI: Adjusted rand index. The results are shown for experiment M.1: LARRY main experiment.

HSCs from an old donor mouse (100 weeks) were either LARRY-barcoded and transplanted into a recipient mouse or directly used for processing with scTAM-seq/EPI-clone. In the negative control, we performed EPI-clone analysis on a set of unrelated HSCs from an old mouse (100 weeks) and the transplanted mouse. b.

This would indicate that a progenitor cell of this HSC gave rise to this clone. If a HSC successfully engrafts, it should keep its clonal DNA methylation pattern (i.e., EPI-clone identity) and pass it to all of its progeny. Since all blood progeny in the transplantation setting comes from the transplanted HSCs, the donor HSC giving rise to the blood cells should also be part of the same EPI-clone cluster. We observe that this is the case for the transplantation experiment, but not for clustering together the transplanted mouse with an unrelated, aged mouse (negative control). f.

Metrics details

The earliest record of tooth antecedents and the tissue dentine1,2, an early-vertebrate novelty, has been controversially represented by fragmentary Cambrian fossils identified as Anatolepis heintzi3,4,5. Anatolepis exoskeletons have the characteristic tubules of dentine that prompted their interpretation as the first precursors of teeth3, known as odontodes. Debates over whether Anatolepis is a legitimate vertebrate6,7,8 have arisen because of limitations in imaging and the lack of comparative exoskeletal tissues. Here, to resolve this controversy and understand the origin of dental tissues, we synchrotron-scanned diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons. We find that the tubules of Anatolepis have been misidentified as dentine tubules and instead represent aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures9,10. Synchrotron scanning reveals that deep ultrastructural similarities between odontodes and sensory structures also extend to definitive vertebrate tissues. External odontodes of the Ordovician vertebrate Eriptychius11,12,13 feature large dentine tubules1 that are morphologically convergent with invertebrate sensilla. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts retain extensive innervation suggestive of a sensory function akin to teeth14,15,16. These patterns of convergence and innervation reveal that dentine evolved as a sensory tissue in the exoskeleton of early vertebrates, a function retained in modern vertebrate teeth16. Middle-Ordovician fossils now represent the oldest known evidence for vertebrate dental tissues.

The origin of vertebrate teeth has been a long-standing problem in palaeontology17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Although teeth evolved from structures in the dermal exoskeleton of jawless vertebrates known as odontodes25, their origin and function remains obscure. Odontodes are the direct evolutionary and developmental antecedents of diverse tooth-like structures, including mandibular and pharyngeal teeth, dermal scales and body denticles19,25,26,27. The odontode unit is characteristically made of dentine, a neural crest-derived vertebrate novelty2,26,28,29, which has diagnostic internal tubules made by odontoblast processes as they deposit tissue30. The presence of dentine in the exoskeleton of Palaeozoic stem-gnathostomes suggests that external odontodes were secondarily recruited into the oral epithelium to form teeth7,8,9. Although dentine seems to be a vertebrate apomorphy, its origins remain controversial owing to its variability, lack of a sufficient comparative dataset, and challenges identifying it in fossil forms.

Cambrian conodonts are the earliest mineralizing vertebrates31, but remain problematic owing to their uncertain phylogenetic position17,32,33,34 and the uniqueness of the mineralized tissues in their pharyngeal elements. Critically, conodont elements lack true dentine17,34. The earliest putative occurrence of dentine and odontodes can be traced to fragmentary phosphatic fossils from late-Cambrian and Early-Ordovician deposits known as Anatolepis heintzi3,4,5. Anatolepis was first described as the earliest agnathan fish4, but its vertebrate affinity was challenged and instead suggested to correspond to an arthropod exoskeleton on the basis of morphological and histological grounds6,7,8. Researchers then revealed histological details of odontode-specific tissues in Anatolepis, such as tubular dentine, a pulp cavity and lamellar basal tissue, which reasserted its position as the first fish3. The conclusion that Anatolepis represents the earliest mineralizing stem-gnathostome has profound bearing on the initial evolution of vertebrate mineralization, and particularly on the evolution of teeth. If Anatolepis embodies the earliest odontodes this would mean dentine and acellular bone were the first vertebrate tissues and enameloid and enamel evolved at a later stage3,35,36.

The ambiguity of the first vertebrate dental tissues, combined with the lack of comparative data from diverse taxa, restricts our ability to differentiate between several hypotheses on odontode origins including: protection—the dermal skeleton including odontodes evolved as a means against abrasion and predation25,37,38; locomotion—increased mineralization in the dermal skeleton acted to stiffen the body in the absence of the mineralized axial skeleton25,39; mineral storage—the mineralized skeleton evolved for calcium or phosphate storage25,40; and sensory—the dermal skeleton evolved as part of, or as a support for, sensory systems16,25.

In this study we use high-resolution synchrotron computed microtomography to analyse a diverse representation of extant and extinct vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons to analyse the origin and distribution of dentine in Cambrian and Ordovician taxa. Together with tissue clearing and immunofluorescence analyses of the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts, our findings illuminate the deep evolutionary origins of dentine and the likely function of the earliest odontodes.

To test the vertebrate affinity of Anatolepis, we first deployed high-resolution synchrotron tomography on late-Cambrian fossil fragments. Vertical and horizontal canals infiltrate the mineralized tissue (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1) and are connected to teardrop-shaped cavities within an otherwise homogeneous lamellar basal layer (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). The tubercles connect to a central cavity that extends to the ventral surface and dorsally attenuates into multiple large-calibre tubules (Fig. 1h). These features were previously interpreted as a pulp cavity and dentine tubules, respectively, in scanning electron micrographs3. Although Anatolepis' tubules were difficult to segment because of partial collapse due to acid preparation, tubules can be seen to have a distinct flared arrow-shaped end in the virtual transverse section (Fig. 1b). Tubules are mostly restricted to the centre with a few peripheral tubules that surround the edges of the tubercle (Fig. 1d). Notably, the peripheral tubules had been observed previously in scanning electron micrographs3 but interpreted as the natural odontode edge. Externally, Anatolepis fragments are marked by rounded tubercles that are interspersed and non-overlapping (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). Anatolepis' tubercles vary subtly in morphology and are situated within the thin basal tissue; the tubercles also extend above the basal tissue that is marked externally by several pore openings (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). The ventral side is covered with dimples that correspond to the location of the tubercles on the opposing side (Fig. 1b). We used this distinct internal and external morphology to match our samples with previously described specimens of Anatolepis3,5.

High-resolution phase-contrast synchrotron scans of coeval aglaspidid arthropod cuticles—extracted from complete specimens—were compared to Anatolepis. Similarly to vertebrate skeletons, the exoskeleton of aglaspidids is also phosphatic41,42,43. Aglaspidid cuticles have a homogeneous lamellar structure that is interrupted by vertical pore canals like those described in Anatolepis3 (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 1–3). Some of these pore canals flare internally into teardrop-shaped cuticular organs, which vary in size through the specimen and are similar to the Anatolepis specimens (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Figs. 1e,f and 2h). In Aglaspis? franconensis, we resolve horizontal canals in addition to the vertical canals and teardrop-shaped cuticular organs. However, this feature was not seen in all scanned aglaspidid cuticle samples and is notably absent from thicker cuticular regions such as portions of the tail spine (Extended Data Fig. 3a,d). Virtual sections indicate partially infilled central cavities from which tubules emanate similar to the putative ‘pulp cavities' in Anatolepis. The central tubules flare dorsally with a distinctive arrow-shaped cavity, as seen in Anatolepis, and are capped by a mineralized cone that sits within a pore (Fig. 2g). Each central tubule is surrounded by a hypermineralized layer that is then surrounded by a hollow cavity, in a tube-in-tube formation that is not seen in vertebrate dentine (Fig. 2e,f). The tubules circumferentially diffuse from the central cavity, and the hollow cavities merge and form a honeycomb structure that is hollow (Fig. 2c,e). Additionally, there is a set of tubules that are peripheral to the central tubules; these are simpler in morphology, lacking both the flared end and mineralized coating (Figs. 1h and 2e). Externally, aglaspidid cuticles have diverse tubercles that vary in size and morphology but are generally rounded, with a corresponding dimple on the underside, the same characters that define Anatolepis (Fig. 1a,e). The external morphology, scans and subsequent segmentation of several aglaspidid cuticle fragments revealed microanatomy with all of the hallmarks of Anatolepis, in having a lamellar basal tissue perforated by vertical and horizontal canals, a central cavity, teardrop-shaped cuticular organs and characteristic arrow-shaped tubules. We conclude that Anatolepis is not a vertebrate but is most parsimoniously identified as an aglaspidid arthropod. As this taxon was the only putative stem-gnathostome with dentine from the Cambrian, this identification pushes the earliest definitive occurrence of the clade 40 million years into the Middle Ordovician6.

Scale bars, 100 μm.

To interrogate whether the histological similarities that led to the misidentification of Anatolepis reflect deeper similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate exoskeletons, we scanned extant invertebrate cuticle and vertebrate mineralized tissues of 35 extant and extinct genera (Extended Data Table 1). We found that the histology of aglaspidid and Anatolepis cuticles did not conform to any dental or osteological tissues seen in the sampled vertebrates but instead was most similar to those of sampled modern arthropod tissues. Specifically, the gnathobases of Limulus polyphemus (Atlantic horseshoe crab; Extended Data Fig. 4), the chelicerae of Hadrurus arizonensis (giant hairy scorpion; Extended Data Fig. 4), the dactyl sensilla of Planes mitutus (Columbus crab; Extended Data Fig. 4) and the dactyl sensilla of Petrolisthe galathinus (porcelain crab) have distinct similarities to aglaspidid and Anatolepis cuticles (Fig. 2). Owing to the size of the sensilla of the porcelain crab, this specimen resulted in the highest-resolution scan and the best comparison to aglaspidid internal anatomy. Porcelain crab sensilla have the distinctive tube-in-tube morphology of their tubules that emanate from a central cavity and radiate dorsolaterally, terminating in setae (Fig. 2e,f). Overall, the histological microanatomy of the porcelain crab sensilla is most like that of aglaspidid and Anatolepis tubercles, with the main difference being a laterally versus circumferentially radiating arrangement of tubules, respectively. The claws and much of the body are covered with sensilla, which are rounded tubercules with seta stemming from one side. Each mineralized seta corresponds to a tube-in-tube structure internally and coalesces past the exocuticle (Fig. 2). In the porcelain crab, the tubercle with setae probably represents a tricoid sensillum9,10, which is an innervated mechanosensitive receptor sensitive to deflection10. The strong similarity between cuticular structures of aglaspidids (including the fragments ascribed to Anatolepis) and the sensilla of extant invertebrates suggests that they had a sensory function.

We next examined definitive samples of Middle-Ordovician vertebrate dentine and odontodes to compare them to these invertebrate structures. The microanatomy of the Middle-Ordovician vertebrates is reminiscent of, but distinct from, the invertebrate cuticular tissues described above. Vertebrates from the Middle Ordovician remain largely enigmatic owing to the paucity of specimens. The two most studied taxa are the co-occurring stem-gnathostomes Eriptychius and Astraspis, which are almost exclusively represented by their odontodes, with rare articulated material confirming stem-gnathostome affinity1,11,13,44,45. Eriptychius odontodes have a distinct elongate morphology, are made up entirely of dentine and lack a capping enameloid tissue (Fig. 3a,b). Remarkably similar to aglaspidids, Eriptychius odontodes have large dentine tubules stemming from a pulp cavity that repeatedly branch and attenuate to the surface as pores as seen also in another Ordovician vertebrate from the Harding sandstone46,47. This convergent exposure of tubules to the surface in aglaspidids and Eriptychius is suggestive of a sensory function, as is the fact that dentine exposure is the most common cause of painful tooth sensitivity in modern taxa2. Additionally, Eriptychius odontodes maintain an open pulp cavity that is continuous with the vascular network (Fig. 3c). This is a critical feature when considering the role of vasculature and nerves in the development and maintenance of the pulp cavity, and sensory function48.

Scale bars, 100 μm.

To explore the extent to which the ancestral sensory function of odontodes persists in extant forms, we tested for innervation in the external odontodes from a diverse range of extant fishes. Dental innervation studies are typically based on oral teeth48,49,50 rather than external odontodes, limiting our inferences on the original function of these structures. Given that external odontodes are homologous to teeth, innervation probably also has a crucial role in the development and function of odontodes. We tested this hypothesis through tissue clearing and immunofluorescence analysis on tail odontodes from late developmental stages and juvenile catsharks (Scyliorhinus retifer; Fig. 4) and little skates (Leucoraja erinacea; Extended Data Fig. 5), and the pectoral fin odontodes of juvenile bristlenose catfish (Ancistrus sp.; Fig. 4). Three-dimensional segmentation of confocal stacks shows innervation associated with odontodes to be present in all taxa sampled, with nerves surrounding the base of odontodes in chondrichthyans and invading the pulp cavity in the pectoral fin in the catfish (Fig. 4). These findings support the hypothesis that the innervation associated with the dentine of odontodes is an ancestral trait among extant gnathostomes.

Anatolepis' putative vertebrate affinities hinged on two main arguments, namely the absence of a complex pore canal system in arthropod cuticles, and the presence of dentine, a calcified tissue of neural crest origin unique to vertebrates. Our data show that late-Cambrian Anatolepis and aglaspidid arthropods and modern arthropods have a cuticle with a pore canal arrangement (Extended Data Fig. 1), which includes sensilla with tubules radiating from a central cavity (Figs. 1, 2 and 5 and Extended Data Figs. 1, 2, 4 and 6). Our new high-resolution synchrotron scan data demonstrate that the seemingly simple dentine tubules in the tubercles of Anatolepis are in reality complex tubules with distinct morphology that more closely conform to arthropod sensilla found in Cambrian aglaspidids and modern arthropods9,10,51. Thus, the fossil tissues of Anatolepis are not dentine and lamellar bone, as they do not conform to any known variation found in extinct or extant vertebrates, but instead correspond to an arthropod exoskeleton as expressed in both extinct and extant species52,53.

The removal of Anatolepis from vertebrates means that the presence of enamel or enameloid at the origin of odontodes can be tracked to the Middle Ordovician22,28,45. The only other putative Cambrian armoured agnathan is an unnamed taxon originating from Australia with the fragmentary material being compared to the Ordovician pteraspidomorph agnathan Porophoraspis54. However, the described histology of this Cambrian Australian material also reveals more similarities to arthropod cuticle than to any known vertebrate. The horizontal and vertical canals are similar to those we describe in aglaspidids and other arthropods, and granular middle layers with distinct polygons54 are seen in many arthropods including the porcelain crab (P. galathinus) in this study (Extended Data Fig. 6).

The odontodes of early vertebrates such as Eriptychius have clear markers of sensory capability, such as an open pulp cavity, large dentine tubules and a lack enameloid. The lack of capping enameloid in Eriptychius would have allowed dentine tubules to be exposed to surface stimuli, which in modern taxa causes extreme sensitivity14,55. Additionally, the large-calibre dentine tubules in the odontodes of Eriptychius indicate the persistent presence of odontoblast processes, which have been shown to act as sensory receptors in teeth16. The open pulp cavity of Eriptychius odontodes implies innervation, as dental studies indicate critical cross-talk between the dental mesenchyme and the development and maintenance of innervation in open pulp cavity48 (see the discussion on dental sensitivity in the Supplementary Information). By contrast, co-occurring Astraspis odontodes have a thick layer of hypermineralized enameloid, blocking the small-calibre dentine tubuli from being exposed to the surface, and the pulp cavity is gradually infilled in older odontodes, probably leading to a diminished sensory function (Fig. 4). On the basis of these observations, we reason that Eriptychius odontodes were more suited to sensory capability than those of Astraspis.

Sensory capabilities are crucial to maintaining environmental awareness in an organism covered by external protective armour, whether in vertebrates or invertebrates. This biological demand led to the remarkable convergence of early-vertebrate dermal odontodes and arthropod cuticle sensilla, which along with the lateral lines in vertebrates contribute to ‘sensory armour' (Fig. 5). Indeed, arthropod cuticles with pore canal systems are part of advanced and highly specialized sensory organs that have been documented in modern taxa10,51,52 but largely overlooked in the fossil record.

An ancestral sensory function of dentine reveals that independent vertebrate dental specializations, or autapomorphies, reflect a shared history. Notably, there are numerous reports of modern vertebrates with sensitive external odontodes. Blind catfish have specialized dermal odontodes that have a purported sensory function56,57. Several mammals, such as narwhals, have specialized dentition that serves a sensory function58,59,60. Odontoblasts themselves are widely recognized to be sensory cells14,16,55. When viewed through this evolutionary lens, the fact that teeth in the mouth are extremely sensitive is less of a mystery, and more a reflection of their evolutionary origins within the sensory armour of early vertebrates.

The original described material3,4,5 was not available or could not be located owing to collections moving from Denver to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (USNM) and other non-returned loans. The Anatolepis material in this study is from Miller's sample TC-1021, from central Texas and from near the top of the Morgan Creek Limestone Member of the Wilberns Formation61. Limestone at that stratigraphic horizon is assigned to the trilobite Idahoia Zone. The strata are from the Sunwaptan Stage of the Millardan Series, late Cambrian in age61. At the time of collection, a 2–3-kg limestone sample was dissolved in ≈15% glacial acetic acid. The dissolved material was wet-sieved, and the insoluble residue was dried. This residue was concentrated using a dense liquid, 1,1,2,2 tetrabromoethane, with a specific gravity of about 2.87. Conodonts, fragments of Anatolepis and other phosphatic fossils were concentrated in the dense fraction. The fossils were picked from the dense fraction with a fine artist's paintbrush under ×25 magnification with a binocular microscope. Additional ‘Anatolepis' was provided by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), for external examination and scanning but no destructive sampling was permitted. The following ‘Anatolepis' specimens were examined: GSC 65600, GSC 65601 and GSC 65602. Additionally, two specimens of ‘undetermined fish A' (GSC 65598 and GSC 65599) and two specimens of ‘undetermined fish B' (GSC 65603 and GSC 65604) were examined. All GSC specimens are from the Cow Head Group, a deposition at the eastern edge of the North American continent spanning an interval extending from the middle Cambrian to the base of the Middle Ordovician, and have been previously published62. All Cow Head specimens appeared to correspond to arthropod invertebrate cuticle.

MPM 18572 is a telson fragment removed from a mostly complete articulated individual, and is featured in Figs. 1 and 2. However, we examined and scanned many more aglaspidids. All examined late-Cambrian aglaspidid material was from the Raasch63 collection, which is split between the USNM, Washington, DC and the MPM, Milwaukee, with some material collected by G. Gunderson and donated to the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum. All of the late-Cambrian aglaspidids sampled here come from the Upper Cambrian of the Saint Lawrence Formation, Sauk County, WI (see ref. 63 for other locality details).

The Aglaspis? franconensis holotype USNM PAL 98916, from the ‘Ptychaspis beds' of the Tunnel City Group at Hudson, Saint Croix County, WI41 (see ref. 63 for other locality details), was sampled. Permission for destructive sampling of the Aglaspis? franconensis USNM PAL 98916 holotype was obtained from the USNM, granted by C. Labanderia, to sample a small fragment of the exoskeleton for comparative purposes. The fragment was then mounted with reversible glue on a plastic toothpick and labelled for synchrotron scanning.

FMNH PF 17898 is a fragment of dermal bone with several odontodes ankylosed. This was picked from loose dissolved material, and then mounted on a plastic toothpick with reversible glue for scanning. The stellate and round morphology identifies the fragment as Astraspis sp.11,44,64. This specimen originates from the Middle-Ordovician Harding Sandstone of Wyoming11,12.

FMNH PF 17901 is a fragment of dermal bone with several elongate odontodes ankylosed. This was picked from loose dissolved material, and then mounted on a plastic toothpick with reversible glue for scanning. The elongate odontode morphology and lack of dentine identify the fragment as Eryptychius sp.11,65. This specimen originates from the Middle-Ordovician Harding Sandstone of Wyoming11,12.

Samples of Polites sp. and shed exoskeletons of Petrolisthes galathinus (porcelain crab) were donated by C. Ferret, from his own collection. Limulus  polyphemus (Atlantic horseshoe crab), Callinectes sapidus (Atlantic blue crab), Planorbarius corneus (ramshorn snail), Eupatorus gracilicornis (five-horned rhinoceros beetle) and Megabalanus tintinnabulum (giant purple barnacle) were purchased online as pinned or desiccated specimens. All other extant invertebrate cuticles came from the FMNH ethanol collections and were not from animals killed for this project (see Extended Data Table 1).

Suckermouth armoured catfish (Ancistrus sp.) were purchased from a local aquarium store (NationWideAquaticsUSA) and were bred in aquarium tanks following a slightly modified version of the protocol described in ref. 66. In this study, we used the albino and ‘lemon' morphs for their reduced melanin; however, these lines have potentially been hybridized in the hobby, and therefore an exact species is uncertain. Water was replaced once a week with dechlorinated water prepared from tap water using chlorine remover treatment (API, tap water conditioner). Water changes with cold water were increased when breeding behaviour was observed. The water was maintained at 27 °C and pH 6.5–7. The temperature was reduced by up to 3 °C by unplugging the heater and doing cold water changes to simulate the rainy season until eggs were laid. Each tank contained one male and two to three female fish, allowing natural breeding. Ceramic D-shaped caves were placed in the tanks to allow for the males to establish territories and the females to lay eggs in them. Once eggs were laid, they were removed from the cave and placed in a jar with a bubbler. Juveniles and adult fish were fed boiled vegetables and algae wafers. Guidelines for animal rearing were approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the University of Chicago who approved the care and breeding of Ancistrus sp. (bristlenose catfish) (IACUC number 72734). All of the procedures were performed at the University of Chicago.

The hatchling Leucoraja erinacea (little skate) and hatchling Scyliorhinus retifer (catsharks) were obtained from the Marine Resources Center, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA, USA. All animals were euthanized using 0.5% tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222, Syndel) until the cessation of heartbeat and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Acros Organics, item number EW-88353-82) overnight before transferring them to 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Fisher Bioreagents).

Synchrotron micro-computed tomography was performed at beamline 13-BM-D at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The white X-ray beam from the Advanced Photon Source bending magnet was reflected from a Pt-coated mirror at a 3 mrad incidence angle, producing an energy spectrum centred at about 25 keV with approximately 10 keV bandwidth. A total of 3,600 projection views were acquired over 180° using a Point Grey Grasshopper 3 camera, with 1,920 (horizontal) × 1,200 (vertical) pixels, and a LuAG scintillator. The sample-to-scintillator distance was approximately 45 mm. Depending on the sample, the camera was equipped with either a 10× or 5× Mitutoyo long-working-distance objective lens. For both objectives, a 175-mm tube was used, resulting in 0.56-μm pixels in object space for the 10× lens and 1.09-μm pixels in object space for the 5× lens. The exposure time was 0.014 s per view for the 10× lens and 0.025 s per view for the 5× lens. Images were reconstructed using the GSECARS tomography processing software (https://cars-uchicago.github.io/IDL_Tomography/)67, which dark-current-corrects and white-field-normalizes the acquired data before performing gridding-based image reconstruction. The resulting image voxel sizes are 0.56 × 0.56 × 0.56 μm for the 10× configuration and 1.09 × 1.09 × 1.09 μm for the 5× configuration. The experiment was run at GSECARS; proposal GUP: 82458; proposal title: Characterizing the origin and development of the earliest mineralizing tissues in vertebrates using synchrotron micro-computed tomography; experiment dates: 21 March 2023 and 2 December 2022.

Laboratory micro-computed tomography was performed on a Phoenix v|tome|x S 240 from GE (PaleoCT facility, RRID: SCR024763, University of Chicago) using the 180-kV nano-focus tube. The scanning parameters for S. retifer (stage 38 catshark) were 70-kV tube voltage and 400-µA tube current, with a timing of 100 ms, 2,000 projections, 3-frame averaging and a 0.1 Cu filter applied; the voxel size was 10.256 µm. For L. erinacea (stage 33 little skate), the parameters were 100 kV and 135 µA, with a timing of 150 ms, 3-frame averaging, resulting in a voxel size of 26.181. For the Ancistrus sp. (bristlenose catfish), the parameters were 60 kV and 269 µA tube current, with a timing of 100 ms, 2,000 projections and 3-frame averaging; the voxel size was 35.062. Segmentation, reconstruction and visualization were performed on Amira 3D 2021.1 (Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum Berlin, 1995–2001 and FEI SAS, a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1999–2021).

Fertilized eggs of S. retifer and L. erinacea were obtained from the Marine Biological Laboratory facilities (https://www.mbl.edu/research/research-organisms). Embryos of S. retifer (stage 38, following ref. 68) and L. erinacea (stages 31 and 32 (n = 4), following ref. 69, in addition to 2-week-old hatchlings (n = 6)) were mechanically extracted and placed in 0.5% tricaine diluted in 1% PBS for 30 min. Embryos were then fixed in freshly made 4% PFA in PBS for 4 days on a rocker at 4 °C. The samples were then dehydrated in 25%, 50%, 75% and then 100% methanol and stored at −20 °C.

To acquire whole-odontode images of immunofluorescently labelled tissue with a confocal microscope, samples were optically cleared using modified versions of previously established techniques70,71,72,73.

Juvenile bristlenose catfish (Ancistrus sp.) were first rehydrated (100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% methanol in 1× PBS). The rehydrated samples were then delipidated in a solution of 10 w/v% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific, BP151) and 10 w/v% N-butyldiethanolamine (Alfa Aesar, L09953.22) dissolved in distilled water (CUBIC-L)70 for 5 days, gently shaking at 37 °C, with the CUBIC-L solution changed daily. The samples were then washed in 1× PBS six times for 2 h each, with one wash left overnight. Samples were then blocked overnight at 4 °C while shaking in blocking buffer (5 v/v% goat serum (Gibco, 16210-072, lot 2285796), 1 w/v% bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific, BP9704, lot 222347) and 0.3 v/v% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS) before immunostaining. The next day, samples were incubated in primary antibodies to neurofilament-associated antigens (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone 3A10, lot 5/7/20; 1:100 in blocking buffer) for 7 days at 4 °C while shaking. Samples were then washed in blocking buffer three times for 2 h each, with one wash left overnight. Samples were then stained with secondary antibodies (Cy3 donkey anti-mouse IgG, Jackson Laboratories, 715-165-150, lot 163873; 1:300) and counterstained with DAPI (Biotium, 40009, lot 15D1117; 1:1,000) in blocking buffer for 7 days at 4 °C while shaking. Samples were then washed in 1 × PBS three times for 2 h each and postfixed overnight in 1 w/v% PFA in 1× PBS overnight at 4 °C while shaking. Samples were washed with 1 × PBS for 2 h before preparing them for confocal microscopy.

We found that embryonic S. retifer and L. erinacea tissues were more difficult to image, probably owing to larger tissue sizes and increased extracellular matrix protein concentration; thus, additional steps were required to optically clear the tissue samples. Samples were first bleached to reduce autofluorescence and pigmentation into a solution of methanol, dimethylsulfoxide and 30% hydrogen peroxide (4:1:1) while exposed under constant light overnight. After this, samples were rehydrated (100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% methanol in PBS 1%). The rehydrated samples were then delipidated in CUBIC-L as described above. To increase antibody penetration and optical transparency, samples were enzymatically digested with collagenase P. Samples were first immersed in reaction buffer for 2 h at 37 °C while shaking, and then digested in a solution of 1 mg ml−1 collagenase P in carbonate buffer (50 mM sodium carbonate (Sigma, 223530), 50 mM sodium bicarbonate (Sigma, 26014), 150 mM sodium chloride (Sigma, S3014) and 25 μM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Sigma, E5134), pH 10) for 24 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Samples were washed in carbonate buffer with 5 mM EDTA three times for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Samples were incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 37 °C while shaking before incubating in primary antibodies to neurofilament (1:40 3A10 in blocking buffer) for 4 days at 37 °C while shaking. Embryos were washed six times (3 h each) in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS before staining with secondary antibodies (Biotium CF633 goat anti-mouse IgG, 20121, lot 23C1003; 1:300) and counterstained with DAPI (1:100) in blocking buffer for 4 days at 37 °C while shaking. Samples were then washed in 1 × PBS three times for 2 h each and postfixed overnight in 1 w/v% PFA in 1 × PBS overnight at 4 °C while shaking. Samples were washed with 1 × PBS for 2 h before preparing them for confocal microscopy.

Before imaging, the samples were placed in a refractive-index matching solution (45 w/v% antipyrine (Thermo Scientific, A11089.22), 30 w/v% nicotinamide (Thermo Scientific, A128271000) and 0.5 v/v% N-butyldiethanolamine in distilled water (CUBIC-R70)) for 1–3 days (depending on the size of the embryonic sample), to render the tissues optically transparent for three-dimensional imaging. Samples were mounted on a 35-mm glass-bottom microscopy dish suspended in a solution of 0.5% low-melting-point agarose (Thermo Scientific, R0801) in CUBIC-R to avoid movement of the sample during the imaging process. The mounted samples were then covered with a glass coverslip. Samples were imaged with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 900) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 25×/0.8 glycerol immersion objective and using a pinhole of 1 AU. Three-dimensional, whole-tissue volumes were acquired using a combination of Z-stacks and image tiling. Images were processed with Zen (Zeiss) and FIJI74, and VGStudio Max 3.3 was used for three-dimensional visualization of the scans.

Miranda cannot remember a time in her life when she did not have insomnia. The 23 year old, who asked for her last name to be withheld, started struggling with sleep when she was a child. As she's grown older, it's only become worse. She takes “a myriad of medications” each night, she says, but usually still cannot fall asleep until the early hours of the morning. “I can't get up and be functional until halfway through the day,” she says. She had to drop out of university because she couldn't attend classes, and she can't hold down a job. Her insomnia exacerbates other medical conditions as well, including migraines and the pain condition fibromyalgia. “It's hugely debilitating,” she says. “It affects everything.”

In the United States, about 12% of adults have been diagnosed with chronic insomnia — when a person struggles to sleep for more than three nights each week for at least three months, and experiences daytime distress as a result. Research suggests that the worldwide figure is 10–30%. It also often co-occurs with and creates a vicious cycle with other conditions, including chronic pain, depression and anxiety.

Fortunately for Miranda and millions of others with chronic insomnia, new treatments are arriving. The emergence of a class of pharmaceuticals that induces sleep through a different brain pathway from existing drugs is a welcome development, and molecules in cannabis and specialized medical devices to promote sleep are also showing potential as sleep aids. Soon, those struggling with sleep could have a range of new options available to help.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is usually the recommended first treatment. This specialized talking therapy focuses on establishing healthy sleep behaviours and addressing thoughts that can interfere with sleep. But CBT-I is not covered by all health-care insurance plans in the United States. In the United Kingdom and parts of Europe, public health-care systems usually provide it, but waiting times can be long. This is because, around the world, there is a limited availability of therapists, says Andrew Krystal, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco. “We keep hiring new people, but almost immediately their schedules are completely filled and the wait list is a year.”

CBT-I also doesn't work for everyone. Miranda has tried it and has received conventional talking therapy for over a decade, with limited success. “It only helps so much,” she says.

Pharmacological interventions are the next line of defence, Krystal says. Benzodiazepines and a class of medicines called Z-drugs, which include zolpidem (Ambien), are among the most prescribed insomnia medications. These sedative hypnotics enhance the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA, thereby dampening brain activity. They also reduce anxiety. But they can create a hangover effect and increase the risk of falls in older people. These drugs also have the potential for misuse and can cause dependence. Some studies have even found an association between long-term use of Z-drugs and benzodiazepines and an increased risk of death.

Miranda tried Ambien, but says that she quickly became chemically dependent. She eventually weaned herself off it and switched to benzodiazepines, but she began developing a tolerance to them, too — she once wound up in hospital with withdrawal symptoms after she tried to cut back on her dosage. “They're horrible drugs to be on,” she says. But she cannot fall asleep without them. Each night, she now takes two benzodiazepines, as well as gabapentin, an anticonvulsant medication that is sometimes given off-label for insomnia.

Physicians frequently provide other off-label prescriptions for insomnia, including trazodone, which is approved for depression. Over-the-counter products such as antihistamines are also used for sleeplessness. None are ideal, however, because they have not been evaluated as sleep aids, says Emmanuel Mignot, a sleep-medicine researcher at Stanford University in California.

Miranda has experience with many of these products. When she first developed chronic insomnia as a child, her paediatrician recommended melatonin, which is available without a prescription in the United States. It helped her fall asleep, but it did not keep her asleep. During her teenage years, different neurologists prescribed off-label antidepressants and other mood medications, including trazodone and mirtazapine. But they came with what she calls “torturous” side effects: she felt constantly anxious and exhausted during the day, and her memory became “incredibly foggy”.

Mignot was studying narcolepsy, a chronic disorder that affects sleep–wake cycles and causes people to fall asleep suddenly, when he inadvertently helped to pave the way towards the latest means of treating insomnia. He discovered that dogs with narcolepsy have a genetic mutation that affects one of two receptors used by the neurotransmitter orexin, the primary role of which was initially thought to be the regulation of appetite. Mignot then found that people with narcolepsy lack orexin, confirming the chemical's main job: promoting wakefulness. If drugs could be developed to prevent orexin from binding to its receptors, Mignot thought, then people with insomnia would become “narcoleptic for one night”.

In 2007, researchers at the pharmaceutical firm Actelion (part of which is now Idorsia Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland) showed that blocking orexin's two receptors induced sleep in rats, dogs and people. In 2014, the biopharmaceutical company Merck, received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the first dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) drug, suvorexant (Belsomra). In 2019, another DORA drug — lemborexant (Dayvigo) — was approved, followed, in 2022, by daridorexant (Quviviq).

Compared with benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, which inhibit activity all over the brain, DORA drugs affect only the neurons activated by orexins (see ‘Blocking wakefulness'). “The beauty of it is it does nothing but block the stimulation of wakefulness,” says neurologist Joe Herring, who heads neuroscience clinical research at Merck in Rahway, New Jersey. “It's a physiologically better way to promote sleep.”

Daridorexant is the only DORA drug for which data are available about daytime functioning, says Antonio Olivieri, chief medical officer at Idorsia, which produces daridorexant. In clinical trials, Idorsia showed that, compared with those given a placebo, people who received daridorexant experienced significant improvements in daytime insomnia symptoms the following day. Data reported in the approvals database of the FDA also indicate that daridorexant has the lowest fatigue and drowsiness scores of the three DORA drugs, possibly because it leaves the body the quickest.

So far, there have been no one-to-one comparisons of DORA drugs. “Ideally, you'd have direct evidence of how those drugs compare to each other,” says Daniel Buysse, a sleep scientist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania. “But we rarely have such evidence, so instead, we have to rely on statistical techniques that allow you to make indirect comparisons.” It's also difficult to say definitively how DORA drugs compare with older treatments for insomnia, but Buysse says that drug registration trials suggest that DORA drugs have fewer adverse cognitive or hangover effects compared with benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, as well as less potential for dependence and misuse. The European Insomnia Guideline 2023 placed daridorexant as the next recommended insomnia treatment after CBT-I.

The main drawback to DORA drugs, Buysse says, is not medical but financial: their high cost keeps them out of reach of many people who could benefit from them. “There are many patients I would like to prescribe these drugs for, but I know in order for them to get one of these medications we'll have to go through trials of several other drugs before the request will be considered,” Buysse says. DORA drugs are also available only in a few countries, so far.

Given her long history of insomnia, Miranda was given a prescription for suvorexant. Her psychiatrist recommended the drug to her about a year ago. “I was really sceptical that an anti-wakefulness drug would be any different to a pro-sleep drug,” she says. But she quickly felt the difference, and has now come to see the drug as “a saviour”. Without the drug, she says, “I'd probably be on a much higher benzodiazepine dose than I am.” She hopes her suvorexant dose can continue to increase, so that some of her other medications can be reduced.

Other drugs that target the orexin system are in the clinical pipeline. Seltorexant, for example, is being developed by the US pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson for people with both major depressive disorder and insomnia. Around 70% of people with depression have insomnia, so having a medication that treats both of those disorders “has the potential to fill an important gap”, says Krystal, who has consulted for Johnson & Johnson on the drug. In a phase III trial, participants who took the drug experienced meaningful improvement in both sleep and depressive symptoms, with an antidepressant effect that seemed to be independent of the participants getting better sleep. Seltorexant might have an antidepressant effect because it is designed to block only one of the two types of orexin receptor, Krystal adds, whereas other DORA drugs block both receptor types.

Investigations of already-approved DORA drugs are also expanding into other populations. Merck has sponsored investigator-led studies of suvorexant in people with insomnia as well as depression or substance-use disorders, and Idorsia is sponsoring studies of daridorexant's safety and efficacy in sub-groups of people who have insomnia and other conditions.

In 2020, suvorexant became the first medication to be approved for treating sleep disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease. Insomnia is often a precursor to and co-morbid with Alzheimer's, and the disease seems to manifest differently in people with the condition. In one study comparing older people with insomnia with those with both insomnia and Alzheimer's, people with both conditions had a number of extra changes to their sleep patterns, including less time spent in deep sleep — sometimes called slow-wave sleep because that describes the pattern of the brain's electrical activity during these intervals. Sleep problems in people with Alzheimer's also seem to have a causal role in increasing levels of toxic substances in the brains of those individuals. Preliminary data suggest that suvorexant could also help to reduce toxic brain proteins. The results of a follow-up study testing that finding are expected in 2026.

Sleeplessness is already among the most common conditions for the medicinal use of the drug cannabis. Miranda, for example, supplements her nightly pharmaceutical regimen with a cannabis tincture that contains a few of the plant's 100-plus cannabinoids (she lives in a state where cannabis use is legal). “It's definitely a key player in my sleep-medication arsenal,” she says.

Yet, scientifically, little is known about which cannabinoids — if any — promote sleep, and what a safe and effective dose is. “Tens of millions of people around the world are probably using cannabinoids for insomnia, but we have very little good-quality evidence to support that,” says Iain McGregor, director of the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney in Australia.

McGregor is investigating cannabinol (CBN), a molecule that develops in cannabis as the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oxidizes. His group reported that CBN increased sleep in rats to a similar degree as zolpidem, but without the drug's known negative side effect of suppressing rapid-eye-movement sleep. Unpublished data of a single-night trial with 20 people with insomnia disorder show that people fell asleep 7 minutes faster after taking 300 milligrams of CBN compared with those taking a placebo; participants also reported subjective improvements in sleep and mood. Although 7 minutes “doesn't sound like a lot”, it is on a par with what benzodiazepines and Z-drugs typically accomplish, says Camilla Hoyos, a sleep researcher at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, who led the work. McGregor, Hoyos and their colleagues are aiming to follow up the work with a large, community-based trial in which people with insomnia take either CBN or a placebo for six weeks at home.

As for cannabidiol (CBD) and THC — the most well-known cannabinoids — the prospects for efficacy against insomnia are doubtful, at least for the doses used in trials so far. Several small studies have failed to find a sleep benefit from taking CBD. In one experiment, researchers observed that participants in a study who received 10 milligrams of THC and 200 milligrams of CBD actually slept for 25 minutes less compared with when they received a placebo. Several other company-sponsored trials of low-dose CBD for insomnia were not published, McGregor adds, because they found no significant improvement. “It's been one failure after the next,” he says.

The search for more effective insomnia treatments continues in other realms, as well. Some research groups are experimenting with different receptors that they hope could lead to new classes of drugs. Gabriella Gobbi, a clinical psychiatrist and research neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, for example, has homed in on one of the brain's two melatonin receptors, MT2. “We want to find an alternative mechanism without any addiction liability and with fewer side effects, especially for use in children and elderly people,” she says. A molecule that the team developed that binds to MT2 increased the time that rats spent in deep sleep by 30%. Gobbi aims to launch clinical trials in the next two to three years.

A few companies and health systems, including the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, have also created or are developing digital platforms for delivering CBT-I. These apps take users through regimens that are tailored to their symptoms. SleepioRx, for example, is a 90-day digital programme that has been evaluated in more than two dozen clinical trials and has showed efficacy as high as 76%. This includes helping people to fall asleep faster, sleep better throughout the night and feel better the next day. In August 2024, the programme, developed by Big Health in San Francisco, California, received FDA clearance. A 2024 meta-analysis of 15 studies that compare in-person and electronically delivered CBT-I concluded that the two approaches were equally effective.

Uptake among physicians has been slow so far, Krystal says. But once practitioners catch on, he adds, “I can imagine a world where you have digital care as your first stop, and if that's not successful, you see a therapist.”

Some studies suggest that insomnia can stem from a high level of underlying brain activity during sleep. This raises the question of whether reducing this activity could treat insomnia, says Ruth Benca, a psychiatrist at Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina. Companies and academic research groups are beginning to test this proposition with wearable devices that use auditory tones or mild electrical stimulation to increase slow-wave activity in the brain. Some devices are already on the market, and evidence suggests that they can increase the duration of deep sleep. Last June, for example, researchers at Elemind Technologies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, confirmed that auditory stimuli delivered in sync with specific brain-wave rhythms generated in a headband allowed people who usually struggle for more than 30 minutes to fall asleep to shave an average of 10.5 minutes off that time.

In the coming years, according to Benca, researchers hope to learn enough about insomnia's causes and treatments to be able to recommend personalized therapies based on an individual's specific demographics, genetics and co-morbidities. These are the frontiers people are working at, she says.

Even after a lifetime of struggling to find safe and effective help, Miranda says that she still holds out hope that better treatments for insomnia are on the horizon. “I can't be on these medications forever,” she says. “They're going to take years off my life.”

Reliable strategies to capture patients at risk of progression from precursor stages of multiple myeloma (MM) to overt disease are still missing. We assembled a comprehensive collection of MM genomic data comprising 1,030 patients (218 with precursor conditions) that we used to identify recurrent coding and non-coding candidate drivers as well as significant hotspots of structural variation. We used those drivers to define and validate a simple ‘MM-like' score, which we could use to place patients' tumors on a gradual axis of progression toward active disease. Our MM precursor genomic map provides insights into the time of initiation and cell-of-origin of the disease, order of acquisition of genomic alterations and mutational processes found across the stages of transformation. Taken together, we highlight here the potential of genome sequencing to better inform risk assessment and monitoring of MM precursor conditions.

Precursor stages of MM, including monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), progress to MM at rates of 1% to 10% per year1,2,3,4,5,6. Currently, patients with MGUS and SMM are monitored using variables that reflect tumor burden, such as levels of M-spike and free light chains, as well as plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow4,5. Stratification models use these biomarkers to prognosticate patients and determine their risk category; however, different models can yield discordant results6,7. Furthermore, somatic alterations that have a role in the disease are not included in commonly used stratification systems8,9. Profiling of genetic biomarkers through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers a robust solution for precision oncology with informed risk assessment, stratification and prediction of progression8,9,10, addressing a major unmet clinical need. This can improve decision-making on observation versus treatment to prevent the irreversible organ damage that manifests in MM7,11.

Genomic studies of tumor plasma cells in patients with MGUS and SMM have shown genetic heterogeneity, similar to symptomatic MM in some cases8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, and prognostic value of mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (including KRAS), DNA repair genes and MYC8,9. Here we created a map of the genome of MM and its precursors using mostly WGS data from >1,000 patients (n = 1,030), including 218 MGUS and SMM (MGUS/SMM; n = 138 WGS data from participants of the Precursor Crowd study (PCROWD)). This map enabled the discovery of coding and non-coding drivers, identifying biomarkers of progression, modeling and timing of MGUS/SMM to MM transformation. These results highlight the clinical potential of genome profiling for monitoring and intercepting progression in molecularly determined high-risk patients.

To characterize the somatic mutation landscape and drivers in precursor conditions of MM, we generated and analyzed deep WGS data on bone marrow samples from patients with MGUS (n = 19), SMM (n = 119) and MM (n = 20) and their patient-matched germline controls (median coverage: 50× in tumor samples, 35× in normal samples; Supplementary Table 1). Given that bone marrow samples contain a small fraction of MGUS/SMM cells (median, 15%), we first enriched these cells and used a low-input DNA protocol19 to reliably extract and sequence tumor DNA (median purity, 81%; Methods). This enabled us to evenly characterize the 119 SMM patients from the three currently used risk groups (International Myeloma Working Group 2/20/20 criteria: 44 low-risk, 29 intermediate-risk and 46 high-risk patients with SMM).

To increase cohort size and power for driver discovery, we combined our precursor-enriched dataset with genomic data from 872 additional individuals with MGUS (n = 18), SMM (n = 62) and MM (n = 792), comprising 810 genomes and 853 exome profiles, yielding a map of somatic mutations of MM and its precursors from 1,030 individuals (Supplementary Table 1). For each tumor, we identified somatic point mutations (single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels)), copy-number alterations and structural variants (SVs; non-coding mutations and SVs were available for 969 samples with WGS data). Our analysis is powered to discover candidate drivers mutated in 2% of patients20 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Indeed, analysis of random samples of the cohort confirmed that the number of drivers found in ≥2% of patients increases and plateaus at around 1,000 patients (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c).

First, we set out to discover candidate drivers of MM and precursor conditions. We identified 62 genes with significantly recurrent point mutations (MutSig2CV, q < 0.1), including (1) 39 already known MM drivers, such as KRAS, NRAS, FAM46C, DIS3, BRAF and TP53; (2) eight new candidate drivers (IKZF3, IKBKB, HNRNPU, FIP1L1, SGPP1, SP3, EHD1 and HNRNPA2B1); and (3) 15 additional candidates mutated in <1% of patients (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2). Notably, IKZF3 (mutated in 1% of patients) is required for the generation of high-affinity long-lived plasma cells21 and is also a known driver of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)22 and diffuse large B cell lymphoma23. In individuals for whom no MM SNV driver event was found, at least one canonical initiating MM event was evident. These included either one of the known translocations, hyperdiploidy (trisomy of two or more of the odd-numbered chromosomes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19 or 21)), gain of 1q or deletion of 13q (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Next, we analyzed copy-number alterations and found 54 significant recurrently altered regions (21 chromosome arms, 18 gains and 3 losses; 33 focal events, 4 gains and 29 losses; GISTIC2.0 q < 0.1). Among these were the well-known hyperdiploidy gains, 1q, MYC, BCMA, FAM46C, CDKN2C, CYLD and FGFR3/MMSET as well as other significantly altered regions, including TERC/GPR160, EVI5, BCL6, BIRC2/3 and XBP1 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). Finally, we discovered 11 additional candidate driver structural variations, including two known canonical drivers (NSD2 and MAF; Fig. 1a; see below). When comparing the number of driver events across MM stages, we observed that precursor patients already harbor at least one MM-driver alteration (Fig. 1a). However, the number of drivers increased with MM progression. For example, point mutation drivers were rare in MGUS (median, 0; range, 0–2), increased in SMM (median, 1; range, 0–7) and further increased in MM (median, 2; range, 0–10) (Extended Data Fig. 1e).

Samples are grouped by genetic subtypes from the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) classification: MAF (translocations of the MAF family of oncogenes), MMSET (translocations of the NSD2 gene), CCND (translocations of the cyclin D family of genes), hyperdiploid (trisomies of odd-numbered chromosomes) and unclassified (other genetic subtypes). Common drivers significantly enriched in MGUS/SMM are colored in green, and those significantly enriched in MM are colored in pink in the rightmost panel.

In boxplots, the center line represents the median, the box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles and the whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range. Values exceeding whiskers appear individually as plain circles.

Next, we defined a score reflecting the gradual progression from MGUS/SMM to MM by testing whether initiating translocations and each of the 103 driver alterations occurring in >1% of patients were found at different frequencies between MGUS/SMM and MM (Supplementary Table 4). Using the WGS cases, we found 26 such events (q < 0.1). The only events enriched in MGUS/SMM were the MAF and MAFB translocations (MAF: odds ratio (OR), 3.1; confidence interval (CI), 1.6–5.8; q = 0.0026; MAFB: OR, 3.4; CI, 1.1–9.8; q = 0.04). The other 24 alterations were more common in MM and included known drivers of the disease (MYC: OR, 5.0; CI, 2.2–14; q = 5 × 10−5; NRAS: OR, 2.7; CI, 1.5–5.3; q = 0.009; KRAS: OR, 1.9; CI, 1.2–3.3; q = 0.09; Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 4). We then defined a genomic score by subtracting the number of MGUS/SMM-enriched drivers from the number of MM-enriched drivers for each tumor and named it the ‘MM-like' score. As expected, the MM-like score increased throughout disease progression (median MM-like score of 1 in MGUS, 2 in SMM and 3 in MM; Fig. 1b). Among patients with SMM only, who can be stratified into three groups with the 2/20/20 model4, we found a gradual increase of the MM-like score that matched the overall medians in MGUS, SMM and MM (median scores of 1 in low-risk, 2 in intermediate-risk and 3 in high-risk SMM groups, respectively; P = 2 × 10−5; Fig. 1c). An MM-like score above the median (score > 1) correlated with a higher chance of progression to MM in patients who were untreated for SMM with WGS data available (hazard ratio (HR), 5.3; 95% CI, 1.1–25; P = 0.03; Fig. 1d). We first validated this association between an increased MM-like score and higher rates of progression to MM using an internal dataset of 87 patients with SMM patients from a previous publication8. (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.8–6.2; P = 5 × 10−5; Fig. 1e). We then confirmed this association using an external validation dataset of 77 patients with SMM from another publication9 with deep targeted sequencing data, despite the fact that this dataset included only mutations and translocations (HR,1.8, 95% CI, 1.1–3.0; P = 0.03; Extended Data Fig. 2a). When analyzed in multivariate regression, we found that the MM-like score was independently associated with a higher chance of progression in a model stratified by cohort (HR, 2.8, 95% CI, 1.8–4.4; P = 7.6 × 10−6; Extended Data Fig. 2b). The MM-like score independently correlated with progression in the two validation cohorts8,9. In the WGS cohort, the overall multivariate model was just above significance (P = 0.06), and the MM-like score had the highest HR estimate compared to the 2/20/20 risk classification variables (Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). Overall, we show that it is possible to define a simple genomic score that can be used to assess the risk of progression to MM and can be implemented in the clinic by discovering drivers of the disease and detecting those associated with the stage of the disease.

We next assessed whether the MM-like score of serial samples from patients with SMM reflects their clinical course. To that end, we collected 47 serial tumor samples (bone marrow or circulating tumor cells) from 20 patients, taken at various time points (from diagnosis to progression) up to 54 months (Supplementary Table 5). Of these patients, 16 were originally from the PCROWD study and four were collected as an external validation cohort (patients GP1–GP4). We calculated the MM-like score for each sample and observed that the score indeed captured the dynamic spectrum of the disease (Fig. 2a). For 11 out of 13 patients who did not progress, the MM-like score was stable over time. These included three patients with a follow-up time less than the first time to progression (10 months), suggesting that these patients probably did not have sufficient time to acquire an additional driver event and expand that subclone to a detectable level. Seven patients clinically progressed to MM, out of whom five also had an MM-like score that increased at the time of progression. One patient (GP3) who progressed to MM with a stable MM-like score had an elevated baseline score (4), and the last one (GP1) remains unexplained with genomic data alone. For the two remaining patients (SCI054 and SCI116), the MM-like score increased but they did not clinically progress (during the measured intervals). Still, one showed a doubling of free light chain ratio indicative of an underlying disease progression together with a bi-allelic TP53 inactivation, which rarely happens early in the disease development24. The increases in the MM-like score were a result of different driver events, including acquiring KRAS (G13D), NRAS (G13D), deletion of 1p and gain of 1q in the progressors and hyperdiploidy and deletion of 1p in two non-progressors, respectively (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Note 5).

a, Swimmer plot showing the clinical efficacy of applying the MM-like score in a longitudinal sample setting, up to 54 months from initial biopsy. Patients characterized by either stable disease trajectory (n = 13, black symbols) or evolving genome (n = 7, red symbols) were identified, with increasing MM-like score driven by the acquisition of MM-driver mutations (KRAS, NRAS, deletion of 1p (del(1p)), hyperdiploidy (HRD)). b,c, Two examples of clinical relevance demonstrating the longitudinal impact of clinical WGS in detecting a MM-like score increase, with association with a subclonal outgrowth obtained from phylogenetic reconstruction of the disease history, and was correlated with an increase in tumor burden. The number of mutations found in each cluster is written to the right of the cluster name. MGUS monitoring over 3 years (b), with phylogenetic tree reconstruction to estimate clone driving growth and novel detection of hyperdiploidy within a bi-allelic TP53 mutant context. High-risk SMM monitoring over 2 years (c): phylogenetic analyses revealed newly acquired recurrent MM event of deletion of 1p and SP140 was identified and assigned to an emerging clone (cluster five (C5)). Concurrently, clinical M-spike levels show stable overall tumor burden. Clonal fractions from before the first WGS are kept equal to the first WGS timepoint for visual representation.

Taken together, these data show the ability of WGS data and the MM-like score to successfully capture the acquisition of MM drivers and, using clonal dynamics, identify the subclones that probably acquired and expanded the drivers.

To further delineate the time of initiation and cell-of-origin for MM precursor disease25,26,27, we estimated an upper bound for the time of the onset of the disease based on passenger mutations that accumulate in a clock-like manner (Methods). In particular, we focused on the 91 deep WGS tumors (14 MGUS, 46 SMM and 31 MM) with a clonal hyperdiploidy event assumed to be the initiating event24,28. There was a wide range of estimated initiation ages, from 1 to 92 years old (median, 35 years old). Interestingly, we found that the patient's age at tumor initiation (that is, hyperdiploidy) correlated with the stage of the disease; the more advanced stages were initiated at a younger age (MGUS, 41 years old; SMM, 38 years old; MM, 31 years old; P = 0.0035, Fig. 3a). We could also estimate the age of each tumor by subtracting the tumor-initiating age from the patient's age at the time of biopsy and confirmed that MGUS and SMM are younger tumors than MM (MGUS, 16 years old; SMM, 21 years old; MM, 33 years old; P = 0.004; Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).

a, Maximum likelihood expectation and 95% CIs obtained from binomial mixture models for patients' age at the initiation of the disease (black circles, patient age at sampling; colored circles, estimated age at the disease initiation) including MGUS (n = 14; median, 41 years old), SMM (n = 46; median, 38 years old) and MM (n = 31; median, 31 years old). b, Boxplot with point estimates and CIs for the molecular tumor age in MGUS (median, 16 years old), SMM (median, 21 years old) and MM (median, 33 years old). c, Boxplot showing that the tumor age estimated from early mutations was higher in patients with MGUS/SMM who progressed during the study versus those who remained stable (progressors: median, 30 years old; non-progressors: median, 15 years old). d, Using mutations across the genome, cell-of-origin analysis29 shows that the mutation profile of MM and MGUS/SMM origins correlates with germinal center, memory B cells and plasma cells. HSC, hematopoietic stem cell. Statistical significance was determined between each top hit and the subsequent models using a two-tailed corrected t-test on the values from the tenfold cross-validation, taking into account the interdependence of tests in a cross-validation setting. Panel created in part using BioRender.com. e, Bradley–Terry scores estimate (bootstrap mean and standard deviation of the log abilities) from the clonality league competition in MGUS/SMM (n = 218; green) and MM (n = 812; black). Green dots on the right represent events more likely to be subclonal in MGUS/SMM than in MM and, therefore, are acquired late in the evolution of the disease (that is, a higher Bradley–Terry score). Events +8q (MYC), −12p and −12q are significantly more clonal in the MM Bradley–Terry model than in the MGUS/SMM one, with an absolute difference in Bradley–Terry score of >1 (Supplementary Note 6). In boxplots, the center line represents the median, the box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles and the whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range. Values exceeding whiskers appear individually as plain circles.

Next, in patients with MGUS or SMM, we wanted to test whether the tumor's age is associated with progression to MM. Indeed, we found that progressors had significantly older tumors than patients with stable disease (median, 15-year-old tumor in stable disease versus 30-year-old in progressors; P = 0.007; Fig. 3c). Notably, the tumor's age was independently associated with progression to MM when compared with 2/20/20 risk classification (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.08–4.01; P = 0.04; Extended Data Fig. 3c). Together, these data show that WGS-based molecular clocks can be leveraged to differentiate disease severity and risk of progression and that the earliest oncogenic events of MM can occur in the first decades of life.

The local distribution of mutations is shaped by the epigenetic organization, which varies along the genome as well as across cell types. To elucidate the B cell differentiation stage at which MGUS/SMM acquired most of its mutations, we used the cell-of-origin prediction method, which leverages correlations between somatic mutation profiles and epigenetic tracks from healthy tissues29,30. We found that among healthy mature B cell types (germinal center, plasma and memory B cells), germinal center B cells were significantly more correlated with somatic mutations than early immature B cell types (naive B cells, P = 0.007; hematopoietic stem cells, P = 0.0002; corrected t-test). This suggests that most passenger mutations are acquired during the later stages of B cell differentiation (Fig. 3d). Notably, the cell-of-origin predictions were comparable across MM subgroups (all coefficients of determination >0.5) and stages (all coefficients of determination >0.6) and remained consistent when we used early mutations only; that is, ones obtained before genomic amplifications (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Of note, we could not find a significantly different correlation between germinal center B cells and plasma cells in MM and its precursors, unlike in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Overall, this suggests that most mutations in these three neoplasias with a rearranged B cell receptor are acquired during mature B cell differentiation stages and confirms that only MM also acquires mutations in the plasma cell stage.

Next, we wondered whether the order of acquisition of genetic abnormalities has a role in the progression to MM. To answer that question, we developed a Bradley–Terry model based on the clonality levels of MM copy-number drivers that we termed ‘clonality league comparison' (Methods). In this model, each MM-driver event is given a Bradley–Terry score that reflects the probability that such an event is found in smaller subclones than others. This allowed us to rank MM-driver events: those that are most often clonal have the lowest Bradley–Terry score, and events that are thought to happen late in cancer development have higher Bradley–Terry scores. Then, to test whether the order of acquisition of events differs between the MGUS/SMM and MM stages, we compared the distributions of Bradley–Terry scores between both models (that is, between the MGUS/SMM and MM Bradley–Terry models). We identified three events with higher Bradley–Terry scores in the MGUS/SMM league model than in the MM one; that is, events that are late in MGUS/SMM and earlier in MM (q < 0.1; MGUS/SMM score − MM score > 1): gain of 8q24 (MYC), deletion of 12p and deletion of 12q (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 5a–c, Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Note 6). Of those, MYC and deletion of 12p were also captured by our MM-like score. Deletion of 12q correlated with deletion of 12p in single chromosome deletions, but the event did not reach significance alone in the MM-like score (q > 0.1). No event was significantly later in MM relative to MGUS/SMM. Overall, our Bradley–Terry model further supports the role of MYC abnormalities and potentially other MM drivers to provide a proliferation advantage toward overt disease.

In addition to the sequential acquisition of genetic abnormalities, mutational processes could influence the transformation to MM. To discover and quantify mutational processes, we first used hierarchical Dirichlet processes31 to identify mutational signatures in the WGS data. Then, we associated them with known signatures from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) (Fig. 4a and Methods)32. We found 21 signatures in our dataset, of which 13 also matched COSMIC signatures and accounted for >80% of the total mutation burden: somatic hypermutation and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (SHM/AID): SBS9, SBS84, SBS85; APOBEC: SBS2, SBS13; clock-like: SBS1, SBS5/40; reactive oxygen species signature SBS18 and signatures of unknown etiology SBS8, SBS16, SBS17a and SBS17b (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Note 7). Of those, we could validate that APOBEC signatures were enriched in the MAF subgroup33, and we report a positive association between SBS8 and the cyclin D (CCND) group independent of the disease stage (Extended Data Fig. 6).

a, Proportion of mutational signatures for whole genomes (top row), restricted to clustered mutations only (within 1,000 bases of another; second row), which are typical of AID activity during SHM in the germinal center, and more specifically within immunoglobulin loci (third row; annotation from COSMIC reference v.3.3). The bottom row represents the proportion of mutational signatures for whole genomes using only early mutations in patients with hyperdiploidy; that is, mutations found at clonal levels on amplified chromosomes. SBS, single-base substitution; ROS, reactive oxygen species. b, Fraction of clonal mutations (median cancer cell fraction > 0.85) that are predicted to be caused by known mutational processes (clock-like signatures SBS5/40 and SBS1, AID/SHM signatures SBS9, SBS84 and SBS85, and APOBEC signatures SBS2 and SBS13) in all patients across the MM disease spectrum. Only deep WGS were used; samples from the CoMMpass study were excluded. Total of clonal mutations: clock-like, n = 14,996 out of 24,780, median, 69% per participant; AID/SHM, n = 11,415 out of 15,636, median, 71% per participant; APOBEC, n = 49,566 out of 101,922, median, 30% per participant. The center line represents the median, the box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles and the whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range. Values exceeding whiskers appear individually as plain circles. *P < 0.05, ****P < 0.0001. P values are from Dunn's test for pairwise, two-sided comparisons and were adjusted with the Holm–Bonferroni procedure: clock-like versus AID: P = 1.15 × 10−2; clock-like versus APOBEC: P = 2.6 × 10−7; AID versus APOBEC: P = 7.75 × 10−13.

Next, and in line with data from CLL34, we found that three signatures associated with SHM/AID activity (SBS9, SBS84 and SBS85) were highly enriched in clustered mutations (<1,000 base pairs from each other; Fig. 4a, second row), and the association was even stronger when we looked only at the immunoglobulin loci (Fig. 4a, third row). Mutations associated with SHM/AID and clock-like signatures were mostly clonal35 (median cancer cell fraction > 0.85: 71% and 69%, respectively; Fig. 4b). On the contrary, mutations that we associated with APOBEC activity were primarily found in subclones (median cancer cell fraction > 0.85: 30%). Furthermore, we could not find strong evidence of APOBEC activity in early mutations. Instead, early mutations were strongly enriched with clock-like signatures SBS1 and SBS5/40 in addition to SBS9 (AID), which is coherent with the phenotypically normal expansion of a B cell population before the emergence of an MGUS/SMM clone (Fig. 4a, last row). This suggests that cancer-like mutational processes (APOBEC and reactive oxygen species) increase after acquiring the initiating event of MGUS/SMM, which then gradually develops into MM.

We next searched for cancer driver genes that are affected by SVs. To do so, we developed a statistical method that analyzes SVs in the neighborhood of each gene and estimates whether SVs are causing loss-of-function events more often than expected by chance (Methods). Overall, we analyzed the 969 patients with WGS data and identified 11 candidate SV drivers (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 9). Of the 969 patients, 300 (31%), spanning all stages of MM, had at least one candidate SV driver event. In addition to the known immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH)-initiating translocations that are associated with MM subgroups (NSD2/MMSET in t(4;14), WWOX, a fragile site proximal to MAF in t(14;16)), our method detected nine candidates. This list includes four known drivers that are commonly affected by copy-number alterations (CDKN2C, SP140, RB1 and TRAF3) as well as five new ones (EMSY, MFF, PRR14L, PRSS2 and SDCCAG8; Extended Data Fig. 7b). Except for the two IGH translocations, SV driver mutations were less common in MGUS/SMM genomes (8%; CI, 4–13%) than in MM (27%; CI, 24–30%; P = 4 × 10−6).

The close neighborhood of all SVs was enriched with mutations attributed to the AID and APOBEC signatures (<10,000 base pairs; 80%; Fig. 5a, middle row), and the association was even stronger among SV drivers alone (88%; Fig. 5a, bottom row). We could differentiate between two categories of SVs: those involving immunoglobulin loci (IGLL5, MMSET, CCND, MAF) were highly enriched in AID, suggesting that they probably arose from translocations generated from double-strand break repairs in the germinal center that happened during late B cell differentiation (Fig. 5b). On the contrary, we found that all of the other seven SV drivers with mutations found in their neighborhood were enriched with APOBEC signature mutations (SBS2 and SBS13), which are not found in normal physiological B cell development and are often generated when single-stranded DNA overhangs are present during SV formation (Fig. 5b)36.

The number of mutations used for each row is indicated on the right side of the colored bars. b, For each SV driver and known canonical myeloma translocations (MMSET, CCND1, WWOX/MAF, MYC), frequency of mutational signatures close to SV breakpoints (<10,000 base pairs). CCND1, IGLL5 and MYC were added to the list of SV drivers because of their known importance in MM. c, Circos plot depicting partners of MYC (chromosome 8) in MGUS/SMM, with recurrent partners (≥3 patients) shown in pink. d, Fraction of patients with deep WGS performed and a MYC translocation detected (immunoglobulin or non-immunoglobulin) across disease stages. Error bars represent binomial proportion 95% CIs for the following counts: MGUS: n = 1 out of 37; SMM: n = 8 out of 120; MM: n = 151 out of 812; bar height represents the frequency itself.

As our algorithm to discover MM SV drivers focused on probable loss-of-function events, it did not capture the MYC translocation events. MYC translocations are known to influence MM disease progression and have been reported at various frequencies across precursor stages (from 0% to 24% (refs. 9,37,38)). In our study, we observed translocations of MYC in 9 out of 157 MGUS/SMM patients with WGS data, for an estimated frequency of 5.7% (CI, 2.8–11%). Similar to MM, both immunoglobulin (IgH, Igλ, Igκ) (n = 3) and non-immunoglobulin partner (n = 6) genes for MYC translocations were found. The most common non-immunoglobulin partner was BMP6/TXNDC5 (Fig. 5c). However, in the MGUS population, MYC was notably rare (none in the PCROWD study and one progressor case from another study38; Fig. 5d), confirming the known increased risk of transformation associated with MYC events (Fisher's exact test, P = 9.3 × 10−5). Overall, this shows that structural variation data from WGS can be used to discover cancer drivers and associate them with clonal evolution and disease progression.

Next, we leveraged the DIG algorithm39 to discover non-coding MM candidate drivers. We found 66 non-coding elements to be significantly recurrently mutated across MGUS/SMM and MM (q < 0.05; Fig. 6a). Of those, 18 were in long non-coding and micro RNA and their promoters, 15 were in the 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of coding genes, 13 were in promoter regions of coding genes, one was in an enhancer region proximal to TXNDC5, 12 were found in immunoglobulin regions and seven were considered mapping or sequencing artifacts after manual review (Supplementary Table 10).

Gene expression levels are given after variance-stabilizing transformation (DESeq2 (ref. 60); arbitrary gene expression units). ILF2 promoter wild-type (ILF2 WT): n = 330, median, 12.3; ILF2 promoter mutant (ILF2 MUT): n = 12, median, 12.5; ILF2 WT and gain of 1q: n = 238, median, 12.9; ILF2 MUT and gain of 1q: n = 9, median, 13.2. The center line represents the median, the box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles and the whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range. Values exceeding whiskers appear individually as plain circles. e, Volcano plot showing the increased expression levels of genes within the topologically associated domain surrounding ILF2 in patients from the CoMMpass study with an ILF2 promoter mutation versus wild-type (P value from the lm function in R; genes represented in red are statistically significant with q < 0.1, where q is the P value adjusted for false discovery rate).

A total of 28 candidate elements could be directly associated with a coding gene target (3′-UTR, 5′-UTR, promoter), of which 17 were found mutated across MM subgroups and also in mature B cells30 (BACH2 promoter and 5′-UTR, BCL6 promoter and 5′-UTR, BCL7A 5′-UTR and so on; Fig. 6a, left). The AID signatures SBS9 and SBS85 were enriched in these 17 elements, consistent with off-target AID activity that could occur during normal B cell differentiation; we postulate that these mutations are less likely to drive cancer progression. Out of the 11 remaining non-coding elements, six were located in known MM drivers or key genes (promoter and 5′-UTR of CCND1, promoters of ILF2, 5′-UTR of EGR1, 3′-UTRs of BMP6 and TXNDC5); and five remain to be investigated (promoter and 5′-UTR of DTX1, promoter of STRIP1, 3′-UTRs of BTG2 and SYBU).

Next, we associated the candidate drivers with mutational signatures and MM subtypes. For instance, the CCND1 promoter and 5′-UTR were hypermutated only in the CCND subtype and are marked by SHM/AID activity (Fig. 6a, bottom rows). This suggests that the translocation occurred before the SHM and class-switch recombination in some cases. Conversely, the ILF2 promoter on chromosome 1q21.2 was mutated exclusively in tumors from the MAF subgroup (n = 9 out of 33 of MAF (27%) among the 177 cases with deep WGS; Fisher's exact test P = 1.0 × 10−7) and was enriched with the APOBEC signature (Fig. 6b) in a CTCF binding peak region (Extended Data Fig. 8). The majority of ILF2 promoter mutations were clonal (11 out of 12 mutations found in nine patients; Fig. 6c) and spanned all disease stages (two MGUS, six SMM and one MM). Finally, we found that tumors with ILF2 promoter mutations have a higher expression of ILF2 and of three other genes in the same topologically associated domain (SNAPIN, S100A4 and S100A6) compared to wild-type cases, independent of 1q gains, and using 589 samples from the CoMMpass study with ILF2 promoter coverage40 (ILF2, P = 0.018; Fig. 6d,e, Extended Data Fig. 9a,b and Supplementary Table 12). Altogether, we provide a list of non-coding candidate drivers for MM and a dictionary of B cell-specific off-target mutations reflecting the B cell to plasma cell differentiation.

Over the last two decades, the genome of overt MM has been extensively characterized. However, a comprehensive map of the transformation from premalignancy to overt disease was lacking. In this study, we analyzed a large cohort of untreated MGUS and SMM using WGS to understand clonal evolution from the earliest genetic abnormalities found in MGUS to active cancer.

Notably, we reveal somatic coding and non-coding driver mutations, structural variations, signature activities and genetic heterogeneity already present at the earliest precancer stages of MM. Building on these observations, we developed the MM-like genomic score, combining 17 genomic events, which can be used to place patients along a trajectory of disease progression and to identify high and low-risk patients in a data-driven manner. This score, based on point mutations, copy-number alterations and canonical translocations, can be measured using sequencing of targeted panels as well as whole exomes and whole genomes, and can be applied to existing cohorts with treatment outcomes.

Our data suggests that the MM-like score can change within 1–2 years in untreated patients, influencing the choice of frequency of measurement. In treated patients, this frequency could be adjusted to detect and monitor emerging subclones41,42. As bone marrow biopsies are often not repeated in the same patient, particularly in the precursor stages, circulating tumor cells or cell-free DNA could potentially replace the need for such biopsies18,43,44,45,46,47,48,49.

Like the classical trajectory of CLL50 and head and neck cancers51, we propose an order of acquisition of events for MM and its precursor conditions, where deletions of 12p and 12q, MYC abnormalities and MAPK pathway mutations occur late. In our model, which we named ‘ladder climbing', these events are acquired stepwise and push tumor cells closer to a cancerous state.

Our refined tumor age estimates suggest that the first oncogenic events occur in the second or third decades of life for both MGUS and SMM, aligning with findings in other hematological malignancies52. This tumor age also indicates that by the time MGUS and SMM patients are diagnosed clinically, the tumor lifetime would already be 20–30 years old. The clinical diagnosis of MGUS/SMM in our study, rather than the screened diagnosis, could explain this late tumor initiation compared to MM53. This tumor age may be a better predictor of progression time and could eventually be included in the MM-like genomic score.

In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group reclassified some SMM as MM based on the ‘nearly inevitable' progression to symptomatic disease54. Whether some MGUS/SMM should be categorized into MM based on their genomic features and whether treatments will be effective in this population remain open questions under investigation (for example, ClinicalTrials.gov IDs: NCT04775550, NCT05469893 and NCT05767359)55.

Our study also describes significant non-coding drivers in MM and its precursor stages, which were mostly found in or near established myeloma drivers. These findings suggest that non-coding mutations, as well as non-genetic factors such as epigenetic changes, could have a critical role in pushing myeloma precancerous lesions toward malignancy55,56.

Although to our knowledge, our study provides one of the largest analyses of whole-genome data for MM and its precursor conditions, more longitudinal samples per patient could further refine our models. Eventually, data from a clinical-grade WGS would replace fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reliably detect emerging high-risk subclones, including in treatment settings42,57,58.

In summary, we provide a model of clonal evolution for MM precursor conditions that indicates a ‘ladder-like' acquisition of events over time, which we combined into a genomic score available as a biomarker tool to improve risk assessment and stratification.

Bone marrow samples were collected from the PCROWD study at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (IRB number 14-174; NCT02269592). All patients provided written informed consent for the collection and research use of bone marrow samples. Research studies were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Research Electronic Data Capture (RedCap) solution was used to aggregate sample-level and participant-level study data61,62. Bone marrow samples were drawn into heparinized EDTA tubes before mononuclear cell isolation (SepMate, STEMCELL Technologies) and subsequent plasma cell selection using CD138 magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). Enriched plasma cell counts and viability of MACS-sorted bone marrow samples were assessed by trypan blue exclusion on an automated cell counter (Invitrogen Countess 3, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In patients with low tumor burden, we also used a standardized CellSearch platform for tumor cell enrichment followed by FACS for the CD38+CD138+CD19−CD45− immunophenotype (Supplementary Note 2)18. Each patient also had peripheral blood processed for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Samples were cryopreserved for subsequent downstream molecular analyses. Patients with bone marrow biopsies had FISH studies performed at clinical pathology laboratories.

Genomic DNA isolation, library construction and sequencing were performed as previously described18,63. For DNA isolation, we used the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (New England Biolabs (NEB)). Yields from DNA isolation from both tumor plasma cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantified using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep kit (NEB) with unique dual index adaptors (NEBNext Multiplex Oligos) with 50–100 ng of input DNA material. Final library fragment sizes were measured with the BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies), and concentrations were quantified by a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit) before pooling. Final sample libraries were normalized and pooled for matched tumor and normal WGS. WGS was performed at the Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. Flowcells ‘S4' were used in a 2 × 150 bp paired-end read sequencing configuration.

After sequencing and library demultiplexing, reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome with BWA MEM (v.0.7.15) (-K 100000000 -p -v 3 -t 16 -Y parameters)64. After marking duplicates, base quality scores were recalibrated with GATK 4.2 BQSR without base quality quantization. The analysis of aligned sequences was performed with the Cancer Genome Analysis workflow from the Cancer Program at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard on an in-house cloud-based HPC system named wolF as follows:

Mutations were detected with MuTect65 for SNVs, and with Strelka266 for small indels. Candidate mutants were filtered through a Panel of Normals consisting of peripheral blood mononuclear cells processed with the same library preparation protocol20, for orientation bias inducing artifact (8-oxoguanine and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded)67, for mapping artifacts with the BLAT realignment68 and for enzymatic shearing of cruciform variant artifacts19. deTiN69 was used to estimate the tumor-in-normal contamination rate and rescue candidate mutations accordingly under 10%. Fingerprinting was used to confirm matching tumor–normal pairing70. ConEst71 was used to detect exogenous contamination. Candidate mutations were also matched against the bovine genome with BLAT to ensure samples were not contaminated from other species72. Finally, candidate mutations were annotated with GATK Funcotator (v.1.7).

Allelic copy-number ratios were calculated with the AllelicCapSeg59 method, which clusters together copy-ratio segments and allelic imbalance obtained from the variant allele frequencies of heterozygous SNPs from the matched normal. ABSOLUTE59 was used to estimate purity, ploidy and cancer cell fraction of mutations and copy-number ratios, and all solutions were manually reviewed. When several samples were available for the same participant, subclonal structures were deciphered with the PhylogicNDT suite of tools51,73.

SVs were detected with Manta74, SvABA75 and dRanger/BreakPointer76. Consensus lists of candidate SVs were then established as previously described77 with the exception of the 10% variant allele frequency filter, which was set to 0% to increase sensitivity to detect immunoglobulin rearrangements. Finally, all candidate SVs from the deep WGS cohorts were manually reviewed with IGV78.

To detect candidate coding drivers, we first selected one sample per patient to avoid double-counting of events (the earliest sample was chosen). The list of candidate drivers from point mutations and indels was established with the MutSig2CV method20. Copy-number hotspots and associated genes were discovered with the GISTIC2.0 method79. After repeatedly resampling and running MutSig2CV and GISTIC2.0 on subsets of the cohort (with as few as ten patients), we modeled the number of drivers for each category of drivers (those found in <1%, 1–2%, 2–3%, 3–4%, 4–5% and >5% of patients) with logistic regression on the number of samples to test whether the number of drivers discovered plateaus at around 1,000 unique samples (Extended Data Fig. 1). We used the DIG method to discover non-coding hotspots of mutations (candidate drivers)39. In brief, the DIG algorithm models constant mutation rates along the genome and identifies non-coding, annotated elements from the PCAWG dataset80 that are more mutated than expected by chance after adjusting for their sequence context and the overall mutation rate of the cohort. Then, candidate drivers were flagged if they were found recurrently mutated (≥2 samples) in WGS data from normal lymphocytes30.

Candidate SV drivers were determined using SVelfie81, a computational algorithm that seeks to discover enrichment of probable loss-of-function SV events on a per-gene basis. SVelfie creates a contingency table estimating the probabilities of all possible types of SVs for a given gene (that is, whether each breakpoint of the SV putatively ends up in an exonic, intronic, 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, promoter or intergenic region, and whether both breakpoints are local to that gene) based on how SV breakpoints would be annotated to that gene using the annotator of dRanger (see above). Such a contingency table is computed for cases in which at least one breakpoint of an SV is within one megabase of the given gene, and it assumes a uniform distribution of breakpoints local to the gene. The probability of both breakpoints being local to a gene is based empirically on how frequently an SV is deemed to have both breakpoints within 1 Mb of a gene for the set of genes being tested by SVelfie. From this information, a subset of the events in the contingency table are categorized as probable loss-of-function to the gene, based on specific breakpoint combinations of an SV event that would putatively disrupt the coding region for a gene and lead to loss of its function. The corresponding probabilities of such loss-of-function events from the contingency table are summed, giving an estimated probability of a given gene losing its function for having an SV with at least one breakpoint local to it. Then, using this probability, a binomial test is performed to determine whether there is significant enrichment of probable loss-of-function events for the gene, and multiple test correction is applied among a starting list of genes being tested by SVelfie, using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate procedure.

To quantify mutational signatures present specifically in the vicinity of candidate SV drivers (see below), we extracted point mutations that were found within 10 kb of SV breakpoints. Then, for each candidate SV driver, we calculated the proportions of mutational signature loadings among all such mutations for each gene by averaging their respective probabilities.

Mutational signatures were extracted from SNVs across all donors using a Bayesian hierarchical Dirichlet process (hdp package, https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp)31. If a given donor had multiple different tumor samples sequenced, SNVs were grouped into pseudo-samples based on their presence or absence across samples, such that a given SNV was only counted once. SNVs were further divided into three categories, each forming a further pseudo-sample: SNVs within immunoglobulin genes, clustered SNVs with an inter-mutational distance of less than 1,000 bases and other SNVs. SNVs were collapsed into their 96 counts of base change within their trinucleotide context. The hierarchy used by hdp consisted of (pseudo-)samples grouped by donor. The hdp algorithm was run in 20 different chains, for 40,000 iterations with a burn-in of 20,000 iterations, as previously described82.

The resulting extracted signatures were further compared to the reference COSMIC signatures (v.3.3)32. Each signature extracted by hdp was modeled as a linear combination of reference signatures previously described in lymphoid cancers32 or normal lymphocytes30 using an expectation-maximization algorithm, as previously described82. If the cosine similarity of the extracted signature and reconstructed signature exceeded 0.85, the extracted hdp signature was replaced with its constituent COSMIC reference signature. If not, the hdp signature was kept as an unmatched mutational signature (Supplementary Note).

The acquisition of (sub-)chromosomal duplications can be timed using the relative ratio of duplicated and non-duplicated SNVs83. In brief, this ratio can be estimated using a binomial mixture model84 on the counts of variant supporting reads and total depth on the chromosomal regions affected by duplications, taking into account the purity of the tumor and the local copy-number profile. From these ratios, the relative timing can be calculated:

where \({C}_{\rm {M}}\) and \({C}_{\rm {m}}\) are the major and minor copy numbers, respectively, and \({P}_{\rm {D}}\) and \({{P}}_{{\rm {ND}}}\) are the proportion of mutations assigned to the duplicated or non-duplicated copy number. The timepoint of duplication will be a number between 0 and 1, the former representing the zygote and the latter the most recent common ancestor to the clone; that is, MGUS, SMM or MM. For purposes of practicality, the 1 is often taken to represent the time of sampling, which will give an upper bound of the timing of the hyperdiploidy. Then, this fraction and its confidence interval are converted to actual age at initiation52,83,84 by multiplying them by the patient's age at the time of biopsy, assuming this time is conflated with the time at which the most recent common ancestor clone existed. Note that this approach assumes a constant mutation rate before and after duplications. Therefore, only SNVs that were most likely to be attributed to SBS1 and SBS5 (both clock-like signatures) were used for the timing analysis.

To accommodate low rates of whole-genome duplications and a high fraction of low-depth WGS from the CoMMpass data, we adapted a method to estimate the relative ordering of acquisition of events based on their relative clonality. As copy-number abnormalities from GISTIC2.0 peaks are often found in different patients, we used a Bradley–Terry model85 (League model) to allow comparison of events, even if they are not found together in the same sample. In particular, the input matrix of the Bradley–Terry model was modified based on known abnormalities in MM (that is, hyperdiploidy is a single event) and on the precision of WGS (that is, points are assigned to ‘winner' copy-number alterations only if the difference in clonality between two samples is significant; see Supplementary Note 6). Then, the standard Bradley–Terry formulas were used to compute log abilities using the BradleyTerry2 R package86. In brief, genomic abnormalities \(i\in \left\{1,\ldots ,K\right\}\) are described with their log ability (or Bradley–Terry score) \({\beta }_{i}=\log \left({\alpha }_{i}\right)\). The probability \({p}_{{ij}}\) that i has higher clonality levels than \(j\) in the model is expressed as the ratio of their abilities \(\frac{{\alpha }_{i}}{{\alpha }_{j}}\), or alternatively, in its logarithmic form:

The log abilities \({\beta }_{i}\) are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation:

where \(n\) comparisons of genetic abnormalities \(\left({i}_{1},{j}_{1}\right),\ldots ,\left({i}_{n},{j}_{n}\right)\) are played and \({Y}_{m}\) is the outcome of the mth comparison \({Y}_{m}\in (\mathrm{0,1})\).

Then, we ran the same Bradley–Terry model in the MGUS/SMM ‘League', versus in the MM ‘League', and therefore termed the method ‘clonality league comparison'. Bradley–Terry estimates (log abilities) were compared with a two-tailed t-test. The leagues include MM-specific initiating events (hyperdiploidy), arm-level copy numbers and significant GISTIC2.0 peaks. Events with an absolute difference in Bradley–Terry estimate of 1 and adjusted q < 0.1 were considered significant.

We followed a previously described29,30 methodology with some modifications. In brief, aggregated genome-wide somatic tumor mutation density was modeled from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) reads of normal B cell types using random forest regression with tenfold cross-validation. For each tumor mutational profile, we trained a separate model using all ChIP–seq profiles associated with each B cell type, combining the two replicates. Clonal and subclonal tumor mutations were counted in 2,125 1 Mb genomic windows, and, in addition to the previously reported excluded regions, we now also excluded the windows spanning the heavy (IgH) and light (Igκ and Igλ) chains. B cell type epigenetic data with replicates were collected from IHEC and EnCODE (ERS663722, ERS663732, ERS643304, ERS728717, ERS663728, ERS728718, CEMT0032.gDNA, ENCDO412QUR, CEMT0135.gDNA, CEMT0134.gDNA) using the following ChIP–seq histone modification tracks: Control, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3. Statistical significance was determined between each top hit and the subsequent models using a two-tailed corrected t-test on the values from the tenfold cross-validation, accounting for the interdependence of tests in a cross-validation setting.

Next-generation sequencing data from previous MM studies were analyzed with the same methods as above to ensure harmonized collection of data for comparative analyses, including WGS of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass database40 (dbGAP accession number phs000748.v1.p1, n = 792), of our group18 (phs003084.v1) and others38,87 (EGAD00001006363, EGAS00001004467). For WGS from the MMRF CoMMpass, which has been sequenced with three different library construction methods, we built one Panel of Normals for each method using matched normal samples with no tumor-in-normal contamination and excluding the 5% lowest fragment size and depth of coverage (Illumina TruSeq, Kapa and KapaHyper). Whole-exome sequencing data matched to the shallow WGS from the MMRF CoMMpass study were analyzed with the Cancer Genome Analysis pipeline as previously described8 and used to detect coding mutations in these samples. Data analyzed from a previous study were obtained from the original publication8: translocations with FISH, mutations and copy-number profiles from whole-exome sequencing8. For the molecular timing of MM, processed mutation counts and copy-number estimates were obtained from additional hyperdiploid genomes in public repositories EGAD00001003309 and phs000348.v2.p1.

Statistical analyses have been conducted as previously described18: median and interquartile ranges are reported to describe quantitative variables unless otherwise stated. The significant difference in average between multiple groups was tested with the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn's post-hoc tests. When only two groups were compared, the Wilcoxon test was used. Means are given with their 95% CIs unless stated otherwise, when they are estimated from random processes. The significant difference in event frequency between multiple groups was tested with a χ2 Pearson test or Fisher's exact test, where appropriate. In survival analyses, patients were stratified per the median of quantitative variables, and time-to-event was calculated from the sampling date to the date of clinical progression to MM or death of any cause, whichever happened first. Patients were censored at the date of last clinical follow-up, or at the start of treatment for MGUS/SMM, where appropriate. Cox regression models were tested with the log-rank test. P values were adjusted with the false discovery rate control procedure from Benjamini and Hochberg and are provided as q-values88; q < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (or <0.1 for genomic driver discovery; see above). For boxplots, we used the default median for center line, upper and lower quartiles for box limits, 1.5× interquartile range for whiskers and points for remaining outliers.

a) Binomial power analysis showing sensitivity to detect candidate point mutation drivers according to the number of independent tumors-normal (TN) pairs sequenced (50 to 5,000) for diverse ranges of mutation frequencies ( > 1%, >2%, >3%, >4%, >5%, >10%), and following the procedure in Lawrence et al.20. Dashed line represents the 90% detection power. b) Number of candidate point mutations drivers found by MutSig2CV analysis across different frequencies of mutation (each color represents a frequency range for a driver to be mutated in the population as indicated on the graph legend). Each dot represents a random sampling of N participants of the full cohort from N = 10 to 1,030. Saturation curves are modeled by logistic regression. c) Saturation analysis for candidate driver discovery based on focal copy-number abnormalities by the GISTIC2 algorithm with axes and modeling similar to panel B. d) Copy-number and structural variants in patients without MM-driver point mutation detected (N = 209; MGUS: 21, SMM: 83, MM: 105). Two participants (MMRF_2153 and SMM_102_Tumor) had driver copy-number detected below the cutoff used in this study (MMRF_2153: del(13q, 13%), SMM_102_Tumor: del(16q), 10%, compared with 14% or 0.1 units of log2ratio). e) Distribution of the number of MM drivers found mutated per disease stage and medians 0, 1, 2 for MGUS, SMM, and MM, respectively. Total number of patients: MGUS: 37; SMM: 181; MM: 812.

Sen. Ron Wyden sent a letter to fellow Senators on Wednesday, revealing that three major U.S. cellphone carriers did not have provisions to notify lawmakers about government surveillance requests, despite a contractual requirement to do so. 

In the letter, Wyden, a Democrat and longstanding member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that an investigation by his staff found that AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon were not notifying Senators of legal requests — including from the White House — to surveil their phones. The companies “have indicated that they are all now providing such notice,” according to the letter.

Politico was first to report Wyden's letter.

Wyden's letter comes in the wake of a report last year by the Inspector General, which revealed that the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018 secretly obtained logs of calls and text messages of 43 congressional staffers and two serving House lawmakers, imposing gag orders on the phone companies that received the requests. The secret surveillance requests were first revealed in 2021 to have targeted Adam Schiff, who was at the time the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

“Executive branch surveillance poses a significant threat to the Senate's independence and the foundational principle of separation of powers,” wrote Wyden in his letter. “If law enforcement officials, whether at the federal, state, or even local level, can secretly obtain Senators' location data or call histories, our ability to perform our constitutional duties is severely threatened.” 

AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told TechCrunch in a statement that, “we are complying with our obligations to the Senate Sergeant at Arms,” and that the phone company has “received no legal demands regarding Senate offices under the current contract, which began last June.”

When asked whether AT&T received legal demands before the new contract, Byers did not respond.

Wyden said in the letter that one unnamed carrier “confirmed that it turned over Senate data to law enforcement without notifying the Senate.” When reached by TechCrunch, Wyden's spokesperson Keith Chu said the reason was that, “we don't want to discourage companies from responding to Sen. Wyden's questions.” 

Verizon and T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment. 

The letter also mentioned carriers Google Fi, US Mobile, and cellular startup Cape, which all have policies to notify “all customers about government demands whenever they are allowed to do so.” US Mobile and Cape adopted the policy after outreach from Wyden's office.

Chu told TechCrunch that the Senate “doesn't have contracts with the smaller carriers.”

Ahmed Khattak, US Mobile's founder and CEO, confirmed to TechCrunch that the company “did not have a formal customer notification policy regarding surveillance requests prior to Senator Wyden's inquiry.” 

“Our current policy is to notify customers of subpoenas or legal demands for information whenever we are legally permitted to do so and when the request is not subject to a court order, statutory gag provision, or other legal restriction on disclosure,” said Khattak. “To the best of our knowledge, US Mobile has not received any surveillance requests targeting the phones of Senators or their staff.”

Cape CEO John Doyle pointed to the company's privacy policy, which states that Cape responds to legal requests but “will notify its subscribers of receipt of any legal process seeking disclosure related to their accounts, thereby giving you the opportunity to challenge that request,” unless legally prohibited to do so. “To date, Cape has not received any requests for subscriber data that contained a nondisclosure obligation,” the privacy policy reads.

Google and did not respond to a request for comment. 

As Wyden's letter notes, after Congress enacted protections in 2020 for Senate data held by third party companies, the Senate Sergeant at Arms updated its contracts to require phone carriers to send notifications of surveillance requests. 

Wyden said that his staff discovered that “these crucial notifications were not happening.”

None of these protections apply to phones that are not officially issued to the Senate, such as campaign or personal phones of Senators and their staffers. In the letter, Wyden encouraged his Senate colleagues to switch to carriers that now provide notifications.

Updated to include comment from Cape's John Doyle and corrected the title of US Mobile's founder.

The next evolution in FSR frame generation


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


As part of its Computex 2025 announcements, AMD has given gamers a sneak peek at the company's major update for its FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) technology. Dubbed FSR Redstone, the upcoming installment will bring many new features to match rival Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).

FSR 4, the latest iteration of the technology, debuted a few months ago with the launch of the Radeon RX 9700 series, specifically the Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT.

While the initial batch of supported titles was limited to around 30 games, AMD expects to double that number by June 5, aligning with the Radeon RX 9060 XT launch. Nonetheless, AMD is already plotting ahead and preparing FSR Redstone as the next substantial upgrade for FSR.

Although AMD did not provide specific details, the chipmaker emphasized three features to be included in FSR Redstone: neural radiance caching, machine learning ray regeneration, and machine learning frame generation. Some of these features might sound familiar, as they are already part of the Nvidia DLSS suite.

AMD states that neural radiance caching effectively learns how light reflects within a scene. The objective is to predict and store indirect lighting assets in a cache, which can subsequently be used to generate heaps of other rays. Logically, this helps accelerate path tracing.

Ray regeneration is equivalent to Nvidia's ray reconstruction. This feature leverages a trained neural network to regenerate pixels that couldn't be accurately traced. Thanks to machine learning, it can predict and filter grainy noise in real time.

With FSR Redstone, AMD is enhancing its super resolution feature through the utilization of an improved machine learning model, designed to predict and reconstruct lower resolution frames in order to optimize performance. The upscaling occurs in real time.

Like Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR also offers gamers frame generation. However, FSR had utilized an AI-free approach up until now. The next-generation FSR Redstone will tap machine learning for frame generation, which should improve performance and quality.

AMD has not committed to a specific date for FSR Redstone's prime debut, only indicating a release in the latter half of this year. FSR Redstone will launch with native compatibility for RDNA 4-powered graphics cards. Sadly, AMD did not specify whether it will be backward compatible with the previous generations of RDNA graphics cards. Since FSR 4 is exclusive to RDNA 4, FSR Redstone support for older-generation AMD Radeon graphics cards looks even bleak.

OpenAI is acquiring io, the device startup that CEO Sam Altman and famed Apple designer Jony Ive have quietly been working on for two years, in an all-equity deal that values that startup at $6.5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. As part of the unusual deal announced Wednesday, Ive and his design firm, LoveFrom, will now lead creative and design work at OpenAI.

“Thrilled to be partnering with Jony, [in my opinion] the greatest designer in the world,” said Altman in a post on X Wednesday. “Excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.”

OpenAI and Ive's collaboration puts one of Apple's former design heads — famous for crafting many iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Apple Watches — at the forefront of the newest technology wave, generative AI. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI has amped up its consumer business significantly. Earlier this month, the company appointed former Meta executive and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo to lead its consumer applications.

Ive could help OpenAI directly compete with Apple in the consumer hardware space, putting even more pressure on the iPhone maker. In recent years, Apple has struggled to develop AI features that keep up with the latest technology from OpenAI and Google. Apple's stock fell 2% on Wednesday after the OpenAI and Ive collaboration was announced.

Io has a staff of around 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists, and product development specialists, per The Wall Street Journal, all of which will join OpenAI. Many of io's employees are former Apple designers — including Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan — who helped build the firm's most iconic products. 

Ive is retaining control of his design firm, LoveFrom, which will continue to operate independently.

Io, under OpenAI, will develop AI-powered consumer devices and other projects. Altman and Ive have reportedly been working on a device that moves consumers “beyond screens.” Bloomberg reports that Ive and Altman's first devices are slated to debut in 2026. The Wall Street Journal reports that Ive will have an expansive role, giving input into future versions of ChatGPT and more.

OpenAI already had a 23% stake in io as part of an agreement between the companies last year, according to The New York Times. That means OpenAI will pay $5 billion to fully acquire io, marking the ChatGPT maker's largest acquisition ever. Reportedly, the OpenAI Startup Fund made a separate investment in io last year.

In a video posted by OpenAI, Altman said the mission of io is to create a family of AI devices that will let people use AI to produce “all sorts of wonderful things.” Ive said he's convinced that everything he's learned “over the last 30 years has led me to this place and this moment.” The first AI device io is working on has “completely captured” Ive's imagination, he said.

The world of AI devices is still in its infancy. Altman was an early investor in Humane, another AI hardware company founded by former Apple employees, which made an AI-powered “pin.” After a series of stumbles, Humane was sold to HP and its devices were sunsetted.

Meanwhile, other form factors for AI devices have shown more promise. Meta's AI-powered smart glasses, which it's developing with the eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, have achieved strong sales and adoption among consumers. This week, Google unveiled its version of AI smart glasses that it's developing with Samsung, Warby Parker, and other partners.

Ultimately, it's unclear what shape OpenAI's devices will take. Later in the video, Altman noted how using a laptop or smartphone to access ChatGPT was too cumbersome. Instead, the OpenAI CEO suggested he'd rather use a device more integrated into his everyday life

The Information first reported on OpenAI's discussions to acquire io in March. At the time, the two companies were said to be discussing building a device that would bring a version of the technology from the movie “Her” to life.

Meta is launching a new program to incentivize startups to adopt its Llama AI models. 

The program, Llama for Startups, provides companies “direct support” from Meta's Llama team, as well as funding in certain cases. Any U.S.-based firm that is incorporated, has raised less than $10 million in funding, has at least one developer on staff, and is building generative AI applications is eligible to apply by the May 30 deadline.

“Members may receive up to $6,000 per month for up to six months to help them offset the costs of building and enhancing their generative AI solutions,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “Our experts will work closely with them to get started and explore advanced use cases of Llama that could benefit their startups.”

The launch of the Llama startup program comes as Meta tries to cement its lead in the fiercely competitive open model space. While the tech giant's Llama models have racked up more than a billion downloads to date, rivals such as DeepSeek, Google, and Alibaba's Qwen threaten to upend Meta's efforts to establish a far-reaching model ecosystem.

Not helping matters, Llama has suffered several setbacks over the past few months. 

The Wall Street Journal last week reported Meta has delayed the rollout of a flagship AI model, Llama 4 Behemoth, over concerns the model underperforms on key benchmarks. In April, Meta had to fend off allegations that it cheated on a popular crowdsourced AI benchmark, LM Arena. The company used a version of its Llama 4 Maverick model “optimized for conversationality” to achieve a high score on LM Arena, but released a different version of Maverick publicly.

Meta has huge ambitions for Llama — and its broader generative AI portfolio. Last year, the company made a prediction its generative AI products would rake in $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue in 2025, and between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion by 2035.

Meta has revenue-sharing agreements with some companies that host its Llama models. The company recently launched an API for customizing Llama releases. And Meta AI, the company's AI assistant powered by Llama, may eventually show ads and offer a subscription with additional features, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's Q1 earnings call.

These products have proven costly to build. In 2024, Meta's “GenAI” budget was more than $900 million, and this year, it could exceed $1 billion. That's not including the infrastructure needed to run and train the models. Meta previously said it plans to spend $60 billion to $80 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily on new data centers.

Is this true for all tool calls? Even if the tool returns little data?


reply



I guess one could in principle wrap the entire execution block into a distributed transaction, but llm try to make code that is robust, which works against this pattern as it makes hard to understand failure


reply



For example, when the code execution fails mid-way, we really want the model to be able to pick up from where it failed (with the states of the variables at the time of failure) and be able to continue from there.We've found that the LLM is able to generate correct code that picks up gracefully. The hard part now is building the runtime that makes that possible; we've something that works pretty well in many cases now in production at Lutra.

It's interesting how architectural patterns built at large tech companies (for completely different use-cases than AI) have become so relevant to the AI execution space.You see a lot of AI startups learning the hard way that value of event sourcing and (eventually) durable execution, but these patterns aren't commonly adopted on Day 1. I blame the AI frameworks.(disclaimer - currently working on a durable execution platform)

At a company-wide hackathon this month, developers at finance firm Block built a dizzying number of prototype tools including a database debugger, a program for identifying duplicated code, and an app that automates Bitcoin support.

The sudden productivity boost was driven by Goose, an artificial intelligence agent developed by Block several months ago that can help with coding and other work like knocking together data visualizations or mocking up new product features.

“We've always had really strong hack weeks, but this one was at another level,” says Jackie Brosamer, who leads the AI and data platform at Block. “We have tens of ideas that we're looking to bring to production.”

Goose helped developers at Block to develop a new agent-to-agent communication server at the hackathon. The company says Goose has changed the way it works, not only helping automate code generation but also allowing non-engineers to dabble in coding or prototype for new apps or features.

I first spoke to Block several months ago, when Goose was a little less cooked than it is now. Developers at the company admitted that the agent increased their output but at the time also sometimes made mistakes like deleting the odd file (this can still happen sometimes). They ran the system on machines where any changes could easily be rolled back.

Agents are starting to change the way many developers and companies operate as AI models get better at managing code, using computers, and wielding tools. Over the past week, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have all touted agentic coding tools. Block uses Anthropic's Claude model by default, which is particularly good at coding and tool use.

Block CEO Jack Dorsey and the company's CTO, Dhanji Prasanna, concluded that agents would shake up their industry in fall of 2024, when improved AI models triggered a significant leap in the performance of many agents. Dorsey and Prasanna decided that Block should build its own agent and that engineers and other staff should dive headfirst into using it.

Block's Goose is available as open source (the name, in case you didn't guess, was inspired by Maverick's friend in the movie Top Gun).

Goose can be powered by a range of different AI models and will run commands and access files and folders on a computer. Goose can also tap into a growing number of online tools, like cloud storage platforms or online databases, thanks to the Model Context Protocol scheme for agent communications developed by Anthropic.

I used the latest version of Goose to knock together a few simple games and a basic visualization. It does a nice job of handling tedious things like ensuring the right version of Python is available and installing packages. Other tools I've tried seem as capable, but the Goose interface is particularly easy and intuitive, and it seems likely to become more powerful as it gains access to other tools and services.

Brad Axen, an engineering lead at Block using Goose, told me recently that Goose has proven especially useful for helping engineers wrap their head around an unfamiliar code base. “One of the things that works best is if you say ‘Hey, I don't know how this works yet, could you please go find everything and give me a summary,'” he says.

Axen said back then that using an agent seemed to require a different mindset where you didn't expect the tool to be perfect and were prepared to roll back any missteps.

Block says that some developers were initially resistant to using Goose, reflecting skepticism I've heard from other coders who don't trust AI to code well or are reluctant to hand over their own agency. But the company has developed protocols for managing code produced using Goose, for example having humans review everything made at the hackathon for bugs before it is cleared for release. As the complexity of these agentic systems grows, managing stability and security may become a bigger challenge.

Axen says he's most excited to see how the server built during the hackathon can change the way other agents use Block's technology. “It's a weird way of thinking about computers working together,” he says. “But it's exciting.”

A consortium of global law enforcement agencies and tech companies announced on Wednesday that they have disrupted the infostealer malware known as Lumma. One of the most popular infostealers worldwide, Lumma has been used by hundreds of what Microsoft calls “cyber threat actors” to steal passwords, credit card and banking information, and cryptocurrency wallet details. The tool, which officials say is developed in Russia, has provided cybercriminals with the information and credentials they needed to drain bank accounts, disrupt services, and carry out data extortion attacks against schools, among other things.

Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) obtained an order from a United States district court last week to seize and take down about 2,300 domains underpinning Lumma's infrastructure. At the same time, the US Department of Justice seized Lumma's command and control infrastructure and disrupted cybercriminal marketplaces that sold the Lumma malware. All of this was coordinated, too, with disruption of regional Lumma infrastructure by Europol's European Cybercrime Center and Japan's Cybercrime Control Center.

Microsoft lawyers wrote on Wednesday that Lumma, which is also known as LummaC2, has spread so broadly because it is “easy to distribute, difficult to detect, and can be programmed to bypass certain security defenses.” Steven Masada, assistant general counsel at Microsoft's DCU, says in a blog post that Lumma is a “go-to tool,” including for the notorious Scattered Spider cybercriminal gang. Attackers distribute the malware using targeted phishing attacks that typically impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims.

“In 2025, probably following Redline's disruption and Lumma's own development, it has ranked as the most active module, indicating its growing popularity and widespread adoption among cybercriminals,” says Victoria Kivilevich, director of threat research at security firm Kela.

Microsoft says that more than 394,000 Windows computers were infected with the Lumma malware between March 16 and May 16 this year. And Lumma was mentioned in more than 21,000 listings on cybercrime forums in the spring of 2024, according to figures cited in a notice published today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The malware has been spotted bundled in fake AI video generators, fake “deepfake” generation websites, and distributed by fake CAPTCHA pages.

Law enforcement's collaboration with Microsoft's DCU and other tech companies like Cloudflare focused on disrupting Lumma's infrastructure in multiple ways, so its developers could not simply hire new providers or create parallel systems to rebuild.

“Cloudflare's role in the disruption included blocking the command and control server domains, Lumma's Marketplace domains, and banning the accounts that were used to configure the domains,” the company wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. “Microsoft coordinated the takedown of Lumma's domains with multiple relevant registries in order to ensure that the criminals could not simply change the name servers and recover their control.”

While infostealing malware has been around for years, its use by cybercriminals and nation-state hackers has surged since 2020. Typically, infostealers find their way onto people's computers through downloads of pirated software or through targeted phishing attacks that impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims. Once on a computer it is able to grab sensitive information—such as usernames and passwords, financial information, browser extensions, multifactor authentication details and more—and send it back to the malware's operators.

Some infostealer operators bundle and sell this stolen data. But increasingly the compromised details have acted as a gateway for hackers to launch further attacks, providing them with the details needed to access online accounts and the networks of multi-billion dollar corporations.

“It's clear that infostealers have become more than just grab-and-go malware,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “In many campaigns they really act as the first stage, collecting credentials, access tokens, and other foothold-enabling data, which is then used to launch more traditional, high-impact attacks such as lateral movement, espionage, or ransomware.”

The Lumma infostealer first emerged on Russian-language cybercrime forums in 2022, according to the FBI and CISA. Since then its developers have upgraded its capabilities and released multiple different versions of the software.

Since 2023, for example, they have been working to integrate AI into the malware platform, according to findings from the security firm Trellix. Attackers want to add these capabilities to automate some of the work involved in cleaning up the massive amounts of raw data collected by infostealers, including identifying and separating “bot” accounts that are less valuable for most attackers.

One administrator of Lumma told 404Media and WIRED last year that they encouraged both seasoned hackers and new cybercriminals to use their software. “This brings us good income,” the administrator said, referring to the resale of stolen login data.

Microsoft says that the main developer behind Lumma goes by the online handle “Shamel” and is based in Russia.

“Shamel markets different tiers of service for Lumma via Telegram and other Russian-language chat forums,” Microsoft's Masada wrote on Wednesday. “Depending on what service a cybercriminal purchases, they can create their own versions of the malware, add tools to conceal and distribute it, and track stolen information through an online portal.”

Kela's Kivilevich says that in the days leading up to the takedown, some cybercriminals started to complain on forums that there had been problems with Lumma. They even speculated that the malware platform had been targeted in a law enforcement operation.

“Based on what we see, there is a wide range of cybercriminals admitting they are using Lumma, such as actors involved in credit card fraud, initial access sales, cryptocurrency theft, and more,” Kivilevich says.

Among other tools, the Scattered Spider hacking group—which has attacked Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International, and other victims—has been spotted using the Lumma stealer. Meanwhile, according to a report from TechCrunch, the Lumma malware was allegedly used in the build up to the December 2024 hack of education tech firm PowerSchool, in which more than 70 million records were stolen.

“We're now seeing infostealers not just evolve technically, but also play a more central role operationally,” says DoubleYou's Wardle. “Even nation-state actors are developing and deploying them.”

Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at the security firm Flashpoint, says that while infostealers are only one tool that cybercriminals will use, their prevalence may make it easier for cybercriminals to hide their tracks. “Even advanced threat actor groups are leveraging infostealer logs, or they risk burning sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),” Gray says.

Lumma isn't the first infostealer to be targeted by law enforcement. In October last year, the Dutch National Police, along with international partners, took down the infrastructure linked to the RedLine and MetaStealer malware, and the US Department of Justice unsealed charges against Maxim Rudometov, one of the alleged developers and administrators of the RedLine infostealer.

Despite the international crackdown, infostealers have proven too useful and effective for attackers to abandon. As Flashpoint's Gray puts it, “Even if the landscape ultimately shifts due to the evolution of defenses, the growing prominence of infostealers over the past few years suggests they are likely here to stay for the foreseeable future. Usage of them has exploded.”

A family vacation to Costa Rica turned sour after 12 of 13 relatives developed symptoms of a fungal lung infection following an excursion through bat-filled caves.

In season two of The Last of Us, the cordyceps fungus—spoiler alert—becomes airborne, meaning the fungal infection can spread not just through bites but also when humans inhale its spores. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica.

In a paper published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of histoplasmosis: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses.

During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone—except the one family member who hadn't toured the cave—became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues.

Five family members sought medical attention. Doctors tested four of them for fungal infections, and two tested positive for histoplasma. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. Notably, the cave they had visited had also likely caused a histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998 and 1999.

“Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame,” the team, led by CDC researchers, wrote in the report. “However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.” In other words, given that it's harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis.

Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies—or had lung cancer—and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals go away on their own.

Histoplasmosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to “consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,” they concluded. In collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health, the CDC hopes to see the risk of histoplasmosis included in the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.

It's not surprising that The Last of Us is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski—author of The Witcher—wrote that “there's a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse.

A Massachusetts student has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges relating to hacking and extorting one of the largest U.S. education tech companies, prosecutors confirmed Tuesday. 

Matthew D. Lane, 19, is accused of using stolen login credentials to access the network of an unnamed software company, which serves schools across North America and elsewhere, to steal the personal information of more than 60 million students and 10 million teachers. 

The stolen personal information included names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, medical information, and school grades. In some cases, the hackers stole decades of historical student data. 

While the company was not named, federal prosecutors described specific details matching the data breach at education software maker PowerSchool, which revealed in January that it had been hacked as far back as August and September 2024. The breach affected schools located mostly across the United States and Canada, which use the PowerSchool software to manage student grades, attendance, and other personal and health information.

Prosecutors say Lane worked with an unnamed co-conspirator who lived in Illinois to extort the education software maker for about $2.85 million in cryptocurrency, according to the criminal complaint.

PowerSchool confirmed to TechCrunch in January that it had paid the hackers to delete the stolen data, but refused to say how much it paid. Earlier this month, several school districts said that they had since faced extortion attempts from someone saying that the stolen student data had not been destroyed. PowerSchool said the extortion attempts were not related to a new incident, as the “samples of data match the data previously stolen in December.”

NBC News was first to report on Lane's plea agreement.

PowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler said the company was aware of the filing, and deferred comment to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Massachusetts, which declined to name the victims, per an email from an unnamed spokesperson to TechCrunch. 

When asked, Keebler did not dispute the ransom amount as noted by the prosecutors.

Lane is also accused of hacking and extorting another company, which prosecutors said was a U.S. telecoms provider. Prosecutors did not name the company in the plea agreement.

Lane's attorney Sean Smith did not respond to a request for comment.

Shopify is giving its merchants a slew of new AI-powered tools designed to help them enhance the online shopping experience for their customers. This includes an AI store builder for users to set up storefronts using a single prompt, as well as an AI generator for creating elements (such as banners) without knowing how to code. 

The platform also upgraded Sidekick, its AI commerce assistant, with new voice chat and screen sharing capabilities. 

These updates were announced on Wednesday during Shopify's Edition launch day, the company's biannual announcement that showcases recent changes to the platform.

The goal of the AI store builder is to create the foundation of a website quickly, so there's more time for personalization. To use the tool, users first have to enter a prompt that describes their brand. For example, “tennis gear and stylish athleisure.” Shopify's AI then generates a ready-to-launch storefront, and merchants can then manually customize their store within the editor.

Shopify also introduced a new public theme called “Horizon” in its Theme Store, a marketplace for downloading pre-designed templates. 

Horizon includes a built-in AI to assist merchants in adjusting their designs as they wish. It's also the first theme to include “Theme Blocks,” which are essentially building blocks that merchants can use to customize how their online store looks without touching any code. 

These theme blocks can also be further customized with the help of AI. For example, if the merchant wants a banner with text and an animation, they can describe it or share an image for inspiration, and it generates the code for them to copy into the editor. They also can generate images. 

Additionally, users can now engage in voice chat with Sidekick, which responds audibly to questions. For example, if merchants are confused about tariffs — a hot topic for retailers right now — Sidekick will direct them to a tariff guide that provides U.S. rates for different types of products. Users can also screen share with Sidekick to navigate features, such as finding the settings.

Alongside these new capabilities, Sidekick is now available in the Shopify mobile app.

Sidekick was rolled out widely to all merchants in December 2024. According to the company, monthly users have more than doubled since the beginning of 2025, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

Shopify's continued investment in AI shouldn't be unexpected. In CEO Tobi Lütke's recent memo to staff, he suggested that AI may help the company maintain a smaller workforce.

A woman from Kansas has sued a number of porn websites after her teenage son found her old laptop in a closet and used it to visit the explicit sites. According to the lawsuit, the sites in question failed to institute appropriate guardrails to keep young users away from the adult content.

404 Media originally reported on the litigation, which was filed with the help of The National Center on Sexual Exploitation Law Center (NCOSE), an organization that focuses on a variety of sex crimes, including sex trafficking and child sexual abuse material. The suit lists as defendants Chaturbate.com, Jerkmate.com, Titan Websites, and Techpump Solutions (also known as Superporn.com). A statement from NCOSE explains the mother's grievances thusly:

Q.R. is a 14-year-old minor child who resides in Kansas with his mother, Jane Doe. Jane Doe was vigilant in monitoring Q.R.'s devices to prevent his exposure to harmful material during this important developmental stage of his life. However, on August 12, 2024, Q.R. found an old laptop that was stored forgotten in a closet.  Unfortunately for Q.R., it was still in working condition. Q.R., using this old laptop, was able to access the internet and began searching for hardcore pornography.

The lawsuit hinges on the claim that the sites should have instituted age-verification mechanisms to comply with a recently passed Kansas law that mandates authentication for adult sites. A statement from the NCOSE claims that the litigation represents the “first lawsuits filed in the U.S. that challenge alleged violators of age verification laws.”

“It is unreasonably dangerous for these pornography websites to provide this product which they know is harmful to children, that children are drawn to access, and do access, without employing age verification as required by Kansas law. Our plaintiff deserves every measure of justice,” a statement from the NCOSE says.

Gizmodo reached out to the defendants, with the exception of Titan Websites, as it wasn't immediately clear how to contact the company.

The NCOSE's website shows it has also assisted with lawsuits against XVideos, another prominent porn site, as well as against Twitter, which it accuses of breaking a federal sex trafficking statute.

The modern anti-porn movement has popped up in mostly conservative states and has sought to highlight the harmful psychological impact that pornography may have on young people. Over the past decade, more than a dozen states have passed age-verification laws designed to curb youth access to porn, much of which is still being challenged in court. It's unclear how effective these laws can actually be, since using a VPN should presumably allow a user to pretend as if they are accessing the websites from a location that is unregulated by such laws.

Dario Amodei's AI safety contingent was growing disquieted with some of Sam Altman's behaviors. Shortly after OpenAI's Microsoft deal was inked in 2019, several of them were stunned to discover the extent of the promises that Altman had made to Microsoft for which technologies it would get access to in return for its investment. The terms of the deal didn't align with what they had understood from Altman. If AI safety issues actually arose in OpenAI's models, they worried, those commitments would make it far more difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the models' deployment. Amodei's contingent began to have serious doubts about Altman's honesty.

“We're all pragmatic people,” a person in the group says. “We're obviously raising money; we're going to do commercial stuff. It might look very reasonable if you're someone who makes loads of deals like Sam, to be like, ‘All right, let's make a deal, let's trade a thing, we're going to trade the next thing.' And then if you are someone like me, you're like, ‘We're trading a thing we don't fully understand.' It feels like it commits us to an uncomfortable place.”

This was against the backdrop of a growing paranoia over different issues across the company. Within the AI safety contingent, it centered on what they saw as strengthening evidence that powerful misaligned systems could lead to disastrous outcomes. One bizarre experience in particular had left several of them somewhat nervous. In 2019, on a model trained after GPT‑2 with roughly twice the number of parameters, a group of researchers had begun advancing the AI safety work that Amodei had wanted: testing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) as a way to guide the model toward generating cheerful and positive content and away from anything offensive.

But late one night, a researcher made an update that included a single typo in his code before leaving the RLHF process to run overnight. That typo was an important one: It was a minus sign flipped to a plus sign that made the RLHF process work in reverse, pushing GPT‑2 to generate more offensive content instead of less. By the next morning, the typo had wreaked its havoc, and GPT‑2 was completing every single prompt with extremely lewd and sexually explicit language. It was hilarious—and also concerning. After identifying the error, the researcher pushed a fix to OpenAI's code base with a comment: Let's not make a utility minimizer.

In part fueled by the realization that scaling alone could produce more AI advancements, many employees also worried about what would happen if different companies caught on to OpenAI's secret. “The secret of how our stuff works can be written on a grain of rice,” they would say to each other, meaning the single word scale. For the same reason, they worried about powerful capabilities landing in the hands of bad actors. Leadership leaned into this fear, frequently raising the threat of China, Russia, and North Korea and emphasizing the need for AGI development to stay in the hands of a US organization. At times this rankled employees who were not American. During lunches, they would question, Why did it have to be a US organization? remembers a former employee. Why not one from Europe? Why not one from China?

During these heady discussions philosophizing about the long‑term implications of AI research, many employees returned often to Altman's early analogies between OpenAI and the Manhattan Project. Was OpenAI really building the equivalent of a nuclear weapon? It was a strange contrast to the plucky, idealistic culture it had built thus far as a largely academic organization. On Fridays, employees would kick back after a long week for music and wine nights, unwinding to the soothing sounds of a rotating cast of colleagues playing the office piano late into the night.

The shift in gravity unsettled some people, heightening their anxiety about random and unrelated incidents. Once, a journalist tailgated someone inside the gated parking lot to gain access to the building. Another time, an employee found an unaccounted‑for USB stick, stirring consternation about whether it contained malware files, a common vector of attack, and was some kind of attempt at a cybersecurity breach. After it was examined on an air‑gapped computer, one completely severed from the internet, the USB turned out to be nothing. At least twice, Amodei also used an air‑gapped computer to write critical strategy documents, connecting the machine directly to a printer to circulate only physical copies. He was paranoid about state actors stealing OpenAI's secrets and building their own powerful AI models for malicious purposes.

“No one was prepared for this responsibility,” one employee remembers. “It kept people up at night.”

Altman himself was paranoid about people leaking information. He privately worried about Neuralink staff, with whom OpenAI continued to share an office, now with more unease after Elon Musk's departure. Altman worried, too, about Musk, who wielded an extensive security apparatus including personal drivers and bodyguards. Keenly aware of the capability difference, Altman at one point secretly commissioned an electronic countersurveillance audit in an attempt to scan the office for any bugs that Musk may have left to spy on OpenAI.

To employees, Altman used the specter of US adversaries advancing AI research faster than OpenAI to rationalize why the company needed to be less and less open while working as fast as possible. “We must hold ourselves responsible for a good outcome for the world,” he wrote in his vision document. “On the other hand, if an authoritarian government builds AGI before we do and misuses it, we will have also failed at our mission—we almost certainly have to make rapid technical progress in order to succeed at our mission.”

In the author's note at the beginning of the book, Karen Hao notes, “I reached out to all of the key figures and companies that are described in this book to seek interviews and comment. OpenAI and Sam Altman chose not to cooperate.” Hao also attempted to reach Elon Musk for comment and got no response.

The man who died after authorities say he bombed a Palm Springs, California, fertility clinic on Saturday was linked to antinatalism—the belief that all life is a form of suffering imposed on people without their consent—according to terrorism experts who have been analyzing his online presence.

Authorities say Guy Bartkus, who was 25, set off an explosion in a car outside American Reproductive Centers, injuring five people and killing himself as well as causing extensive damage to the building in an act of terrorism.

“The subject had nihilistic ideations, and this was a targeted attack,” said Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, in a press conference. Bartkus was attempting to livestream the attack, Davis added. All embryos in the facility were saved.

Since the attack, Bartkus' digital footprint has surfaced, including writings and recordings of his views. According to the LAist, Bartkus appeared to describe himself as being promortalist and misandrist on a website that surfaced after the bombing and could be heard in an audio recording saying, “Basically I'm anti-life.  And IVF is like kind of the epitome of pro-life ideology.” He did not use his name on the site, but analysts from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) believe the website was operated by him. WIRED has viewed an archived version of the website.

Reddit has also banned the antinatalist subreddit r/Efilism, telling NBC News it was removing “any instances of the suspect's manifesto or recordings and hashing to prevent reupload.” Efilism, a form of antinatalism also linked to promortalism, gets its name by spelling “life” backward.

Nihilists believe that life is meaningless. While promortalists and antinatalists also don't value human life, Katherine Keneally, US director of threat analysis and prevention for the ISD, says Bartkus' views were somewhat distinct from nihilism because of his belief he was on a mission.

“Promortalists recognize and seek to minimize suffering rather than embrace misanthropy and amorality,” Keneally says, noting that the writings attributed to Bartkus indicate he rejected the “sociopath[ic] tendencies of nihilists” in a May 2025 forum post. Keneally says part of minimizing suffering, in the eyes of an antinatalist, is reducing the human population.

In a recording of the aforementioned website, Bartkus reportedly said, “ I am angry that I exist, um, and that, uh, you know, nobody got my consent to bring me here.”

Keneally says the suspect's statements and social media posts indicate the bombing was motivated by promortalism, as he may have thought targeting a fertility clinic was preventing new life. ISD analysts don't believe promortalism has been a primary motivator of violence in previous cases it's been linked to, she adds.

The bombing comes over a week after ISD released a report about how nihilistic worldviews are fueling violence in the US and Europe. The report found that two prominent nihilistic subcultures, True Crime Community and No Lives Matter, were linked by authorities to nine school shooting plots and two Swedish stabbing attacks in 2024.

True Crime Community adherents fawn over school shooters, but rather than focus on their motivations, the fixation is on their personal characteristics, the report says.

“We'll see young girls and young women in these communities online that will create memes and images of shooters with hearts around them, adding their last name to theirs,” Keneally says.

Meanwhile, the No Lives Matter camp seeks to replicate violent attacks, often stabbings, to “supercharge the spread of these ideas through memes, images, clips of music or even color schemes,” the report adds. The No Lives Matter movement also intersects with Satanism and has ties to the 764 network, which is known for luring children into sextortion.

According to the ISD report, the disorganized and ever-changing nature of nihilist ideologies makes it harder to understand and counter.

“Those who carry out nihilistic violence are not seeking to change society or promote a specific ideological outcome,” the report says. “Instead, perpetrators of these attacks are deeply enmeshed in subcultures that share misanthropic and nihilistic worldviews, promote anti-social behavior and encourage violence as an outlet for their emotions and personal struggles.”

The report points to a manifesto left behind by the Madison, Wisconsin school shooter in December, which was called “War Against Humanity,” as an example of nihilistic-fueled violence.

Keneally says people who get wrapped up in these beliefs skew younger; mental illness can also be a predictor. On the website believed to be linked to Bartkus, he said he had borderline personality disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by impulsive behavior and difficulty regulating one's emotions.

She said in Bartkus' case, the fact that he posted videos of himself making bombs on YouTube and posted on a pro-suicide forum suggests that there were warning signs that could have been flagged prior to the bombing.

“There were signals that could have potentially served as a way to disrupt this attack,” she claims.

A trio of Apex Storage's new X16 Gen5 add-in cards loaded with 32 Phison E28 Gen5 M.2 SSDs were behind the feat.

Phison has been showcasing its data storage innovations at Computex 2025. Of particular interest, we attended a partner demo where the firm utilized 32 of its latest and greatest PCIe Gen5 SSDs in a RAID setup. During the demo, we saw CrystalDiskMark report data transfer rates as high as 113.6 GB/s for reads, and 104.6 GB/s for writes.



This demonstration of extraordinary speed was enabled by a powerful modern workstation PC and a mix of cutting-edge storage components. Specifically, Phison utilized an AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7978WX CPU, installed on an Asus Pro WS WRX90E-Sage SE motherboard, as the foundation of the system.

The storage subsystem consisted of 32 of Phison's potent new E28 Gen5 SSDs installed across a trio of Apex Storage X16 Gen5 add-in cards. All these components were installed in a sweet-looking be quiet! chassis, as you can see.

Phison's new E28 Gen5 SSD rubs shoulders with the best in consumer mid-2025 PC land. A single E28 Gen5 in a modern PC will be able to deliver data transfer speeds of up to 14.8 GB/s reads and 14.0 GB/s writes. The Phison E28 Gen5 is being marketed as “the weapon of choice for serious gaming and productivity,” so it is definitely targeting consumers. Its controller features a quad-CPU architecture, is fabbed on TSMC's 6nm node, and supports up to 32 TB.



Here we had 32 of Phison's new E28 Gen5 SSDs; however, each Apex Storage X16 Gen5 add-in card can fit 16 M.2 SSDs (there's a clue in the name), so two would have sufficed for a 32x SSD demo. We guess three cards were installed for optimal performance, load balancing, or another nuance of the Threadripper-powered Windows system.

The storage performance in this setup seems remarkable. Witnessed data transfer rates as high as 113.6 GB/s for reads, and 104.6 GB/s for writes might seem amazing. However, it was confirmed by a Phison rep that the Windows kernel was actually holding back performance.

Apex Storage's new X16 Gen5 add-in card features the PM584 Microchip switch that has 84 lanes, claimed to support the full 16 M.2 at full bandwidth. We were told each X16 Gen5 card also has a limit of 128TB of addressable storage, at this time (that would require using 32x 4TB drives).

Amadou Sow woke to the shrieking of smoke detectors. It was a little after 2:30 am on August 5, 2020, and his house in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, was ablaze. The 46-year-old rushed to his bedroom door, but a column of smoke and heat forced him back. Panicked, Sow ran to the rear window, broke the screen with his hand, and jumped. The two-story drop fractured his left foot.

Sow's wife Hawa Ka woke their daughter Adama, who shared their room. She dragged the terrified 10-year-old to the window and pushed her out. Sow tried to catch her but missed. Miraculously, the girl landed on her hands and feet, uninjured. Then it was Ka's turn. When she leaped, she fell on her back, shattering her spine in two places. Sow barely heard her howls of pain. He was thinking about their 22-year-old son, Oumar.

He couldn't see any movement inside Oumar's room. He hurled a rock at the window, but the glass held steady. Despair filled him. Then he noticed Oumar's car wasn't in the driveway. He must be working his night shift at 7-Eleven. Thank God! Sow's family was safe. But what about the others in the house? All told, nine people called 5312 Truckee Street home.

Sow had bought the four-bedroom property in the northeastern suburb of Green Valley Ranch in 2018. The neighborhood was newly built and sparsely populated, cut off from the bulk of the city by miles of prairie grass, giving it an isolated, ghost-town feel. But for Sow, a Senegalese immigrant who usually worked nights at Walmart, the home was a refuge. Not long after his family moved in, his old friend Djibril Diol's family joined them. Diol—Djiby to his friends—was 29 and a towering 6'8", a civil engineer who hoped to one day take his skills back to Senegal.

The first fire truck arrived at 2:47 am. By then, the inferno had shattered the windows and plumed the air with smoke. The stench of burning wood filled the neighborhood. When firefighters subdued the blaze enough to get in the front door, they found the small body of a child. Djiby's daughter Khadija had been two months shy of her second birthday. Farther in sprawled Djiby himself and his 23-year-old wife, Adja.

Next to Adja lay Djiby's 25-year-old sister, Hassan. She'd only been living in the house for three months. Like Adja, she had dreamed of going back to school to study nursing. She died with her arms still wrapped around her 7-month-old daughter, Hawa Beye. Medical examiners would later conclude that all five died of smoke inhalation, airways coated in black soot, internal organs and muscles burnished “cherry-red” from the heat.

At the same time firefighters were entering the house on Truckee Street, Neil Baker, a homicide detective for the Denver Police Department (DPD), was awoken by a call from his sergeant. Baker—in his fifties with reading glasses, thinning hair, and a rosy complexion—threw on a suit, muttered a hurried goodbye to his wife, and jumped in his car.

After nearly 30 years as a Denver-area cop, Baker knew his way around town. He also knew that Green Valley Ranch was a confusing rabbit's warren of nearly identical roads. So before he set off, he did something innocuous, something anyone might have done: He Googled the address. And like anyone who Googles something, he was thinking about the search result he wanted—not the packets of data flitting between his device and Google's servers, not the automated logs of what he was searching for and where he was searching from. But this unseen infrastructure would be key to figuring out what happened at Truckee Street—and it may soon extend the reach of law enforcement into the private lives of millions.

Three weeks before the fire, 16-year-old Kevin Bui went into central Denver to buy a gun. Bui had led a charmed life. His family emigrated from Vietnam before he was born, and though they struggled financially at first—Bui describes his childhood homes as “the projects”—by the time he started high school, his dad's accounting business had taken off. The family moved to a palatial house in Lakewood, on Denver's western outskirts, complete with views of the mountains. Bui took to wearing Gucci belts and Air Jordans.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

“I disliked school, but I was always really good at it,” Bui tells me. He was athletic too—a swimmer, and an inside linebacker on his school football team, the Green Mountain Rams. He was close with his older sister, Tanya, despite their seven-year age difference. Tanya filled Kevin's girlfriend's lashes and bitched to him about her boyfriends. The siblings discussed adopting a dog together.

But there was a darker side to their life: Kevin and Tanya dealt fentanyl and marijuana, often finding customers on Snapchat. Kevin planned to start “carding,” stealing people's credit card information on the dark web. And he took to amassing weapons.

The guys Bui had arranged to meet in central Denver on that day in July had promised to sell him a gun. Instead, they robbed him of his cash, iPhone, and shoes.

Afterward, Bui bubbled with humiliation. A few weeks earlier, football practice had shut down because of the pandemic. Classes had already been virtual for months. He felt he was “just doing bullshit”: waking up, logging on to Zoom, and returning to bed. The robbery tipped him over the edge. That night, at home in Lakewood, Bui resolved to get even. He pulled up the Find My device feature on his iPad and watched as it pinged his phone. The map zoomed east, past downtown, finally halting at Green Valley Ranch. A pin dropped at 5312 Truckee Street.

The next afternoon, Bui sent a Snapchat message to his friend Gavin Seymour. “I deserved that shit cuz I knew it would happen and still went,” he wrote, according to later court records. “They goin get theirs like I got mine.”

Bui and Seymour ran track together and lived just a four-minute drive apart. But in many ways they were opposites. Where Bui oozed confidence, Seymour was plagued by insecurity. Where Bui excelled academically, Seymour struggled with multiple learning disabilities. In contrast to Bui's apparently cookie-cutter-perfect family life, Seymour's parents split when he was young, and his father was largely absent.

In response to Bui's message, Seymour wrote: “idk why I would let you go alone I'm sorry for that.”

Bui wrote back: “I cant even be mad cuz we used to do the same shit to random niggas.”

But he was mad. More to the point, he was disgraced, his self-image—as a winner, a champ, top dog—shattered. A week later, Bui searched the Truckee Street address 13 times, including on sites like Zillow that detailed its interior layout. And he persuaded Seymour, who was just about to turn 16, and another friend, 14-year-old Dillon Siebert, to help him exact revenge. In late July, Seymour and Siebert also searched the address multiple times.

Bui would later insist they'd planned to simply vandalize the house: hurl rocks at the windows, maybe, or egg the exterior. But sometime in those last hot days of July, things took a darker turn. On August 1, Bui messaged Seymour: “#possiblyruinourfuturesandburnhishousedown.”

Three evenings later, Siebert and Bui went to Party City to buy black theater masks, then grabbed dinner at Wendy's. They met up with Seymour, and at around 1 am on August 5 the three piled into Bui's Toyota Camry. They stopped at a gas station, where they filled a red fuel canister to the brim. Then they set off for Green Valley Ranch, cruising past downtown and the Broncos stadium and through an industrial area dotted with smokestacks and semitrailers. The drive took at least 30 minutes, long and boring enough for any one of the teens to express doubt, postpone, chicken out. But it seemed none of them did, not even when they got to 5312 Truckee and saw a minivan—a family vehicle—parked out front.

They found the house's back door unlocked. It's not clear who doused the gas on the living room walls and floors or who set the flame. When it caught, all three stumbled out to Bui's car and took off.

When Detective Baker arrived at 5312 Truckee Street two hours later, neighbors swarmed the street, their faces lit by the glow of the flames. The air tasted like ash. He spotted Ernest Sandoval, his partner on the case. Sandoval, nearly 15 years younger than Baker, had moved to homicide from the nonfatal shootings unit only a few weeks earlier.

The officers on the scene told the pair that there could be as many as five fatalities. They suspected faulty wiring had sparked the blaze. It was terrible, tragic—but at least homicide's job would be straightforward. “We'll have some reports to write,” Baker remembers thinking. “We'll have to probably go to the autopsies.” Then a man with melancholy eyes and a faint soul patch approached him. “I have something you should see,” he said. Noe Reza Jr. lived next door. He took out his phone, which held footage from his security cameras.

The video clips started at 2:26 am. They showed three figures in hoodies and masks stealing through the side yard of 5312 Truckee. One points toward the rear of the house. Then they move out of the camera's sight. Twelve minutes later, the trio sprint back toward the street. At 2:40, flames erupt from the home's lower floor. Someone screams. The fire consumes the entire house within two minutes.

“Oh, are you kidding me,” Baker thought. Five people had been murdered and their only lead was a few seconds of video that revealed nothing of the criminals' identity.

That morning, Kevin Bui slept in. Around 10 am, he searched online for news of the fire. There was an abundance. The tragedy had sparked headlines and Twitter threads across the world. The Council on American Islamic Relations issued a statement urging police to consider religious hate as a potential motive. Leaders of Colorado's African community expressed fear, wondering which of their members might be targeted next. Even Senegal's president tweeted he'd be watching the case closely.

That's when the truth began to dawn on Bui. Like many people, he had assumed that Apple's Find My device software offers exact location tracking. But such programs rely on an unreliable combination of signals from GPS satellites, cell towers, Wi-Fi networks, and other connected devices nearby, and their accuracy can vary from a few feet to hundreds of miles. In the past, this ambiguity has led to threats, holdups, and even SWAT raids at the wrong addresses. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment.)

As he read the news that morning, Bui realized that he had made a terrible mistake. These innocent faces didn't belong to the guys who had robbed him. He'd killed a family.

That August, Denver's usually crystalline skies were choked with wildfire smoke. Baker and Sandoval barely noticed. They spent their waking hours in DPD's 1970s-era HQ, with its fluorescent lighting and gumball machines in the lobby.

The pair had begun their investigation with the usual stuff: interviewing the victims' friends and family, combing through text messages and financial records. The more they dug, the clearer it became that the families of 5312 Truckee lived quiet, pious lives: work, mosque, home.

The detectives returned to video footage. On clips pieced together from nearby Ring cameras, they saw the car the suspects were in taking a series of wrong turns as it entered the neighborhood, and wildly swerving and mounting curbs on the way out. But the videos weren't clear enough to identify the exact make or model of the dark four-door sedan. The detectives quickly obtained what are known as tower dump warrants, which required the major phone networks to provide the numbers of all cellular devices in the vicinity of 5312 Truckee during the arson. And they slung a series of so-called geofence warrants at Google, asking the company to identify all devices within a defined area just before the fire. (At the time, Google collected and retained location data if someone had an Android device or any Google applications on their cell phone.)

The warrants returned thousands of phone numbers, which the detectives dumped on Mark Sonnendecker, an agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) who specialized in digital forensics. Sonnendecker, slim and soft-spoken with a face resembling Bill Nye's, focused on T-Mobile subscribers. He had noticed that a “high percentage” of suspects in previous cases subscribed to the network.

There were 1,471 devices registered to T-Mobile within a mile of the house when it ignited. Using software that visualizes how long it takes a signal to bounce from a cell tower to a phone and back again, Sonnendecker narrowed the list down to the 100 devices nearest to the house. One evening toward the end of August, detectives roamed the area around 5312 Truckee with a cell-phone-tower simulator that captured the IDs of all devices within range. That night, there were 723. Sonnendecker cross-referenced these with the 100 from earlier, eliminating the 67 that showed up on both lists and likely belonged to neighborhood residents who could be ruled out. That left 33 T-Mobile subscribers whose presence in Green Valley Ranch in the early hours of August 5 couldn't easily be explained.

Investigators considered bringing them in for questioning but decided against it; without any evidence to detain them, they feared spooking the arsonists into fleeing the country. Nothing pointed to any obvious suspects. Still, Sonnendecker remained confident that something would pop up to give police the breakthrough they needed.

But as summer turned to fall, progress on the case began to falter. Hundreds of Crime Stoppers tips were still pouring in, including some from psychics. Baker and Sandoval crisscrossed the state to interrogate a trio found with drugs, guns, and masks in Gypsum and to interview the Senegalese community in the mountain town of Silverthorne. (For decades, West Africans had found work in the ski hub's many resorts, hotels, and grocery stores.) They even chased a lead to Iowa. “We got pretty hopeful here and there, but it just kind of fizzled out,” recalls Baker.

The detectives were feeling the pressure. In the wake of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests that summer, a petition demanding police stop “undervaluing the lives of BIPOC individuals” and prioritize the investigation into the deaths of the Diol family collected nearly 25,000 signatures. Baker and Sandoval were told not to take on any new cases so they could work this one full time.

At a department meeting in September, Baker and Sandoval pleaded with colleagues for ideas. Was there anything they hadn't tried—anything at all? That's when another detective wondered if the perpetrators had Googled the address before heading there. Perhaps Google had a record of that search?

It was like a door they'd never noticed suddenly flung open. They called Sonnendecker and the district attorney, Cathee Hansen. Neither had heard of Google turning over a list of people who had searched for a specific term. In fact, it had been done: in a 2017 fraud investigation in Minnesota, after a series of bombings in Austin in 2018, in a 2019 trafficking case in Wisconsin, and a theft case in North Carolina the following year. Federal investigators also used a reverse keyword search warrant to investigate an associate of R. Kelly who attempted to intimidate a witness in the musician's racketeering and sexual exploitation trial. But those records had largely been sealed. So, unaware of these precedents, Hansen and Sandoval drafted their warrant from scratch, requesting names, birth dates, and physical addresses for all users who'd searched variations of 5312 Truckee Street in the 15 days before the fire.

Google denied the request. According to court documents, the company uses a staged process when responding to reverse keyword warrants to protect user privacy: First, it provides an anonymized list of matching searches, and if law enforcement concludes that any of those results are relevant, Google will identify the users' IP addresses if prompted by the warrant to do so. DPD's warrant had gone too far in asking for protected user information right away, and it took another failed warrant 20 days later and two calls with Google's outside legal counsel before the detectives came up with language the search giant would accept.

Finally, the day before Thanksgiving 2020, Sonnendecker received a list of 61 devices and associated IP addresses that had searched for the house in the weeks before the fire. Five of those IP addresses were in Colorado, and three of them had searched for the Truckee Street house multiple times, including for details of its interior. “It was like the heavens opened up,” says Baker.

In early December, DPD served another warrant to Google for those five users' subscriber information, including their names and email addresses. One turned out to be a relative of the Diols; another belonged to a delivery service. But there was one surname they recognized—a name that also appeared on the list of 33 T-Mobile subscribers they'd identified earlier in the investigation as being in the vicinity of the fire. Bui.

The phone was registered to Kevin's sister Tanya—he may have borrowed it after his was stolen. But a quick scan of the social media accounts of the remaining subscribers on the list yielded three suspects: Kevin Bui, Gavin Seymour, and Dillon Siebert. They were teens, they were friends, and they didn't live anywhere near Green Valley Ranch. They lived in the Lakewood area, 20 miles away. There was no reason for them to be Googling a residential address so far across town.

“There was a lot of high-fiving,” recalls Sandoval. But it was too soon to fully celebrate. They now had to build a case strong enough to prosecute minors in a high-profile homicide. “We knew this was going to be a big, big, big fight,” Baker says.

On New Year's Day of 2021, Baker drove by the Bui family's home and snapped a photo of the 2019 Toyota Camry sitting in the driveway. Another warrant to Google yielded the three teens' search histories since early July. In the days before the fire, Siebert searched for retailer “Party City.” On Party City's website, Baker spotted masks similar to those worn by the three perpetrators. The company confirmed that their Lakewood location had sold three such masks hours before the fire. Baker then contacted the shopping complex to get footage from the exterior security cameras that night. He saw that around 6 pm, a 2019 Toyota Camry pulled into the parking lot. “It just snowballed,” says Baker, shaking his head in remembered wonder. “I cannot believe the amount of evidence that we were able to come up with.”

From the teens' texts and social media, detectives were able to see that the morning after the arson, with the house on Truckee Street still smoldering, Bui and Seymour embarked on a camping trip. A week later, Bui went golfing. A few months after that, Seymour joined the Bui family on vacation in Cancun, where more smiling photos of the two emerged, this time on beaches and boats. The posts enraged the detectives. “Where's the remorse?” Baker said.

Shortly after 7 am on January 27, police arrested Bui, Seymour, and Siebert. Seymour and Siebert refused to talk, but Bui agreed to an interview and promptly confessed. “He'd had six months of just keeping this inside,” said Baker. “He knew that his time had come.”

For the next 18 months, the case dragged through the court system. It took a year for a judge to rule that Siebert, 14 at the time of the crime, would be charged as a juvenile, while 16-year-olds Bui and Seymour would be tried as adults. If convicted, they faced life in prison.

In June 2022, just when it seemed like the prosecution could finally proceed, Seymour's lawyers dropped a bombshell. They filed a motion to suppress all evidence arising from the reverse keyword search warrant that DPD had served to Google—the key piece of information that had led detectives to Bui and his friends.

Nearly two years had passed since the Diols were killed in their own home. Many of the victims' family and friends still moved through their days fearfully and lay awake nights, reliving the nightmare. Now, the detectives had to tell them that the case might be thrown out altogether, potentially allowing the three teens to walk free.

Seymour's defense argued that, in asking Google to comb through billions of users' private search history, investigators had cast an unconstitutional “digital dragnet.” It was, they said, the equivalent of police ransacking every home in America. The Fourth Amendment required police to show probable cause for suspecting an individual before getting a warrant to search their information. In this case, police had no reason to suspect Seymour before seeing the warrant's results. But the judge sided with law enforcement. He likened the search to looking for a needle in a haystack: “The fact that the haystack may be big, the fact that the haystack may have a lot of misinformation in it doesn't mean that a targeted search in that haystack somehow implicates overbreadth,” he said.

The teens' fate looked sealed. Then, in January 2023, Seymour's lawyers announced that the Colorado Supreme Court had agreed to hear their appeal. It would be the first state supreme court in America to address the constitutionality of a keyword warrant. Though the verdict would apply only in Colorado, it would influence law enforcement's behavior in other states, and potentially the US Department of Justice's stance on such warrants too.

Baker and Sandoval's investigation had now been dragged into a legal process that could reshape Americans' right to search and learn online without fear of retribution. “Even a single query can reveal deeply private facts about a person, things they might not share with friends, family, or clergy,” wrote Seymour's legal team. “‘Psychiatrists in Denver;' ‘abortion providers near me;' ‘is my husband gay;' ‘does God exist;' ‘bankruptcy;' ‘herpes treatment' … Search history is a window into what people wonder about—and it is some of the most private data that exists.”

The Colorado Supreme Court heard arguments for the case in May 2023. Seymour's attorney argued that reverse keyword searches were alarmingly similar to geofence warrants, which courts across the country had begun to question. (In August 2024, a federal circuit court of appeals—considered the most influential courts in the United States after the Supreme Court—ruled geofence warrants “unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment” for never specifying a particular user.)

Denver's DA, Cathee Hansen—who'd helped detectives craft the warrant in question nearly three years earlier—compared it to querying a bank for suspicious transactions. “You don't go into each person's account and scroll through their transaction history to see if it applies to that account,” she said. “You just tap into a database.” Neither search violated any individual's privacy, she argued.

The judges pushed Hansen on the warrant's applicability to abortion, outlawed in a growing number of states. “I could see warrants coming in from one of those states to Colorado: Who searched for abortion clinics in Colorado?” said Justice Richard Gabriel. “Under your view, there'd be probable cause for that. That's a big concern.”

After a five-month wait that Sandoval remembers as “gut-wrenching,” the court finally ruled in October 2023. In a majority verdict, four judges decided the reverse keyword search warrant was legal—potentially opening the door to wider use in Colorado and beyond. The judges argued that the narrow search parameters and the performance of the search by a computer rather than a human minimized any invasion of privacy. But they also agreed the warrant lacked individualized probable cause—the police had no reason to suspect Seymour before they accessed his search history—rendering it “constitutionally defective.”

Because of the ruling's ambiguity, some agencies remain leery. The ATF's Denver office says it would only consider using a keyword warrant again if the search terms could be sufficiently narrowed, like in this case: to an address that few would have reason to search and a highly delimited time period. The crime would also have to be serious enough to justify the level of scrutiny that would follow, the ATF says.

Not everyone is so cautious. Baker and Sandoval regularly field calls from police across the country asking for a copy of their warrant. Baker himself is considering using it in another case. And a cottage industry of consultants that, until recently, helped police craft tower-dump warrants now trains them to requisition Google. No systemic data is being collected on how often reverse keyword warrants are being used, but Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director of digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation says it's possible that there have been hundreds of examples to date.

Meanwhile, another case—in which a keyword-search warrant was used to identify a serial rapist—is now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. If the warrant is upheld, as it was in Colorado, their use could accelerate nationwide. “Keyword warrants are dangerous tools tailor-made for political repression,” says Crocker. It's easy to envision Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requesting a list of everyone who searched “immigration lawyer” in a given area, for instance.

By the summer of 2024, all three teens had accepted plea deals: Siebert got 10 years in juvenile detention; Seymour got 40, and Kevin Bui 60, both in adult prison. Bui received the harshest sentence because he'd masterminded the arson. (He was also caught with 92 pills of fentanyl and a couple grams of methamphetamine in his sock while in detention.)

To the victims, none of it was enough. Amadou Beye, the husband of Hassan Diol and father of seven-month-old Hawa, addressed Bui directly at his sentencing. “I will never forget or forgive you for what you did to me,” he said. “You took me away from my wife, the most beautiful thing I had. You took me away from my baby that I will never have a chance to see.” A shudder ran through his tall body. Beye had been in Senegal awaiting a visa when his family was killed. His daughter was born in America, and he never got to meet her.

Bui remained expressionless throughout the victim impact testimonies, save for a furiously bobbing Adam's apple. Peach fuzz darkened his now 20-year-old jaw. He wore a green jumpsuit, clear-framed glasses, and white shoes. At the end, he read from a crumpled sheet of yellow ruled paper. “I was an ignorant knucklehead blinded by rage. I'm a failure who threw his life away,” he said. “I have no excuses and nobody to blame but myself.”

But when I talked to Bui three months later, he sounded upbeat. “When you go to prison there's a lifeline,” he told me. Monday through Friday, he took classes on personal growth and emotional intelligence. Aside from that, “I just work out, I chill with some of the guys. We eat together, watch TV, watch sports,” he said. He tried to catch every Denver Broncos and Baltimore Ravens game. Lately, he'd also gotten into Sex and the City.

Not once did Bui complain about the lack of privacy in prison or his exile from the outside world, both physical and digital. Prisoners had little internet access, which, for someone of his generation, who'd grown up online, must have been hard. Did he know who he was without his iPhone, his Snapchat and Instagram? Who were any of us really, without our online personas, our memes and TikToks and the access to the entirety of human knowledge afforded by our devices? As Seymour's lawyers had argued, didn

Well, that didn't go well. After enduring two hours of nonstop Gemini AI announcement after announcement at Google I/O, I waited one hour in the press lounge to get a chance to try out either a pair of Android XR smart glasses or Samsung's Project Moohan mixed reality headset. Obviously, I went for the Android XR smart glasses to see how they compare to Meta's $10,000 Orion concept and Google Glass before it. Is Android XR the holy grail of smart glasses we've been waiting over a decade for? Unfortunately, Google only let me try them out for 90 seconds.

I was promised five minutes with the Android XR headset prototype and only had three minutes total, half of which a product rep spent explaining to me how the smart glasses worked. Ninety seconds in, I was told to tap on the right side of the glasses to invoke Gemini. The AI's star-shaped icon appeared in the right lens (this pair of Android XR glasses only had one tiny transparent display) slightly below its center point. I was instructed to just talk to Gemini. I turned around and looked at a painting hung on the wall and asked it what I was looking at, who painted it, and asked for the art style. Gemini answered confidently; I have no idea if the answers were correct. I looked over at a bookshelf and asked Gemini to tell me the names of the books—and it did. Then the rep used a phone that was paired to the glasses to load up Google Maps. He told me to look down at my feet, and I saw a small portion of a map; I looked back up, and there Gemini pulled up a turn-by-turn navigation.

Then the door to the 10 x 10-foot wooden box I was in slid open, and I was told I was done. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and honestly, I barely even got to get a sense for how well Gemini worked. The AI constantly spoke over the rep while he was explaining the Android XR demo to me. I'm not sure if it was a false activation or a bug or what. When I asked about the painting and books, I didn't need to keep tapping on the side of the glasses—Gemini kept listening and just switched gears. That part was neat.

Compared to Meta's Orion smart glasses—which are also a prototype concept at this stage—the Android XR glasses aren't even on the same level. You can see more and do more with Orion and through its waveguide lenses with silicon carbide. Orion runs multiple app windows, like Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and even has “holographic” games, like a Pong knockoff that you can play with another person wearing their own pair of the AR glasses. Versus Snapchat's latest AR “Spectacles” and their super narrow field of view, I'd say the Android XR prototype and its singular display might actually be better. If you're going to have less powerful hardware, lean into its strength(s).

I was promised 5 minutes with the Google Android XR smart glasses, but they only gave me 3 minutes, and half of that was explaining what they were and how they worked, so I actually only had 90 seconds to use Gemini on a painting on a wall, two books on a bookshelf, and the… pic.twitter.com/Ly60boX91G

As for the smart glasses themselves—they felt like any pair of thick sunglasses, and they felt relatively light. They did slide off my nose a bit, but that's only because I have a flat and wider Asian nose. They didn't appear to slip off the nose of my friend and Engadget arch-nemesis, Karissa Bell. (I'm just kidding; I love Karissa.) There was no way for me to check battery life in 90 seconds.

So that's my first impression of the first pair of Android XR smart glasses. It's not a lot, but also not nothing. Part of me is wondering why the hell Google chose to limit demo time like this. My spidey sense tells me that it may not be as far along as it appeared in the I/O keynote demo. What I saw feels like a better version of Google Glass, for sure, with the screen resembling a super-tiny heads-up display that's located in the center of the right lens instead of above your right eye on Glass. But with only 90 seconds, there's no way for me to form a firm opinion. I need to see a lot more, and what I saw was not even a sliver of a sliver. Google, you got my number—call me!

RDNA 4 for professionals


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has been busy at Computex 2025, where the chipmaker unveiled the exciting Radeon RX 9060 XT and the Ryzen Threadripper 9000 series. To cap off its series of announcements, AMD is thrilled to introduce the Radeon AI Pro R9700, a PCIe 5.0 graphics card designed specifically for professional and workstation users.

RDNA 4 is an architecture geared towards gaming, but that doesn't mean AMD can't apply it to professional-grade graphics cards. For instance, RDNA 3 saw the mainstream Radeon RX 7000 series successfully coexisting with the Radeon Pro W7000 series. The same situation will occur with RDNA 4. AMD has already unveiled four RDNA 4-powered gaming graphics cards, yet the Radeon AI Pro R9700 is the first RDNA 4 professional graphics card to enter the market. The new workstation graphics card aims to replace the RDNA 3-powered Radeon Pro W7800, which has been faithfully catering to consumers since 2023.

The Radeon AI Pro R9700 utilizes the Navi 48 silicon. It's currently the largest RDNA 4 silicon to date, with a die size of 357 mm² and home to 53.9 billion transistors. Navi 48 is also found in the Radeon RX 9070 series. It's a substantially smaller silicon than the last-generation Navi 31 silicon, which is 529 mm² with 57.7 billion transistors. It's nothing short of impressive that Navi 48 is roughly 33% smaller but still has 93% of the transistors of Navi 31.

Navi 48, a product of TSMC's N4P (4nm) FinFET process node, adheres to a monolithic design. On the contrary, Navi 31 features an MCM (Multi-Chip Module) design, consisting of chiplets interconnected to a monolithic die. That's the reason why Navi 31 is so enormous. The GCD (Graphics Complex Die) alone measures 304.35 mm², whereas each of the six MCDs (Memory Cache Die) is 37.52 mm².

With Navi 48, AMD returned to a monolithic die and, with N4P's help, reduced the die size by 33%. Nonetheless, Navi 48 is up to 38% denser than Navi 31. The former has a density of 151 million transistors per mm², whereas the latter comes in at 109.1 million transistors per mm².

In terms of composition, the Navi 48 features 64 RDNA 4 Compute Units (CUs), which enable a maximum of 4,096 Streaming Processors (SPs). In contrast, the Navi 31 is equipped with 96 RDNA 3 CUs, for a total of 6,144 SPs. More CUs don't necessarily mean more performance since RDNA 4 delivers considerable generation-over-generation performance uplift over RDNA 3.

Regarding FP16 performance, the Radeon AI Pro R9700 peaks at 96 TFLOPS, 6% faster than the Radeon Pro W7800. AMD rates the graphics card with a 1,531 TOPS of AI performance.

AMD claims the Radeon AI Pro R9700 offers 2X improved performance over the Radeon Pro W7800 in DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 8B. For some strange reason, AMD compared the Radeon AI Pro R9700 to the GeForce RTX 5080. Tested in a few large AI models, the Radeon AI Pro R9700 delivered up to 5X higher performance than the RTX 5080.

The Radeon AI Pro R9700 is equipped with 32GB of GDDR6 memory and a 256-bit memory interface. This configuration results in a memory bandwidth of up to 640 GB/s, 11% more than the Radeon Pro W7800 32GB but 26% less than the Radeon Pro W7800 48GB. As for the Infinity Cache, the Radeon AI Pro R9700 still has 64MB, the same as the Radeon Pro W7800 32GB.

With 32GB of onboard memory, the Radeon AI Pro R9700 can tackle most AI models. It has the capacity of the Radeon Pro W7800, but not as much as the 48GB variant. The Radeon AI Pro R9700's typical blower-type design will enable users to rock up to four of them inside a single system, such as AMD's Ryzen Threadripper platform, which has good multi-GPU support. With four of them, users will have access to 128GB, more than enough for heavy models that exceed 100GB of VRAM usage.

The Radeon AI Pro R9700 has a 300W TBP (Total Board Power). It's 15% greater than the Radeon Pro W7800 32GB and 7% higher than the Radeon Pro W7800 48GB. Similar to most workstation-grade graphics cards, the Radeon AI Pro R9700 has the power connector at the rear. AMD has confirmed that the graphics card utilizes the 12V-2x6 power connector. The Radeon AI Pro R9700 renders illustrate the graphics card featuring four DisplayPort outputs. Since it uses the RDNA 4 architecture, these outputs should conform to the 2.1a standard.

AMD has announced that the Radeon AI Pro R9700 will launch in July, but it has not revealed pricing details. In contrast, the Radeon Pro W7800 debuted at $2,499 two years ago and has maintained most of its value, currently priced at $2,399. We will soon learn the price of the Radeon AI Pro R9700 as its launch approaches in just a couple of months. AMD anticipates a healthy supply of the Radeon AI Pro R9700 from its partners, including ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, XFX, and Yeston.

Moar Threadripping. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD announced its new Zen 5-powered Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-series and non-Pro processors here at Computex 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan, touting up to 96 cores and 192 threads in the flagship 9995WX. AMD's newest 'Shamida Peak' Threadrippers bring the benefits of the Zen 5 architecture to AMD's premier WX-Series workstation and non-Pro processors, saying they deliver up to 2.2X the performance in rendering than Intel's fastest competing Xeon-W chips.

AMD also revamped its non-Pro Ryzen Threadripper 9000-series chips, with the flagship 9980X HEDT chip wielding 64 cores and 128 threads. AMD's full Threadripper 9000 series will be available in July.

The Threadripper 9000 chips have much in common with their predecessors, the Threadripper 7000 series, with AMD continuing to split the chips into the Pro and HEDT swimlanes. The chips also have the same core counts, base clocks, and cache capacities (up to 384MB) as the prior-gen models across the range of the product stack, but the peak boost clocks have been bumped up to 5.4 GHz for all models, an increase ranging from 100 to 300 MHz. The TDP ratings also remain the same 350W for all models.

The processors provide up to 22% more performance than the prior-gen in threaded workloads, and the lion's share of their increased performance from the jump from the Zen 4 architecture to Zen 5, which imparts a 16% IPC gain, and the move from 5nm to 4nm for the compute dies.

AVX-512 support is also fully baked into the design, dramamatically improving performance in applications that utilize the dense instruction set. The chip also come with all of the same I/O connectivity as before, including up to 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, but memory support has been bumped up from DDR5-5200 to DDR5-6400. ECC is fully supported and AMD's Pro chips feature the AMD Pro Technolgies suite of RAS features.

As with all of AMD's Threadripper chips, these models have the same design as AMD's data center chips, in this case, the EPYC 'Turin' 9005 series, but come with special firmware and power tuning to optimize them for workstation platforms.

As you can see above, the chips have a large central 6nm I/O die flanked by rows of 4nm compute dies. With this generation, AMD has rotated the eight-core compute dies 90 degrees and arranged them into four vertical rows of three chips apiece, for a total of 12 compute dies with 96 cores for the flagship 9995WX. AMD removes four of those chips to create the 64-core 9980X, with further adjustments to the number of compute dies for the different models.

Both families of Threadripper 9000 chips will drop into the same sTR5 socket as the prior-gen chips. The WR90 platform with support for eight channels of memory will house the Pro chips, while value-optmized TRX50 boards with support for four channels of memory house the HEDT processors.

After a BIOS update, the new chips are compatible with existing motherboards. AMD expects a few new refreshed motherboard models from vendors, but it says the chips will largely leverage the existing ecosystem of sTR5 motherboards. As such, all of the existing sTR5 coolers on the market are fully compatible with the new processors.

AMD shared a few benchmarks to underline its performance superiority over Intel's Xeon-W lineup, but as with all vendor-provided benchmarks, take them with a grain of salt. We've included the full test notes below.

AMD claims the 96-core Threadripper 9995WX is 2.2X faster than Intel's 60-core flagship W9-3595X in the Cinebench multi-core rendering benchmark, an incredible lead. It's also 22% faster than the previous-gen 96-core Threadripper 7995WX.

AMD also shared a broader spate of benchmarks, with impressive gains ranging from 140% to 245% faster than the W9-3595X in a diverse set of real-world applications like media and entertainment, design and manufacturing, and LLM inference verticals, among others.

Overall AMD's Threadripper 9000 series appears poised to continue its utter dominance over Intel's competing workstation processors. AMD hasn't shared pricing yet, but given that its most affordable previous-gen HEDT model weighed in at $1,400 while the flagship retailed for $4,999, these chips will undoubtedly be pricey. As you'd expect, we'll have our own benchmarks coming around the time of launch in July.

If there's one thing the Federal Bureau of Investigation does well, it's mass surveillance. Several years ago, then attorney general William Barr established an internal office to curb the FBI's abuse of one controversial surveillance law. But recently, the FBI's long-time hater (and, ironically, current director) Kash Patel shut down the watchdog group with no explanation.

On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Patel suddenly closed the Office of Internal Auditing that Barr created in 2020. The office's leader, Cindy Hall, abruptly retired. People familiar with the matter told the outlet that the closure of the aforementioned watchdog group alongside the Office of Integrity and Compliance are part of internal reorganization. Sources also reportedly said that Hall was trying to expand the office's work, but her attempts to onboard new employees were stopped by the Trump administration's hiring freezes.

The Office of Internal Auditing was a response to controversy surrounding the FBI's use of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The 2008 law primarily addresses surveillance of non-Americans abroad. However, Jeramie Scott, senior counselor at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Gizmodo via email that the FBI “has repeatedly abused its ability to search Americans' communications ‘incidentally' collected under Section 702” to conduct warrantless spying.

Patel has not released any official comment regarding his decision to close the office. But Elizabeth Goitein, senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice, told Gizmodo via email, “It is hard to square this move with Mr. Patel's own stated concerns about the FBI's use of Section 702.”

Last year, Congress reauthorized Section 702 despite mounting concerns over its misuses. Although Congress introduced some reforms, the updated legislation actually expanded the government's surveillance capabilities. At the time, Patel slammed the law's passage, stating that former FBI director Christopher Wray, who Patel once tried to sue, “was caught last year illegally using 702 collection methods against Americans 274,000 times.” (Per the New York Times, Patel is likely referencing a declassified 2023 opinion by the FISA court that used the Office of Internal Auditing's findings to determine the FBI made 278,000 bad queries over several years.)

According to Goitein, the office has “played a key role in exposing FBI abuses of Section 702, including warrantless searches for the communication of members of Congress, judges, and protesters.” And ironically, Patel inadvertently drove its creation after attacking the FBI's FISA applications to wiretap a former Trump campaign advisor in 2018 while investigating potential Russian election interference. Trump and his supporters used Patel's attacks to push their own narrative dismissing any concerns. Last year, former representative Devin Nunes, who is now CEO of Truth Social, said Patel was “instrumental” to uncovering the “hoax and finding evidence of government malfeasance.”

Although Patel mostly peddled conspiracies, the Justice Department conducted a probe into the FBI's investigation that raised concerns over “basic and fundamental errors” it committed. In response, Barr created the Office of Internal Auditing, stating, “What happened to the Trump presidential campaign and his subsequent Administration after the President was duly elected by the American people must never happen again.”

But since taking office, Patel has changed his tune about FISA. During his confirmation hearing, Patel referred to Section 702 as a “critical tool” and said, “I'm proud of the reforms that have been implemented and I'm proud to work with Congress moving forward to implement more.” However, reforms don't mean much by themselves. As Goitein noted, “Without a separate office dedicated to surveillance compliance, [the FBI's] abuses could go unreported and unchecked.”

An annual transparency report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shows that the FBI's searches for Americans' information has fallen. Last year, the FBI only used 5,518 query terms about Americans, compared to 57,094 in 2023 and 119,383 in 2022. While this looks like progress, it doesn't mean that the Office of Internal Auditing's work is done.

“The FBI should maintain its audits,” Scott said, “and if they do, the FBI must make very clear who is responsible for continuing the internal audits and ensure the oversight gets done.”

Elon Musk gave an interview to Bloomberg News on Tuesday, appearing remotely to an audience at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha. And while the billionaire oligarch has given plenty of whiny and childish interviews over the years, his latest is one of the most juvenile to date.

Musk repeatedly insulted the interviewer for asking completely normal questions about his businesses like Tesla and SpaceX, and he became extremely defensive when asked about his role in President Donald Trump's government as the head of DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The billionaire oligarch even called the interviewer, UK broadcaster Mishal Husain, an “NPC,” meaning a non-playable character in a video game.

Musk started the interview absolutely indignant that Husain would ask him about what he was doing to “turn around” Tesla after sales have suffered around the globe. Musk answered “it's already turned around” and then fell silent as though that was sufficient as an explanation. Tesla's profits plunged 71% last quarter, but Musk kept insisting that everything was fine because the stock price had recovered.

As Musk kept trying to claim that Tesla's sales were fine, Husain pointed out that the EV company's brand had taken a hit. She didn't mention Musk's Nazi-style salutes on Jan. 20, but that, along with his role in the dismantling of the federal government, have caused many people to put bumper stickers on their Tesla cars that say things like, “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,” something Husain mentioned.

“There are also people who are buying it because Elon's crazy, or however they may view it,” Musk joked. “So yes, we've lost some sales perhaps on the left, but we've gained them on the right. The sales numbers at this point are strong. And we see no problem with demand.”

Musk then went on to insist that Tesla stock trading at all-time highs meant his company was in good shape and sales numbers were very good, finishing with “They're fine. Don't worry about it.”

It's difficult to explain just how juvenile Musk's attitude during the interview was to someone who hasn't seen the video, which is available in its entirety on YouTube. The billionaire snarked about a judge who ruled against him as an “activist judge who's cosplaying as a judge in a Halloween costume,” and whined about “activist investors” who didn't allow him to run his company like he wanted, segueing into how he was building “millions and potentially billions of humanoid robots.”

Musk also complained that he didn't like the questions Husain was asking, saying “now let's move on” twice in rapid succession as she tried to ask questions.

The billionaire often gave one-word responses to questions he didn't seem to like and paused for oddly long periods after some questions, seemingly gazing into space as he's sometimes known to do. There was an especially long pause when Musk was asked about whether he regretted getting involved in political work. He referred to the outrage over his destruction of the government as a “violent antibody reaction,” terminology he's used before.

“I'm not someone who's ever committed violence,” Musk said. “And yet, massive violence was committed against my companies. Massive violence was threatened against me. Who are these people? Why would they do that? How wrong can they be? They're on the wrong side of history.”

Again, Musk is the guy who kicked off Trump's second term by giving two Nazi-style salutes, so he doesn't really have a leg to stand on when it comes to the “right side of history.” But the billionaire said that it wasn't just the people who had attacked Tesla dealerships who should be afraid. He said they were going to prison and that anyone who “funded them and organized them will also go to prison.”

Musk then made a dramatic pointing gesture at the screen, seemingly talking about the Bloomberg journalist: “Don't worry. We're coming for you.” The line got a tremendous laugh from the Musk-friendly crowd in Qatar, a country he visited last week as Trump's buddy in oligarchy. In fact, Musk announced a new Starlink contract in Saudi Arabia, and the Washington Post has reported that countries are being pressured to buy Starlink services in some of the trade deals that are being negotiated.

When Tuesday's interview got into the topic of Musk's work in the government, including the ways that his companies have benefited, he got even more defensive. Having access to the inner workings of the federal government has hypothetically provided Musk with a unique look at highly proprietary information, the kind of things that are so secretive they're specifically exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests. Because if a government contractor knows exactly what both the government knows and his competitors know, he has a tremendous advantage.

Musk insisted that DOGE was just an advisor to the government, incapable of taking unilateral action or dictating to federal agencies what they should do. “We are not a dictator, we are advisors,” Musk said. This is contradicted by countless things Musk has said publicly on X and in cabinet meetings. In late February, for example, Musk stood up to talk about the things he was canceling and suggested that he alone gets to decide what gets funded. The billionaire was talking about his cuts within the context of all the mistakes that had been made, acknowledging that he was making mistakes but they were rectified.

“So for example, with USAID, one of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention,” Musk said at the February cabinet meeting. “I think we all want Ebola prevention. So we restored the Ebola prevention immediately. And there was no interruption. But we do need to move quickly if we're to achieve a $1 trillion deficit reduction in financial year 2026.”

The problem is that Musk isn't the one who should be making that call. Congress allocates funds for programs, and Musk and his DOGE crew have no right to cancel things unilaterally. The oligarch clearly knows that this mindset has gotten him into trouble and is now just lying about how things are operating behind closed doors.

Musk was also asked Tuesday about his thoughts on regulation of AI. The billionaire had rather infamously called for more regulation of AI and a complete pause on all research in 2023 while he was secretly working on his own AI behind the scenes. Musk said Tuesday that having too many regulations “was a natural consequence of prosperity,” saying that, “this has happened throughout history.”

“When you have an extended period of prosperity with no existential war, there's no cleansing function for unnecessary laws and regulations,” Musk said. That's obviously a rather unnerving thing for Americans to hear when you remember that Musk is both the wealthiest man in the world and a huge defense contractor.

Musk also went on a long tangent about how white people were supposedly being persecuted in South Africa, a conspiracy theory that was thrust into the spotlight when the AI chatbot Grok started responding to any random query on X with facts about it. Musk claimed that he couldn't get a license in South Africa to operate his Starlink service, but Husain pointed out “that looks like it's about to change.” Musk pestered Husain about whether it “seemed right” that he should be persecuted for his race as a white man, and Husain, who was not the one being interviewed, pointed out people wanted to hear his opinion, not hers.

“Why do you like racist laws?” Musk said repeatedly as he interruptted Husain.

Asked about whether DOGE would really cut $2 trillion in spending, since the numbers haven't materialized despite the immense destruction of critical scientific research and basic services, Musk again acted like a child, insisting that “your question is absurd.”

Musk went on to become frustrated with questions about DOGE and called Husain an “NPC” like other “conventional journalists” and said it was “like talking to a computer.”

Musk was also asked about USAID and recent comments from Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who criticized Musk for getting rid of the agency. Gates said the cuts would cost millions of lives, something backed up by research. Musk called Gates a “liar” and then said something about the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that's difficult to decipher.

“Who does Bill Gates think he is to make comments about the welfare of children given that he [unintelligible] Jeffrey Epstein?” Musk said to applause. “I wouldn't trust that guy to babysit my kids.”

Musk said that any “useful” functions of USAID had been transferred to the State Department, which is yet again not his choice to make. The billionaire went on to insist that HIV/AIDS programs, which had been cut, were actually going to continue, something that simply wasn't true.

Musk was also asked about his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and insisted he doesn't speak with him. Asked about that, Musk said, “I was on a video call with him about five years ago,” though the Wall Street Journal reported in late 2024 that he had been in “regular contact” with the Russian leader since 2022. Musk was aghast that his interviewer would believe something published in the Wall Street Journal, calling it “the worst newspaper in the world.”

Again, it's really worth watching the entire interview if you want to see just how big of a shitshow this was for Musk. But perhaps we're judging this interaction by older standards. Given the way that everything seems to have gone completely off the rails in the era of Trump, maybe this is just our new normal and we need to expect it. It's a depressing place to be as a country, that's for sure. But Musk clearly isn't going to start acting like an adult anytime soon.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm the head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU's Grossman School of Medicine in New York City. 

There is a huge controversy ongoing about Cincinnati Children's Hospital's decision not to put a 12-year-old girl on their heart transplant waiting list. The reason they didn't do it was thatshe has not been vaccinated against the flu and against COVID-19. 

This has led to a huge, angry backlash, part of the reason being that the young girl's mother, Jeneen Deal, is related by marriage to Vice President JD Vance's half-sibling, so she's part of a celebrity family. 

The couple — her parents — adopted her from China when she was 4, and they knew at the time that she had heart problems and was going to need a heart transplant. They've always taken her to Cincinnati because they believe that's the best place in their area for her to get care. They've had a long-standing, good relationship with the hospital, and I'm sure they're very angry that now they've got this challenge to getting her waitlisted to receive a heart. 

Those of you who know the heart transplant field know that for kids, it's tough to get a heart. It's very difficult because there are very few donors. That's partly because many of the donors for adults come from car accidents, gunshots, swimming pool accidents, that sort of thing. Younger children, happily,are not as likely to die in circumstances where they then become cadaver organ donors, so the organs are very scarce. 

What's going on? Well, the family says they don't want to vaccinate because it's against their religious beliefs. It's hard to know what those religious beliefs are because there are no major religions that oppose vaccination.All major religions — all that I'm familiar with — support vaccination as good for the individual to preserve their health and good for the community. 

What the hospital is doing in this situation has nothing to do with fights about whether a flu vaccine should be mandated or if schools can require vaccination.What's going on here is that when you get a heart transplant, you have to take immunosuppressive drugs immediately and for the rest of your life. 

They tune down your immune system and make you very vulnerable to infections such as the flu, and they make it very likely that you could die if you got the flu, COVID-19, or other infectious diseases that normally we might be able to survive without getting vaccinated.

The hospital is trying to be responsible and say that they don't want her to die if they transplant her. The way to maximize her chance of doing well with the heart is to give her vaccines, which will build up her immune system before they transplant her. 

That makes good sense to me. It also makes good sense to say that we don't want to waste a scarce heart on someone who's likely to get sick when other people are waiting in the queue — other kids not related to JD Vance — who are vaccinated and will do better. 

From a moral point of view, we want to steward the supply of scarce hearts responsibly and make sure they go to the child who's going to do the best with the heart and has the best chance at life. 

I do think it's right to say vaccination, in this instance, is something that the hospital really wants to see.It's medically indicated for this girl and anybody else on a waitlist anywhere for a transplant. That's not the same and shouldn't be mixed up with fights about mandatory vaccination to get into school. 

I think the hospital is asking for the right thing, and I hope that they stick to their guns on this oneand don't let misinformation or misunderstanding get in the way of doing what's best for the girl and doing what's best with the scarce supply of hearts. 

I'm Art Caplan, at the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Thanks for walking.

To effectively battle cancer, scientists must study the battlefield. Now, in a recent study published in Nature Communications, a multi-institutional research team including The University of Osaka has discovered some crucial intel: localized oxygen deficiency in the colon cancer microenvironment can promote tumor growth.

Until recently, oxygen deprivation, i.e., hypoxia, was thought to suppress tumor progression. Consequently, drugs that block the supply of oxygen to tumors were being used to treat cancers. However, these treatments achieved mixed results; sometimes, these drugs even accelerated tumor growth. Understanding why this happens has become an urgent question in cancer research.

We uncovered a surprising mechanism by which hypoxia may promote tumor growth, and it involves the formation of cells called inflammatory fibroblasts."

Akikazu Harada, lead author of the study

The research team found that when oxygen becomes scarce in certain areas of a colon tumor, the surrounding fibroblasts (normally 'good' cells that support tissue structure) transform into harmful inflammatory fibroblasts. The altered cells release factors that help tumors grow, such as epiregulin. In addition, they release Wnt5a protein, which helps maintain a low-oxygen state by inhibiting new blood-vessel formation at the site of its release, thereby maintaining hypoxia.

To validate the findings from the mouse model in human samples, the researchers pooled data from human samples obtained from patients with a healthy colon, colon cancer, and those with inflammatory bowel disease. Later, they analyzed the data and compared their findings with data from mice.

"We found that the malignant transformation of fibroblasts and the induction of Wnt5a-secreting fibroblasts are commonly observed in both mouse models and human samples," says Akira Kikuchi, senior author of the study.

This insight into the potential pathology of colon cancer and inflammation can provide the blueprints for a new cancer battle strategy: drug therapies that target Wnt5a-producing fibroblasts. As a result, fibroblasts are now being recognized as a key 'third' therapeutic target, complementing traditional treatments targeting cancer cells and immune cells.

This finding holds special importance for colon cancer, which is the leading type of cancer in Japan. Additionally, the observed pathological changes of fibroblasts could also apply to chronic inflammatory disorders like inflammatory bowel disease, offering fresh insights into their mechanisms and potential new treatment strategies for these challenging conditions.

New research in rats indicates that a Mediterranean plant may be an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The findings are published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture.

Various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory medications are used to treat ulcerative colitis, but they can cause numerous side effects. To test the potential of the Arbutus unedo plant (often referred to as the strawberry tree) that is native to the Mediterranean region, investigators gave rats doses of an extract from the plant before exposing the animals to a chemical that induces ulcerative colitis.

The pretreatment prevented changes in the colon's lining and led to fewer colonic lesions compared with no pretreatment. The pretreatment also caused decreased expression of various proteins that promote oxidative stress and inflammation.

Our findings suggest that Arbutus unedo should be studied further in preventative and therapeutic approaches to gastrointestinal disorders."

In a recent study, a research team from the Medical University of Vienna has gained new insights into post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and the relevance of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. The study, which was recently published in the journal Allergy, shows that PCS patients have altered inflammatory markers and a disturbed intestinal barrier, which could contribute to the development of post-viral fatigue.

The researchers, led by Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber from MedUni Vienna's Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, analyzed data from a prospective observational study. The course of SARS-CoV-2 infections and gastrointestinal symptoms before, during and after the infection were examined. In addition, blood, saliva and stool samples from PCS patients were analyzed.

The results show that patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal complaints have an increased risk of developing PCS fatigue. At the same time, prominent changes were found in certain biomarkers. For example, PCS patients showed an increased LBP/sCD14 ratio and lower IL-33 levels, which indicates altered immune activation and a reduced intestinal barrier. In addition, there were increased IL-6 levels, which are considered a marker for systemic inflammatory reactions.

Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have long-term effects on the immune system and intestinal health that contribute to the development of PCS."

Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber from MedUni Vienna's Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology

She is co-director of the National Reference Center for Postviral Syndromes at MedUni Vienna.

The study underlines the central role of the gastrointestinal tract in the development of long-term consequences after COVID-19. Monitoring gastrointestinal symptoms and biomarkers could help to identify at-risk patients at an early stage and develop targeted treatment strategies. This could be particularly important for the treatment of post-viral fatigue.

"What is particularly exciting is that our study participants were mostly young and healthy before the infection. Even the Covid disease was mostly mild or even asymptomatic. One difference was the more frequently reported gastrointestinal complaints in the group that developed post-viral fatigue," explains Johanna Rohrhofer from the Center for Pathophysiology Infectiology and Immunology, lead author of the study.

The research team plans to validate the findings in further studies. "The identification of predictive markers for PCS could enable personalized prevention and treatment in the future," says Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber.

Since President Donald Trump released his 2026 budget blueprint in early May, calling for $163 billion in federal spending cuts, much of the attention has focused on his slashing of foreign aid and boosting of border security. But the proposal also holds important clues — amid some mixed messages — about the administration's approach to two pressing public health issues: mental health and addiction.

There are about 80,000 overdose deaths in the United States each year, recent data shows, and nearly 50,000 deaths by suicide. Trump's proposal includes heavy cuts, totaling more than $22.6 billion, to three federal agencies that address these issues and suggests eliminating programs aimed at suicide and overdose prevention. The administration says this will streamline its efforts, but advocates, researchers, and public health practitioners worry this could make the death toll even worse.

Of course, a proposal is far from a final budget.

And this isn't even a full budget proposal. It's what people on Capitol Hill call a "skinny budget." It covers only discretionary spending that Congress authorizes each year, not larger entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those big-ticket items and many other details will be addressed in the administration's full budget, expected in the coming months.

Still, evaluated alongside the administration's actions so far — including slashing the federal health workforce and disupting grants to addiction recovery programs — the early proposal hints at Trump's priorities.

"You don't have it in enough detail to be able to really make assessments" about specific policies, said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president at the McDermott+ consulting firm and a longtime Republican Senate staffer. But "even in a skinny budget, you have to take it seriously and think that, 'Oh yeah, they're going to try to accomplish this.'"

About two weeks before Trump released his skinny budget, a preliminary budget document for the Department of Health and Human Services was leaked, showing deep funding cuts and lists of programs slated for elimination.

Discrepancies between those two documents — the official, skinny budget and the more detailed leaked one — have muddled the budget process even more than usual.

Here are three things that millions of Americans experiencing mental illness or addiction, and their loved ones, should watch as the process continues.

1. There is considerable confusion about the future of suicide prevention programs, including the nation's mental health crisis hotline, 988.

Trump plans to propose spending $520 million on the 988 system next year — the same amount as in the current fiscal year, said Rachel Cauley, a spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget. She told KFF Health News that the president's budget will include an additional $95 million for other suicide prevention programs.

But that's far from clear when looking through the only official budget document released so far.

Trump's skinny proposal calls for more than $1 billion in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the government's lead agency on all things related to mental health and addiction. The proposal says much of that comes from "eliminating inefficient funding" for SAMHSA's Programs of Regional and National Significance.

This bucket of spending includes a variety of grant programs, in areas including children's mental health and homelessness prevention. Budget documents from the current fiscal year show some of the costliest programs under this title focus on suicide prevention, including 988 grants to ensure state and regional call centers have the capacity to handle the millions of calls and texts the crisis line receives, Garrett Lee Smith grants focused on preventing youth suicide, and Zero Suicide grants that help health systems develop comprehensive suicide screening and response protocols.

Many people consider these programs vital given the country's ongoing suicide crisis. From 2000 to 2018, the national suicide rate increased 35%. Although there was a slight dip the following two years, the rate returned to its peak in 2022.

The 988 system, since launching in 2022 under the Biden administration, has fielded more than 9.8 million calls and 2.5 million texts.

"Cutting this funding is going to be disastrous," said Paul Nestadt, a psychiatrist and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. "A lot of suicide prevention does take place at the state or even local level, but it's funded by federal programs."

The skinny budget proposal says, "These programs either duplicate other Federal spending or are too small to have a national impact."

Cauley did not respond to questions about where she got the 988 and suicide prevention funding numbers she cited or why they differ from what's noted in the skinny budget.

Although it's fairly common to see discrepancies among an administration's various budget documents, attention to these documents — and concerns about differences — are heightened this year amid the Trump team's efforts to radically downsize the government and federal spending.

"It's very confusing," said Laurel Stine, chief advocacy and policy officer with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. "We want to ensure that the 988 lifeline is safeguarded," but the only officially released budget document "doesn't speak to it at all."

Another point of confusion: The skinny budget suggests that states can accomplish the work supported by the eliminated funding through separate block grants they receive from the federal government to address mental health and addiction.

However, those grants are specifically aimed at caring for people with serious mental illness and cannot be spent on suicide prevention for the general public.

2. The administration wants to cut certain tools used for preventing drug overdoses.

In the skinny budget, the Trump administration says it is "committed to combatting the scourge of deadly drugs that have ravaged American communities."

It goes on to propose eliminating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which has overseen a lot of overdose prevention work, and consolidating the infectious disease and opioids program with three other programs, effectively reducing its budget and capacity.

Some advocates, clinicians, and researchers worry such actions could reverse the recent progress made on overdose deaths.

"President Trump says that he wants to protect Americans from fentanyl," said Hanna Sharif-Kazemi, who works on federal affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy organization for people who use drugs. "But the plan that he has outlined in his budget proposal really doesn't match those words."

The proposal refers to "harm reduction" efforts, including providing sterile syringes to people using drugs, as "dangerous activities" and suggests federal funds should not support them.

But syringe service programs are among the most studied interventions and are proven to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis, without increasing crime or drug use.

They also "do so much more than just give syringes," Sharif-Kazemi said, adding that they typically distribute naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, and connect people to resources for food, housing, and treatment, which help keep them alive.

Without these programs, infectious diseases are more likely to spread and affect the broader community, said Nestadt, the Johns Hopkins professor. "Eliminating those programs is going to have terrible effects on the population of the United States, regardless of whether they're using opiates or not."

3. Research cuts aimed at "DEI" could worsen disparities in suicide and overdose rates.

The Trump proposal takes an axe to the National Institutes of Health, wiping out nearly $18 billion of the research agency's budget and eliminating several centers within it, including the National Institute on Minority and Health Disparities.

These actions align with Trump's ongoing attacks on "diversity, equity, and inclusion" programs, which he calls "woke" ideology.

Researchers say the proposed cuts, if enacted, could hamper efforts to address racial disparities in mental health and addiction that have become increasingly prominent.

Although national overdose deaths dropped last year, rates have increased in many Black and Native American communities.

Suicide rates have been rising faster for Black Americans than for their white counterparts. Early in the covid-19 pandemic, when suicide rates decreased for white Americans, they trended in the opposite direction for Black Americans and other communities of color.

"It might seem to the layperson that suicide is suicide, overdose is overdose," Nestadt said. But the data shows that trends are different for different groups. That means the factors that drive them to suicide — and the interventions that could save their lives — may be different.

"If I want to reach people with suicidal thoughts that are a highly educated, affluent population that has access to health care, I'm going to go to primary care doctors and pediatricians" to implement interventions, Nestadt said. But when trying to reach urban Black teens who have limited access to health care, "maybe it's a church" or barbershop, he said.

Nestadt is currently working on a CDC-funded study in which he interviews the family and friends of Black youths who died by suicide to understand what led to that point and how it could be prevented. He worries his funding could be cut any day.

What happens next?

Nothing in any Trump budget proposal is final. Lawmakers hold the power to determine federal spending.

Although some advocates worry that congressional Republicans will simply accede to Trump's demands, Whitlock, the McDermott+ consultant, said, "Congress is always going to want to express its will, and this will be no different."

Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees the budget, has stated that she has "serious objections" to some of the proposed cuts.

And when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared before House and Senate committees on May 14, some lawmakers pushed back on the administration's plans. Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) held up a packet of naloxone and said the government should amplify what works to decrease overdose deaths instead of shuttering SAMHSA.

"Help us save more lives," she said. "Don't shift it and shaft it."

In this interview, NewsMedical speaks with Quanterix about blood spot testing for neurological applications.

My career journey has included three phases:

The most important practice learned after introducing multiple early technologies into regulated markets has been that interesting technologies create a starting point; developing a complete solution that scales globally requires the addition of standards, controls, sustainable training programs, and well-designed quality specifications.

My role at Quanterix as Vice President of Product Management is to transform customer feedback into a detailed product description that can be developed and manufactured.

The familiar blood draw performed during routine testing is considered “wet” and collected in tubes. While a routine process at this point, the resources required are significant: a trained phlebotomist, sterile device, intravenous puncture, cold chain transportation, and storage. 

These requirements create cost, logistical, and access barriers that ultimately limit health care access.

DBS or DPS represents an alternative biocollection method where a much smaller volume of blood is extracted by finger or heel prick and blotted on a membrane.

Once adsorbed to the membrane, many analytes are stable at room temperature, removing the logistics and cost of cold chain storage from the collection to analysis site.

In preparation for analysis, the DBS/DPS is resuspended in liquid and extracted, providing the input to an analytical method.

When you combine the reduction of cost and simplification of collection, shipment, storage with access to more patients, DBS/DPS offer tremendous potential advantages and open new opportunities that benefit the clinician, testing laboratory and patient.

DBS/DPS remains in an early development stage but has made entry into the clinic. One example is the use of a Hepatitis C confirmatory, but not diagnostic testing. For the above reasons, nearly every blood-based test could benefit if converted from wet tube-based to dry spot-based. Neurodegenerative diseases could especially benefit from dry spot biocollection methods due to the large number of samples that may be required over the course of a 10-20 years of disease progression. DBS/DPS may offer a cost-effective means of monitoring patients with at-home collection followed by ambient shipment to a testing laboratory.

The exponential interest in neurology blood-based biomarkers stems from the technical breakthroughs in testing brought about by ultra-sensitive protein quantitation. The peripheral organs of the body, such as liver, kidney, pancreas and heart have direct and nearly uninhibited access to the blood stream. 

Blood-based biomarkers for heart and kidney disease reach sufficiently high concentrations that ultra-sensitive analytical methods are not required. The brain simply isn't as accessible. The blood-brain barrier provides an important and highly protective environment that limits the availability of biomarker proteins to blood. 

In application breakthroughs, ultra-sensitive technologies such as Simoa® have demonstrated the ability to detect and quantitate minute amounts of highly informative neuronal biomarkers in plasma and serum. This, in turn, has created a positive feedback mechanism for biomarker discovery. Example biomarkers such as p-Tau 181 and p-Tau 217 were identified by mass spectrometry and subsequently quantitated by Simoa. With those success stories, the neuronal biomarker community is looking for more examples of early detection biomarkers.

The magnitude and pace of progress are currently bringing tremendous promise throughout the neurology field. 

P-Tau 217 was described as a breakthrough blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's as early as 2020. Quanterix announced the release of the first commercial p-Tau 217 assay in 2024. Within one year, in 2025, all four analytes of the Simoa Neurology 4-plex E assay kit( NfL, GFAP, AB40, Ab42) and p-Tau 217 were successfully measured in a dry plasma spot. Improvements in reproducibility, quantifiability, and standardization are still required, but the proof of concept has already been demonstrated. This is an extremely exciting time for the neurology research space.

As described earlier, the ultra-sensitivity of Simoa enabled measurement of early detection of Alzheimer's biomarkers in blood for the first time. With an intravenous wet sample blood draw, sample volume is not typically limiting, and 100 uL is routinely provided as input to the assay.

With dry blood/plasma spot, the challenge to detect a very small number of molecules increases because the sample available after capture and extraction is nearly ten to fifteen-fold less. The ultra-sensitivity of Simoa offers the possibility to extract exciting information on patient health from a single, cost-effective, and highly accessible drop of blood/plasma.

In combination, Simoa and DBS/DPS scale neurodegenerative tests in an unmatched fashion. Imaging technologies, such as PET, have provided invaluable metrics for diagnosis and clinical trial enrollment and endpoint criteria. At the same time, the cost and access to imaging-based methods can be inhibiting. The cost of clinical trial enrollment using only a PET scan ($3000 each) compared to a hybrid approach that utilizes a PET scan and a blood test ($50 each) has been estimated to decrease by nearly $7 million for a 1000-patient study.

This enables more therapeutics to access the clinical stage and more diverse communities to be considered. Simoa ultra-sensitivity and DBS enable fundamental advancements to translate into scalable solutions that broadly improve human health.

As exciting as it has been to witness the early measurement of neurology biomarkers from a DBS/DPS, the field is just getting started with multiple important milestones ahead. First, there is a need for more signal as quantitation of p-tau 217 with DPS is still challenging. This could be done via improved analytical technologies such as Simoa, larger sampling volumes, more efficient plasma separation, or more effective extraction methods.

Multiple controls are also required to monitor key steps in the process, inlcluding loading, plasma separation, extraction, and run controls. After adequate performance and controls are in place, standardization will be required to enable comparability across studies. There is a tremendous amount of work yet to be done.

Multiple DBS/DPC collection devices are currently available. Despite different approaches amongst these devices to collection and separation of blood into plasma, every device requires an extraction step. The proteins once adsorbed to the membrane need to be re-solubilized, collected in a tube and prepared for analysis. The new Simoa dry blood extraction kit, which is based on work done at the University of Gothenberg, provides a simple, off-the-shelf solution for this key step. Early work with the kit has shown effective extraction of p-Tau 217, Nf-l, GFAP, Ab40 and Ab42 in a fashion fully compatible with Simoa analysis.

With the clear potential to translate recent biomarker discoveries into scalable health care solutions, multiple groups will work collaboratively to improve the collection device, measure stability, refine extraction methods, improve analytical performance and establish calibrators. Together, we will work toward an RUO solution that iteratively evolves to meet the needs of clinical researchers. Quanterix is committed to partnering closely with researchers to learn how it can help at each step in that process.

Wesley Straub obtained his B.S. in Chemistry magna cum laude from Boston University and a Ph.D. from the University of California San Francisco. After working on producing, purifying, and characterizing several biosimilars, recombinant blood factors, and novel biotherapeutics, he entered the life science technology field with Forte Bio. He has contributed to the development and launch of over 25 hardware, software, and reagent products across BLI, capillary sequencing, qPCR, and Simoa technologies.

From discovery to diagnostics, Quanterix's ultrasensitive biomarker detection is fueling breakthroughs only made possible through its unparalleled sensitivity and flexibility. The Company's Simoa® technology has delivered the gold standard for earlier biomarker detection in blood, serum or plasma, with the ability to quantify proteins that are far lower than the Limit of Quantification (LoQ) of conventional analog methods.

Its industry-leading precision instruments, digital immunoassay technology and CLIA-certified Accelerator laboratory have supported research that advances disease understanding and management in neurology, oncology, immunology, cardiology and infectious disease. Quanterix has been a trusted partner of the scientific community for nearly two decades, powering research published in more than 2,500 peer-reviewed journals.

For the first time, scientists have shown that an established blood-cleansing procedure could help rid the human body of tiny plastic particles, offering hope for new detox solutions amid rising global contamination.

​​​​​​​Study: Therapeutic apheresis: A promising method to remove microplastics? ​​​​​​​Image Credit: SIVStockStudio / Shutterstock

Rising plastics use is associated with massive and widespread environmental contamination with plastics. Much evidence suggests that in their degraded form, they have entered living organisms, including the human body. A recent article in the journal Brain Medicine reports on the feasibility of removing such forms of plastics using an established technique called therapeutic apheresis.

Microplastics and nanoplastics are forms of plastic with greatest diameters of 1μm–5 mm and <1 μm in greatest diameter, respectively. Together, they are dubbed MNP.

MNPs may be byproducts of commercial production cycles involving goods like pharmaceutical formulations or cosmetics. They may also represent a degradation stage of waste plastic.

Filters showed zero plastic particles before treatment. Prerinsed apheresis equipment tested clean, confirming detected particles came solely from patients' bloodstreams.

MNP exist everywhere in the world, including marine and forest environments. Recent research hints strongly at their threat to human health and potentially links them to multiple health conditions. The scientific paper notes that due to current methodological limitations, it's often more precise to speak of MNPs or MNP-like structures, which may involve MNPs combined with other molecules like proteins, and that reports on MNP presence in tissues should be interpreted with some caution. These include cardiometabolic disease (such as stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome), cancer, infertility, dementia, and other neurodegenerative conditions.

Such disorders may be triggered or accelerated by the presence of MNPs. For instance, some scientists postulate that MNPs taken up by adrenal gland tissue may disrupt the normal production of adrenal steroids like cortisol. Cortisol, being a stress hormone, abnormal cortisol levels in the blood may dysregulate stress responses. This may explain why many viral infections are currently followed by chronic fatigue after clinical recovery. A further theory is that MNPs help carry infectious agents into cells and tissues.

Currently, MNP exposure is unavoidable, leading researchers to investigate whether it can be effectively removed from the body.

The authors of the current study examined the use of therapeutic apheresis to potentially remove MNPs from the body. At present, this technique is used to remove certain blood components, such as cells or plasma proteins.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) has been dramatically more prevalent in recent years. This is associated with increasing air pollution by particles 10μm or less in size.

In an earlier study by the same authors, ME/CFS patients reported a 70% improvement in symptoms after they received this therapy. It is important to note that this prior observation related to symptom improvement and did not specifically investigate MNP removal. The current study took this further by looking for the presence of MNP-like particles in the eluted fluid.

Chronic fatigue cases spiked alongside PM10 pollution – A 2024 study connected ME/CFS surges to environmental particles ≤10 μm, mirroring the apheresis patient cohort's triggers.

Therapeutic apheresis is basically a filtration process. Blood from the patient passes from a vein through a circuit involving an apheresis machine that contains a series of filters designed to remove different blood components. For instance, one set of filters might remove autoantibodies, while another might target blood lipids.

The filtered blood is now passed back into the patient using a second vein. The eluate will be enriched in the components removed from blood.

In the current study, 21 patients who had post-infectious ME/CFS were treated using two cycles of therapeutic apheresis, or more, using double filtration. The concentrated eluate was measured by a sophisticated analytical method called attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy. It's important to note that this analysis does not quantitatively measure MNPs; it only determines whether MNP-like particles are present or not.

This revealed 14 types of substances or mixtures resembling MNP-like particles in the eluates from these patients, but not the prerinse fluid. The IR spectrum showed a 67.5% match for polyamide 6 (nylon 6), and 35.3% match for polyurethane (PUR-WS). Some of these particles were 200 nm in size or smaller.

This might be due to the presence of polyamide 6, a synthetic polymer primarily produced as a fiber rather than a particle, which is manufactured as electrospun fibers <100 nm for some specialized applications.

This spectroscopic method identifies the presence of polyamide bonds, though this may indicate the presence of proteins as well. This limits the definitiveness of this observation regarding the precise composition of the detected particles.

This study reports for the first time a method that might potentially be used to remove MNP-like particles from the human body. Larger studies are required to validate this application.

Moreover, the plasma MNP levels pre- and post-apheresis need to be measured quantitatively, along with eluate MNPs, in more than one apheresis cycle. This will show how well these particles are being removed from blood and then from tissues. The clinical effects of MNP removal from the body also need confirmation, and it must be emphasized that such effects are not yet established by this preliminary research.

Intestinal microbes that survive chemo can rid the gut of excess chemo drugs and produce a vitamin that helps to stem nausea.

Chemotherapy doesn't just kill cancer cells. It also affects the microbes in the digestive tract. 

Researchers at UC San Francisco have discovered that some gut bacteria can reduce the side effects of these potent treatments, and that one family of cancer drugs may actually boost these protective bacteria.

The phenomenon could help physicians to predict the severity of a patient's side effects and points the way to supplements that could help those whose guts aren't sufficiently protecting them. 

These studies emphasize the important relationship between the gut microbiome and drug toxicity. A more detailed understanding of this relationship could provide new strategies to optimize the treatment of cancer and other diseases."

Peter Turnbaugh, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology at UCSF

Turnbaugh's team found that colorectal cancer patients taking a class of chemotherapy drugs known as fluoropyrimidines had much less diverse microbiomes in their digestive systems. But the surviving bacteria did something amazing.

"They were able to gobble up the chemotherapy and chemically transform it into a harmless byproduct," said Kai Trepka, a student in the Medical Scientist Training Program at UCSF who co-authored the study along Wesley Kidder, MD, MPH, an associate professor of medicine who specializes in gastrointestinal cancer. It published April 16 in Science Translational Medicine.

The team also saw that measuring the abundance of helpful bacteria could predict whether a patient would develop the kind of severe side effects, like nausea or vomiting, that make it hard for people to complete their treatment. 

When the researchers gave these drug-processing microbes to mice experiencing severe chemotherapy side effects, their symptoms greatly improved, suggesting that humans may be able to use the bacteria as probiotics. 

A second study, published May 20 in the journal mBio, revealed the microbiome can also protect patients from the painful numbness or tingling sensation that is another common side effect of chemotherapy, by producing vitamin K2. 

When the researchers looked at the microbiomes of 56 colon cancer patients, they saw again that the fluoropyrimidine drugs had killed off some of the organisms and bolstered the populations of others.

Among those that thrived during chemotherapy was a nonpathogenic strain of E. coli that produced vitamin K2. The researchers gave K2 to mice who'd been treated with fluoropyrimidine drugs, and their side effects resolved. 

Patients who reported fewer side effects also had more K2 in their microbiomes.

"For a long time, the microbiome has seemed like a black box," Kidder said. "We're now starting to be able to shine little flashlights and find clues to how we can influence it for the better - in this case, better outcomes for cancer patients."

Changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) during adolescence play an important role in the association between air pollution exposure and insulin resistance, according to a new study led by investigators from the Keck School of Medicine of USC.

The study, funded in part by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and published in JAMA Network Open, found that children who were exposed to higher levels of traffic-related air pollution-specifically nitrogen oxides-tended to have a higher BMI by age 13, and experienced rapid weight gain from adolescence to young adulthood. This, in turn, was linked to higher levels of insulin resistance in their mid-20s.

We estimated about 42% of the relationship between early pollution exposure and insulin resistance can be explained by accelerated BMI growth trajectories-which describes how an individual's BMI changes over time-and further contributes to insulin resistance, a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes."

Fangqi Guo, PhD, MPH, postdoctoral scholar research associate, Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, and lead author of the study

"These findings held, even after accounting for other factors such as smoking, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and parental history of diabetes," says Guo. "Our discovery is especially important for families and children living in high-traffic urban areas who may already face other socioeconomic or health disparities," says Guo.

With the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance among young adults and children, the study's findings uncover how the harmful effects of air pollution may contribute to long-term metabolic problems.

In this study, the team of researchers specifically explored nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted into the air from motor vehicles, categorized as traffic-related air pollution. (TRAP). TRAP exposure has been associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the underlying mechanism of this association has not been fully understood. This study found that exposure to TRAP in childhood is associated with higher risk of insulin resistance in young adulthood, and the association may be partially explained by higher BMI and accelerated BMI growth from early adolescence into young adulthood.

The study included data from Meta-Air2, an ongoing substudy of the Southern California's Children's Health Study (CHS) and featured 282 participants enrolled in kindergarten or first grade in 2003, who were actively followed up until 2014. The study's researchers initiated a follow-up study in 2023 where participants, now young adults, provided blood samples for metabolic biomarker testing.

"By identifying weight gain during adolescence as a key pathway between air pollution exposure and insulin resistance, our research underscores the importance of early interventions. These include promoting healthy lifestyle habits and weight management and improving air quality-in a bid to reduce the risk of chronic disease later in life," says Guo. "Public health efforts that address both environmental exposures and childhood obesity could make a significant impact."

In addition to Guo, the study's other authors are Xinci Chen, Steve Howland, Zhongzheng Niu, Lu Zhang, W. James Gauderman, Rob McConnell, MD, Theresa M. Bastain, Rima Habre, Carrie V. Breton, and Shohreh F. Farzan from the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California; Nathan Pavlovic and Fred Lurmann from Sonoma Technologies Inc, Petaluma, California.

As researchers work to improve treatment of Alzheimer's disease, new research by UCLA Health identified a candidate drug that reduces levels of a toxic form of a protein in the brain caused by the disease and improved memory in mice by boosting production of a protective protein.

In a study published in the Nature journal npj Drug Discovery, UCLA Health researchers targeted the protein clusterin (CLU), which is crucial in preventing the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins that that disrupt communication between brain cells and lead to memory impairment - a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer's disease.

More than a decade ago, a variant of the gene that encodes clusterin was identified as the third strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. It was recently reported that increased CLU protein could provide protection against Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline. UCLA Health researchers led by Varghese John identified a candidate small molecule, DDL-357, that increased concentrations of secreted clusterin (sCLU) in Alzheimer's mouse models, resulting in a reduction of the toxic protein phospho-tau and improvement of mitochondrial function, both associated with progression of the disease. DDL-357 also improved the memory of treated mice in maze-based cognitive tests.

Our findings open the door to the development of new treatments that not only target the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease but also restore lost cognitive function – something that existing therapies have yet to achieve."

Varghese John, professor of neurology and director of the Drug Discovery Laboratory (DDL) at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research and Care at UCLA

"While the drug candidate is still in pre-clinical testing and far from human trials, initial results suggest it could work in concert with existing Alzheimer's disease treatments and may also be effective in treating other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", John said.

The drug is one of the latest that John and fellow UCLA Health researchers at the Drug Discovery Laboratory have identified as potential candidates for development to treat Alzheimer's disease. One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer's model mice by jumpstarting the brain's memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory. Another study published in April found the molecule DDL-218 worked to increase levels in mouse brain of another protective protein, sirtuin 1, that is lower in people who carry apolipoprotein E4, a genetic variant of apolipoprotein, that confers the greatest risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These potential drug candidates provide an opportunity for the testing of new complimentary therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

Researchers at the University of Turku, Finland, have taken a step towards more personalized and effective cancer treatments. A new study has identified the conditions under which the antibody drug bexmarilimab can activate the body's own defense system against cancer, and how to identify patients who will benefit from the drug.

Bexmarilimab has the ability to "wake up" macrophages, a type of immune cell, to act against cancer. The study found that this activation occurs especially when the tumor microenvironment is immunologically silent. Moreover, in the healthy tissue adjacent to the tumor, bexmarilimab was shown to trigger B cell-mediated immune responses, regardless of how sensitive the neighboring tumor was to the treatment. This suggests that the drug may have immunological effects beyond the tumor itself.

By utilizing previous knowledge about the changes bexmarilimab causes in tumors, researchers were able to demonstrate the benefit of bexmarilimab by measuring the upregulation of five different genes (gene signature). In the future, this could enable more accurate patient selection and improved treatment outcomes.

This gene signature gives us a tool to identify patients whose tumors are likely to respond to bexmarilimab. Supporting treatment decisions with gene signatures measured from the tumor may help target therapies to those who are most likely to benefit. The next step is clinical validation of the signature, which could enable its use in more precise patient profiling."

Jenna Rannikko, Doctoral Researcher and lead author of the study

The study utilized patient-derived tissue samples that closely mimic the interaction between tumors and the immune system. By measuring treatment response in these tissues, the researchers observed similar patterns to those seen in clinical trials of bexmarilimab.

Bexmarilimab, developed in Finland, has shown promising results in several types of solid tumors. This new study adds important insights into how bexmarilimab can be used most effectively in the future.

"Our findings suggest that by better understanding the tumor microenvironment, we can tailor immunotherapies to the patients who are most likely to benefit", says Associate Professor Maija Hollmén, the study's principal investigator. "In addition, understanding the factors that influence treatment efficacy may help expand its use to new patient groups in the future."

Editor's Note: USWNT Footnotes takes you inside the major talking points around the U.S. women's national team, the NWSL, European leagues, and all across American women's soccer.

Jaedyn Shaw, Korbin Albert and Mia Fishel are among 20 players to make up the U-23 women's national team for two upcoming road matches against Germany. The squad will face the Germans outside Stuttgart on May 30 and again on June 2. The camp in Europe is part of USWNT coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance when it comes to the player pathway to the full senior team.

Hayes announced a 24-player senior roster on Tuesday for stateside matches against China (May 31) and Jamaica (June 3), and during her press conference, referenced Shaw, Albert and Fishel and explained why she thought it was important for them to take part in the U-23 camp instead. 

"This is what I've felt has really been missing for a lot of players," Hayes said. "That they made that jump from Under 20 to seniors and they don't have a body of games. Yes, [Fishel] could come in, sit on the bench for us, but it's much better for her to go up and play in Germany and get the experiences so that these players are tracking to compete in the place that we want them to come [the 2027 World Cup]."

Fishel, 24, tore her ACL ahead of the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup and recently returned to play for her club Chelsea. Hayes called her in as a training player for the April matches against Brazil, but she hasn't played with the full team in more than a year. 

Shaw, 20, and Albert, 21, are both USWNT veterans at this point given how young the squad is, and won gold medals with the team at the Paris Olympics last summer. But Hayes believes all three will benefit more from playing with the U-23 team right now.

"I think the trip to Germany for [Fishel], plus Jaedyn plus Korbin, will be another step in their development," Hayes said. "And one where, just for context, both teams are able to play five overage players. So this is a great opportunity for us to be able to play players with less experience." 

Trinity Rodman update

Trinity Rodman made her valiant return to the USWNT in April where she scored a brilliant goal in the team's first match vs. Brazil. She didn't see the field in the second game, but played for the Washington Spirit a few days later. Since then, Rodman has taken a leave of absence from soccer to address ongoing back issues. There is no timetable for her return to club or country.

Hayes said this week that she speaks with Rodman regularly and the ‘Triple Espresso' star is "doing really well."

"It has certainly been a multidisciplinary approach to supporting Trin – [that includes] club, country and the NWSL – so there's good communication and support provided to her," Hayes said. "I think with regard to the issue in her back, she wants to get to a place where it doesn't keep coming back. So I think these are the right steps for her, and I've definitely seen a lot of progress. 

"But unfortunately, like anything, you can't put a timeframe on it because we want to ensure that she's not carrying that pain any further. And I think we're definitely heading in the right direction. I don't know when she will be back, but I know that Trin is being given all the support and we very much hope for a speedy recovery."

One full year on the job

It's been almost one year since Hayes officially took over the USWNT (her first match was June 1, 2024 which resulted in a 4-0 win over Korea Republic). Hayes spent more than a decade at Chelsea where she transformed the club and won 16 trophies. In her first few months with the U.S., she led the squad to an Olympic gold medal and gave 21 different players their senior team debut. Now, she's developing and expanding the player pool ahead of the next World Cup, which is not until 2027.

"The truth is, I'm in love with my job every day," Hayes told reporters this week. "I didn't realize how stuck I'd become until I got out of that. And the self-development that's gone on for me on a personal level was not just what I needed, but the push I needed as well. I'm on so many different leadership programs – not just formal but sometimes informal gatherings with other head coaches. I never really got as much time as I wanted to do that before. 

"Also, I'm loving learning again – a new culture, a new playing pool and everything that comes with that. Right now I'm working on the plan to qualify for 2027, but also within that, why those missing gaps are there. Not just in our program, but in our sport, because I'm all about not just closing the gap, but how can we help support all areas of the sport? So I'm in my perfect job and absolutely loving it."

Catarina Macario scores in FA Cup Final

After being eliminated from Champions League competition, Chelsea responded by going onto win the FA Cup Final with a 3-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday. The undefeated Blues completed the domestic treble, winning the Women's Super League, WSL Cup and FA Cup. Macario, who was subbed onto the pitch in the 62nd minute, scored Chelsea's second goal on a header in the 84th minute.

Not only was it Macario's 11th goal of the season, but she became the third American woman to score in an FA Cup Final, joining Sam Mewis and Carli Lloyd. 

Savy King update

In very uplifting news, Angel City FC defender Savy King has been discharged from the hospital. She posted the update on social media earlier this week.

King, 20, required medical attention during the Angel City-Utah Royals match on May 9 when she collapsed on the field. The game was stopped for about 10 minutes and King was carted off the field and immediately taken to a local hospital. The club later announced that King was in stable condition and that she underwent successful surgery for a heart abnormality.

The incident sparked outrage among players, coaches and the soccer community because the game continued after King left the field. A week later, after reviewing league protocols, the NWSL admitted the match should have ended.

In an Instagram post, King thanked her family, friends, teammates and fans for their love and support as well as the medical team "who saved my life and cared for me every step of the way." King also said she is "looking forward to recovering and getting back out on the field."

Matt Turner's jubilant week in London has quickly turned on its head after U.S. Men's National Team head coach Mauricio Pochettino warned that the Crystal Palace goalkeeper's position as his starter is not guaranteed.

The 30-year-old has spent the season on loan at Selhurst Park from Nottingham Forest, however, the move hasn't helped the former Arsenal shot stopper find his way back onto the field on a regular basis. Having spent the majority of the season backing up Dean Henderson, Turner has made just four appearances in Cup competitions and none in the Premier League.

And while Turner had started three FA Cup games for Palace earlier in the season, he returned to the bench from the quarter finals onward, with Henderson playing the full 90 minutes in their recent 1-0 Final win against Manchester City, marking Palace's first major title victory in their 164-year history.

Turner was subsequently named to Pochettino's preliminary 60-man roster for their upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, which will be played a matter of days before they head to the CONCACAF Gold Cup. But while he has been Pochettino's starter since day one, the Argentine admitted on Tuesday that this could yet change.

“I think it's true that he's not playing, and we were talking with him and we translated the idea of that for the future in one year's time, I think he needs to find a way to compete every week because if not it's going to be a little bit delayed with the rest of the teammates,” the former Tottenham Hotspur boss said.

“But I think it's open now, in our mind it's open for another player, maybe to challenge in between them, and maybe to try to give the possibility to play for another player.”

The USMNT has shortlisted six goalkeepers for their upcoming games, including the as yet uncapped trio of Chicago Fire's Chris Brady, New York City FC's Matthew Freese, and Barcelona's Diego Kochen. And while all six can't make the final cut, Pochettino did confirm that he plans on bringing four to the Gold Cup, at which point, the competition will come down to how they perform in training.

“I think we are going to have enough games to try to give maybe the possibility to another keeper, maybe to play, but that is not today the decision. Of course, until now, Matt was our number one choice, but that can change,” Pochettino admitted.

With his loan deal set to expire in the summer, and two years remaining on his Forest contract, where Matz Sels has enjoyed an excellent season between the sticks, it seems likely Turner will be hoping to find a way out of the City Ground in the coming months - something he eluded to in March.

“I think obviously whenever I come to the National Team, I want to play,” he explained. “I want to put the crest on and have the responsibility of being the number one, but at the same time, I understand that my club situation right now isn't the best, so I have to maybe make some changes in that department if I want to play more consistently.”

GENEVA (AP) — Last-minute transfer signings are open to all 32 teams going to the Club World Cup in the United States next month, FIFA said Wednesday, likely fueling more speculation that one of them will try to sign Cristiano Ronaldo on a short-term deal.

FIFA confirmed all 20 home national federations of the 32 teams have taken up an offer made last year to approve special trading windows for the monthlong tournament that opens June 14 in Miami.

Transfers can be made from June 1-10 and again June 27-July 3 according to exceptional rules FIFA approved in October.

“The objective is to encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation,” FIFA said in Wednesday's statement.

One such player is Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is leaving Liverpool where his contract expires on June 30. He is expected to join Real Madrid which could try to reach agreement to take him to the U.S. next month. Liverpool did not qualify for the Club World Cup.

Ronaldo's Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr also did not qualify because it did not win an Asian Champions League title between 2021 and 2024.

That has not stopped speculation the 40-year-old Portugal great could make a transfer, potentially on a short-term loan, ahead of the Club World Cup.

Such a move would be unprecedented in modern soccer though could appeal to FIFA by boosting the profile and ticket sales of an inaugural tournament being played in 11 U.S. cities. It has been unclear if many fans of the teams will travel to the U.S. for the 63-game tournament.

A transfer for Ronaldo also would reunite him and Lionel Messi in the same competition for the first time since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Last October, FIFA invited Messi's Inter Miami to enter the tournament in the slot that was expected to be reserved for the host nation's champion. Inter Miami led the regular season standings but was then eliminated in the MLS Cup playoffs.

Speculative reports have linked Ronaldo to the one Saudi club that qualified, Al Hilal, the Brazilian club Palmeiras and Wydad of Morocco, even though that club is currently banned by FIFA from registering new signings.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has promoted the Club World Cup at recent meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump, and the new gold trophy has been prominent in the Oval Office at the White House.

ATLANTA – Twenty players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp and matches in Germany. The U.S. team will be in Germany from May 26-June 3 and will play its German counterparts twice, on May 30 and June 2 at small stadiums outside of Stuttgart.

The programming in Europe is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team.

“This is an incredible opportunity for our U-23 player pool to face top tier opponents in Europe and give them the valuable experiences that are much needed,” said Hayes. “We want to be very conscious of developing our players through different experiences, and as I have spoken about before, this will take shape of some players playing in U-23 games and at other times being called in with WNT.This is because wewant to increase the diversityof high-level opponents that they get to compete against, but the methodology and coaching points between the teams will be exactly the same.”

Goalkeepers (2): Angelina Anderson (Angel City FC; Danville, Calif.), Jordan Silkowitz (Bay FC; Fairfax, Va.)

Defenders (6): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; El Cajon, Calif.), Lauren Flynn (Utah Royals FC; Arlington, Va.), Emily Mason (Seattle Reign FC; Flemington, N.J.), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; Hingham, Mass.), Evelyn Shores (UNC; Atlanta, Ga.), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; Rossmoor, Calif.)

Midfielders (6): Korbin Albert (Paris Saint-Germain FC, FRA; Grayslake, Ill.), Abi Brighton (Juventus FC, ITA; Beaufort, S.C.), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; Roswell, Ga.), Samantha Meza (Seattle Reign FC; Balch Springs, Texas), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Jaedyn Shaw (North Carolina Courage; Frisco, Texas)

Forwards (6): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; Edina, Minn.), Mia Fishel (Chelsea FC, ENG; San Diego, Calif.), Caiya Hanks (Portland Thorns FC; Kailua-Kona, Hawaii), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; Beltsville, Md.), Makenna Morris (Washington Spirit; Germantown, Md.), Riley Tiernan (Angel City FC; Voorhees, N.J.)

The U.S. roster features 15 players who are Under-23 in age, and per an agreement with Germany that is standard for Women's U-23 internationals in Europe, each squad will have five “overage players,” none of whom can be born before Jan. 1, 1999.

Players born in 2002, 2003 and 2004 are age-eligible for this year's U-23 WNT, and this U.S. roster also includes four players born in 2001 — GK Angelina Anderson, F Mia Fishel, M Samantha Meza, D Kennedy Wesley and one in 2000 — GK Jordan Silkowitz.

Midfielder Evelyn Shores from the 2024 NCAA Champion University of North Carolina Tar Heels is the only current collegiate player on the roster.

This U-23 camp will be led by University of New Mexico head coach Heather Dyche along with assistant coaches Yolanda Thomas, who is an assistant with the 2024 NWSL Champion Orlando Pride; former USWNT player Stephanie Cox, a 2008 Olympic gold medalist; and long-time U.S. Youth National Team and former San Diego Wave goalkeeper coach Louis Hunt.

Bad news for the attacker.

Real Madrid have published a medical report on Endrick, who suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's match in Sevilla and will miss the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup.

After the tests carried out today on our player Endrick by the Medical Services of Real Madrid, he has been diagnosed with an injury to the combined tendon of the hamstrings in his right leg. Awaiting further evaluation.Source: Realmadrid.com

This is very bad news for Endrick and Real Madrid, as the young Brazilian forward could've played some minutes during the tournament. Now, he will have to miss the Club World Cup and then wait for the pre-season stage to start working under soon-to-be new coach Xabi Alonso.

Hamstring injuries are always very tricky, so Endrick will need to take a cautious approach with his recovery in order to avoid setbacks when he's cleared to play during the summer.

Washington, D.C. (05/21/2025) – Washington Spirit forward Makenna Morris has been called up to the U.S. U-23 Women's National Team, U.S. Soccer announced today. The U-23 team will hold training camp in Germany beginning later this month and face their German counterparts in two friendly matches on Friday, May 30 and Monday, June 2.

The dynamic second-year pro also scored Washington's first goal of the season in Houston this spring, the sixth of her young career.

Phil Foden believes he may need to miss England's summer internationals and the Club World Cup to allow his ankle problem to heal, as he admitted to struggling mentally with issues both on and off the pitch during a difficult season.

The Manchester City player attributed a “frustrating” year to injury and other factors, as he opened up about the toughest campaign of his career.

Foden was named Footballer of the Year last season, when he scored 27 goals for City, but has not scored since January and was only a substitute for Saturday's FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace.

He played in Thomas Tuchel's first two games in charge of England, the March wins over Albania and Latvia, but thinks he may be better off resting, rather than trying to impress the new manager, who names his squad for the June matches against Andorra and Senegal on Friday.

Foden also feels it might benefit him to sit out the Club World Cup, which could involve seven games and more than five weeks in the United States for City, but he will consult with his club and country before making a decision.

He said: “It's a difficult situation for me with the internationals right around the corner. It's something we have to speak with the club and national team to see, maybe, if it's better to rest and get my ankle fully 100 per cent back how I want it.

“I just need a few weeks off it without playing football and obviously I can't get it at the moment. It's a bit frustrating to play with niggles like this. It's getting better and stronger each day.”

Foden has only started one of City's last eight games as he continues to feel the after-effects of a challenge by Casemiro in April's 0-0 derby draw.

Foden revealed that he has struggled with aspects away from football as well as with his ankle, as he explained his underwhelming season. “It's been difficult,” he added. “I picked up an ankle injury against [Manchester] United and it's taken time to heal. It was a bad ligament damage to the ankle. It took a while to heal before I can push myself back in training, I had to look after it.

“It's been a frustrating season for me. I've had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. It's one of them, sometimes there's things in life that are bigger than football. This season I've struggled a little bit. Hopefully, come next year, I can get my head mentally right, get back where I left the season before, because I know what I'm capable of doing and the quality I have.

“I know if everything was okay, I'd definitely be better on the field. Sometimes things happen and you have to deal with it and move on.”

Foden is grateful to City for helping him during a tough period, adding: “The club have been so supportive. I can't thank them enough.”

He also offered an insight into how players are feeling about the first 32-team Club World Cup, which will follow a campaign when City have already played 57 games.

“It's obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season,” he said. “I believe everyone needs the right time to recover to go back to next season. Obviously, there will be this competition that's coming up.

“It's going to be a funny one, some clubs will take it more seriously than others, but I know City and the club we are, we'll definitely take it seriously.”

Phil Foden is seeking talks with England and Manchester City to devise a period of rest this summer after the toughest season of his career.

The midfielder, who turns 25 next week, admitted to ‘mental fatigue' earlier in the campaign and has revealed off-field issues have hampered his performances.

Foden is also carrying ligament damage in his ankle, sustained during the dour Manchester derby in early April, and has only featured for 105 minutes since.

The summer schedule is packed, with England internationals coming in the days before City travel to the United States for the newly expanded Club World Cup.

But Foden is looking for a break to recharge and put the season behind him.

‘I just need a few weeks off it without playing football and obviously I can't get it at the moment,' he said. ‘It's a difficult situation for me with the internationals right around the corner.

Phil Foden has admitted he needs a break this summer after the worst season of his career 

Foden (with Kevin De Bruyne) has battled through ankle problems and off-field issues this term

‘It's something we have to speak with the club and national team to see maybe if it's better to rest and get my ankle fully 100 per cent to back how I want it.

‘I just don't know at the moment, it's a conversation to be had and we'll see what happens.'

Foden had started this term as the PFA Players' Player of the Year but managed 10 goals and six assists in 44 appearances – with his seven Premier League goals coming in the space of a month.

The academy graduate has again hinted at problems away from the pitch while also claiming that the ankle issue was significantly worse than supporters realise.

‘The ankle has taken time to heal,' he said. ‘I somehow managed to play on at United. That's the kind of person I am, I try to play on with anything. I remember how much pain I felt when the adrenaline died down.

‘A lot of people don't know what football players have to go through and play with. I've had a lot of pain and playing with it in the last couple of months. Maybe I came back too early. But it's what I'm like. I'm feeling a lot better now and can really push on with it.

‘It's been a frustrating season for me. I've had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally.

‘Sometimes there are things in life that are bigger than football. I've struggled a little bit. 

'Hopefully next year I can get my head mentally right and get back to where I left off the season before because I know what I'm capable of doing and the quality I have.'

Foden (training with Jordan Henderson and Adam Wharton) suggested he wants a rest

Thomas Tuchel names his second England squad on Friday morning ahead of a World Cup qualifier with Andorra at Espanyol on June 7 and a friendly against Senegal three days later.

The German has previously suggested that he will not be doing Premier League clubs any favours when picking teams. 

City's Club World Cup tournament begins in Philadelphia against Wydad on June 18, with Pep Guardiola's squad going on a camp near Miami in the five days beforehand. Foden indicated that he wants to play for City.

‘It's obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season,' Foden added. ‘Everyone needs the right time to recover. Obviously there will be this competition that's coming up.

‘It's going to be a funny one, some clubs will take it more seriously than others but I know City and the club we are, we'll definitely take it seriously.

‘I've left it in the back of my mind to be honest until the season's finished. For myself it will be somewhere I look at to get going for the season. I'm just looking forward to seeing what it's like and playing against top teams.'

A bipartisan group of Congressional representatives are calling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline the government's visa processing system to ensure visitors from abroad will be able to attend next year's FIFA World Cup as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

The World Cup, which kicks off in less than 400 days, is expected to generate $3.75 billion in economic activity in the U.S. With SoFi Stadium in Inglewood hosting eight games, the economic impact on Southern California is estimated at nearly $600 million.

But cost-cutting measures proposed by Rubio could threaten that by reducing staff and closing some embassies and consulates, increasing visa wait times and making an already cumbersome system more complicated and costly. That could keep tens of thousands of fans at home.

Even without the changes, six countries have at least one U.S. diplomatic post with visa wait times that extend beyond the start of the World Cup.

 Sports 

Will the Trump administration fix a backlogged visa approval process in time for fans from many countries to attend the World Cup and L.A. Olympics?

Rubio is scheduled to appear Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee where he will be asked about the visa process, said Rep.  Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Los Angeles). Kamlager-Dove, a member of that committee and a proponent of sports diplomacy, laid out her concerns and those of her colleagues in two-page letter addressed to Rubio and signed by 52 representatives, including Rep. Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills), the first Republican to sign on; Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and Ted Lieu (D-Manhattan Beach), a member of Democratic House leadership.

“I'm hoping to get some answers and some solutions,” said Kamlager-Dove, whose sprawling districts ranges from the border with Beverly Hills to South Los Angeles. “This is a real problem because it impacts attendance and it impacts economic activity.”

The 2026 World Cup will be the largest in history, with a record 48 countries participating. It will also be the first World Cup played in three countries, with Mexico and Canada sharing host duties with the U.S. However the vast majority of the games — 78 of 104 — will be played in 11 U.S. cities between June 11 and July 19, 2026.

“The economic stakes of these games and significant for red and blue districts nationwide, as is the diplomatic and soft-power opportunity of being at the center of the international sports universe,” Kamlager-Dove wrote in her letter. “However the success of these games hinges on the State Department's ability to efficiently process the visa applications of spectators, athletes and media.”

 Sports 

Casey Wasserman says his committee has made strides with Trump over Olympians not having visa issues for the 2028 L.A. Games, despite the U.S. considering travel restrictions for 43 countries.

Kamlager-Dove believes the opportunity is too important to be sacrificed to politics.

“The United States has an obligation to put its best foot forward as the host of these games,” she said. “Sports diplomacy is an important tool for us as we continue to talk about peace and cooperation. It's also so important as we recognize all of the different ethnic communities that help make up the United States and want to root for their home team.

“And so you want restaurants to be full, clubs and bars to be full, hotels to be full.”

Earlier this month President Trump held the first meeting of a White House task force charged with overseeing what the president called “the biggest, safest and most extraordinary soccer tournament in history.” But the administration has sent mixed signals over exactly how welcoming it intends to be.

At that meeting attended by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, Vice President JD Vance — co-chair of the task force — said the U.S. wants foreign visitors “to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games. But when the time is up we want them to go home, otherwise they will have to talk to Secretary Noem.” He referred to Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency has detained and interrogated visa holders at U.S. points of entry.

“It is up to [Rubio] to square that circle for us when he comes to our committee,” Kamlager-Dove said. “The good news is you have Republicans and Democrats asking these questions. These games are non-partisan. And I believe that these are practical, logistical, solvable log jams that deserve a solution.

“Staff the State Department to focus on them. Accelerate and streamline these processes and prioritize diplomacy. Because the games are diplomatic.”

ATLANTA (May 21, 2025) – Twenty players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp and matches in Germany. The U.S. team will be in Germany from May 26-June 3 and will play its German counterparts twice, on May 30 and June 2 at small stadiums outside of Stuttgart.

The programming in Europe is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importancealong the player pathway to the full National Team.

“This is an incredible opportunity for our U-23 player pool to face top tier opponents in Europe and give them the valuable experiences that are much needed,” said Hayes. “We want to be very conscious of developing our players through different experiences, and as I have spoken about before, this will take shape of some players playing in U-23 games and at other times being called in with WNT.This is because wewant to increase the diversityof high-level opponents that they get to compete against, but the methodology and coaching points between the teams will be exactly the same.”

Goalkeepers (2): Angelina Anderson (Angel City FC; Danville, Calif.), Jordan Silkowitz (Bay FC; Fairfax, Va.)

Defenders (6): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; El Cajon, Calif.), Lauren Flynn (Utah Royals FC; Arlington, Va.), Emily Mason (Seattle Reign FC; Flemington, N.J.), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; Hingham, Mass.), Evelyn Shores (UNC; Atlanta, Ga.), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; Rossmoor, Calif.)

Midfielders (6): Korbin Albert (Paris Saint-Germain FC, FRA; Grayslake, Ill.), Abi Brighton (Juventus FC, ITA; Beaufort, S.C.), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; Roswell, Ga.), Samantha Meza (Seattle Reign FC; Balch Springs, Texas), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Jaedyn Shaw (North Carolina Courage; Frisco, Texas)

Forwards (6): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; Edina, Minn.), Mia Fishel (Chelsea FC, ENG; San Diego, Calif.), Caiya Hanks (Portland Thorns FC; Kailua-Kona, Hawaii), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; Beltsville, Md.), Makenna Morris (Washington Spirit; Germantown, Md.), Riley Tiernan (Angel City FC; Voorhees, N.J.)

The U.S. roster features 15 players who are Under-23 in age, and per an agreement with Germany that is standard for Women's U-23 internationals in Europe, each squad will have five “overage players,” none of whom can be born before Jan. 1, 1999.

Players born in 2002, 2003 and 2004 are age-eligible for this year's U-23 WNT, and this U.S. roster also includes four players born in 2001 -- GK Angelina Anderson, F Mia Fishel, M Samantha Meza, D Kennedy Wesley and one in 2000 -- GK Jordan Silkowitz.

Midfielder Evelyn Shores from the 2024 NCAA Champion University of North Carolina Tar Heels is the only current collegiate player on the roster.

This U-23 camp will be led by University of New Mexico head coach Heather Dyche along with assistant coaches Yolanda Thomas, who is an assistant with the 2024 NWSL Champion Orlando Pride; former USWNT player Stephanie Cox, a 2008 Olympic gold medalist; and long-time U.S. Youth National Team and former San Diego Wave goalkeeper coach Louis Hunt.

U.S women's national team head coach Emma Hayes is taking another step in developing the USWNT player pool. The manager named a 20-player U-23 roster for a training camp and matches in Germany. The two-game series will be played in two stadiums outside of Stuttgart, Germany, on May 30 and June 2. These are the first matches for Hayes' revamped U-23 program in 2025. 

"This is an incredible opportunity for our U-23 player pool to face top tier opponents in Europe and give them the valuable experiences that are much needed," said Hayes. "We want to be very conscious of developing our players through different experiences, and as I have spoken about before, this will take the shape of some players playing in U-23 games and at other times being called in with the WNT. This is because we want to increase the diversity of high-level opponents that they get to compete against, but the methodology and coaching points between the teams will be exactly the same."

The U-23 roster will have its own coaching staff, led by University of New Mexico head coach Heather Dyche. Orlando Pride assistant coach Yolanda Thomas, and former USWNT player Stephanie Cox, a 2008 Olympic gold medalist, will serve as U-23 assistant coaches, alongside U.S. Youth National Team and former San Diego Wave goalkeeper coach Louis Hunt.

The roster has 15 players who are under 23 years old, and in an agreement with Germany and U23 standards in Europe, each roster will have five "over-age" players who can be born before Jan. 1, 1999. 

There are 16 NWSL and three European club pro players on the U23 roster, and only one active college player, University of North Carolina midfielder Evelyn Shores.

Ten players named to the roster have scored in the NWSL this season. Jordyn Bugg and Maddie Dahlien for the Seattle Reign FC, Lilly Reale and Sarah Schupansky for Gotham FC, Kennedy Wesley for the San Diego Wave, Riley Jackson for the North Carolina Courage, Caiya Hanks for Portland Thorns FC, Jameese Joseph for Chicago Stars FC, Makenna Morris for the Washington Spirit and Riley Tiernan for Angel City FC.

Goalkeepers (2): Angelina Anderson (Angel City FC; Danville, Calif.), Jordan Silkowitz (Bay FC; Fairfax, Va.)

Defenders (6): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; El Cajon, Calif.), Lauren Flynn (Utah Royals FC; Arlington, Va.), Emily Mason (Seattle Reign FC; Flemington, N.J.), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; Hingham, Mass.), Evelyn Shores (UNC; Atlanta, Ga.), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; Rossmoor, Calif.)

Midfielders (6): Korbin Albert (Paris Saint-Germain FC, FRA; Grayslake, Ill.), Abi Brighton (Juventus FC, ITA; Beaufort, S.C.), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; Roswell, Ga.), Samantha Meza (Seattle Reign FC; Balch Springs, Texas), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Jaedyn Shaw (North Carolina Courage; Frisco, Texas)

Forwards (6): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; Edina, Minn.), Mia Fishel (Chelsea FC, ENG; San Diego, Calif.), Caiya Hanks (Portland Thorns FC; Kailua-Kona, Hawaii), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; Beltsville, Md.), Makenna Morris (Washington Spirit; Germantown, Md.), Riley Tiernan (Angel City FC; Voorhees, N.J.)

Mauricio Pochettino, head coach of the United States Men's National Team, took part in the 2025 Gold Cup Media Day and shared several insights on the team's current state, the international calendar, and the challenges ahead. One of the main topics discussed was the impact of the new Club World Cup, which will take place at the same time as the Concacaf tournament.

“The Club World Cup doesn't benefit any national team. But we understand how the business of football works, and it's up to us to minimize the damage that can come from overlapping competitions,” said the Argentine coach in a firm tone. 

He added, “This is a situation that forces teams like the U.S., Mexico, Canada, or Panama—whose best players are involved in the Club World Cup—to manage without players who would normally be with us.”

Looking ahead to the Gold Cup, where the USMNT will make its debut on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago, sharing the group with Saudi Arabia and Haiti, Pochettino highlighted the importance of the moment:

“I think it's a great opportunity to be together for an extended period, and that's going to be very helpful for us.” He continued, “This is also a good chance to work with the players we already know and with some who haven't been able to join us due to injuries or other reasons.”

Regarding the recent semifinal loss in the Concacaf Nations League to Panama—and the subsequent defeat in the third-place match against Canada—Pochettino was self-critical but remained hopeful:

“Even in defeat, I think there are many positives we can take away.”

Another major topic was the competition for the goalkeeper position. The lack of playing time for Matt Turner at Crystal Palace sparked debate.

“That position is wide open in our minds. It's open for someone else to step in and challenge,” Pochettino explained. “It's true that Matt's not playing, and we spoke with him to make it clear that, looking toward the future—within a year—he needs to find a way to compete week in, week out.”

Finally, the coach addressed the biggest goal of this cycle: the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

“We're going to host the World Cup, and it's always important to win and build our identity so we can arrive in the best possible shape for that tournament.”

With the 2025 Gold Cup on the horizon, head coach Mauricio Pochettino has sent a clear message to Christian Pulisic and the USMNT regarding his approach to player selection for the tournament.


FIFA has released its latest world rankings, sparking questions about whether the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) and its star player, Christian Pulisic, have taken a hit following a disappointing CONCACAF Nations League campaign. 


The USMNT looks increasingly like a project veering off course, just as the clock begins to tick louder towards the 2026 World Cup. Yet, things are going very wrong — and not just on the pitch.

Tanner Tessmann enjoys defying expectations.

“When I was at FC Dallas at the start of my career, everyone said, ‘Yeah, he's good on the ball but has no idea how to defend',” he says. “So I went to the league that has the best defensive history and learned a lot from them and developed.

“I'm not perfect at all but I learned a lot about how a team defends while I was in Italy, and what they look for; how to maintain the score.

“Then they said, ‘The guy can defend and he's good on the ball but he's too slow and doesn't have the physical aspect'. So I moved to France to play where they're the best with duels and the best athletes in a fast-paced game.

“I try to develop the best I can. I make mistakes and I've got a lot to work on, but I want to be the best I can be.”

At the weekend, Tessmann defied expectations again. Most people had written off his troubled club Lyon's hopes of qualifying for Europe, but they beat Angers 2-0 on the closing day, sneaking into sixth place in Ligue 1, earning a spot in next season's Conference League play-off round or, depending on the result of Saturday's Coupe de France final, a Europa League place.

When he arrived at the Groupama Stadium, the 23-year-old had to contend with a bottleneck of quality — experienced midfielders blocking his way into the first team — but he started against Angers and made 34 appearances in all competitions in his first season at the club.

This summer, Mauricio Pochettino could select him for the USMNT's busy schedule of high-profile friendlies and their Gold Cup campaign after Tessmann furthered his development in European competition this season.

He appeared in nine of Lyon's 12 Europa League games, including their quarter-final second leg against Manchester United, when Lyon fought back with 10 men at Old Trafford only to be knocked out in extra time by United's even more remarkable turnaround, with the game ending 5-4.

“It leaves a bitter taste and leaves me wanting more and the team wanting more,” he says. “Going down to 10 men was a challenge but we still scored a goal and we celebrated a little too early. Credit to them, they came back and believed and scored the goals. It was a crazy ending.”

Lyon's players are getting used to football's capacity for tumult. There have been financial difficulties and, in March, head coach Paulo Fonseca got a nine-month ban after an angry head-to-head confrontation with a referee. It meant Fonseca was barred from the touchline and the officials' changing rooms before, during and after matches, and denied access to the players' changing rooms, pitch and tunnel.

For a squad trying to adapt to the new coach's methods, it was a challenge, but one they overcame regardless. Lyon won six of their 10 league games after the ban (which lasts in part until November).

“He coaches us all week and interacts with us all week and on the game day, he's in the hotel with us and gives us the team talk like always,” explains Tessmann. “Then we go to the game and we're in the locker room and doing our thing. At half-time, we get on a video call with him and he speaks. The club has done a good job managing the situation.

“Obviously it's not the same as when he's on the sideline but in these big games with 50,000 fans, it's hard to hear anyone anyway. His presence is missed but doesn't change so much.

“In the home locker room at our stadium, we have TVs for the half-time call and at away grounds, we make whatever arrangement we can to make it work. Each is different.

“It just becomes normal. The first game was weird because we had just got a new coach and you change your warm-up routine to match how the new coach and his staff do everything, and then had to change again and get used to the new system.

“But it has gone well. If anything, it has just made guys step up more and be leaders at half-time and speak before the game. We have a lot of players who will do that, so it's good.”

For Tessmann, the season has been a welcome learning curve. “We have a lot of experienced players and loads to learn from, not just in my position,” he says. “The midfield is loaded, so playing with those guys has been a pleasure and an honour.

“I've been very close with Nemanja Matic. He took me under his wing and we get along as friends and I learn a lot from him. Corentin Tolisso (a 30-year-old French midfielder who played for Bayern Munich) has a great mentality and the style and way he works have been good to learn from.

“Just watching him from a distance is impressive and gives me a lot to take away.”

Training has been different from his previous team, Venezia, which he left last summer after helping them win promotion to Italy's Serie A. “There is a lot more counter-attacking and transition in France,” he says. “We simulate that during the week, while in Italy it's low- and mid-block defending, keeping the ball and how to move the right way.

“I've improved my high-speed ball control and decisions. Moving to Italy was a big jump and then moving here was another big jump: from Serie B to a big club that fights in European competition. We're expected to win games, it's a different mentality.”

Back in Italy, his friend, compatriot and former Venezia team-mate Gianluca Busio is embroiled in a relegation fight that will go to the last day of the season. Venezia face the daunting task of beating Weston McKennie and Tim Weah's Juventus (who are fighting for Champions League qualification) to have a chance of beating the drop. Other results must also go their way.

Tessmann is defiant. “They can do it,” he says of his former club. “The whole year, everyone was doubting they could stay up, but they're still right there. Anything is possible.

“He (Busio) has done well. He's been playing more attacking, while it used to be me and him as a No 6 and No 8 (holding and central midfielder). It's not easy when you're down at the bottom as a No 10 (attacking midfielder). It's easier when you're a No 6 or No 8 because you can control the game more, but in the position he is, he's done well.”

Tessmann's thoughts will switch to the USMNT now that the domestic campaign is over. He reflects on his upbeat summer in France last year, when he played for a young, impressive United States men's team that reached the quarter-finals of the Olympics.

“We actually stayed in Lyon before we played Guinea and spent four days here with my wife and family,” he says. “I had no idea I'd come here at that stage, nothing was in the works. So when they approached me, I was very open.”

Tessmann has won six caps for the USMNT senior side since the Olympics, experiencing the gamut of emotions in the CONCACAF Nations League; from the quarter-final win against Jamaica to playing in both damaging defeats by Panama in the semi-final and Canada in the third-place play-off.

The experience has left him even hungrier to feature for Pochettino's side more, a desire for repeat call-ups he admits can have differing effects in the run-up to next summer's World Cup. “With the national team growing and players being more active in big European clubs, the competition to be called up is harder and harder.

“So when you are, the mistake is to think you can just do the minimum to be there and not make mistakes or take risks. The thing you need to do is to get on the ball, make things happen and impose yourself and if that comes with my mistakes or bad passes, then it has to be OK.

“I would love to take part in the Gold Cup.”

Off the field, Tessmann has recently become a father to a baby boy called Tennyson, and the joys of parenthood have come with a temporary curb on one of his hobbies.

“I have found some good golf courses around Lyon,” he says. “Lyon has nice hills and woodland and you can design a course with a lot of different elements, but now I have a son, so I won't be playing as much unless he wants to caddy for me. We'll see.”

If Tennyson has his father's appetite for fast learning, he could be carrying Tessmann Senior's clubs sooner rather than later.

Jude Bellingham joined Real Madrid from Borussia Dortmund in 2023

Real Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham is expected to miss at least the first six weeks of next season when he has shoulder surgery after the Club World Cup.

The 21-year-old has struggled with a persistent shoulder problem since 2023 and Real have scheduled the operation for when the tournament in the United States is over.

The former Birmingham City midfielder has worn strapping on his shoulder when playing for England and for his club, having initially missed two games for both Madrid and England at the end of 2023 after injuring his shoulder against Rayo Vallecano.

The expanded 32-team Club World Cup takes place in the United States between 15 June and 13 July.

Bellingham is expected to miss the whole of preseason and at least the first six weeks of the new campaign, which would also mean being absent for England's World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia in September.

On Friday, England boss Thomas Tuchel will name his England squad for June's qualifier against Andorra and friendly against Senegal, with questions remaining about whether or not players due to play in the Club World Cup will be selected.

Bellingham starred in his first season in Spain after signing for £115m from Borussia Dortmund.

He helped Madrid to the La Liga title and Champions League, scoring 23 goals in 43 appearances.

This season, though, he has scored just 14 in 52, with Madrid losing the title to Barcelona and being knocked out of Europe in the quarter-finals by Arsenal.

The American Dream mall is no stranger to large crowds — nor is it a stranger to sporting events. 

That will come in handy as the 2026 FIFA World Cup arrives next summer at MetLife Stadium next door — or in the short term, when the stadium hosts the FIFA Club World Cup this June and July. 

American Dream hopes to capitalize on those crowds, and it plans to lure them to the mall with various activities and promotions this summer and next.

For any soccer matches happening in the next year and a half, “you don't need to bring a cooler full of beer. Why don't you come over to our restaurants and have a great meal?” Paul Ghermezian, a senior executive with Triple Five, which owns American Dream, said in a recent interview. 

Story continues below photo gallery.

He noted that it makes perfect sense for American Dream to piggyback on the games. On the day of soccer matches, patrons will likely spend the entire day in the Meadowlands anyway, for the tailgating and the game. “You're not going for three hours to the game, you're going for the nine hours for the day,” Ghermezian said.

The mall has plenty of experience drawing a crowd centered around specific events. Thousands of patrons came out for JonasCon in March and the opening of a MrBeastBurgers — named after the famous YouTuber MrBeast — in 2022.

In April the mall hosted the grand opening of former NFL quarterback Tom Brady's sports memorabilia store, CardVault by Tom Brady.  

And the mall has hosted a slew of sports-related events. It played host to the Harlem Globetrotters last summer, and plans to host them again in the summer of 2025.

American Dream also hosted the U.S. curling championships in February 2024. 

A spokesperson for USA Curling, which held the 2024 sports tournament in the East Rutherford mall, said the decision to have the matches at American Dream meant thousands of spectators were able to see competitive curling for the first time. 

At 3 million square feet and with a $5 billion price tag, the retail and entertainment venue — more than 30 years in the making between planning, financing and construction — features an indoor water park, an indoor amusement park with roller coasters, a 300-foot Ferris wheel, indoor miniature golf and ice skating, and the only year-round indoor ski and snowboard park in North America.

American Dream also has more than 200 stores — including flagships for Toys R Us and Babies R Us — and over 50 dining options, including fast-casual, sit-down and high-end dining.

Last summer, American Dream also had watch parties, entertainment, giveaways, video games and a soccer turf field for the Copa America tournament. 

The mall is separated from MetLife Stadium by Route 120, but a pedestrian walkway connects the two megastructures. State officials are spending $33 million on a new pedestrian bridge for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“I love to think of them as dry runs, but it's almost nonstop all the time,” Ghermezian said of these events and offerings. “In a sense, everything has been a bit of a dry run.” 

All of it is essentially a buildup for what the mall might host during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. MetLife Stadium will be one of 16 stadiums across North America hosting matches for the World Cup. And MetLife will host the finals on July 19, 2026.

The stadium has a capacity of over 82,000, and Gov. Phil Murphy has said the matches would bring roughly 1 million visitors to the region in 2026.

“Anything that's smaller than FIFA [World Cup] will be a dry run,” said Charles Cristella, executive vice president of retail at real estate services firm JLL.

The big events at MetLife Stadium that would show how the mall can handle itself for the 2026 FIFA World Cup would be the FIFA Club World Cup tournament this June and July, and the WWE SummerSlam wrestling tournament on Aug. 2 and 3. 

Ghermezian didn't say exactly what the mall is doing for either event. It largely depends on which teams end up being in the semifinals and finals. 

He said some retailers at the mall have shown interest in doing events of some kind for the FIFA Club World Cup. And Gregg Schwartz, a spokesperson for the mall, said certain tenants are looking at store openings related to the World Cup and soccer, but he did not provide names. 

“With the World Cup coming, they want to get here in a timely fashion and capitalize on a global audience,” Schwartz said. 

The problem? The lineup for the FIFA Club World Cup will quickly change, Schwartz said.

“You're going to find out around June 25 who's playing here on July 5, 8, 9 and 13,” he said. “But you have the potential of a team like Real Madrid playing here for three games or [Lionel] Messi with [Inter] Miami.

“So all of a sudden, Messi's coming to MetLife Stadium, our phones are ringing off the hook,” Schwartz continued. 

In other words, if news breaks in late June that Messi is coming to MetLife Stadium, fans will flock to the stadium and likely come to American Dream. 

The mall, in turn, would have just a few days or, in the best-case scenario, a couple of weeks to plan, finalize and promote a slew of events and offerings for thousands of international guests. 

During Copa America last summer, American Dream hosted an array of activities ranging from video games to a soccer field and live DJ performance, made possible thanks to the mall's partnership with the American Spanish-language television network Univision.

Schwartz highlighted a previous offering the mall did in November 2022, when American Dream hosted a Trophy Tour with Coca-Cola and numerous soccer stars, including Brazilian player Ricardo Kaká, who met with fans and signed autographs. 

The event featured a tour featuring the World Cup trophy, and it was geared toward young athletes and soccer fans. For the tour, American Dream executives decked out the entire ice rink in soccer field turf. 

Coca-Cola — the sponsor of both American Dream and FIFA — was present at the event, and in the future it can offer product samplings and promotions, Schwartz said. 

In the weeks ahead, the mall is hosting “Pre-Game at the Dream,” which includes specials with 11 restaurants at the mall.

They range from 10% off Little Sheep and Szechuan Opera to $15 combos at MrBeast Burger, $5 beer and $25 buckets at House of Que, and happy hour at Carpaccio. 

Then on the weekend of Aug. 1 to 3, American Dream is hosting a Japanese Sumo wrestling tournament, part of WorldWide Sumo's Power Show.

Can American Dream pull this off? Absolutely, said Cristella, of JLL. And the mall executives think so, too. 

“They are very well-suited,” Cristella said of Triple Five. “This is what this company does. They build massive projects and they appeal to massive crowds, and they know how to handle it.” 

Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, said it “certainly makes sense to lean into these events,” though the mall runs the risk of patrons opting to stay confined to the stadium and not venturing out to American Dream. 

“So basically, the question they face is do they put a lot of effort into working with the events or working around the events,” Matheson said.

Lo'eau LaBonta, known for her tenacious play and colorful personality, was among 24 players invited to USWNT training camp ahead of friendlies against China on May 31 and Jamaica on June 3.

In just one year of coaching the U.S. women's national soccer team, Emma Hayes has extended close to two dozen first-time invitations to training camp. Most have gone to young players seeking a place in the talent pool as the 2027 World Cup draws closer.

At 32, Lo'eau LaBonta did not seem to figure into Hayes's plans. A 10-year NWSL midfielder, the 5-foot-1 LaBonta had built a fine pro career and a big following among fans enamored with her tenacious play and colorful personality.

The Sports Moment newsletter

Tuesday brought a new accolade: a U.S. call-up.

LaBonta was among 24 players named by Hayes to training camp ahead of friendlies against China on May 31 in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Jamaica on June 3 in St. Louis.

“With the volume of young players or less experienced players we're bringing in, I think we have to get that balance right,” Hayes said. “Someone like Lo who, I mean, she's a super player and someone [who] is deserving of that [call-up]. This is the right moment to do it.”

If she plays, LaBonta will become the oldest player to debut in the program's 40-year history. A third of the way through the NWSL season, she has captained and scored three goals for the Kansas City Current, which leads the league with a 7-2-0 record.

LaBonta's only international experience has been with the under-14, under-15 and under-23 squads.

LaBonta was among three invitees who have never played for the national team, joining Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey and Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello, both 25.

Last month, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, a 28-year-old goalkeeper from Manchester United, made her U.S. debut in a 2-0 victory over Brazil.

This camp marks the return of Chelsea's Naomi Girma, a world-class center back who has yet to play this year because of a calf injury. Other veteran call-ups include midfielders Lindsey Heaps and Sam Coffey, defenders Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox and forward Lynn Biyendolo.

Four of the seven forwards on the roster are 22 or younger. Four teenagers received invitations: midfielders Lily Yohannes (17), Olivia Moultrie (19) and Claire Hutton (19) and winger Gisele Thompson (19).

No members of the vaunted “Triple Espresso” front line are on the squad. Trinity Rodman received an excused absence from the Washington Spirit after reinjuring her back this spring, and Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson are on maternity leave.

Hayes said she speaks with Rodman regularly but does not know when she will return.

“We want to ensure she's not carrying that pain any further, and I think we're definitely heading in the right direction,” Hayes said. “I don't know when she will be back, but I know Trin is being given all the support by everyone, and we very much hope for a speedy recovery.”

Midfielder Rose Lavelle and defender Tierna Davidson are unavailable because of injuries.

The U.S. Soccer Federation is also planning to announce an under-23 roster Wednesday for two away friendlies against Germany in the coming weeks.

Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United).

Defenders: Kerry Abello (Orlando Pride), Crystal Dunn (Paris Saint-Germain), Emily Fox (Arsenal), Naomi Girma (Chelsea), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash), Emily Sams (Orlando), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC).

Midfielders: Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City), Olivia Moultrie (Portland), Lily Yohannes (Ajax).

Forwards: Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City), Catarina Macario (Chelsea), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville), Ally Sentnor (Utah), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City), Gisele Thompson (Angel City).

PARIS - Bianca Andreescu's comeback hit a snag Wednesday when she was bounced from the second round of the French Open qualifying tournament.

The 17th seed from Mississauga, Ont., had match point against Japan's Nao Hibino up 5-3 in the second set. But she failed to convert, and Hibino came back for a 2-6, 7-6(5), 6-4 victory on the clay courts of Roland Garros that took two hours 31 minutes to complete.

Andreescu was one of three Canadians eliminated from qualifying Wednesday at the second Grand Slam of the tennis season.

Germany's Tamara Korpatsch cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 victory over 24th seed Marina Stakusic of Mississauga, and 10th seed Rebeka Masarova of Switzerland was a comfortable 6-0, 6-3 winner over Carson Branstine, a Californian who represents Canada internationally.

The 24-year-old Andreescu, a former world No. 4 and the 2019 U.S. Open champion, is back on the court after a nearly six-month layoff after she underwent emergency appendix surgery in February. She has had some success this year on clay — which she has said is not her strongest surface — including a run to the fourth round of the WTA 1000 Italian Open earlier this month.

Rising star Victoria Mboko of Toronto, the last Canadian alive in qualifying, plays a second-round match Thursday against Kathinka von Deichmann of Liechtenstein.

Elsewhere, Felix Auger-Aliassime of Montreal defeated Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard of France 6-4, 6-2 in the second round of the Hamburg Open.

Auger-Aliassime, seeded sixth in Hamburg, is using the ATP 500 tournament as a tune-up for the French Open after he withdrew from the Italian Open with a sore back. He will next face France's Alexandre Muller, who advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (5) upset of top seed Alexander Zverev.

The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York, where the US Open is held, will undergo a major $800 million renovation. This would be the largest single investment in the history of the US Open.

This self-funded project by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) aims to update the famous Arthur Ashe Stadium and incorporate a state-of-the-art player performance facility. The renovation aims to improve the experience for fans, players, and partners while confirming the venue's position as a top worldwide tennis attraction.

Arthur Ashe Stadium, the center court stadium and the largest tennis stadium in the world, with a capacity of approximately 24,000, will undergo a $550 million interior rebuild. The stadium will receive modernised concourses to add new retail, food, and beverage spaces. It will also gain 2,000 new courtside-level bowl seats, expanding seating in that area from 3,000 to 5,000 seats, bringing more fans closer to the action. The seating capacity will remain stable and won't increase or decrease. There will also be two luxury suite levels and new dining options. 

A $250 million, four-story player performance center will be built adjacent to Arthur Ashe Stadium and connected by a sky bridge. The center will have bigger locker rooms, indoor and outdoor warm-up areas, a new dedicated cafe for players, and relaxation areas to meet the needs of today's athletes, who frequently travel with coaches, trainers, physiotherapists, and families.

The renovation will unfold in three carefully planned phases to ensure minimal disruption to the 2025 and 2026 US Open tournaments and be ready by the 2027 event. Rossetti, a Detroit-based firm, is leading the renovation. It is also the architectural firm behind Arthur Ashe Stadium's original design in the 1990s and the 2014–2018 upgrades.

The redesigned USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center will preserve its reputation as a tennis mecca while redefining itself as a vibrant entertainment and cultural hub. By 2027, fans can enjoy a more immersive and comfortable experience, players will benefit from cutting-edge facilities, and the US Open will cement its reputation as a world-class spectacle in the heart of New York City.

Danielle Collins pulled off a second three-set win of the week at the Internationaux de Strasbourg, the 2024 finalist rallying to defeat Emma Raducanu, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.“I think it's more rewarding when you win a tough match versus one that was easy,” Collins said on court after the match. “A lot of times when you win easy, it's just about how bad the other player played, right? So, it's better if it can be a little bit close to come out with these wins.”The former world No. 7 shook off losing a long game late in the third and, fired up by a too-close-for-comfort cameraman, reeled off the final three games of match, knocking out the 2021 US Open champion in two hours and 21 minutes.“I knew playing Emma, I would have to play my aggressive game style,” she said, “and the more that I did that, I think I was able to kind of stay in control of the points and really push her. She played really well and gave me some challenges but I just kept going after it.”Collins is in the midst of an encore season after initially planning to make 2024 her final year on tour. She made up for a delayed start to her red-clay swing with a big win at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, dethroning defending champion Iga Swiatek in straight sets en route to the fourth round.

I'm not meek and mild. I'm not someone that is going through life quietly...I know what it takes to succeed, and at this level, you have to compete...It's about bringing the energy, showing positive emotions, sometimes showing negative emotion and being upset with yourself, but then trying to work through those moments. Danielle Collins

Unseeded in Strasbourg, she battled past in-form fellow American Sofia Kenin in the first round to book an intriguing clash against a resurgent Raducanu, who enjoyed a fourth-round run of her own at the Foro Italico just last week.Raducanu opened her Strasbourg campaign with an impressive upset over No. 6 seed Daria Kasatkina, and edged through the opening set over Collins before finding herself on the back for in the second, later calling for an injury timeout.Collins looked to consolidate a break advantage early in the decider but Raducanu kept battling, leveling the set at three games apiece. Collins stepped in to break right back and spent the ensuing changeover standing up for herself and Raducanu, imploring a encroaching cameraman to step back as they attempted to rehydrate.“We're on a changeover,” she told the cameraman, who was stationed between the two players. “You don't need to be that close to me and you don't need to be on top of Emma. It's wildly inappropriate.”Spurred on by the incident, Collins roared through the match's conclusion, breaking once more to clinch the win in just under two and a half hours.

Collins is into her second WTA quarterfinal of the 2025 season, having reached the last eight in Charleston in April.

“I think to be good at anything, self-expression is really important. There's not too many successful people in the world that feel like they can't be themselves. I think you have to be yourself, and I'm a competitor at the end of the day. I'm not meek and mild. I'm not someone that is going through life quietly, and I want to succeed.

But at the end of the day, if you go out and try to be yourself, compete hard and do the best you can, good things to happen.”Awaiting the American in the last eight will be Anna Kalinskaya, who turned the tabled on top seed Jessica Pegula to advance in three sets.

Though he will not be playing, the 2025 French Open will still be a memorable one for Rafael Nadal.

The 14-time winner of the clay court Grand Slam bid farewell to tennis following Spain's exit from the Davis Cup finals in November 2024.

The Spaniard's appearance at Roland Garros as a player came a year ago when he was beaten by Alexander Zverev in the opening round.

With his career now over, Nadal will appear at his most successful tournament where he will be honoured with a special tribute ceremony, which former rival Andy Roddick is looking forward to.

Rafael Nadal's record of 14 French Open titles is one that may very well never be broken.

He dominated this Parisian Grand Slam, winning 112 matches and losing just four throughout his illustrious career.

Therefore, it is only fitting that the tournament honours its greatest ever player, and that will take place in a special tribute ceremony for Nadal on May 25, the opening day of the French Open.

During an episode of his ‘Served' podcast, Roddick shared his thoughts on the upcoming event and expects some of the 22-time Grand Slam winner's greatest rivals such as Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to be present.

“Obviously the ceremony is a no-brainer. The Davis Cup one kind of felt weird. That's not the way his career should have ended in my opinion,” Roddick said.

“They wanted all the guys to come and by there but I was with Roger a couple of weeks ago and he was like you don't know what day he plays and then if he plays and wins, they wanted us to come on the Thursday, but if he loses on a Tuesday, it was all just messy.

“This is great. Sunday at Roland Garros. Let's kick off the tournament. I expect all the people to be there. I expect Roger to be there. I am sure Novak will be there. I am sure this will be the way his retirement should be celebrated on that court.”

Nadal developed a reputation for being an intense player with a fierce competitive nature.

In fact, he is regarded by many as the greatest competitor that the sport has ever seen and his ability to stay resilient helped win him plenty of matches when he was below his best level.

Off court however Nadal is a more reserved individual and prefers not to be as much in the spotlight. But he understands the gravity of what he achieved at the French Open and why he is being honoured with a special ceremony. 

“I'm not much for tributes, but Roland-Garros is obviously the most important place in my career, without a doubt,” said Nadal.

Nao Hibino came from match point down to upset Bianca Andreescu in the second round of Roland Garros qualifying.

Japan's Nao Hibino ended No. 17 seed Bianca Andreescu's return to Roland Garros qualifying after pulling off a remarkable second-round comeback to win 2-6, 7-6(5), 6-4 in 2 hours and 31 minutes. Hibino saved one match point trailing 5-3 in the second set.

Andreescu had opened her qualifying campaign with the first 6-0, 6-0 win of her career over Yao Xinxin. She picked up where she left off in a dominant first set against Hibino, carving a series of winning drop shots and deploying fine variety from the baseline. No. 200-ranked Hibino found some form to take a 3-1 lead in the second set, but Andreescu responded by powering through the next four games in a row to reach the brink of victory.

However, Hibino fired an inside-in forehand winner from deep beyond the baseline to save match point, and from that point on began to deliver some brilliant all-court tennis to turn the match in her favor. The former No. 56 and three-time WTA titlist began to read Andreescu's game and come up with answers for everything: flat counter-punching from the baseline to wrong-foot the Canadian, canny net approaches to cut off volleys and her own deft counter-drop shots.

Hibino played a magnificent return game to break Andreescu for 5-5, then from 5-2 down in the tiebreak reeled off five straight points to level the match. A pair of Andreescu forehand errors opened the door, but at 5-5 in the tiebreak, Hibino stepped up with a pair of superb backhand winners to snatch the set.

A barnburner of a third set saw Hibino capture the only break for 3-2 as Andreescu sent a backhand wide. Both players ended the match with positive ratios of winners to unforced errors -- Hibino tallying 30 to 24, and Andreescu 43 to 33. Hibino will next bid for a place in her seventh Roland Garros main draw against No. 12 seed Ella Seidel, who defeated Panna Udvardy 3-6, 6-2, 6-3.

Midway through Day 3, heavy rain halted action. But three wild three-setters managed to get over the line before play was called on all courts.

Nao Hibino came from match point down to upset Bianca Andreescu in the second round of Roland Garros qualifying.

The numbers are in: Swiatek remains the benchmark, but Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini have all made major clay-court moves in a reshuffled Top 15 heading into the season's second Slam.

As Roland Garros approaches, we've refreshed our Clay-Court Power Rankings -- a data-backed look at who's been best on the surface over the past five seasons. This updated “Clay Index” reflects a weighted calculation of clay-court performance:

The result is a sharper picture of both form and longevity, showing not just who's had the best spring, but who's owned the surface across multiple seasons.

The clay queen remains in a league of her own. Swiatek tops the chart with an eye-popping index of 9336.75 -- nearly 4,000 points clear of her closest rival. Her supremacy is built on titles, consistency and an unmatched ability to win in Paris. Swiatek has won a clay-court title in each of the past five seasons, but for the first time in that stretch, she heads to Roland Garros without one.

Sabalenka holds firm at No. 2 with 5759.25 points, thanks to deep runs at key WTA 1000 events. She has yet to win Roland Garros, but her form on clay is trending up after winning the WTA 1000 title in Madrid.

Coco Gauff sits third with 4,322.75 points, buoyed by steady clay-court results over the past two seasons. She's reached at least the quarterfinals 11 times on clay since 2021 -- behind only Swiatek and Sabalenka. Close behind, 2024 Roland Garros finalist Jasmine Paolini rises to No. 4 with 3,219.5 points, thanks in large part to her breakthrough title in Rome.

A pair of 2024 Roland Garros quarterfinalists are next in line. Ons Jabeur narrowly holds the No. 5 spot over Elena Rybakina -- 2763.5 to 2675.75. Jabeur has reached five clay-court finals since 2021, but her most recent final came two years ago in Charleston. This season, Jabeur lost in the opening rounds at Madrid and Rome, but with back-to-back quarterfinals runs at Roland Garros, Jabeur has a proven track record of success on clay.

While the Clay Index captures performance based on points earned, raw win totals offer a complementary snapshot of volume and reliability on the surface. No surprise:  Swiatek leads the tour with 81 wins on clay since 2021, followed by Sabalenka (62) and Gauff (58). These three are not only consistent deep-round threats. They've also simply played and won more than anyone else on the dirt.

Here are the top WTA players in total clay-court wins over the past four seasons:

 

 

The numbers are in: Swiatek remains the benchmark, but Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini have all made major clay-court moves in a reshuffled Top 15 heading into the season's second Slam.

I still continue to have support of the closest people in my life, which is the most meaningful thing to me. Without that, I wouldn't be probably able to keep the balance. Novak Djokovic

Last week, the current world No. 6 was in Belgrade for the unveiling of a special project his sponsor Lacoste partnered on with Novak Djokovic Foundation. The two organizations introduced an extraordinary “Novak Djokovic Court,” commemorating the hero to so many.Gracing the sides of the doubles alleys are two lines of text: one reads Novak the GOAT, next to an action silhouette of Djokovic, and opposite features Novak the Croc to pair with Lacoste's trademark logo. A giant portrait of Nole fist-pumping bleeds into an adjacent multi-purpose basketball and volleyball court that documents his 24 title runs across the four Grand Slam host cities.

The location couldn't be more fitting, for the facility sits next to the Djokovic foundation's headquarters and pays homage to its namesake's tennis roots. The end goal of the complex's opening aligns with Djokovic's ongoing mission to encourage future generations to fully embrace an active lifestyle, and follows in the footsteps of similar Lacoste initiatives that included collaborations with Gustavo Kuerten and Daniil Medvedev.“Those are the some of the courts in which I grew up playing junior tournaments. It was a great job done by creative artists and something that was very close to my heart, obviously,” Djokovic reflected with TENNIS.com. “It's a way of giving back to the community, contributing to better and more exciting access to public courts.“I always have been and I always will be a proponent of outdoor activities. Trying to get young children and young people out on the courts, sports facilities, fields, trying to engage in as many outdoor activities as possible. There's no better, healthier environment or development for them to do so.”

It's a different chapter of my life that I'm trying to navigate myself through.

Seeded second behind fourth-ranked Taylor Fritz, Djokovic faces Marton Fucsovics in his opening match Wednesday evening. Revenge opportunities potentially await against his Madrid conqueror, Matteo Arrnaldi, and third seed Tomas Machac, who won their Geneva semifinal last year.With his family set to pack the stands, Djokovic will be energized to begin a fresh streak of momentum ahead of launching another bid for major title No. 25 in the French capital.“I still continue to have support of the closest people in my life, which is the most meaningful thing to me. Without that, I wouldn't be probably able to keep the balance,” said Djokovic.“I know what it takes to be a Grand Slam champion. I know what it takes to be at the top of the game. It's a big commitment, a big dedication and it's not as smooth and easy for me as it was 10 years ago. My life has changed a lot, but for better, to be honest. It's just a new chapter that I'm embracing. I'm still connected to tennis and still want to express myself on the court.”

I'm not particularly used to having this kind of circumstance where I would lose consecutive matches (in) first rounds and so forth. I don't think it ever happened for me in like the last 20 years. But I knew that eventually that moment will come.“Of course, I'm very pleased and proud of my entire career, but I still have a desire to reach the greatest heights, to win Slams and to be one of the best players in the world. That's why I'm here, that's why I'm playing Geneva.”

Seeded second behind fourth-ranked Taylor Fritz, Djokovic faces Marton Fucsovics in his opening match Wednesday evening. Revenge opportunities potentially await against his Madrid conqueror, Matteo Arrnaldi, and third seed Tomas Machac, who won their Geneva semifinal last year.With his family set to pack the stands, Djokovic will be energized to begin a fresh streak of momentum ahead of launching another bid for major title No. 25 in the French capital.“I still continue to have support of the closest people in my life, which is the most meaningful thing to me. Without that, I wouldn't be probably able to keep the balance,” said Djokovic.“I know what it takes to be a Grand Slam champion. I know what it takes to be at the top of the game. It's a big commitment, a big dedication and it's not as smooth and easy for me as it was 10 years ago. My life has changed a lot, but for better, to be honest. It's just a new chapter that I'm embracing. I'm still connected to tennis and still want to express myself on the court.”

The 2025 French Open is now just days away, as the stars of women's tennis finish up their pre-tournament preparations.

Several WTA players will head to Roland Garros with genuine title ambitions as the field appears more open than ever.

Three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek would be the obvious pick, but her form in 2025 has left many questioning her title-winning credentials.

The world number one could be primed to take advantage, having already picked up a title on clay this year, when Aryna Sabalenka won the Madrid Open.

Italian Open finalists Jasmine Paolini and Coco Gauff could also be contenders, having impressed fans with their clay court prowess in Rome recently.

As the saying goes, ‘You have to be in it to win it,' and those players who fail to join the 128-woman draw will have to wait until 2026 to have a shot at French Open glory.

The 2019 US Open champion has just lost in qualifying, as she failed to convert match points that would've seen her move one step closer to the main draw.

Canada's Bianca Andreescu returned to the WTA Tour at the beginning of the clay season and secured several impressive wins.

Winning her opening match in French Open qualifying, Andreescu was just two wins away from a spot in the Roland Garros main draw.

Unfortunately, it wasn't to be for the 24-year-old, as she lost to Japan's Nao Hibino, 6-2, 6-7, 4-6, despite leading 6-2, 5-3, 40-30 in the second set.

She may take some solace from her current ranking, however, knowing that if she continues to play as well as she has since returning in April, she likely won't need to qualify for Wimbledon.

Ranked 102nd in the world, Andreescu would likely qualify directly for the main draw of the next Grand Slam, in large part thanks to her impressive run in Rome.

Andreescu secured two impressive seeded victories at the Italian Open before coming up short against China's Qinwen Zheng in the fourth round.

Andreescu's win over Elena Rybakina in the third round was by far her most impressive since returning, as she dominated the 2023 champion in straight sets.

Beating the Kazakh in such convincing fashion reminded many of the Andreescu who won the US Open title six years ago, form that she'd no doubt love to rediscover in 2025.

In 2019, Andreescu made her Flushing Meadows debut, entering the event as the number 15 seed, having won her home Canadian Open one month earlier.

To the surprise of many, Andreescu qualified for the final in New York, taking advantage as the top seeds fell during the early stages of the tournament.

There, she came face to face with six-time champion Serena Williams, who was forced to retire from her previous meeting with Andreescu after just four games during the Canadian Open final.

Producing her best tennis on the biggest occasion, Andreescu upset the legend, lifting her maiden Major title with a 6-3, 7-5 win on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Andreescu became the first player to win the US Open title on her main draw debut, a feat matched by Emma Raducanu two years later.

The Canadian hasn't returned to a Grand Slam final since, and has only returned to the fourth round of a Major tournament once, at the 2021 US Open.

Andreescu wasn't the only notable WTA star vying for a spot in the French Open main draw through qualifying.

2012 French Open finalist Sara Errani won her opening match in qualifying and will now take on Anna-Lena Friedsam in the second round.

Andreescu's fellow Canadian has also been in action, as teenage prospect Victoria Mboko beat Sinja Kraus in her opener and awaits Liechtenstein's Kathinka Von Deichmann when she returns to the court.

Mboko has impressed in 2025, taking sets off of Paula Badosa in Miami and Coco Gauff in Rome.

Errani and Mboko are scheduled to play their second round qualifying matches on Wednesday, May 21.

Novak Djokovic admitted his time alongside coach Andy Murray ended because the pair “couldn't get more out of that partnership on court.”

Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray was a shock hire at the back-end of last year for one of his greatest rivals in Djokovic, with the pair working together for the Australian Open in January.

Djokovic impressed in Melbourne, beating Carlos Alcaraz before being forced to withdraw from his semi-final due to injury. The pair continued their partnership through hard cout events in Indian Wells and Miami, where Djokovic reached the final, and the first two clay court tournaments of the year in Monte-Carlo and Madrid.

However, after Djokovic lost his first match at both events, the pair confirmed the end of their time together last week. The French Open starts on Sunday, 25 May.

"We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it,” Djokovic said, ahead of playing in the Geneva Open this week.

"My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person.

"I think he has a brilliant tennis IQ, he has a very rare mind of a champion that obviously has achieved what he has achieved, and he sees the game incredibly well."

Djokovic, who is eyeing a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam in Paris, is also targeting a 100th tour title this week in Geneva.

The Serb, who turns 38 on Thursday, is joined this week by Dusan Vemic, a previous member of his team, and assistant coach Boris Bosnjakovic.

Djokovic has previously worked with Boris Becker and Goran Ivanisevic, but insists he is in no rush to appoint a new permanent coach.

"At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach," Djokovic said. "I don't need to rush in any context. I feel comfortable with the people around me.

"In the next few tournaments, we'll see what happens."

Djokovic has not won a title since claiming gold at the Paris Olympics last summer, which took place on the clay courts of Roland-Garros.

The French Open qualifiers are in full swing as a host of players work hard to try and ensure their name is in the draw when it's made tomorrow. 

After an enthralling Australian Open back in January, it's felt like a long time coming for another Grand Slam to kick off, but the waiting stops on Sunday. 

Novak Djokovic is looking for a fourth French Open title and a 25th in total as he bids to end his long wait to get his hands back on one of the game's biggest prizes. 

The Serbian legend defeated Carlos Alcaraz in an epic quarter-final in Melbourne, but injury forced him to withdraw in the semi-finals against Alexander Zverev.

During that tournament, Djokovic was full of praise for his first-round opponent, and he might be somewhat surprised to hear what has happened to him ahead of the French Open. 

The American player caught the eye at the Australian Open when he put up a valiant fight against Djokovic during their first-round tussle. 

Basavareddy threatened to send shockwaves across the tennis world, winning the first set before succumbing to Djokovic's brilliance and losing in four. 

The 20-year-old won't get another crack at a Grand Slam at the French Open, however, after he was surprisingly beaten in qualifying earlier this week. 

Basavareddy went down in three sets to Argentine player Andrea Collarini, losing 5-7, 7-5, 4-6, to fail to make the main draw at Roland Garros. 

The Serb has never been shy in offering praise to players making their way in the game, and he was under no illusions that Basavareddy gave him a bit of a fright in Melbourne. 

After beating the American, he said: “Well, to be honest, I don't know much about him. I watched him play yesterday actually, for the first time. I think he's played the semi-finals of the New Zealand tournament. 

“I saw that he's very quick. He's a very talented player. He's got great hands. He's very dynamic. He can serve well, hit spots. Just a very complete game overall.”

Now, Basavareddy will turn his attentions to the grass court season and he will surely head to Roehampton where he will try and qualify for that Grand Slam.

Playing her first Grand Slam qualifying event in six years, Bianca Andreescu was in no mood to hang around. The former US Open champion raced into the second round of Roland Garros qualifying, whitewashing China's Yao Xinxin 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes.

The result was the first 6-0, 6-0 win of Andreescu's professional career. The last time she won a match 6-0, 6-0 at any level was in Junior Billie Jean King Cup in 2016 over Watsachol Sawatdee. Previously, she had notched two 6-0, 6-1 wins in professional events: over Ari Matsumoto in the first round of the 2018 Gifu ITF W25, and over Garbiñe Muguruza in the 2019 Indian Wells quarterfinals.

Andreescu last contested the preliminary rounds of a major at the 2019 Australian Open, where she qualified and reached the second round. She would end that season in the Top 5 as the reigning champion of Indian Wells, Toronto and the US Open, but has struggled with injury and illness since. This is just the fifth tournament of Andreescu's season following an appendectomy in February, and she is currently ranked No. 102. Last week, she reached the fourth round of Rome, notching two Top 20 wins over Donna Vekic and Elena Rybakina en route.

Andreescu has contested Roland Garros qualifying twice previously, falling to Tereza Smitkova in the 2017 first round and Richel Hogenkamp in the 2018 third round. Her best main-draw performances at the tournament to date are third-round finishes in 2023 and 2024.

There was a gulf in experience between Andreescu and Yao, the 21-year-old who notched her first tour-level win in Jiujiang last October and who was playing the first Grand Slam qualifying event of her career. The Canadian did not face game point in the first set, repeatedly exposing Yao's movement on clay with a series of drop shots. No. 261-ranked Yao improved in the second set, but could not take advantage of three points to hold serve.

"I felt really good coming here," said Andreescu afterwards. "It's the French open -- no matter what match you play in whatever draw, it's a very important match. I was very pleased with my attitude today."

Andreescu, the No. 17 seed in the qualifying draw, will next face former No. 56 Nao Hibino, who defeated Andrea Lazaro Garcia 7-6(4), 6-4. Elsewhere, Andreescu's Canadian compatriot and the partner with whom she won the 2017 Australian Open and Roland Garros girls' doubles titles, Carson Branstine, notched her first career major qualifying win 6-4, 6-2 over Whitney Osuigwe.

Two of Day 1's longest matches were won by local wild cards who thrilled the Parisian crowd in a pair of rollercoaster epics. Margaux Rouvroy -- who previously upset Sofia Kenin in the 2023 qualifying first round -- needed 3 hours and 40 minutes to defeat Japan's Haruka Kaji 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-6[3], sinking to her knees after triumphing in a gruelling clay-court battle.

The No. 248-ranked Frenchwoman lost the first set after holding one set point in the tiebreak, was two points from defeat trailing 5-4 in the second set and held her first two match points at 5-4 in the decider before outlasting Kaji in the super-tiebreak.

Earlier, Carole Monnet had pulled off an unlikely comeback against Croatia's No. 11 seed Petra Martic. The 23-year-old trailed Martic by a set and 3-1, but reeled in the former quarterfinalist 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 in 2 hours and 35 minutes.

There was better fortune for Croatia in the second-longest match of Day 1, Jana Fett's 6-2, 4-6, 7-6[10] defeat of Priscilla Hon in 2 hours and 45 minutes. Fett came back from 3-0 down in the third set, and saved one match point in the super-tiebreak.

                The US Open is set to transform ahead of the 2027 edition with a revamped look!            

The US Open is one of the four most prestigious tournaments in tennis, along with the Australian Open, French Open, and Wimbledon. Being that last Grand Slam of the year, the US Open, held in New York, is one of the more fun and energetic events on the tennis calendar. 

Situated in the heart of America's eastern coast, the final major of the year generates buzz and excitement due to its location, late-night match euphoria amongst the crowd, and other activities to keep fans constantly engaged. 

Now, however, the developers of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center have decided to add another level of entertainment and comfort for players and fans alike with a renovation project set to take place. 

The USTA is pouring $800M into a major upgrade of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center — its biggest investment yet 🎾✔️ Arthur Ashe Stadium overhaul✔️ New multistory player performance center✔️ Upgraded fan experienceMORE — https://t.co/L160Hxw0o6 pic.twitter.com/kVG3pFiQe2

The $800 million project is said to be the largest one to date at the year's last major, and work is said to be carried out in three phases. While ensuring that the play is not affected, the current plan aims to complete the entire project prior to the start of the tournament in 2027.

On the cards for the renovation is the reimagined Arthur Ashe Stadium, which is set to undergo modernization and enhancement of the entrance. The plans also include additions to restrooms, escalators, and elevators, along with modifications to the food and beverages sections.

Around $250 million will be spent on developing a new, state-of-the-art facility known as the Player Performance Center for the players and their teams. This facility will consist of both indoor and outdoor relaxation areas, new locker rooms, and player lounges. 

As for the fans, the renovations will enhance the premiumness with better seating, 2,000 additional seats, and two levels of luxury suites. Courtyard seats are expected to increase from the current capacity of 3,000 to 6,000.

As per reports, this project is completely self-funded, and there is no amount of public funding involved. The city reaps the benefit of the tournament, which generates around $1.2 billion of economic impact on a yearly basis. 

The developers have taken on an ambitious project, to say the least, but once the remodeling is done, there is no doubt that Flushing Meadows will be transformed into a much more iconic venue than what it already is today.

Tennis is a ‘fun hobby' for the player looking to add to grand slams won in SW19 and at the Australian Open

It's slightly unusual to hear Henry Patten – along with Harri Heliövaara, the reigning men's doubles champion at Wimbledon and the Australian Open – call tennis a “fun hobby”. But then you spend time in his company and realise he is slightly unusual.

Patten, 29, was not supposed to be a professional, never mind a grand slam winner. Though he played county level as a child, he enjoyed various sports as a teenager before a tennis scholarship to Culford School in Suffolk – “I don't know how we weaselled that!” – inspired him to attend college in North Carolina, where he read economics.

“We'd have two hours' training in the afternoon, a foreign concept to me,” he says. “That was where I learned how to be a professional without really understanding what was happening, because I was having a good time.”

Patten, a late developer missed at every level, evidences a flawed system. Though he acknowledges that “it's pretty tough to see a hundred 12-year-olds and say which'll be a champion”, even when he excelled in the US no one paid attention. “I came home and the first professional event, someone from the LTA came up and said: ‘Who are you?' I didn't know how to take that.”

So he agreed to join Ernst & Young as a technology risk consultant, but was saved by the pandemic, doing well enough in bubble events for his family to insist he pursued tennis seriously. “Thank goodness they talked me around otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here. A friend works at EY and he's absolutely miserable, whereas any time I'm upset or struggling, I can play tennis. It completely engrosses you and takes your mind off whatever else is going on.”

Patten's calm sense of perspective is striking, but a debut grand slam final is of a palpably different order – especially for an unseeded, unknown Briton in SW19. “The first time we played Wimbledon I was trying to act like I wasn't nervous at all, and we lost very quickly, so now I let the nerves be there,” he says. “But this time I couldn't stop smiling, it's the coolest thing ever. Walking down the corridor, past the trophies and underneath the Kipling quote, it feels like the absolute pinnacle of anything.”

Emerging to a crowd, though, is different – “You want that moment to last for ever, don't really want to start playing tennis” – and as the contest intensified into an unfathomable epic, the atmosphere became equally feverish. “The whole way we were clinging on desperately,” Patten tells me, “so I didn't feel much pressure until the last point, and Harri hit a great first serve – I didn't even touch the ball.”

After which, mayhem. “What was amazing was I had everyone in my box,” Patten says, “and they all had the same face on that I had on … the craziest, best feeling ever, a home crowd going completely ballistic, everyone's just nuts. To create those emotions in people, it's an absolute honour.”

In Melbourne, six months later, it was Patten tasked with settling another classic: “I felt a lot more pressure thinking blindly, ‘Serve it out, just serve it out.' I went completely blank so Harri came and said, ‘Your serve is great, serve here; I'm going to go here,' which usually the server would dictate. I served an ace and said, ‘OK, now tell me how to serve on this one.”

Before teaming up with Finland's Heliövaara, Patten partnered fellow Briton Julian Cash, eventually realising that he had to be ruthless to progress. “One of those difficult conversations you just have to have, and we had it. What's unusual is we're still friends and we've got seven Brits in the doubles top 50, which is unbelievable – it's a golden age.”

Doubles, though, suffers from a chronic lack of funding, coverage and care, despite proof – exemplified by Patten's experiences – that people love it. “It's a team sport, so you've got different tactics,” he explains when asked to pitch it. “You see a lot more variation in the shots – singles is mainly baseline rallies, but doubles has net play with quick hands, it's absolute carnage.

“Singles, you have a pretty strong idea of who's going to win, whereas doubles, everything's out of the window … I know friends of years who split up and hate each other. Fundamentally, you're dealing with extremely competitive 30-year-old men who travel the world together – it's a recipe for disaster!”

Patten also has a vision for change, citing padel as an example. “There's always a good energy. Most sports, the spectacle is great but it's really about being with friends and having a nice time, so you could turn doubles into something different, with music and free crowd movement. Doubles has a great chance of becoming this unique, fun event … if the authorities let it.”

The hit Formula 1 documentary series Drive to Survive has picked up another prestigious award, after winning an Emmy on Tuesday.

The Netflix programme won the “Outstanding Sports Documentary Series – Serialised” category at the Sports Emmy's for Series 6, which covered the 2023 F1 season.

It's the second time the Box to Box Films-produced show has won this award, after also picking it up in 2022.

Since launching with the first series back in 2019, Drive To Survive has become a massive global hit, with a cumulative audience of over 700 million people.

Series 6 covered Max Verstappen's third championship triumph in a dominant year for the Dutchman when he won 19 of the 22 Grands Prix across the season and romped home to the title.

“Obviously you're not talking about a season where there's a massive title rivalry, so really it's interesting watching the fight for second, third, fourth taking place,” Executive Producer James Gay-Rees told Formula1.com at the time.

"We went into it slightly worried that because Red Bull were so dominant it might be a little bit skinny, but actually it's not. We even nearly did more episodes than we normally do because we had quite a lot of stories to tell.

“I get for the casual viewer that it may get a bit repetitive with Max winning every weekend, but I do think, in hindsight, people are going to understand what an amazing driver he is."

Series 7 of Drive to Survive was released in March of this year, and all seven seasons are available to watch now on Netflix.

Sofia Coppola is recalling the moment she realized “The Virgin Suicides” was an iconic film — and it's all thanks to Leslie Mann and Maude Apatow.

Coppola told i-D during the 25th anniversary of her 2000 directorial debut that she had no idea Gen Z was aware of the film until she was on set for her 2013 feature “The Bling Ring.” During production, actress Mann cited how her daughter was a fan of the film. Mann has two daughters with husband and collaborator Judd Apatow: Maude and Iris Apatow. At the time of “The Bling Ring,” the eldest Maude would have been 16, the same age as the Lisbon sisters in Coppola's adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel. (Coppola had previously confirmed to Vogue that Maude Apatow is fan.)

When asked if “a fan or someone [has] come up to you and said something that's really left a mark about your work or the meaning that it's had on them,” Coppola cited her discussion with Mann. “I was working on a project with Leslie Mann and she said ‘My daughter loves your movie “The Virgin Suicides.”‘ This was maybe 12 years ago,” Coppola said. “I was like, ‘How does she even know about that? She wasn't even born then.' It was long before TikTok. I was just really surprised, and it made me so happy.”

Coppola continued of “The Virgin Suicides,” which premiered at Cannes, “Nobody saw it when it came out, but now there is a generation of girls that rediscovered it. I am very moved that girls today still connect to it. I never thought that it would mean so much and be something that so many people connected to.” 

The film, despite grossing just under $5 million in the U.S. against a $9 million budget, later became a cult classic synonymous with the melancholic realization that teenage longing and ennui can extend into adulthood. The film went on to also influence the aesthetics of female-focused melancholic adolescent series, such as “Euphoria,” which stars Maude Apatow.

Coppola previously told ELLE that she and lead star Kirsten Dunst have plans to mark the 25th anniversary of “The Virgin Suicides.” (Dunst and Coppola have reunited on features “Marie Antoinette” and “The Beguiled.”)

“I think Kirsten [Dunst] and I will plan to do some screenings or something around it,” Coppola said of “The Virgin Suicides” turning 25. “I've always had a connection to that time in life; it is something that I'm drawn to…so much of my work has been around young women growing up, and the fact that that can still connect with people makes me happy.”

 










Coppola also said in the film's official production notes back in 2000 that Eugenides' novel inspired her to try directing. “I really didn't know I wanted to be a director until I read ‘The Virgin Suicides' and saw so clearly how it had to be done,” Coppola said. “I immediately saw the central story as being about what distance and time and memory do to you, and about the extraordinary power of the unfathomable. It's about the big themes in life: about mortality and obsession and love.”

	President Donald Trump spent much of Wednesday's Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa rambling about disproven claims and conspiracy theories that white South African farmers are the victims of a genocide. Ramaphosa was not interested in indulging Trump's delusions about his country.


	When a reporter asked Trump what it would take for him to believe that there was no white genocide taking place in South Africa, Ramaphosa interjected to say that such a shift would require Trump actually “listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom he is good friends with, like those who are here.” 


	“It will take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective,” Ramaphosa added.


	Over the last week, attendees at the NAMPO agricultural exhibition in Bothaville, Free State — the largest agricultural expo in South Africa — categorically refuted claims that they were victims of a genocide. The allegations have also been rejected by South African courts who have blocked the transfer of funds to white supremacist groups who spread the conspiracy theory. Nevertheless, Trump has granted refugee status to over 50 white South Africans, and banned the government from participating in this year's G20 summit, which is set to be hosted by South Africa. 

	











	The claim that South African whites — particularly white farmers and Afrikaners — have been the targets of systematic, genocidal, anti-white violence in post-Apartheid South Africa has existed for decades, and is an extension of global white genocide conspiracy theories. The claims have been repeatedly disputed, with both international and South African investigations finding that rural crime against South African farmers victimizes both Black and white farmers and employees. According to a data review by The New York Times, between April 2020 and March 2024, South African police reported 225 farm murders. “Many of the victims — 101 — were current or former workers living on farms, who are mostly Black,” the report read. “Fifty-three of the victims were farmers, who are usually white.”

	Trump seemed unmoved in Wednesday's meeting, at one point handing Ramaphosa — who repeatedly attempted to correct the president's narrative in as respectful manner as possible — a stack of printed articles he said were related to the murder of a white farmer. “Death. Death. Death,” Trump repeated while flipping through the printouts.

	











	After Ramaphosa suggested Trump actually listen to the perspective of South Africans, Trump had the lights of the Oval Office dimmed and played footage of members of South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party singing the controversial anti-Apartheid song “Kill the Boer.” The presentation also included social media footage of white crucifixes lining a highway in South Africa purporting to represent murdered white farmers.


	“I would like to know where this is because this I've never seen,” Ramaphosa said. 


	“It's in South Africa,” Trump replied, without stating a specific location. 


	Ramaphosa also attempted to explain that while the EFF's songs were a point of controversy even within South Africa, and he personally disagreed with the content, the party had constitutional protections and free speech rights preventing the government from shutting them down. 


	Never one to ignore the Oval Office press gaggle, the president repeatedly complained that the “fake news” media refused to report on the alleged race-based killings and instead was criticizing him for accepting a $400 million airplane from the government of Qatar. The Pentagon confirmed on Wednesday that it had accepted the plane.

	“I wish I had a plane to give you,” a seemingly exasperated Ramaphosa said at one point. 


	“I wish you did. I would take it,” Trump responded. “If your country offered the United States Air Force a plane, I would take it.”

	Others in the room seemed baffled by the ambush and complaint session Trump had orchestrated at the meeting. At one point, South African businessman Johann Rupert attempted to gently explain to Trump that while South Africa does have “too many deaths. It's across the board. It's not only white farmers. It's across the board.” 


	Rupert went on to implore Trump to help provide American technology like drones and Starlink — headed by South African billionaire and regular conspiracy monger Elon Musk — to law enforcement in South Africa, which would help curb crime rates in rural areas.

EXCLUSIVE: After working with A24 on The Smashing Machine, the anticipated MMA drama out later this year, Dwayne Johnson is looking to get back in business with the studio. Sources tell Deadline that he's come aboard to co-star in Breakthrough, a psychological thriller penned by up-and-comer Zeke Goodman.


	Set in turn-of-the-millennium Southern California, the story follows an alienated young man who comes under the influence of a motivational guru, whose intoxicating charm masks his morally questionable methods of manipulation and his own concealed darkness. We're told Johnson will play the supporting role of the guru, with casting still underway for the lead role and other supporting parts.

	











	There's no director on the project yet, but it will be produced and financed by A24. Stacey Sher's Shiny Penny Productions will produce alongside Johnson and Dany Garcia's Seven Bucks Productions, with Jacob Epstein and Justin Wolf to exec produce via Lighthouse Management and Media.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In recent years, Johnson has been attaching himself to projects that show a different side to his capabilities as a performer, and Breakthrough is no different in that respect. Earlier this year, he set up Ripped, an adaptation of the short story by Joe Ballarini, at 20th Century Studios, with an eye to produce via Seven Bucks and potentially star. This isn't the only high-profile project he has there at the moment, as he's also set to star opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Emily Blunt in 20th's untitled Hawaiian crime pic to be directed by Martin Scorsese. Next up, Johnson will be seen playing MMA fighter Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine, a possible awards contender from director Benny Safdie that's slated for release October 3.


	Goodman is a multi-hyphenate writer, director and actor who started his career as the star of Amazon's I Know What You Did Last Summer reboot and their series reboot of Cruel Intentions. Both he and Johnson are repped by WME. Johnson is also represented by Gang, Tyre, Ramer; and Goodman by Lighthouse Management & Media and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman.

Susanne Bier is directing the Warner Bros. feature that will shoot late this summer.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Joey King is in negotiations to star alongside Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman in Practical Magic 2, Warner Bros.'s Pictures sequel to the 1998 movie.


	Susanne Bier, who directed Bullock in the post-apocalyptic thriller Bird Box and Kidman in the sordid Netflix mini-series The Perfect Couple, is on board to helm the feature that has a Sept. 18, 2026 release date.




	Bullock and Kidman are reprising their roles as witch sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, who in the original movie fight a family curse that dispatches the men with whom they fall in love. That movie was based on the novel by Alice Hoffman and juggled themes and ideas of sisterhood, female empowerment, domestic abuse, with some comedy and supernatural fun thrown in.

	King will play one of Bullock's daughters, the one who discovers the dark family secrets and her own dark powers, plunging the family into a crisis.

	Akiva Goldman, who co-wrote the first movie, co-wrote the script for this installment with Georgia Pritchett. Bullock and Kidman are also producing along with the original's Denise Di Novi.


	A late summer shoot in London, where Warners shoots many of its movies, is being planned.


	Warners had no comment on the dealmaking.


	King became a household name to the Gen Z crowd thanks to playing a teen torn between two boys in the romantic Kissing Booth trio of movies that were among the most viewed on Netflix for a time. She earned an Emmy for her work in the Hulu crime drama The Act and has taken leading roles with 20th Century Studios' The Princess and opposite Brad Pitt in Bullet Train. She last starred in the Netflix sci-fi flick Uglies, directed by McG.


	King is repped by WME and Brillstein Entertainment Partners.

	On Sunday, three-year-old Trigg Kiser died following a drowning incident. According to local NBC affiliate 12 News, authorities responded to a call in Chandler, Arizona where they found the boy unconscious after being pulled out of a pool. The child was airlifted to Phoenix Children's Hospital. The circumstances of the drowning are unknown; an investigation is underway. “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the child's family and loved ones during this unimaginable time,” said Chandler Police spokesperson Sonu Wasu in a statement. 


	Trigg was the son of Emilie Kiser, a 26-year-old Arizona-based mom and beauty influencer who has 3.6 million TikTok followers and 1.4 million Instagram followers. (Neither Kiser nor her representatives have issued a statement, and didn't respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.) When the drowning incident happened on May 12, it was reported on local Arizona news channels and the outside of the house was shown. Viewers recognized it as belonging to Kiser. Almost immediately, TikTok was ablaze with rumors that the boy who had drowned was Kiser's son. People posted videos comparing footage from the news report to Zillow listings of Kaiser's house, insisting that the boy who drowned must have been her son. There were tearful videos where creators prayed for Trigg's wellbeing and others where people redoubled their investigative efforts to prove that Trigg was the boy who had drowned. TikTok creators pointed to the fact that Kiser (and many of her close friends who are also influencers) hadn't posted in days.

	











	Kiser is among the most popular mom creators on TikTok and has welcomed millions of fans into her family's life. Trigg was a regular staple in Kiser's content, as Emilie showed footage of her getting the young boy ready for the day, playing with him, or putting him down for a nap. Through her daily vlogs, viewers came to feel that they knew her. More than that, some of them felt they loved her — and loved her children. This isn't uncommon for parasocial relationships, which are defined as one-way relationships fans develop with celebrities or influencers. The ones viewers form with mom creators can be particularly intense, according to Jess Rauchberg, an assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University. “She's walking you through her life. It's super intimate. It feels like you're spending the morning with your best friend,” Rauchberg says.

	On Monday, news reports confirmed that Trigg had died. Seemingly instantaneously, online sleuths dug for proof of the boy's passing, even going as far as posting screenshots from the Maricopa County Office of the Medical Examiner confirming his death. That didn't surprise Brandon Harris, a professor of social media analytics and production at the University of Alabama who studies parasocial relationships. “For better or worse, these content creators are public figures and celebrities at this point,” he says. “We can debate the limit of what the expectation of privacy should be but they have primarily made their wealth by making their lives accessible to other people.” And fans seem to expect that access even in the wake of unimaginable tragedy. 


	There was also an outpouring of grief on social media, as viewers and fans struggled to understand the death of a boy with whom they had formed such a parasocial bond. They had watched Trigg grow up, their videos and captions lamented, and now he was gone. Creators posted videos of themselves sobbing onto the camera. One video with hundreds of thousands of views offered the Kiser family a place to stay if they wanted to leave Arizona. Another account, which has now been deleted, posed as Emilie posting a tribute to her late son. “Social media collapses the distance between viewers and the person on the other side of the screen. The tragedy becomes so much more than just a family's grief or a community's grief when millions of people are now grieving with you,” Rauchberg says. “And that's not always a good thing. We don't actually know this family.”

	Alongside the expressions of grief, creators and commenters threw blame and accusations. They insisted Emilie and her husband, Brady, should be charged with child neglect. An unsubstantiated rumor that Emilie refused to have a pool fence installed because it wasn't aesthetically pleasing has been often repeated. People zoomed into old videos of Kiser's, trying to prove that she did or didn't have safety measures in place. They looked through her content, trying to pinpoint where she was when the drowning incident occurred. Had she been home? Was she out? Was she at fault or was her husband? In a video viewed over 200,000 times, a creator who goes by @neurodivergent_nate said, “this is parental neglect. You're the parent and you need to be protecting them. And you failed.” 


	The TikTok videos addressing the Kaiser family tragedy largely fall into two categories: grieving Trigg or blaming his parents for his death. The intensity of the reactions leave Rauchberg wondering whether the intense parasocial reaction to Trigg's death may change the culture of parents sharing content about their kids online. “Let's say I'm an influencer and, God forbid, something happens to my kid, do I want people making content about my child and getting views and clicks and likes because my child died?” 

	











	Losing a child is a tragedy; losing a child in front of millions of people who think they know is a dystopian nightmare – and it's making mom influencers rethink what they're sharing online. One mom creator posted a TikTok of herself overlaid with the words, “Anyone else questioning how much of their life they share online after seeing Emilie Kiser get ripped apart by the internet?” In another video, a creator who posts about being a mom in law school said, “I just want you guys to know this will be the last public video from me. The things that I've seen after someone going through the worst thing imaginable are vile and disgusting and I don't wanna share my life. I don't wanna share my kids.” Rolling Stone reached out to this creator, who said she had nothing to add to what she said in the video.

	A mom creator who has hundreds of thousands of followers, and requested to remain anonymous because of possible backlash, tells Rolling Stone that she was stunned by the lack of sensitivity of viewers and fans. “People watch creators on the internet and they don't realize that they're real people with real lives and real families outside of what they see on the internet,” she says.


	Because of the response to the Kiser family tragedy, this creator is taking a break from posting on social media and is even debating quitting altogether despite the benefits from an influencing career. “Having a following can be a creative outlet and a monetary blessing for sure, but the cost is your privacy and your peace. No amount of money is worth that. The money you can make from social media is not worth this. Everything that happens to you, good or bad, will be dissected by the internet. Nothing is worth your privacy and your peace.”

The false notes are rare in director Oliver Hermanus' affecting and dustily textured romance “The History of Sound,” written by Ben Shattuck from his own short story about men in love, together and apart, circa World War I and its aftermath. But for a queer love story starring two of the hottest, of-this-moment leading actors around — Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor — “The History of Sound” almost perversely denies your expectations of what a gay romance could be. 

The grandiose, sweeping emotional gestures toward repression and latent desire out of something like “Brokeback Mountain” are nowhere here, Hermanus instead following the lonesome Lionel (Mescal) around America's hidden corners and eventually into Europe for much of this melancholy mood movie.

Mescal and O'Connor play Boston Conservatory music students who meet in 1917, spend winding but limited bouts of time with one another over the years, and on the way to the film's rueful conclusion. While “The History of Sound” suffers from some pacing issues and detours that turn up as dead ends, following Lionel's path as a budding ethnomusicologist collecting songs and sounds to record on cylinders, this is a lovely movie capable of wounding and haunting you. 

It's also a vivid big-screen showcase for Mescal. The Irish “Normal People” breakout and “Aftersun” Best Actor Oscar nominee seizes the opportunity for understated emotions that are a far cry from the swords and sandals of his most recent film and franchise debut, “Gladiator II.”

“My father said it was a gift from God that I could see music,” says the older Lionel, played by a wistful Chris Cooper in 1980. “My father would play B minor, and my mouth would turn bitter.” Lionel is revealed to possess a kind of Nabokovian synesthesia that transforms his ear for sound and music into a kaleidoscope of feeling and mental process. 

We meet a very young Lionel in Kentucky in 1910 before we're transported to Boston in 1917, where Lionel's life course alters when he approaches David (O'Connor), who's riffing on piano in a smoky bar. They go to bed together in one of the film's demure nods at sex — I wouldn't call any of the lovemaking onscreen in “History of Sound” sex scenes per se, besides one scene involving Lionel's later relationship with a woman (Emma Canning). “The History of Sound” never comes out and says, “These men are gay!,” nor does it strain to depict self-inflicted and necessary repressions of queer men at the time.

 










Though that's not to say that Hermanus' film — closer in tone to the South African director's 2019 portrait of apartheid-era pining, “Moffie,” than his 2022 looking-back-on-your-life Oscar bid “Living” — isn't about queer suffering. The draft threatens Lionel and David's taciturn romance, while Shattuck's script hinges more on gestures and exchanges than literal declarations of feeling, and both the traumas of war and existential uncertainty about his sexuality and desires eventually plague David. More than, perhaps, they do Lionel. “I don't worry,” Lionel says at one point. “I admire you,” David responds.

The two men eventually embark on an impromptu journey through the backwoods of Maine to collect American heritage songs sung by the local people, a kind of self-enterprise academic assignment whose aims and goals they aren't sure of just yet. But it gives Lionel and David time to spend together, in each other's arms naked in a tent, over a handful of nights and weeks, away from the rest of the world. “The History of Sound” is careful not to reveal too early or too explicitly how much David and Lionel are feeling for each other, though a trepidated departure at a train station tells you what you need to know: “See you next summer?” “Sure.” Lionel shakes in David's farewell embrace over what could be the last time they see each other. At least for a while. These are the moments when the enormously talented Mescal as Lionel, withdrawn but never holding back, pierces the screen.

 










Shattuck's script and story more intimately follow Lionel on his own expedition into a sentimental education. In later years an established music teacher, he appears to have had some kind of fraught relationship or hook-up situation with a European protégé while teaching in shimmery, summery Italy, though the closest he's able to get to anyone other than David is his girlfriend Clarissa (Canning, in a short but sharp performance), a musician who wants Lionel to meet her parents. Clarissa's mother warns her to leave him, as Lionel seems to radiate only sadness and a secret within, David probably never not on his mind over the years. (Cinematographer Alexander Dynan gorgeously captures Lionel's chapter in Europe with all the glimmery tactile feel of a Luca Guadagnino movie, where moments trudging through the American middle-of-nowhere adopt a more muted palette.)

O'Connor gets less of a recognizable emotional arc to work with, though that's because “The History of Sound” only shows us David through Lionel's eyes, his memories, the rare and tremulous moments of togetherness they have. Composer Oliver Coates, who coincidentally also provided the ethereal, regret-twinged music for “Aftersun,” writes an original folk score for this film that stands on its own, with Mescal also doing his own singing and evoking a Kentucky accent that's both boyishly earnest and tentatively coy.

 










Not all of “The History of Sound's” second half lands with the same emotional assuredness of the first, as Lionel's path wends and expands even while ever looking back at David as the one he couldn't contain in his grasp. That's partially due to outside social forces that demand their love be kept private, behind closed doors or the canvases of a tent, but Hermanus and Shattuck aren't interested in piling on that context, which has already been explored in so many other movies more directly. And I speak on behalf of queer audience members such as myself when I say we are, at this point, over it anyway as a storytelling cue.

“The History of Sound” is as plaintive and lilting as a piano note in minor key, never wallowing in its own misery but still keen to explore the psychic sensations, afterglow, and wreckage of a meaningful connection. If the film lacks heat, that's because Hermanus is committed to making what is decidedly not a Big Gay Sweeping Romance. The emotions flood and hit hard, though, in a final chapter in which Lionel encounters David's eventual wife Belle (Hadley Robinson, who gives a stirring monologue), who is restless and desperate for company and hopes Lionel will stay for just a little bit longer. There's a shot of a cigarette left to burn on its own in an empty kitchen that epitomizes Hermanus' patient gaze, never in a rush to move things (such as things like the course of love) along for the sake of narrative momentum.

 










When the grown-into-old-age Lionel (Cooper) says he was “never happier than when collecting songs,” what he means is he was never happier than during the times he spent with David. He just can't come out and say that, forced to live in a closet that “History of Sound” never identifies or addresses, and the film is better for it. The soundtrack takes a bracing hairpin turn when Joy Division's post-punk epic ballad “Atmosphere” jolts in, a shocking clash against the folk songs prior, songs that almost evoke Arthur Russell, the sound of a man alone in the woods with his thoughts, ruminating over his desires, where it all went wrong or was left unsaid. 

“Don't walk away in silence,” Joy Division's Ian Curtis sings. Lionel eventually does walk away in silence, but he's haunted by the sounds and impressions of a romance that was anything but.

“The History of Sound” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. MUBI releases the film later this year.

	Filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho's Brazilian movie The Secret Agent, which has been rumored to be a finalist for the Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or, is having its stateside rights scooped up by Neon. A theatrical release is in the works for this year.


	If the 1977-set political thriller takes home Cannes' big prize, it will give Neon a sixth consecutive Palme d'Or win following last year's Anora, Justine Triet's 2023 winner Anatomy of a Fall, 2022's Triangle of Sadness, 2021's Titane and 2019's Parasite. Out of that bunch, Anora and Parasite won Best Picture Oscars.


The Secret Agent premiered in competition at Cannes on Sunday to 100% fresh reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. The pic stars Wagner Moura, Maria Fernanda Cândido, Gabriel Leone, Carlos Francisco, Alice Carvalho and Hermila Guedes.

	The 2025 American Music Awards will showcase a wide range of performers, from 22-year-old Benson Boone, who has back-flipped his way to stardom in the past year, to 80-year-old Sir Rod Stewart, who is set to receive a lifetime achievement award. This will mark Stewart's first time on the AMAs stage since 2004.


	The show, which is being held on Memorial Day for the first time, is set to kick off summer from the Fontainebleau Las Vegas on Monday, May 26. The 51st AMAs will air live coast to coast at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS, and stream on Paramount+ in the U.S.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	This will mark the first regular American Music Awards broadcast since the show that aired in November 2022, and the first one to air on CBS. The show was a fixture on ABC from 1974 to 2022, and it will mark the first one not held in the Los Angeles area.


Jennifer Lopez is hosting the show for the second time. She previously hosted in 2015, when she opened the show with a performance of her 1999 hit “Waiting for Tonight” leading into a dance medley of the year's biggest hits.


	Two other performers on this year's show are past AMAs hosts. Stewart co-hosted in 1989 with Anita Baker, Debbie Gibson and Kenny Rogers. Gloria Estefan co-hosted in 1990 with Alice Cooper, Anita Baker and The Judds, and in 1993 with Bobby Brown and Wynonna. Estefan will mark her first performance on the AMAs in 32 years, celebrating five decades of her career in music.


	As previously announced, Janet Jackson will receive the Icon Award, which recognizes an artist whose body of work has marked a global influence over the music industry. The 11-time American Music Award-winner will also take the stage, marking her first television performance since 2018.


Gwen Stefani will perform a medley celebrating the 20th anniversary of her debut solo album Love.Angel.Music.Baby, including her Billboard Hot 100-topping smash “Hollaback Girl,” and a song from her newest album, Bouquet, which was released in November.


	Fresh from winning four awards at the 2025 Academy of Country Music Awards, country music star Lainey Wilson will perform.


	Breakout artist and first-time American Music Award nominee Benson Boone will perform his latest single, “Mystical Magical,” from his upcoming sophomore album American Heart, which is due June 20.

	











	Three-time American Music Award winner Blake Shelton will make his AMAs performance debut with a track from his new album, For Recreational Use Only, which was released on May 9.


Reneé Rapp will also make her AMAs debut, performing new music off her upcoming sophomore album.


	The American Music Awards is the world's largest fan-voted award show. Tickets to the show are available now on Ticketmaster. 


	Kendrick Lamar leads this year's nominees with 10 nominations, followed closely by Post Malone with eight nods, and Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan and Shaboozey with seven each.


	Nominees are based on key fan interactions — as reflected on the Billboard charts — including streaming, album and song sales, radio airplay and tour grosses. These measurements are tracked by Billboard and Luminate, and cover the data tracking eligibility period of March 22, 2024, through March 20, 2025.


	Fan voting is now closed with the exception of collaboration of the year and social song of the year, which will remain open for web voting through the first 30 minutes of the AMAs broadcast via VoteAMAs.com.


	The AMAs and Easy Day Foundation, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit organization committed to helping veterans transition to civilian life, will partner to present several in-show moments that celebrate veterans while raising funds for a variety of national and local organizations.


	The 2025 American Music Awards will re-air on MTV (Tuesday, May 27, at 10 p.m. ET/7 p.m. PT), CMT (Wednesday, May 28, at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT) and BET (Thursday, May 29, at 10 p.m. ET/7 p.m. PT).


	The show will also livestream on Harmony, Penske Media's proprietary live streaming platform that can be viewed across Penske Media's owned and operated websites, including Variety, Rolling Stone, The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, WWD, Deadline, Vibe, IndieWire and Gold Derby.

	











	The AMAs have also identified additional presenters and participants, including Nikki Glaser, who hosted this year's Golden Globe Awards and has already been tapped to host next year's show. Other presenters and participants include Tiffany Hadish and Wayne Brady, who have hosted other awards shows, and Shaboozey, who amassed seven AMA nominations this year.

Season 23 “American Idol” winner Jamal Roberts' victory on May 18, 2025, came with an undisclosed cash prize, an album development deal with 19 Recordings, and newfound fame. But the dad of three from Meridian, Mississippi, likely never imagined his win would also lead to country superstar Carrie Underwood naming a farm animal after him. 

On May 21, 2025, Underwood — who won the competition in 2005 and returned as a judge in 2025 — posted a series of adorable photos on Instagram of a newborn lamb at her Nashville farm, born the same day as the “American Idol” finale. 

Underwood captioned the post, “Surprise! We've got another new life around the farm! This little guy happened to be born on the day of the @americanidol finale, so we figured it would only be right if we named him Jamal!!! ☺️ Mama and Baby J are doing well…and I'm popping by the barn to get snuggles every chance I get! Welcome to the world, little dude!”

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

Fans and friends instantly swooned over the adorable newborn lamb and the name Underwood chose for him, with one fan writing, “Never in a MILLION years did Jamal Roberts dream that Carrie Underwood would name a lamb after him!! 😂 This takes dreams coming true to a WHOLE nother level!! Love it!!”

Contemporary Christian artist Brandon Lake, who performed several times on season 23 of “American Idol,” excitedly commented, “JAMAL!!!”

The “American Idol” social media team chimed in, “Already lookin' like a winner 🏆✨”

“This is absolutely a perfect name,” one fan wrote, and another agreed, “Jamal is the perfect name for this cutie !!!! 😍”

Given Roberts' penchant for wearing no shirt under his suits and vests, one fan quipped, “Jamal is sooooooooooo cute!!!! Good thing he wont need a shirt with that coat 🧥 Amazing Mama and baby.”

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

After the May 18 finale, Roberts told Access Hollywood that the best advice he received from Underwood during the season was her “post and ghost” social media strategy. 

“Post and ghost, post and ghost,” he told the outlet. “I gotta just love it because people are gonna have their opinions all over the world, but if you post and ghost, I ain't worried about it. Just stay focused on the task at hand.”

Underwood shared her advice during the April 28 episode, as she was providing feedback to contestant Breanna Nix about not letting naysayers' voices get into her head. 

“I want to tell you all an important trick,” Underwood said. “It's called ‘post and ghost.' You put your stuff on social media and you don't look at the comments. That's how I live my life, man. Anybody who thinks they're yelling at me, or insulting me, or telling me I'm a certain way, or not enough this, or I'm too much that, they're just yelling at the clouds. I don't hear or see any of it. So, post and ghost people.” 

Underwood acknowledged to Parade Magazine that social media is a necessity for artists building their fan bases and trying to gain exposure, but said it can also erode their sense of confidence. 

“Even when I was on the show 20 years ago, we had message boards,” she explained. “So that was kind of the beginning of social media. But you had to seek it out a little more. Now, it's in your face no matter what you do. And especially if you are an aspiring musician, you have to put yourself on social media. It's part of the deal because you want to gain fans and it's such a huge way to do that.”

However, she said, “Some of the most toxic people on the planet are the ones that are on running things and posting things the most. So becoming comfortable within yourself and what you do, putting it out there for people to see and looking at the people that you like to follow (is my advice). But then, do you really care what somebody that you've never met before and are never going to see cares about you? Don't worry about it. Do your thing.”

EXCLUSIVE: Andrew Koji (Bullet Train), Jason Momoa (A Minecraft Movie), Noah Centineo (Warfare) and Roman Reigns (Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw) are in talks to star in Legendary's live-action Street Fighter movie, based on the Capcom video games, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for the studio declined comment, and the plot of the film remains under wraps. In February, Bad Trip‘s Kitao Sakurai boarded as director, inheriting the project from Talk To Me‘s Danny & Michael Philippou, who attached themselves in April of 2023, following Legendary's acquisition of exclusive film and TV rights to the Street Fighter IP. The film adaptation is being co-developed and co-produced alongside Capcom, the developer and publisher of the video games. No word has emerged yet on who has written and who specifically will produce the actioner.

	











	Launched in 1987, Street Fighter is a series of fighting games revolving around intense one-on-one battles between a diverse cast of martial artists. The games often center around a global fighting tournament organized by M. Bison, the leader of the evil organization Shadaloo. Street Fighter has sold over 55 million units worldwide since launch, making it one of the most well-known and highest-grossing video game franchises of all time. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Known for roles on the series Warrior and Gangs of London, as well as films like Bullet Train and Boy Kills World, Koji will next be seen starring in the Tubi Original Worth the Wait and Prime Video heist series Haven, among other projects. He is repped by Conway van Gelder Grant, Principal Entertainment LA, and Myman Greenspan Fox.


	Coming off of Warner Bros and Legendary's phenomenon A Minecraft Movie, which is approaching $1B at the global box office, Momoa will next be seen starring in Apple's miniseries Chief of War, out August 1, and Legendary's live action/animated road trip adventure Animal Friends, out October 10. Other upcoming projects include Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (where he plays Lobo), Dune: Messiah (where he reprises as Duncan Idaho), and action comedy The Wrecking Crew opposite Dave Bautista, to name just a few. He is repped by WME and Edelstein, Laird & Sobel.


	Most recently seen starring in A24's intensely immersive Warfare, from Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, as well as Netflix's spy series The Recruit, Centineo is repped by WME and Myman Greenspan Fox.

	As attacks on reproductive freedom continue to rise in the United States, more than 250 public figures — including Harry Styles, Megan Thee Stallion and Olivia Rodrigo — have banded together to throw their support behind Planned Parenthood.


	In a letter published as a full-page ad in The New York Times Wednesday (May 21), the British pop star, Houston rapper and “Vampire” singer were just three of the hundreds of musicians, actors, designers, athletes and influencers who signed their names next to the statement “I'm for Planned Parenthood.” Addison Rae, Chelsea Cutler, Clairo, Cyndi Lauper, Del Water Gap, Gracie Abrams, Jack Antonoff, Jason Isbell, King Princess, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Maggie Rogers were also among the musicians who endorsed the message, as were Meghan Trainor, Phoebe Bridgers, Rebecca Black, R.E.M., Remi Wolf, Sara Bareilles, Sharon Van Etten, Sheryl Crow, Soccer Mommy, St. Vincent, Stevie Nicks and Tegan and Sara. 

	











	In addition to aligning themselves with the nonprofit by adding their names, signatories also acknowledged that “Americans are losing more of our freedom to decide how we live our own lives” with their signatures. “1 in 4 people in the U.S. have been to a Planned Parenthood health center for care: birth control, cancer screenings, wellness exams, STI testing and treatment, abortion, gender affirming care and more,” continues a message accompanying the letter on Planned Parenthood's website. “I'm for you and me — not the government — deciding what care we need and where we can go to get it.”


	Other stars who signed include actors Pedro Pascal, Mikey Madison, Scarlett Johansson, Christina Ricci, Ellen Pompeo, Laura Dern, Melissa McCarthy, Laverne Cox and Natasha Lyonne, as well as Jimmy Kimmel, Karlie Kloss, Shonda Rhimes, Gloria Steinem, Trixie Mattel, Sofia Coppola and Cara Delevigne. Visitors have the option of adding their name to the list of supporters online. 


	“Every day, Planned Parenthood health center staff open the doors of health centers to ensure patients — no matter who they are — can get access to the essential health care they need,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement. “Planned Parenthood health centers play an irreplaceable role in our health system. I applaud these cultural changemakers and everyone across the country who have said, loud and clear: I'm for Planned Parenthood.”

	











	The letter comes as reproductive rights are more at risk now than they've been in decades. Since re-entering the White House in January for his second term — two and a half years after Roe v. Wade was overturned — President Donald Trump's administration has enacted a number of policies restricting access to reproductive healthcare, cutting public health programs centered around reproductive healthcare and removing legal protections for reproductive healthcare clinics and providers, all within his first 100 days in office, according to a report by the Center for Reproductive Rights.  


	It also comes about a month after Planned Parenthood rallied support while honoring Rodrigo at its 2025 Spring Into Action Gala in New York City on April 24. After accepting the Catalyst of Change Award presented by Lily Allen — who also signed Monday's letter — the “Drivers License” musician delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of the organization's work.


	“When I play shows, I look out at crowds filled with young girls, and the bond I feel with them is profound,” she said at the event. “We live in a world that politicizes our bodies and uses harmful ideologies to deny us safety and healthcare, and it breaks my heart to think that, because of oppressive laws and outdated policies, some of those girls may not get to follow their dreams the way I was able to follow mine.”


	She added at the time, “My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.”

	The Republican budget bill remains in rocky territory after a night of contentious, acrimonious debate, during which Democrats repeatedly accused the GOP of using the cover of darkness to attempt to jam through unpopular legislation. 


	The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would make permanent President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which were a boon to the wealthiest earners in the nation. In order to pay for those cuts, the GOP plans to kick millions of people off of Medicaid, food assistance, and other critical social safety net programs. 


	Republicans scheduled a critical meeting of the House Rules Committee for 1 a.m. on Wednesday morning. The marathon hearing — in which lawmakers questioned the chairs and ranking members of various committees involved in the production of the reconciliation bill — lasted over eight hours. It did not escape notice that the late-night hearing took place during hours when most journalists, government officials, and interested members of the public would be at home and asleep. 

	











	“It's just over 100 days you guys have gone from promising to lower costs to ripping away people's health care. Of course you don't want anybody to know what you're doing here,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said around 1:30 a.m. “It's because you know this bill betrays the people who voted for you.” 


	“You have the most ineffective Congress in the century, you passed almost no legislation into law, and this is how you want to roll out your big centerpiece legislation at 1:00 in the morning?” McGovern added. “This isn't just incompetence. It's much more nefarious than that. You are intentionally hiding what you are doing. What an insult to the people of this country, what disdain you guys must have for the people who voted for you.”


	Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), ranking member of the House Budget Committee, noted that shortly before the hearing began, the Congressional Budget Office issued an updated analysis estimating that “the bottom 10 percent of Americans will actually be poorer as a result of this bill, with the biggest benefit going to the top 1 percent of Americans.”

	The analysis also found that changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would lead to a significant drop in household resources for the lowest 10 percent of incomes over the next decade. The Republican bill would also result in around $500 million in cuts to Medicare, according to the new analysis.

	











	“What is also quite clear is that this bill is not entirely paid for, even after all of those cuts to Medicaid, all of those cuts to Medicare, all of those cuts to the Affordable Care Act and nutrition assistance and on and on, they don't come close to paying for the cost of the tax cuts,” Boyle added. It's “just taking on more and more to our national debt.” 


	Democrats also took the opportunity to hone in on some of the other absurdities in the legislation. In the latter hours of the hearing — when daylight had finally returned to the Capitol — Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.), ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, called out a provision in the bill that would repeal a tax on firearm silencers, at the same time that Republicans wanted to institute more stringent work requirements on SNAP recipients. 


	“I have no idea why we think it's a good idea to repeal a tax on silencers when we are going to feed fewer children in our country as a result of this. It's a moral damn failure is what it is,” Craig said. 


	In another exchange, Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) asked House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) to read a line from his committee's legislation that would repeal an excise tax on tanning beds.

	“I don't want to read the bill for you,” Smith responded to Fernández. 


	“They're repealing an excise tax on tanning beds. They're repealing a tax on silencers,” Fernández said after having another member read out the line item. “So if you have a tanning bed, you get a little bit of a tax break and if you need a hospital bed in rural America, you're out of luck.”


	As previously reported by Rolling Stone, hospital executives and staff have warned that the deep cuts to Medicaid eligibility that the GOP is attempting to disguise as anti-waste legislation could force many hospitals — particularly in rural areas — to close their doors. 


	Despite having the majority in both chambers of Congress, as well as control of the White House, Republicans have struggled to pass any sort of legislation throughout Trump's first months in office. As of Wednesday morning, several hardline members of the Republican caucus remained opposed to the “big, beautiful” bill. Overnight, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was forced to make concessions to the so-called “SALT Caucus,” a group of Republicans demanding an increase to the cap on state-and-local-tax (SALT) deductions allowed in some states. 

	











	Johnson insisted that there was a “chance” the Budget Committee would move to a vote on Wednesday, and met with several holdouts, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Andy Harris (R-Md.), and Keith Self (R-Texas.). On Tuesday, Trump made a rare trip to the Capitol to speak directly to Republicans and urge them to pass what he hopes will become his signature piece of legislation — to little discernible effect. 


	If Republicans do manage to get their ducks in a row and pass the bill out of committee and through a floor vote, the legislation will face a whole new round of opposition in the Senate.

	The Democratic minority has been clear that they would provide no air or comfort to the other side of the aisle. To “every Republican member who votes for this. You own it. You own it,” McGovern said on Wednesday. “You own every hospital that closes, every child that goes to bed hungry. Every senior who loses care and every American family forced to choose between groceries and rent, between their heating bill and their child care.” 


	“You guys can force us to debate this bill in the dead of night, you can do it while the country sleeps. But the American people will wake up tomorrow, and I guarantee you they will wake up to how terrible your agenda is,” he added. “They will remember this moment.”

	If you're even mildly curious about why Donald Trump is big mad at lil ol' Bruce Springsteen lately, just listen to the artist's newly released EP, Land of Hope & Dreams — a live recording from Manchester, England, earlier this month. You don't even have to listen to Springsteen's music if you want to find out about the controversy; just stream “Land of Hope and Dreams (Introduction)” and “My City of Ruins (Introduction)” below. 


	Of course, streaming the songs can be pretty great, too, especially if you like Bruce Springsteen (which Donald Trump clearly does not.)


	In his intro to “Land of Hope and Dreams,” Springsteen lays out his philosophy, telling the Brits that the E Street Band would be summoning the power of rock “in dangerous times.” “In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” he says. “Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.” Pretty good, right? And after that you get the seven-minute Wrecking Ball song.

	











	And he didn't stop there. Over a piano line that's alternately doleful and rousing, Springsteen waxed patriotic in the intro to The Rising's “My City of Ruins.” “There's some very weird, strange, and dangerous shit going on out there right now,” he says. “In America, they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. This is happening now. In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world's poorest children to sickness and death. This is happening now.

	“In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers,” he continues. “They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society. They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.” He goes on to outline how the Trump administration has targeted universities and deporting American citizens. He reiterated, “This is all happening now.” He also offered an optimistic note saying that he believed that America would survive this moment. What's not to like, right?

	With Land of Hope & Dreams EP, Springsteen is refusing to back down. Trump threatened a “major investigation” into Springsteen and abused the caps-lock button on his phone to write that Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” (Trump has also claimed that the way Kamala Harris' campaign paid Springsteen's production company $76,000 during the 2024 election was illegal, but that's not true.)


	Clearly, by releasing a recording on which Springsteen's message is loud and clear and perfectly enunciated right when the controversy began, he wants his opinion of Trump to be known. He's also included some pretty great songs, including a Bob Dylan cover, to go with it — and it's all available to stream now.

Following her breakout role as the younger version of Rhaenyra Targaryen in HBO's “House of the Dragon,” Milly Alcock will soon return to screens this week in Netflix's limited series “Sirens,” starring alongside Julianne Moore and Meghann Fahy. “She's graceful on and off and it was just really inspiring, just learning off her,” Alcock told IndieWire at the New York premiere about her time working alongside Moore.

The series marks the rising Aussie star's first production in the United States. “You guys have weird hours,” she said of what it was like working in the States versus her experience on other projects around the world. “On other sets I've worked on, you start at the same time every day and you finish at the same time every day. But in the US, they have a thing where you can do 14 hours and then if you go over, the call time rolls over, so by the end of the week you're doing ‘Fraturdays,' which I didn't realize was a thing and now I hate them [laughs].”

Alcock will soon make her debut as Supergirl, the cousin of Superman in James Gunn's “Superman” in July, before starring in her own film with director Craig Gillespie next year for “Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.” Plot details are being kept under wraps for the film, but it has a script by actress Ana Nogueira. The film is inspired specifically by Tom King's 2022 comic series “Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow,” and it will fit into the larger DC universe of stories Gunn and Peter Safran are building.

Although she hasn't seen Gunn's film yet, we asked the actress if she received any advice from anyone to prepare for stepping into the famed DC Studios role. “No, I asked,” she said. “They were just like, ‘Prepare to be bruised, there will be battle scars, and you'll be proud of them. That definitely happened!”

Jason Momoa will star alongside Alcock as Lobo, an alien mercenary and bounty hunter from the utopian planet of Czarnia in the DC comics. He, on his Instagram, shared a screenshot of a quote from a prior interview in which he said that if anyone ever called asking him to play Lobo or to audition, “I'm there.” He tagged the post simply, “They called.”

The official synopsis for “Sirens” reads: “Devon (Fahy) thinks her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) has a really creepy relationship with her new boss, the enigmatic socialite Michaela Kell (Moore). Michaela's cult-ish life of luxury is like a drug to Simone, and Devon has decided it's time for an intervention. But she has no idea what a formidable opponent Michaela will be. Told over the course of one explosive weekend at The Kells' lavish beach estate, ‘Sirens' is an incisive, sexy, and darkly funny exploration of women, power, and class.”

 










It premieres May 22 on Netflix. Check out the trailer here.

Avery Tucker, formerly half of Girlpool, has shared a new song. “Big Drops” is Tucker's debut solo single, and he co-wrote and co-produced it with frequent A. G. Cook collaborator Alaska Reid. In a press statement, he described the song as “a story about loving and losing someone who is finding themselves time and time again overtaken by the big drop.” Watch the accompanying music video, directed by Lilliya Scarlett Reid, below.

Girlpool, the Los Angeles–based duo of Tucker and Harmony Tividad, broke up in 2022, a few months after the release of their final album, Forgiveness. Last year, Tividad shared the album Gossip, her first proper studio album.

Jordan Peele‘s iconic film “Us” will be feted by Film at Lincoln Center, to honor the legacy of his 2019 feature. IndieWire can announce that Peele will be at the center of curated festival “The Other America: A Cosmology of Jordan Peele's ‘Us,'” which will take place from June 20 to 26.

“Us” stars Lupita Nyong'o as a mother who is determined to save her family from doppelgänger killers who stalk their Santa Cruz beach house. The nuances of the film are reflected in the festival program, which is arranged in thematic sections based on recurring motifs from the film, including “The Shadow Self,” “The Uncanny,” “Labyrinths,” “Rabbits,” and “The Uniform.” Peele's nods to “Dead Ringers,” “Scissors,” “Donnie Darko,” “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,” and “A Nightmare on Elm Street” are highlighted during the festival, which coincides with the recent publication of “‘Us': The Complete Annotated Screenplay.” The book has in-depth footnotes, commentaries, marginalia, and a slew of images, definitions, and inspirations for “Us,” leading Film at Lincoln Center to “interpret the cosmology outlined through a presentation of double features, supplementary reading material, and in-person appearances from some of the book's contributing writers,” as the center announced.

Of course, the festival will also kick off with a never-before-seen 35mm presentation of “Us” courtesy of auteur Peele's personal collection. The Opening Night presentation has a two-for-one 35mm double feature of “Us” with Oscar Micheaux's silent film “Body and Soul,” which will feature live grand piano accompaniment by Makia Matsumura. Shana L. Redmond, the Director of the Center for the Study of Social Difference at Columbia University, and Michael Gillespie, Associate Professor in NYU's Department of Cinema Studies, will take part in a conversation after the screenings.

Additional speakers throughout the festival include fashion designer Mary Ping; Mellissa Huber, Associate Curator at The Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art; writer and designer Leila Taylor; and filmmaker Sierra Pettengill. 

Copies of the annotated screenplay will be available for purchase at all in-person events, with an option to bundle the book with a ticket to the Opening Night double feature or a signed copy with a series All-Access Pass. “The Other America: A Cosmology of Jordan Peele's ‘Us'” is organized by Florence Almozini and Tyler Wilson in collaboration with Monkeypaw Productions and Inventory Press.

“Us“Jordan Peele, U.S., 2019, 35mm, 116m

A haunted house turned home–invasion thriller stretched to national proportions, Us transforms a family vacation in Santa Cruz into a metaphysical horror of doppelgängers, repression, and class anxiety. When the Wilson family are attacked by their red-jumpsuited doubles—the Tethered—they're swept into a coordinated uprising emerging from a subterranean labyrinth and government conspiracy. Blending slasher and creature-feature thrills, cultural iconography, and Jungian psychology, Peele crafts a propulsive, frequently hilarious allegory that's at once genre pop and political provocation, in which the threat isn't some external invader but our own warped reflection wielding a pair of scissors. Lupita Nyong'o's astonishingly splintered dual performance anchors a film teeming with mirrored symbols, from rabbit warrens and the eerie symmetry of 11:11 to the sharp line drawn from Reagan-era mythmaking to its 2010s implosion. Us remains a richly layered, destabilizing vision, and Film at Lincoln Center is proud to revive it in a new 35mm print—made to be seen, and reseen, on the big screen. 35mm print courtesy of Jordan Peele's personal collection.

The Shadow Self

“It is a frightening thought that man also has a shadow side to him, consisting not just of little weaknesses and foibles, but of a positively demonic dynamism. The individual seldom knows any thing of this; to him, as an individual, it is incredible that he should ever in any circumstances go beyond himself. But let these harmless creatures form a mass, and there emerges a raging monster.” –From Psychology of the Unconscious (1912) by Carl G. Jung 

“Body and Soul“Oscar Micheaux, U.S., 1925, 35mm, 105m

Silent with English intertitles

In his boldest surviving film, pioneering Black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux casts Paul Robeson—making his screen debut—in dual roles that expose the fault lines between America's religious and justice systems. As an escaped convict posing as a beloved preacher, and as his gentle, upright twin, Robeson embodies a devastating split between appearance and truth, and whose uncanny doubling plays out in a community shaped by racial violence, spiritual deception, and economic precarity. Made nearly a century before Us, Body and Soul claimed the doppelgänger as a distinctly Black metaphor: not for abstract guilt or buried sin, but for the internal schism demanded by a racist society—what W. E. B. Du Bois described, in 1903, as the double consciousness of Black American identity. To this day one of the great race-melodramas, Micheaux's silent-era masterwork still shocks with its formal audacity and searing political clarity. Featuring live piano accompaniment by Makia Matsumura. 35mm print preserved by George Eastman Museum.

“C.H.U.D.”Douglas Cheek, U.S., 1984, 35mm, 88m“Beneath the city of New York are living catacombs, an endless maze of subterranean tunnels, unfit for anything human, unauthorized for anything experimental…” Look closely during Us's 1986 prologue and you might spot the VHS copy of C.H.U.D., which reimagines the city's unhoused and neglected as irradiated mutants (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers, in fact) who start dragging New Yorkers down through manholes and sewer grates. John Heard and Daniel Stern lead a scrappy ensemble of skeptics, activists, and urban outcasts navigating a conspiracy that tunnels deep into institutional rot. Grimy, industrial, neglected, and claustrophobic, C.H.U.D. wraps a bleak social parable in unapologetically low-budget B-movie scuzz, turning environmental decay and systemic failure into monstrous form—literalizing the nightmare that the forgotten might rise, and no longer recognize us as their own.

Rabbits

What is so real as the cry of a child?

 










A rabbit's cry may be wilder

But it has no soul.

–Lines from “Kindness,” a poem by Sylvia Plath 

“Who Framed Roger Rabbit“Robert Zemeckis, U.S., 1988, 35mm, 104m

A hard-boiled noir wired with anarchic slapstick, Who Framed Roger Rabbit reimagines 1940s Hollywood as a city where humans and cartoons uneasily coexist—most notably in the segregated Toontown. When down-on-his-luck detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is hired to clear the name of the manic, wrongfully accused Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer), he falls into an underworld of gags, studio backstabbing, and a real-estate conspiracy that threatens to, quite literally, erase Toontown. Zemeckis's film, realized in brilliant tandem with animation director Richard Williams, remains a jaw-dropping technical marvel years before CGI made such feats commonplace. It's also a sharp satire of gentrification, exotification, otherness, tokenizing, and Hollywood hierarchy, where Toons are both stars and second-class citizens. The tone shifts to genuine horror with Christopher Lloyd's nightmarish performance as the fascist toon-executioner Judge Doom, whose urban renewal plans would make Robert Moses break a sweat.

“Alice“Jan Švankmajer, Czechoslovakia, 1988, 35mm, 86m
 










Czech with English subtitles

The same year Who Framed Roger Rabbit blended hand-drawn cartoons and noir with big studio firepower, Jan Švankmajer dragged Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland through the looking glass and into a world of splintered dolls and taxidermy nightmares. Mixing live action and disturbing, tactile stop-motion animation, the great Czech surrealist's debut feature transforms Alice's descent into a waking dream of Victorian clutter. Decayed objects gnaw, toys bleed sawdust, and the White Rabbit—stitched-up and glassy-eyed—wields a pair of scissors like a surgical instrument. Less an adaptation than a dissonant echo of Carrollian logic, Alice is a marvel of handmade horror that channels the darker currents of adolescent imagination and, not unlike Us, treats the inner life of a child not as an innocent refuge but as haunted terrain. One of cinema's strangest portals into the unconscious, and a rare moment to see it projected from an imported 35mm print.

“Donnie Darko“Richard Kelly, U.S., 2001, 35mm, 113m

Set in a leafy Anytown, USA of 1988, Richard Kelly's cosmic tragedy follows a heavily medicated, sleepwalking teen (Jake Gyllenhaal, in a career-defining role) haunted by visions of Frank (a kind of Virgil in a rabbit suit) who tells him the world will end in 28 days, on the eve of Halloween. As the date approaches, time begins to warp—alongside Donnie's relationships with his family, classmates, and therapist—into a looping puzzle of parallel realities and paths not taken. Kelly's apocalyptic, darkly funny sci-fi debut channels millennial angst while both embracing and skewering the New Age mythos that defined the end of the 20th century, with its mercurial mood bookended by two different but equally unforgettable “Mad World” needle drops. Initially overlooked after its post-9/11 release, Donnie Darko soon found a cult following among those attuned to its eerily prescient vision of dislocation, ambient dread, and a fractured national psyche splintered across timelines.

“The Uniform“

“The power of the uniform lives both in its simplicity and its magnitude when multiplied. When confronted by a collective many of the same, a monolith is formed. It can feel like a protective shield or a menacing threat. As an individual in uniform, only the role or service seems to exist, more enlightened depths of the person are pushed beneath the layers… The uniform's ingenuity is its ability to communicate control and reliability while also being symbols of corporeal control.” –From “Uniform” by Mary Ping in Us: The Complete Annotated Screenplay (2024) New 4K Remaster

“Akira“Katsuhiro Otomo, Japan, 1988, 124m

Japanese with English subtitles

2019, Neo-Tokyo: A biker clad in crimson slides his taillight-streaked motorcycle down an urban freeway, and anime was never the same. Set in a crumbling Japanese metropolis rebuilt after a devastating explosion, Akira follows teenage rebels Kaneda and Tetsuo as secret government experiments unleash psychic forces capable of unmaking the world. Katsuhiro Otomo's pioneering cyberpunk landmark fuses anarchy with pop grandeur, layering social unrest, Cold War paranoia, echoes of Japan's 1960s student movements, and adolescent fury into an explosion of hand-drawn invention. The Capsules gang's uniforms—and their gleaming pill insignias—prefigure the red jumpsuit revolution of Us (and Keke Palmer's motorcycle drifting in NOPE), while Otomo's neon-tinged apocalyptic vision of Tokyo remains a gold standard of animated world-building. Propulsive, visionary, and still retina-scorching nearly 40 years later, Akira isn't just the future—it's the fuse.

“Dead Ringers“David Cronenberg, Canada, 1988, 35mm, 116m

“Don't worry, baby brother… We'll always be together.” David Cronenberg's coolly perverse Dead Ringers dissects the entangled psyche of identical twin gynecologists, Beverly and Elliot Mantle (an iconic dual performance by Jeremy Irons). They share everything—patients, accolades, even a meticulously managed identity—but their bond begins to unravel when the more vulnerable Beverly falls for an actress, Claire Niveau (Geneviève Bujold), whose anatomy doesn't quite conform to textbook norms. The indelible image of their deep red surgical scrubs signals the film's antiseptic precision and the latent horror of medical authority, not least in the brothers' custom-forged tools “for operating on mutant women.” It's hard not to see its echoes in Us's jumpsuits and sharp scissors. Still one of Cronenberg's most psychologically disturbing works, Dead Ringers transforms the clinic into a nightmarish theater of bodily autonomy loss and violation.

Labyrinths

“At the heart of every labyrinth, in fact, there is a blind spot. And if the subject of the narrative wanders in the labyrinth of his own blindness, the narrative in turn becomes for us readers [or watchers] a labyrinth in which we wander until someone like Theseus, just a name, attempts to deliver us from it… the point of horror resides in the blind space.” –From “Partial Vision” (1981) in Cahiers du Cinéma by Pascal Bonitzer

 










“The Lady from Shanghai“Orson Welles, U.S., 1947, 35mm, 87m

Orson Welles's hypnotic puzzle film set the standard for using literal and figurative labyrinths to mirror a society's darkest truths. Hired as a crewman by a wealthy lawyer (Everett Sloane), Irish drifter Michael O'Hara (Welles) finds himself seduced and ensnared by the lawyer's wife Elsa, played by a platinum-blonde Rita Hayworth in one of the genre's most enigmatic femme fatale turns. Critics were baffled upon its release by the narrative contortions and dense plot, but the disorientation is the point; Welles fashions a baroque noir of fatalism and entrapment, where escape is an illusion and the self is a hall of mirrors. Its iconic, climactic mirror maze shootout has since been echoed in countless films (from Enter the Dragon to the climax of John Wick: Chapter 2); in Us, a seaside carnival's funhouse of mirrors marks the inciting location of horror and revelation.

“Nightbreed“Clive Barker, U.K./Canada/U.S., 1990, 35mm, 102m

Monsters live beneath the surface—but the real villainy remains above—in Clive Barker's wildly ambitious horror-fantasy, which transforms society's outcasts into mythic antiheroes. Boone (Craig Sheffer), a tormented young man accused of heinous crimes, is clinically manipulated by his psychiatrist Dr. Decker (played with icy menace by David Cronenberg), who moonlights as a masked serial killer. On the run, Boone discovers Midian—a hidden necropolis beneath a Canadian cemetery, where shape-shifting beings live in secret exile. Reclaimed from box office failure as a cult classic, Nightbreed fuses Hellraiser-level body horror with queer allegory, cryptozoology, and religious subversion to create a blood-soaked parable of persecution and chosen families. Its practical effects and creature designs remain dazzlingly strange, and its subterranean world—labyrinthine, liturgical, and etched with mysterious lore—echoes the Underpass in Us.

 










Preceded by:

“Labyrinthe“Piotr Kamler, France, 1969, 12m

Hand-drawn in ink and meticulously rotoscoped frame by frame, Labyrinthe follows a solitary figure through alien architectures of shadows and mirrored chambers. Polish-born and Paris-based, Piotr Kamler is an experimental animator whose work explores temporal distortions and spatial paradoxes, conjuring here a slow-creeping sense of entrapment intensified by an unnerving soundscape—a clear antecedent to Barker's nightmarish visions.

The Uncanny

“The uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar.” –From The Uncanny (1919) by Sigmund Freud

“Dead Again”Kenneth Branagh, U.S., 1991, 35mm, 107m

Kenneth Branagh's follow-up to his Henry V adaptation is this reincarnation noir pitched at full operatic tilt: by turns lush and implausible yet totally sincere. Spanning 1940s and 1990s Los Angeles, it follows a private eye (Branagh) and an amnesiac woman (Emma Thompson) whose present-day bond begins to echo a decades-old murder. Past lives begin to bleed into the present, while scissors, hypnosis, and mistaken identities swirl into a karmic spiral of romantic obsession and twisted humor. Often dismissed as a Hitchcock pastiche, Dead Again is far more playful and emotionally earnest than its influences suggest—a feverish genre bender full of theatrical flourishes and bold performances (including a scene-stealing Robin Williams) that plays like a romantic thriller possessed by a detective story, gothic fantasy, and historical melodrama all at once.

“A Nightmare on Elm Street“Wes Craven, U.S., 1984, 35mm, 91m

Wes Craven's genre-defining classic made sleep itself the most perilous realm imaginable. When teens begin dying in their dreams—each claimed by a disfigured man with a glove of knives—the boundary between waking life and unconscious terror erodes. As bodies pile up, bedtime becomes both a threat and an inevitability, and the desperate effort to stay awake only accelerates reality's collapse. Enter Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a child murderer turned boogeyman whose spectral presence twists domestic spaces into sites of terror. Bathtubs become sinkholes, beds explode with blood, and body bags whisper names. More than 40 years later Elm Street still feels radical: not just for its surreal inventions and practical effects, but for how bluntly it expresses horror that is personal, political, and inescapably inherited—from your parents, your nightmares, and the systems meant to keep you safe.

“Scissors“Frank De Felitta, U.S., 1991, 35mm, 105m

A year before Basic Instinct, Sharon Stone delivered one of her most unusual performances in this cult curio of early-'90s pulp cinema. After a violent elevator encounter, the sexually repressed Angela Anderson (Stone) is lured to a mysterious high-rise loft—only to find herself framed for murder. Her attacker lies dead on the bed, a raven screams accusations, and the rooms are filled with warped mementos from her psyche. Based on a story by legendary casting director Joyce Selznick—developed nearly a decade after her death—Scissors gradually sheds its thriller skin to become something altogether stranger: a dream-logic chamber piece of dolls, doubles, and mental breakage.

Chris Brown was granted a $6.7 million bail after he was charged last week in an alleged London nightclub attack in February 2023, with a British judge also allowing the singer to continue on his previously scheduled European tour as long as bail conditions are met.


	Following Brown's arrest in Manchester, England on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm last week, a British judge initially ruled that the singer be held without bail due to the “extremely serious” allegation that Brown beat music producer Amadou “Abe” Diaw with a tequila bottle and then stomped on him, resulting in a hospitalization and, later, a $16 million lawsuit.


	Brown remained in custody in Salford until Wednesday morning, when a judge granted bail as long as Brown posted £4 million ($5.4 million) immediately, followed by an additional £1 million ($1.3 million) within seven days. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Brown was not present at the bail hearing and has not yet entered a plea on the charges. The next hearing in the case was set for June 20; the hearing was originally scheduled for June 13, but Brown had a concert in Frankfurt, Germany, scheduled for that day. The new hearing on June 20 falls between Brown's European tour stops in the U.K. Brown's tour is scheduled to begin June 8 in Amsterdam.

	











	As part of his bail conditions, Brown was ordered to surrender his passport (except when touring), reside at a specific address known to the court, and neither contact Diaw nor visit the London nightclub where the alleged assault took place, the BBC reports.


	In October 2023, Diaw filed a $16 million lawsuit against Brown, accusing the singer of “beating him over the head” with a tequila bottle and “ruthlessly” stomping on him when they were both at a London nightclub the previous February.

Austin Butler no doubt will steal each scene in Darren Aronofsky‘s crime caper “Caught Stealing.” The highly-anticipated '90s-set novel adaptation stars Butler as a former baseball prodigy who gets literally caught up in a mob-fueled treasure hunt.

In a who's who of NYC staples, Zoë Kravitz, Liev Schreiber, Vincent D'Onofrio, Griffin Dunne, and Carol Kane co-star in the gritty, LES-shot feature. Benito A. Martínez Ocasio AKA Bad Bunny, Matt Smith, and Regina King round out the buzzy cast. 

The official synopsis reads: “Hank Thompson (Butler) was a high-school baseball phenom who can't play anymore, but everything else is going okay. He's got a great girl (Kravitz), tends bar at a New York dive, and his favorite team is making an underdog run at the pennant. When his punk-rock neighbor Russ (Smith) asks him to take care of his cat for a few days, Hank suddenly finds himself caught in the middle of a motley crew of threatening gangsters. They all want a piece of him; the problem is he has no idea why. As Hank attempts to evade their ever-tightening grip, he's got to use all his hustle to stay alive long enough to find out…”

Aronofsky directs the feature from a screenplay by Charlie Huston, who wrote the book on which the film is based. Huston has a novel trilogy that follows Butler's anti-hero character, with “Six Bad Things” and “A Dangerous Man” in the series. 

“Caught Stealing” was shot in New York during the fall of 2024 by Aronofsky's frequent cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, who also was the DP on Spike Lee's latest film, “Highest 2 Lowest.” Aronofsky produces “Caught Stealing” along with Jeremy Dawson, Dylan Golden, and Ari Handel. Author Huston and Ann Ruark executive produce. 

Aronofsky recently told Vanity Fair that after directing “The Whale” in 2023, he wanted to work on a film that was lighter in tone. That led him to revisit Huston's script for “Caught Stealing,” which had been in the works for about 15 years. “I felt like there was just so much tension in our normal lives that I felt like the one thing that Hollywood has always done great is entertain. I looked at my projects and I said, ‘You know what? The most fun one I have is Charlie's script,'” Aronofsky said. 

 










He added during a French Cinematheque masterclass that the film is “just a crime caper that we tried to make really well — and that was a really fun activity. There's nothing wrong with taking a classic genre and just trying to make it better, and to do things with real craft.” 

Sony Pictures will release “Caught Stealing” in theaters August 29. Check out the trailer below.

Julianne Moore celebrated the premiere of her next project, “Sirens” on Netflix, on Tuesday, May 20 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. The limited series features Moore alongside Meghann Fahy, Milly Alcock, Kevin Bacon, and Glenn Howerton in the Margot Robbie-produced project from “Maid” creator Molly Smith Metzler.

On the carpet, IndieWire caught up with Moore about Jesse Eisenberg's upcoming A24 musical film. As for what she can tease, Moore told us that she will indeed be showing off her vocal chops, a follow-up to singing a little bit in 2021's “Dear Evan Hansen”: “Yes, I am. I'm singing. We're all singing in it,” she said.

“Jesse Eisenberg is just the most extraordinary person,” she continued. “He's so incredibly creative. I feel so fortunate to be able to work with him. This is very different, but I think that he can have sort of a satirical worldview. At the end of the day, he's got so much feeling. We're all very excited about it. I actually just wrapped it last week, last Thursday.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






Eisenberg's film follows a shy woman who is unexpectedly cast in a community theater musical production, going to extremes as she loses herself in the role. It is an original comedy starring Moore and Paul Giamatti, with Eisenberg also taking on a role in the film. Additionally, the cast includes Halle Bailey, Havana Rose Liu, Bernadette Peters, Eldar Isgandarov, Bonnie Milligan, Colton Ryan, Lilli Cooper, and Maulik Pancholy.

One of Moore's frequent collaborators, Todd Haynes, is in the midst of working on his next project. “We're very excitedly moving forward on this adaptation of Hernan Diaz's ‘Trust,'” he told The Hollywood Reporter in February. “That's what I'm focusing on right now with Kate Winslet at HBO.” 

As for whether Moore knows anything about Haynes' project, she told us that she has “no idea. I texted with him not too long ago. I mean, he's just an amazing person, a truly gifted artist, and I'll be in anything he asks me to be in.”

“Sirens” showrunner Metzler previously was a writer on “Shameless,” and told IndieWire that being a playwright is very “similar” to TV writing, as both processes are “very, very collaborative.”

Metzler said, “When you're playwriting you're usually with the whole team, with someone designing the set and the director and actors and dramaturg. You're all making this thing together, but the person who has to speak for the vision of the show is usually the playwright and you just are very empowered. Your relationship with your director is a true partnership. And is a writer's medium, playwriting. That's what's similar about it is TV is a writer's medium.”

 










“Sirens” premieres May 22 on Netflix. Check out the trailer here.

Grammy-winning artist Ciara, stylist and creative director June Ambrose, and music executives Phylicia Fant and Sylvia Rhone will be honored on Tuesday (June 3) at the inaugural Black Women in Music Dinner. The event, which honors Black women “for their contributions to music and for shaping popular culture,” will be held at the Audrey Irmas Pavilion in Los Angeles. The event was originally set for Jan. 28 but was rescheduled due to the L.A. wildfires, which devastated the region in January.


	The Black Women in Music Dinner will serve as The Connie Orlando Foundation's first fundraiser focused on supporting breast cancer awareness and research. By raising funds and driving attention to this critical cause, the foundation aims to empower women with the knowledge, resources and support they need to fight breast cancer and improve health outcomes.

	“Black women in music continue to be a transcendent and driving force of creative expression, shaping the musical landscape and enriching diverse cultures worldwide,” said Orlando, founder of The Connie Orlando Foundation, in a statement. “Their contributions are not just transformative; they are the heartbeat of innovation and culture. It is an immense honor to celebrate the trailblazing careers of Ciara, June Ambrose, Phylicia Fant, Sylvia Rhone, DJ Kiss, and Flo Ngala at our inaugural event. These powerful women come from diverse paths, yet they share a unified commitment to pushing boundaries and sparking meaningful change across the music industry.


	“As we embark on this momentous journey to celebrate Black women in all their brilliance and as ‘guards' of an ever-evolving industry, we are deeply grateful for the unwavering support of HarbourView Equity Partners as our founding partner, and Sherrese Clarke, whose leadership has been instrumental in bringing this mission to life.”


	In addition to being the founder of the foundation that bears her name, Orlando is the executive vp of specials, music programming and music strategy at BET. She is serving as executive producer of the 2025 BET Awards, set for June 9.


	Here's a closer look at the 2025 Black Women in Music Dinner honorees:


	Ciara, a singer/songwriter, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, will receive the Avant-Garde Award, recognizing her artistry and influence. Ciara topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 2004 with “Goodies” featuring Petey Pablo, topped the Billboard 200 in 2006 with Ciara: The Evolution and won a Grammy in 2006 for best short form music video for “Lose Control.”


	June Ambrose, a creative director, costume designer and entrepreneur, will receive the Guardian of Vision Award. Ambrose is best known for styling prominent hip-hop and R&B artists, such as Missy Elliott and Jay-Z, in high-fashion pieces. Ambrose has designed for more than 200 music videos; published a book, Effortless Style, in 2006; and was hired at Puma in 2020.


	Phylicia Fant will receive The New Guard Award, celebrating her role as a transformative leader. Fant is the head of music industry partnerships at Amazon Music and the former head of urban music at Columbia Records. She is also the founder/CEO of The Purple Agency, a public relations and marketing agency.


	Sylvia Rhone, a trailblazing music industry veteran and the first Black woman to lead a major label, will receive the Vanguard Award. Rhone is the chair/CEO of Epic Records. Rhone previously served in senior positions at Universal Motown, Elektra Entertainment Group and Atlantic Records.


	DJ Kiss, media personality and influencer, and Flo Ngala, editorial photographer and photojournalist, will be honored with The Guardian Angel Spotlights. This award recognizes individuals who serve as messengers, protectors and guides within the music industry, driving both artistic and commercial success.


	Additional program details, including host, performers and presenters, will be announced at a later date.

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: The Edmonton Oilers‘ 1980s domination of the NHL will be the subject of a doc series from Ryan Reynolds‘ Maximum Effort.


The Great Ones will run to five parts and explore the remarkable journey of the Oilers, who won five Stanley Cups between 1983 and 1990 after the merger of the NHL and WHA merger in 1979. Featuring a cast of Hall of Fame players who defined the Oilers' dynasty, looking at their lives on and off the ice. It will feature interviews with the team, their rivals, broadcasters, managers and other behind-the-scenes characters. 


	Maximum Effort is carving a niche in sports doc series charting the rise of unfancied teams, with Welcome to Wrexham, about the fast-rising Welsh soccer team Reynolds and Rob McElhenney own, now rolling out its fourth season on FX. The Great Ones is its latest venture.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	It's not often that we get to watch Jodie Foster in a French-speaking lead role, which makes her latest Cannes film premiere, A Private Life, all the more intriguing. 


	She has the chops: Foster studied at Lycée Français in Los Angeles, becoming fluent in French. In Rebecca Zlotowski's latest directorial, she plays renowned psychiatrist Lilian Steiner who learns about the death of one of her patients, and becomes deeply troubled. Convinced that it was murder, she decides to investigate.


	The pic reps Foster's first French-language role in two decades after Jean-Pierre Jeunet's wartime romance A Very Long Engagement in 2005 before which she had a handful of smaller roles in French pics. The 2x Oscar winner has had other titles here at Cannes before including Money Monster (2016), Bugsy Malone (1976), Taxi Driver (1976) and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1975).

	“This is something I wanted to do for a long time,” said Foster about a lead role in French-speaking pic. “This is the first time that I've had as much dialogue in a French movie. It was a huge challenge for me. The great thing, when I act in French, I'm totally different person: My confidence isn't as high and my voice is higher. It creates a new character for me.”

	Foster confessed, “Why didn't I make a film in French? I was afraid. A number of directors offered me projects, but I was too scared to act in French. I thought someone who is familiar with French should do so.”


	Foster was asked if she brings a director's mind to her acting. “Actors think in the moment, while directors have the big picture in their head,” said the multihyphenate whose directed title The Beaver with Mel Gibson played Cannes in 2011. The Silence of the Lambs Oscar winning actress said she prepares as an actor when it comes to the role in front of her. “I never went to conservatory school,” she said, and essentially goes with her gut. 


	Zlotowski movie is playing out of competition and being released by Sony Pictures Classics in North America and Latin America. The pic received a ten-minute standing ovation at its Cannes premiere last night. 


	In 2021, Foster received an honorary Golden Palm here at Cannes.

The Armed have announced a new album, The Future Is Here and Everything Needs to Be Destroyed. Out August 1 via Sargent House, the Detroit hardcore collective's Perfect Saviors follow-up is led by the single and opening track “Well Made Play.” Watch the song's video, directed by Christopher Gruse, below.

Armed vocalist Tony Wolski said of the clip, which depicts two men fighting over a jet ski, “While we chase distractions and small comforts, we're pushed into endless competition with each other—often while those with real power take freely, right in front of us.” He added of the album: “It's music for a statistically wealthy population that somehow can't afford food or medicine—endlessly scrolling past vacation photos, gym selfies, and images of child amputees in the same feed. It reflects the dissociation required just to exist in that reality.”

The Armed have have also announced a limited U.S. tour that will extend from late summer through the end of 2025. They'll be joined at all dates by fellow Michiganders Prostitute. In March, the Armed performed at a Bernie Sanders rally in Warren, Michigan. Find all of the band's tour dates below.

The Future Is Here and Everything Needs to Be Destroyed features Ken Szymanski, Patrick Shiroishi, Urian Hackney, Kurt Ballou, Troy Van Leeuwen, Meghan O'Neil, Cara Drolshagen, Tony Wolski, Brian Wolski, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Ben Chisholm, Prostitute, Zach Weeks, Mark Guiliana, Kayleigh Goldsworthy, and Derek Coburn. After Perfect Strangers, The Armed released the Everlasting Gaze EP.

The pop icon will support the upcoming LP with an extensive U.K. and European headline tour this summer.

Robbie Williams is looking to hark back to “a golden age for British music” with his newly-announced LP Britpop, slated to land this autumn.


	The album, which the singer says was inspired by the iconic musical era of the same name and the bands who defined it (Oasis, Blur, Pulp et al), will arrive via Columbia Records. It will mark Williams' 13th solo full-length effort to date, and his first of non-festive original songs since 2016's The Heavy Entertainment Show. A release date is due to be confirmed soon.“I set out to create the album that I wanted to write and release after I left Take That in 1995,” he said in a statement. “It was the peak of Britpop and a golden age for British Music. I've worked with some of my heroes on this album; it's raw, there are more guitars and it's an album that's even more upbeat and anthemic than usual.“There's some ‘Brit' in there and there's certainly some ‘pop' too – I'm immensely proud of this as a body of work and I'm excited for fans to hear this album.”


	The news coincides with the release of the album's blistering lead single, “Rocket,” which features Black Sabbath legend Tony Iommi on guitar. Its accompanying music video is set to drop this Friday (May 23), though a press release states that it will feature scenes of Williams and Iommi together in the latter's hometown of Birmingham.

	Williams will support Britpop with an extensive U.K. and European headline tour this summer, which features two nights at London's 60,000-capacity Emirates Stadium (June 6-7). Support will come from Warrington rock band The Lottery Winners, as well as Rag ‘N' Bone Man on select dates.

	The artwork for Britpop, meanwhile, nods to one of Williams' most iconic looks: the red tracksuit worn to Glastonbury Festival in 1995 when he partied with Oasis at the height of the Britpop era. He had departed boyband Take That shortly before this time, in order to pursue a solo career. It also features an illustration of two demonstrators in ‘Just Stop Pop' t-shirts defacing the image, in the style of protest group Just Stop Oil.


	In January, Williams secured a huge milestone on the U.K. Album Charts. Better Man, the soundtrack to his recent biopic of the same name, gave the pop icon his 15th No. 1 album, seeing him move ahead of The Rolling Stones (14) in the all-time rankings. He is now tied with The Beatles at 15 for the most ever.

	More than 250 celebrity leaders from across multiple industries — including Olivia Rodrigo, Harry Styles, Pedro Pascal, and Addison Rae — have signed a full-page Planned Parenthood ad calling for support of the organization's lifesaving healthcare initiatives in response to threats under President Donald Trump.


Rolling Stone exclusively reveals the list of signees behind the “I'm for Planned Parenthood” ad, which runs Wednesday in The New York Times.


	Following the “I'm for Planned Parenthood” sentence structure, the ad reads: “Because I'm for freedom… because I'm for healthcare… because I'm for you and me — not the government — deciding what care we need and where we can get it.”


Megan Thee Stallion, Meghan Trainor, Phoebe Bridgers, Clairo, Gracie Abrams, Sara Bareilles, Sheryl Crow, and Cyndi Lauper are among the musicians signing the ad. Scarlett Johansson, Laverne Cox, Cara Delevingne, Zoey Deutch, Melissa McCarthy, Natasha Lyonne, Christina Ricci, Alfre Woodard, Alexandra Shipp, and Julianne Nicholson led the list of actors standing behind the letter.

	











	“Trans people need health care providers they can trust, just like everyone else. Planned Parenthood health centers are a lifeline for so many across this country who rely on them for inclusive care,” Laverne Cox said in a statement. “I'm for Planned Parenthood because they provide a space for queer people to feel safe, supported, and affirmed in who they truly are.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Karlie Kloss, Shonda Rhimes, Gloria Steinem, Trixie Mattel, Roxane Gay, Jenna Lyons, Drew Afualo, Nikki Glaser, Mara Brock Akil, Laurie Simmons, and Aja Naomi King are also included as signees. (See the full list of signees here.)


	“Every day, Planned Parenthood health center staff open the doors of health centers to ensure patients — no matter who they are — can get access to the essential health care they need. Planned Parenthood health centers play an irreplaceable role in our health system,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a press statement. “I applaud these cultural changemakers and everyone across the country who have said, loud and clear: I'm for Planned Parenthood.”

	The advertisement includes how one in four people in the U.S. have visited Planned Parenthood centers for cancer screenings, STI testing, abortion, gender-affirming care, and other needs. 

	











	“I'm incredibly grateful to see so many bold, influential voices declare their support for Planned Parenthood. Having spoken to many of them, I know this is personal,” Caren Spruch, National Director, Arts & Entertainment Engagement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, added. “One in four people in this country have been to Planned Parenthood for essential health care — including many of these changemakers, their friends, families, and their fans, who have publicly shared their Planned Parenthood stories.”


	The advertisement comes as President Trump has targeted reproductive rights, including via an executive order that aimed to prohibit federal funding for elective abortions when he took office, and restricting Title X funds from going to Planned Parenthood affiliates during his first time as president.

	Josh O'Connor experienced the splendor of Cannes in 2023, when he was there with Alice Rohrwacher's La Chimera. This year, he's back with two movies in contention for the Palme d'Or: Kelly Reichardt's art heist picture The Mastermind and Oliver Hermanus' The History of Sound, in which O'Connor stars with Paul Mescal.


	While en route to the New York set of the untitled Steven Spielberg/Amblin/Universal film where he's been cast alongside Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Eve Hewson and Emily Blunt, O'Connor said of Spielberg, “He's great. He is the dream, the best in the world,” but he admits being on set makes him miss home and tending to his fig trees and vegetables.

	











DEADLINE: What are you able to say about the Spielberg movie?


			Watch on Deadline		







JOSH O'CONNOR: I'll tell you what I'll say. It's like old-school Spielberg. I think people will be excited.


DEADLINE: When you say old-school Spielberg, what does that mean?


O'CONNOR: Close Encounters, E.T.; that world.


DEADLINE: And do you play an American?


O'CONNOR: I guess I'm in my American period at the moment.


DEADLINE: Which brings us neatly to Reichardt's The Mastermind.


O'CONNOR: It's the 1970s. The Vietnam War was going on. Kelly's really one of my favorite filmmakers in the world. Truly. There's a handful of directors that I have dreamt of working with, and Kelly's one of them. So, I've had the best time working with her. It's in the traditional Kelly fashion. It's looking at the world through the people that fall between the cracks and not necessarily the people you'd expect. Often, she's looking at artists and stuff like that, and it's got that vibe. It's almost like she's looking at the Vietnam War, but averting her eyes.

DEADLINE: How so?


O'CONNOR: It's in the background, really. It's about this guy James Mooney who's desperately trying to support his family and make a name for himself. He's sort of a failed artist. He works as a carpenter.


DEADLINE: Reichardt has spoken in the past about looking at characters located in the perimeters of society. Is James in that category, do you think?












O'CONNOR: I guess in my head, when I hear “perimeters of society,” I would normally pick someone ostracized in some way or left behind. And in many ways, this character isn't that. He's middle-class, he's from a perfectly good family, but he's in the outside of society insofar as he lives quite a plain life, an unfulfilled life. That's what's pulling him to make a name for himself. It's almost more tragic in that he just feels forgotten. He just feels like a regular Joe. And I guess Kelly's asking, “What's worse than being regular Joe?” For someone who has a big ego, that's not great.

DEADLINE: Does he have a family to raise?


O'CONNOR: He's got two kids, two boys and a wife. Alana Haim plays my wife in it.


DEADLINE: Where does Reichardt set the story?


O'CONNOR: Outside of Boston, in the Cambridge area, but we shot in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is architecturally very interesting for the period we're in, the '70s. Again, it's that middletown, quiet suburbia.


DEADLINE: He sounds like the forgotten white man who in contemporary terms might have voted for Donald Trump.


O'CONNOR: If you're looking at the moment in time, that's the relevance. An interesting angle on it, is that shooting somewhere like Ohio as the election was just going on was a very interesting place to be, and that's where J.D. Vance is from. 


	I think, politically, that period in the '70s for America and the Vietnam War was really interesting. Kelly is diverting her eyes to the politics always in every film. It's there in the background and she is talking about it, but she isn't. It's like, she's never crude about it. It's not obvious like in so many scripts I read, and in many movies, and I understand why. They are movies that are built to, “How can we get these things awards?” [With Kelly] a tear would be welling up in a scene and she'd be like, “Cut! What are you doing? We don't cry in these movies.” She's the antithesis of that. She wants to keep it real. She doesn't want to get too earnest about things. There's a lightness to it. There's comedy, but there's depth.

DEADLINE: Yeah, I think Reichardt would rather be teaching film class at Bard College than chasing awards, right?


O'CONNOR: That's not the primary purpose. She's not seeking that.


DEADLINE: So is James the leader of the art thieves? I see John Magaro, a Reichardt regular, is also in it. Is he in the gang of thieves?


O'CONNOR: The majority of the film is my character on the run. We come across John Magaro, who is an old friend of mine from art school, and there are all sorts of characters I come into play with. Todd Haynes had this great quote about Kelly, where he said, “The thing about a Kelly Reichardt movie, is it's like a road movie that never quite hits the road.” They never quite get that joy.


DEADLINE: And what kind of artwork does he steal? Is it contemporary? Are they Old Masters…?


O'CONNOR: It's someone who is the perfect answer for this, because it's someone who is not headline-grabbing at all. It's someone worth a bit of money, but not quite worth what they should be worth. It's Arthur Dove [a pioneer of American abstraction]. His artwork is kind of surreal, but it's also, well, in my opinion, not that attractive. It's funny because he is brilliant and he would sell for money, but it's not stealing a Picasso. Even in his grand thievery it's sort of underwhelming.

	











DEADLINE: Reichardt's father was a crime scene investigator—do you think his profession influenced the film in some way?


O'CONNOR: I remember thinking, “Oh, that makes sense to me,” just for someone who is led by story to have grown up in that environment. But once we got to work it wasn't talked about an awful lot. So, I think it's in the background. These aren't stories that come from her father or anything like that, but I imagine it must've had an influence on her.


DEADLINE: Some have commented, “This doesn't sound like a Kelly Reichardt movie.” 


O'CONNOR: I would say as a Kelly fan, I watched this movie, and you can see Kelly Reichardt in it. You can see all of the humor. You can see the messaging that's not overt or crude. I think people won't be disappointed.

DEADLINE: Reichardt once commented that what actors do “remains very mysterious to me. I try and stay out of their way. We're together in search of a character.”


O'CONNOR: That really resonates with me. I think that's so true. Although, just to counter it a little bit, I would say, the thing is that first of all, she loves that mystery. She loves that she doesn't understand what we do, but I think she understands more than she makes out. I think actually she has a very clear idea of who the characters are. But, like any brilliant director, and I've been fortunate enough to witness this, there's this real gift you can have as a director where you say you have an idea. And rather than go to the actor and say, “This is my idea, OK? Do it.” You just find a way of allowing the actor to discover the same idea you always had in the first place, because we then feel like we have an ownership over it. And that's not to downplay what actors do in any way. She's worked with some of the greats, like Michelle [Williams]. It's just that I think Kelly undervalues her talent and she does have those ideas. What you're doing is fitting into a Kelly Reichardt vision, and it's a negotiation, of course, but she is somehow imprinting these ideas in us. That's my belief anyway.


DEADLINE: How does she infuse her films with the disparate stripes of her life: teaching, what she views in art galleries, her longtime friendship with Todd Haynes?


O'CONNOR: First of all, she's an art lover. She loves film so very much. She's one of those filmmakers that has an encyclopedic knowledge of movies, particularly old movies. We've often forgotten with Kelly, she does teach at Bard. She's a great teacher. Again, that's a similar thing to being a great director. She worked with Todd Haynes at the start. She's worked in film for years in different roles and capacities. She went to art school, she's got all that history there, and it just comes through in all of her movies. It's just Kelly. It's so obviously her.


DEADLINE: Did she screen any old movies for you?


O'CONNOR: She sent me some documentary footage from the '70s. I can't remember the name of it, but that was more just to get this idea of how families are together. There's a couple of scenes [in The Mastermind] where it's Bill Camp, Hope Davis, me, Alana, and we all sat around the table.


RELATED: Brazilian Comeback: How The Cannes 2025 Country Of Honor Is Following The Success Of ‘I'm Still Here'


DEADLINE: Where is Vietnam in the movie?












O'CONNOR: It's kind of an undercurrent of the movie. We don't go to Vietnam. We don't ever really talk about it. There might be a brief moment over the dinner table where Bill Camp comments on it. And the reason it's an undercurrent is like, here is a man of age who isn't at war.


DEADLINE: You're also in The History of Sound, which is based on a 2018 short story by Ben Shattuck. You play David and Paul Mescal is Lionel, and they meet in a Cambridge, Massachusetts bar in 1916 and bond over regional folk songs. 


O'CONNOR: Then they go on this journey. The film follows Lionel who has this synesthesia, where he can see color and see and feel emotions when he listens to music. He also has an incredible singing voice. And David is like an archivist and has a fascination with collecting the old folk songs of America. And then they go on this very beautiful journey together. And I go missing for a long time.


DEADLINE: David plays the piano. Can you play it?


O'CONNOR: I couldn't play the piano until I did this movie. I still can't, but I can play it better than I could. I took a few lessons and I just learned in the end. I'd like to think the truth is I didn't have an awfully long time to prep for this movie, and I jumped in between projects. He's a very beautiful character that is so meaningful to me and to the movie, of course, but I didn't have an awful lot of time, so I just learned those songs on piano.


DEADLINE: The original short story is about time and memory and the little things that matter over time.


O'CONNOR: I think it's that thing of what the film does incredibly well is it plays into that feeling of nostalgia and regret and loss. I came in and they shot all of my stuff, which is mostly this traveling through America which is very beautiful. So that was really just lovely. We did that for a couple of weeks, then I left. Then I was on Challengers, and then I was shooting Knives Out [Wake Up Dead Man]. So it was all kind of busy and I felt like that movie was over. But of course they had all of the rest of the movie to shoot. And when I saw it, seeing what they'd done, what they created without me was just … I was so proud of them. It was such a nice feeling. But what's so beautiful about it is this feeling of song and of music. When you listen to a piece of music and it transports you to a certain place or a time, and if you close your eyes, you can feel like you are actually there.


DEADLINE: Shattuck writes about the songs they collect being filled with stories of people's lives. Did you feel that connection to community?


O'CONNOR: David is a connector, he pulls people together, but his ultimate aim is to collect these songs. Whereas Lionel, Paul's character, starts to see that what they're getting isn't just these songs. As you said, it's community.


DEADLINE: Did you and Paul Mescal go on any pub crawls in New England? And then, of course, you worked on Rian Johnson's latest Knives Out with James Bond [Daniel Craig] and Andrew Scott in actual England.


O'CONNOR: I wish we did. I am so boring nowadays. I'm in bed by nine o'clock. I don't know what's happened to me. But no, I am afraid I didn't. But we had a great time. And on Knives Out, James Bond was in it, Andrew Scott, some of my closest friends. It was lovely. Even though I'm again playing an American, we shot it in London. So, it was the first time I could be home for ages.

	











DEADLINE: Images of you in clerical garb in the Knives Out movie reminded me of Mr. Elton, the village vicar you played in the Jane Austen film Emma.


O'CONNOR: I said to Rian Johnson, “My favorite role I think I've ever played was Mr. Elton.” I remember when I saw that movie, thinking, there's all these brilliant actors, Johnny Flynn, Anya [Taylor-Joy], Mia Goth, Callum Turner, all these guys are doing one movie and then me and Tanya Reynolds are doing, I don't know what we're doing, but it's not the same movie. But I had the time of my life. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to go quite so over the top on this movie.


DEADLINE: Having starred in Guadagnino's Challengers, are you still involved in his screen version of Pier Vittorio Tondelli's novel Separate Rooms?


O'CONNOR: Unfortunately not. Luca's working all the time. He's such a busy bee and rightly so. We're constantly talking. He may well do it, but unfortunately it won't be with me.


DEADLINE: Do you know what you are doing next?


O'CONNOR: I'm shooting this summer in Europe with an American director, more of which I can't say. But then I am going to go and do some other stuff for a little bit. I love my ceramics, I love gardening. My poor garden is suffering when I go away. And I'm definitely looking forward to some time to just try some other things and maybe get back on stage. It's been too long. There are conversations around various places. Maybe not exclusively in London as well.


DEADLINE: Is the idea to work with diverse directors who aren't here in the UK? Of course, UK actors have always flown the coop and returned home later.


O'CONNOR: I think there's an element of that. Like Alice Rohrwacher's who for me is … the filmmakers I always loved were Pasolini, Rossellini, Bellocchio, to me she's that. Luca's a hero of mine. But one of my first films, with Francis Lee, was God's Own Country in the UK. I think he's one of our greats. And he's extremely thoughtful. And because of that, his films come when they come. You have to wait. But I'll always work with him again. I think we've also suffered a little bit in the British film industry with arts funding being cut. And I think that's been difficult for places like the BFI for supporting young filmmakers. I don't think that's the reason people are doing more films in America. I think that's just sometimes what happens. But I'm always on the lookout to be at home.


DEADLINE: How did Spielberg come-a-calling?


O'CONNOR: About this time last year, I was in New York and on the night of the Met Gala, I got a text from my agent saying, “Can you meet Steven Spielberg tomorrow for coffee?” And I was like, “Yes!” And I went to his office, Amblin. He told me he didn't have a script, but he told me the story of the movie and he said, “Would you like to do it?” And I sort of feigned, “Let me think about it.” But obviously…


DEADLINE: Good joke.


O'CONNOR: It was kind of straightforward. He's just the most special person. He seems to have the most incredible amount of energy I've ever witnessed. He comes up to you, he whispers in your ear like an excited child about an idea, a thought, and it's truly inspiring.


DEADLINE: Who are the cast members you work with the most in the Spielberg?


O'CONNOR: Emily Blunt and myself are kind of following that track.

	











DEADLINE: Are the pair of you related in some way?


O'CONNOR: In some way.


DEADLINE: Husband and wife? Siblings…? 


O'CONNOR: I've got to dash, I've got to go to makeup.


DEADLINE: Oh, you're not an alien, are you?


O'CONNOR: Maybe. [laughing] I wouldn't need any makeup for that!


DEADLINE: You co-wrote the film Bonus Track. Are there further thoughts about screenplays and perhaps directing, because years ago you told me you'd like to direct?


O'CONNOR: Hopefully. Maybe something down the line. I noticed that Harris Dickinson's got his movie [Urchin] at Cannes, which I'm delighted about. I think he's really inspired me actually go and maybe try it. You know what it's like, it gets busy, but it is definitely a dream of mine.

"After 20 magical years fronting this band, this will be my last year with Foreigner," Hansen revealed during an appearance on The Voice.

	Twenty years since he took up the role of vocalist of Foreigner, Kelly Hansen has announced that he will be leaving the band this year.


	Hansen's news was shared on the season finale of NBC's The Voice on Monday (May 20), where the band was on hand to perform a medley of their hits. 


	Following a rendition of “Feels Like the First Time,” Hansen took the opportunity to announce his plans to the audience. “After 20 magical years fronting this band, this will be my last year with Foreigner,” he revealed. “At the end of this summer, a new great voice will sing these songs for you; my friend Luis Maldonado.”

	Hansen then welcomed Maldonado for a performance of “Juke Box Hero,” before the pair shared lead vocals on “I Want to Know What Love Is.”

	











	“Being the voice of Foreigner has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” added Hansen. “But it's time to pass the mic. Luis has the voice, the energy, and the soul to carry these songs into the future. I couldn't be prouder to hand this off to him.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Hansen rose to fame in the '80s as the vocalist for Hurricane, whom he fronted until their 1991 dissolution. Following years spent working with other bands, such as Air Pavilion, Unruly Child, Perfect World, and recording with Slash's Snakepit, Hansen joined Foreigner in 2005 following the departure of co-founding vocalist Lou Gramm two years prior.


	Maldonado, meanwhile, joined Foreigner in 2021, having previously served as the guitarist of Train and having worked with names such as John Waite and Lisa Marie Presley. “This music has been part of my life for as long as I can remember,” Maldonado added. “I'm ready to honor Foreigner's legacy and bring my heart to every performance.”


	The status of Hansen's role in the band had previously been the subject for debate in March, when it was announced that actor Geordie Brown, who is perhaps best known for his role in Foreigner's own Jukebox Hero – The Musical – would be fronting the band for their Canadian Farewell Tour throughout October and November. Foreigner's recent South American tour also featured Maldonado on lead vocals, while Gramm returned as a guest musician.


	Foreigner was first formed in 1976 by former Spooky Tooth guitarist Mick Jones, with the band releasing their self-titled debut album the following year. They topped the Billboard 200 in 1981 with the aptly-titled fourth album, 4. The record also boasted top five songs “Urgent” and “Waiting for a Girl Like You,” though they would release their highest-charting single in 1984, with “I Want to Know What Love Is” topping the Hot 100 after it was issued as the lead track from Agent Provocateur.


	Various lineup changes over the years have left Jones as the only original member of the band, though he has been absent from the live stage since 2023. In October 2024, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Sammy Hagar.

"The phone obsession has now got so out of hand that it has become unnecessarily distracting especially to the band," said Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood.

	As Iron Maiden ready themselves to climb aboard Ed Force One and launch their Run for Your Lives World Tour, manager Rod Smallwood has asked fans to put their phones away.

	The veteran British heavy metal outfit will launch their upcoming tour in Budapest, Hungary on May 27, with the shows also kicking off their 50th anniversary celebrations. With the massive milestone in their back pocket, and the tour also set to see the debut of drummer Simon Dawson, there's a lot worth documenting.

	However, Smallwood has taken to the band's website to share a post titled “Put away your phones and get ready to Run For Your Lives!” in which he urges fans to experience the shows “in the moment” rather than on smaller screens at a later date.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“We really want fans to enjoy the shows first hand, rather than on their small screens,” Smallwood wrote. “The amount of phone use nowadays diminishes enjoyment, particularly for the band who are on stage looking out at rows of phones, but also for other concertgoers. 


	“We feel that the passion and involvement of our fans at shows really makes them special, but the phone obsession has now got so out of hand that it has become unnecessarily distracting especially to the band. I hope fans understand this and will be sensible in severely limiting the use of their phone cameras out of respect for the band and their fellow fans.”


	Iron Maiden aren't the first band to ask fans to put their phones back in their pockets. In 2015, Jack White shared a verbal plea for no phones during his Lazaretto tour, and by the time The Raconteurs toured in 2019, attendees were told to put their devices in locked Yondr pouches.


	“We think you'll enjoy looking up from your gadgets for a little while and experience music and our shared love of it in person,” a note from the band read at the time.


	Other acts, such as Tool, have also employed a similar approach, requesting phones stay off their phones until their final performance. Guitarist Adam Jones explained in 2022 that while part of the reason was due to the loss of connection between band and fan, another factor was the limited technological know-how of some concertgoers.


	“I think one of the problems is you get a lot of lights because people don't know how to use their cameras correctly, which makes it very blinding onstage,” Jones explained.

	











	As Smallwood added on Iron Maiden's website, much of the urging for fans to stow their phones comes out of a plea for respect, for both the larger experience and the band themselves.


	“We would very much like you to be ‘in the moment' instead and be fully actively involved to enjoy each and every one of these classic songs in the spirit and manner they were first played,” he adds. “This show isn't just a celebration of our music; it is, as you will see, also about our years of art, of Eddie and of the many, many worlds of Maiden we have created for you.”


	“So please respect the band, respect the other fans and have the time of your lives as you join your Maiden family by singing your heart out, rather than getting your phone out!! It's really not a lot to ask is it?”


	The upcoming Run for Your Lives World Tour will be Iron Maiden's first performances since wrapping their The Future Past Tour in São Paulo, Brazil in December. That tour was the last to feature drummer Nicko McBrain, who announced his “decision to take a step back from the grind of the extensive touring lifestyle.”

	After an appeals court declined to remove an injunction aimed at barring Donald Trump‘s administration from deporting noncitizens to “third-party countries” — a country that is not their country of origin — without due process, and without giving them chance to raise concerns of persecution, torture, and death, the government allegedly violated that court order days later.


	Two men, who are originally from Myanmar and Vietnam and were being held in U.S. immigration custody, were deported to war-torn South Sudan, according their lawyers, Politico reported. Their lawyers said they received the a notice of the deportation plan on Monday evening and that by this morning, they were on a plane with 10 other deportees.


	Earlier this month, as Rolling Stone reported, the Trump administration was preparing to use a military plane to fly immigrants to Libya before Judge Brian Murphy clarified that doing so would violate his court order. Lawyers with the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and Human Rights warned that “Laotian, Vietnamese, and Philippine” immigrants who are being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Texas were “being prepared for removal to Libya, a county notorious for its human rights violations, especially with respect to migrant residents.”

	Lawyers for the Burmese man, per Politico, said he was originally scheduled to be on a flight to Libya, before the plan was abandoned amid media and legal scrutiny. The attorneys also said that the man, identified as N.M. in court papers, received notification about the deportation to South Sudan only in English, violating Murphy's previous order due to N.M.'s limited English proficiency.


	A level-four travel advisory from the the U.S. State Department warns Americans to avoid travel to South Sudan. The country entered into civil war in 2013, and per the U.S. government, “Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups.” The travel advisory also warns that “Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan…. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.”

Close enough, welcome back Dean Winchester.

It's always very exciting when beloved actors are announced to star in new projects, and doubly so when comparisons can be made. While Supernatural fans are waiting forThe Boys' big reunion for its central. trio, hype for Jensen Ackles' new show Countdown has been building. This has been especially exciting for fans of his 15-year stint as the demon hunter Dean Winchester, especially because according to Ackles himself, fans of Supernatural won't be disappointed of his new character.

In an interview, Entertainment Weekly spoke with co-creator Derek Haas, Ackles and more cast members to get a glimpse into Countdown and learn what fans can expect. While we don't know much about the plot beyond the initial synopsis, Ackles shared that while it's not the exact same premise as Supernatural, fans of Dean Winchester won't be disappointed to find similarities with his newest character. As he put it:

There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy. It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I like doing that.

While we're looking at a show closer to Chicago and 9-1-1, Ackles describes his new character as "rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy", classic play by his own rules risk-taker. Which even for people like me who has scraped the surface of Supernatural, that's pretty promising if you just switch L.A. detective with demon hunter. As for why the two characters are so close, Ackles had a simple but understandable response.

I mean, I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character. And I think this guy is in the vein of that, just with a completely different set of circumstances.

A statement that is quite understandable. If it ‘aint broke, don't fix it. Considering Dean is so beloved, it makes sense to bring some of the most likable aspects of his personality and character to a new project. And from the looks of it, Ackles isn't rehashing Dean, just using some of him as a jumping off point for his new role. How successful Ackles will be in Countdown is still yet to be seen, but hopes are high.

From sharing some photos on his social media to celebrating filming coming to a close in March, Jensen Ackles' hype train for Countdown has been quite steady. Even if we don't know every single detail about the new drama just yet, nuggets of new info such as BTS on-set pics are helping to keep the fires stoked.

Amazon Prime Video: 30-day free trialNothing supernatural is needed to watch Jensen Ackles' upcoming series Countdown, just an Amazon Prime subscription. Throw in free, fast delivery, Prime Gaming and Reading, as well as exclusive offers. With one of the biggest libraries of on-demand content, watch Amazon Originals like LOTR prequel, The Rings of Power and superhero hit, The Boys. Trial for 30-days, thereafter pay $14.99 a month, or save 22% by paying $139 upfront for the year.

Even in those posts, fans are quick to comment that just seeing Jensen Ackles on set is enough to make this show a hypothetical smash hit, without any footage out. So for the sake of fans, I hope that Countdown lives up to the hype once its available to stream with an Amazon Prime subscription on June 25, 2025.

You'll have to construct your own Devils Tower out of mashed potatoes (or garden dirt, depending on how much room you've got), but an authentic Close Encounters of the Third Kind alien mask is going up for auction, and it's equal parts cool, cute, and creepy.

It's part of Propstore's auction of items from Planet Hollywood's extensive memorabilia collection (see the whole catalog here), kicking off May 21 and running through June 11. There's a Gremlins puppet, Ghostbusters miniatures, Spock ears from two different Star Trek movies, and lots more, but the Close Encounters alien—complete with “functional eye mechanisms”—is the standout pick.

According to Propstore's listing, the climactic Close Encounters sequence in which the musically inclined aliens land their ship at Devils Tower “was achieved by dressing dozens of young girls as the friendly Grays. Multiple versions of their extraterrestrials masks were built by production, including a number of tests and prototypes, while two versions were ultimately selected for filming: non-articulated masks for wide or long shots of the aliens, and mechanical versions capable of a limited number of facial expressions.”

This particular item, the listing explains, “originated from Academy Award-nominated special mechanical effects artist and regular Spielberg collaborator Roy Arbogast. It features a foam latex-backed slip latex skin dressed over a fiberglass underskull and painted gray-brown on the exterior. The interior is inset with wide cast resin eyes painted with blue irises and black pupils. The eyes are designed to move from side-to-side via cables installed along the interior.”

Arbogast's many special effects credits also include several John Carpenter films (Escape From New York, The Thing, They Live, and more) as well as Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.

Some “sympathetic restoration” has been applied to the mask in the intervening decades, though the listing notes it's in quite fragile condition. In other words, it's for display only—don't try to wear it around the neighborhood to freak out unsuspecting Richard Dreyfuss types.

The starting bid for the Close Encounters of the Third Kind mask is $2,500—you can learn more about the auction and how to bid here.

Mysterious crop circles have been discovered etched into fields in one of the world's most famous UFO hotspots.

Wiltshire in the UK has become the epicenter of the phenomenon since the 1970s, and the bizarre designs were recently found just 13 miles away from Stonehenge.

A perfectly crafted geometric design was spotted in a farmer's field in the Wiltshire village of Sutton Veny on May 15.

The pattern included a central design resembling a Celtic knot or a four-pointed star within a circle. 

On May 19, another unique crop circles was found in a grass field 30 miles away in the nearby county of Dorset. That design featured several geometric shapes set inside two overlapping circles.

Crop circles are large, unexplained formations that appear, typically in the middle of the night, in fields with tall grass or fresh crops like wheat or corn.

While many suspect the massive designs are the work of artists or pranksters, UFO conspiracy theorists have maintained that crop circles are made by extraterrestrials who are leaving cryptic messages for humans.

However, it's been proven that many are man-made, using tools like planks to push down and flatten crops as a mean to spark fears or artistic expression.

A crop circle resembling a Celtic knot or a four-pointed star was discovered in a field in the UK on May 15, making it the first reported crop circle of 2025

On May 19, a second crop circle was spotted 30 miles from the Celtic knot, in the UK county of Dorset

But some people truly believe the crop circles are the work of aliens as they can range between 50 and 1,000 feet in length but apparently take only minutes to create in the dark of night.   

Although these strange patterns have been discovered in dozens of countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan, crop circles have been most commonly found in the UK.

Moreover, roughly 80 percent of all UK crop circles have been reported in Wiltshire. Since 2005, there have been more than 380 crop circles recorded in this area alone.

The formations are typically found in crop fields and their appearance often coincides with the growing season, when crops are mature enough to show visible patterns but haven't been harvested yet.

In countries in Earth's Northern Hemisphere, like the US and UK, crop circles tend to appear between May and August when the crops are tall enough to be flattened into circular patterns.

Images and footage of the recent crop circles have flooded the internet where people claim they are a form of 'communication.'

UAP researcher Holly Wood posted on X: 'Who or what is trying to get our attention?'

Another Ufologist shared: 'People say when you look at it from the top, the symbol makes them 'download' certain information to their subconscious mind.'

Wiltshire has become the most common location to find crop circles in the UK, with more than 380 discovered in this one county since 2005

While the crop circles have sparked theories of alien visitors, the owner of the field where the Celtic knot was found was reportedly 'very upset' that someone or something flattened his valuable crops.

However, he's making the most of the setback by opening the field up to crop circle enthusiasts to come and view the new pattern for a small donation, according to Coast to Coast AM, hosted by UFO enthusiast George Noory.

Monique Klinkenbergh, founder of the crop circle exhibition in Wiltshire's Pewsey Vale, admitted that there are definitely man-made crop circles on Earth, but others are much harder to explain without considering UFOs and aliens. 

While many suspect the massive designs are the work of artists or pranksters, UFO conspiracy theorists have maintained that crop circles are made by extraterrestrials who are leaving cryptic messages for humans

'If you listen to eye witness accounts, the unexplained circles have one thing in common - they were formed in minutes, or seconds, by an invisible source,' Klinkenbergh told the BBC in 2023.

'There is definitely a mystery going on, but it's very hard to label the source, whether it is extra-terrestrial, paranormal or just nature,' she added.

For example, the 2001 'Milk Hill circle' in Wiltshire had over 400 circles spanning 787 feet and was said to be too complex for humans to quickly create in one night.

UFO researchers have also claimed that crop circles display several unusual features, like crop stalks which have all been perfectly bent but not broken or cut by machinery.

Witnesses have also claimed to have seen orbs of light and other strange beams appearing over fields moments before the crop circles formed.

The 2001 Milk Hill circle is said to be too complex for humans to have created in just one night, making it one of many examples of strange designs UFO researchers say proves crop circles are created by extraterrestrials

Despite these strange occurrences, several people have come forward since the 1990s to claim that they were the culprits behind crop circles around the world.

In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, two Englishmen from Southampton, confessed to creating over 200 crop circles in southern England during the late 1970s.

They claimed that they used simple tools like planks, ropes, and a sighting device (a baseball cap with a wire loop) to flatten crops into circular patterns.

In 2002, five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT were recruited by a television show to create crop circles, aiming to replicate the work of Bower and Chorley.

The students successfully produced a formation that could be mistaken as an alien message.

The world's second-biggest rat species — a gargantuan woolly beast — was caught on camera in the mountains of New Guinea.

One of the largest rats in the world has finally been caught on camera, almost four decades after it was first discovered.

These gargantuan rats, named the subalpine woolly rat (Mallomys istapantap), measure up to 33.5 inches (85 centimeters) long from the end of their tail to their nose, and weigh as much as 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).

The species was first identified in 1989 through museum specimens, but it had never been photographed or observed in the wild — until now.

In a new study published April 18 in the journal Mammalia, František Vejmělka, a doctoral candidate at the Czech Academy of Sciences and the University of South Bohemia, has revealed the very first images of these rats in their natural habitat.

He captured the footage right at the end of his six-month expedition to the mountains of New Guinea, where the subalpine woolly rat is native to.

It is the largest species of rat in the Australia and Oceania region, and one of the largest species in the world, alongside the Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus), which measures 34.6 inches (88 cm) from nose to tail.



When they were first scientifically described, researchers noted that subalpine woolly rats are usually found in montane forests and grasslands between 8,040 and 12,630 feet (2,450 to 3,850 meters) above sea level, live a nocturnal lifestyle, mostly eats plant matter, and nest in burrows. These rodents have sharp incisor teeth, thick fur and huge 3-inch-long (8 cm) paws.

Little research has been done regarding this species in the decades since, due to its elusive nature and hard-to-access habitat, meaning it has never been formally observed, filmed or photographed in the wild before.

"It's astonishing that such a large and striking animal has remained so poorly studied. How much more is there to discover about the biodiversity of tropical mountains?" Vejmělka said in a statement.



On a six-month expedition to New Guinea, Vejmělka surveyed more than 60 species of rodents and marsupials on the slopes of Mount Wilhelm, the highest mountain in Papua New Guinea. With the help of local tribes, Vejmělka collected camera trap footage of the massive subalpine woolly rats and caught a few specimens, enabling him to obtain the first ever biometric measurements of the males of the species. The camera trap videos included a clip of one of the massive rats using a fallen mossy tree branch to cross a stream.

—Scientists solve mystery of how orange cats got their coats — and why so many are male

He also recorded data about the rats' parasites, diet and patterns of activity and movement, finding it spends its days hiding in underground burrows or tree canopies, and then climbs trees at night to feast on plant matter.

Vejmělka told Live Science that the extremely high and steep mountain ranges provide a unique ecosystem. "Their ancestors arrived from Asia to the island completely absent of any other terrestrial placental mammals (only marsupials and monotremes)," he said in an email, adding their size may be an example of insular gigantism — an evolutionary phenomenon where small animals on islands grow bigger than their mainland counterparts.

The discovery provides a glimpse into the mountains of New Guinea and the biodiversity there. "If it weren't for the indigenous hunters who accompanied me in the mountains and helped me locate the animals, I would never have been able to collect this data," said Vejmělka.

Countdown's Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys) on the ensemble cast, Dean Winchester comparisons, and getting to feel like Tom Cruise.

With only a little more than a month to go until Prime Video's Countdown starts hitting screens, we're getting some insights on what we can expect from Showrunner/EP Derek Haas (NBC's "Chicago" franchise) and series star/EP Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys). When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum (Ackles) is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. But the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions.

Ackles's Mark Meachum is described as a "rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy" who "takes risks that most people wouldn't take." That could make things difficult when Meachum finds himself part of an elite team that also includes Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), Amber Oliveras (Jessica Camacho), Keyonte Bell (Elliot Knight), Evan Shepherd (Violett Beane), and Lucas Finau (Uli Latukefu). Speaking exclusively with EW, Haas noted that the show's drama won't just be about big action scenes, with Meachum involved in some romantic entanglements. "It's not going to be just one," Haas added about the potential romantic dynamics at play. "I love the triangle. It's my favorite shape. And we're going to have a few of those."

In addition, Ackles discussed what it was like working with the ensemble cast, how Supernatural fans might find similarities between Meachum and Dean Winchester, and how the series made him feel a bit like Tom Cruise:

Ackles on Working with the "Countdown" Cast: "It's like every ingredient for a perfect dish. Everybody blends well together. Everybody's so giving and happy to do whatever it takes for the team."

Ackles on Fans Finding Similarities Between Mark Meachum & Dean Winchester: "There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy. It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I like doing that. I mean, I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character. And I think this guy is in the vein of that, just with a completely different set of circumstances."

Ackles on Getting "Getting My Tom Cruise On" with "Countdown": "I actually just did some ADR the other day for an action sequence. I was watching it and I was like, 'Oh, I'm getting my Tom Cruise on here. This is some full-on action stuff.'"

 A bullpen filled with desks. A dimly lit interrogation room complete with a two-way mirror. White boards covered in pictures of suspects. Talk of "computer forensics." Sitting on the set of Countdown, Prime Video's new series from co-creator of the One Chicago franchise Derek Haas, you'll recognize a lot of the cop show staples. But this isn't about a local police station. Rather, Countdown follows a task force comprised of law enforcement professionals from many different organizations.


 The idea came to Haas during his time on Chicago P.D. "When I was working on Chicago P.D., there was an actress who was leaving the show and whenever that happens you're always like, 'Okay, where could we send them?'" Haas recalls, likely referencing Erin Lindsay's (Sophia Bush) arc on the show. "I went to our technical advisor, and I'm like, 'Where could she go?' And he was like, 'Well, do you want her to come back?' 'Yeah. And I want it to be heroic.' He's like, 'She's got to join a task force.'"


 As Haas learned more about task forces, he says, "I found out it's kind of like an all-star team and it's got people from a bunch of different agencies. So you got DEA or NSA or you could have somebody from the coast guard, secret service, detectives from local police departments, feds. And they're on a particular mission."

 That brings us to Countdown, where this specific task force is made up of Mark Meachum (Jensen Ackles), Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), Amber Oliveras (Jessica Camacho), Keyonte Bell (Elliot Knight), Evan Shepherd (Violett Beane), and Lucas Finau (Uli Latukefu). Although we can't give too many details about their roles just yet, they will have to work as a team if they want to succeed.


 "Putting this disparate group together and then emphasizing different strengths is what makes the show," Haas says. "And watching as they come together as a team. I think that's what the viewers are going to find really interesting."

 Coming together as a team was a breeze for the cast, led by Supernatural and The Boys star Jensen Ackles. "It's like every ingredient for a perfect dish. Everybody blends well together," Ackles says of the cast. "Everybody's so giving and happy to do whatever it takes for the team."


 Speaking of Supernatural, Ackles knows fans love to see nods to his demon-fighting former character, Dean Winchester, and let's just say he doesn't think Meachum will disappoint. "There's probably going to be some familiarity from that fandom with this guy," he says. "It's not like I'm going so opposite spectrum with this character. He's going to be a familiar taste, which is good. I like doing that. I mean, I played Dean for 15 years. I loved playing that kind of a character. And I think this guy is in the vein of that, just with a completely different set of circumstances."


 Specifically, Ackles describes him as a "rogue L.A. detective, wrong-side-of-the-tracks kind of guy" who perhaps "takes risks that most people wouldn't take." And that leads us to the action.


 ELIZABETH MORRIS/ AMAZON CONTENT SERVICES

 Fans can expect what Ackles calls "a fair amount" of action from the series and his character in particular. "I actually just did some ADR the other day for an action sequence," Ackles says. "I was watching it and I was like, 'Oh, I'm getting my Tom Cruise on here. This is some full-on action stuff.'"


 But there's more to the series than full-on action.There's also some romance, as Meachum finds himself in a bit of a will-they-won't-they. "It's not going to be just one," Haas says when asked about a will-they-won't-they relationship. "I love the triangle. It's my favorite shape. And we're going to have a few of those."


 Countdown premieres June 25 on Prime Video.

Could aliens be seeing the situation we are experiencing here on Earth with the climate crisis, the increase in the greenhouse effect, and the search for clean energy? That is why they decided to install a UFO-like object in California that interacts with the sun. Of course, this is an absurd hypothesis when heard without context, but it could make sense with what was seen in California. This discovery could change everything we know and have done so far when it comes to clean and renewable energy.

If we stop to think about all the clean energy sources we have so far, we can come up with a good list, but they all have major challenges to overcome to be disseminated on a large scale.

In other words, to solve our energy problem, we still need to create a new way to produce a lot of energy or solve the problems with the energy sources we have. This is where the plant interacting with the sun seen in California comes into play.

A few years ago, a renewable energy company called Heliogen, backed by Bill Gates and founded by serial entrepreneur Bill Gross, tested a new approach to an existing clean energy model. They discovered that this new approach could replace the use of fossil fuels in industrial processes, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Okay, let's get this story straight. Heliogen's main goal is to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in industrial processes, as they alone account for about 75% of global energy demand. With this in mind, the company is looking to use ultra-high-carbon, carbon-free solar heat to produce clean fuels, such as green hydrogen.

To test this new approach, Heliogen built a smaller version of its planned solar refinery in California. That's when hundreds of perfectly aligned mirrors, all reflecting sunlight to a central point, were spotted and mistaken for an “unidentified flying object” (UFO) sitting in the middle of nowhere.

It's an image that might come as a shock to passersby, and it shouldn't be. Besides being mistaken for a UFO, this object is one of our greatest hopes for the future of clean energy.

There are 400 aligned mirrors concentrating sunlight on a specific point. What does that mean? Well, this process alone generated extreme heat with great efficiency.

This process produced temperatures of up to 1500°C (2732°F). Just to give you an idea, most full-scale concentrated solar power plants in existence can produce temperatures in the range of 400°C to 500°C. So, yes, Heliogen surpassed them all.

To achieve these results, the company also had the help of cutting-edge software, which, by combining AI and a series of cameras, kept the mirrors on target as much as possible, through slight adjustments in their position throughout the day.

The results that this process can generate for us are truly impressive, as they range from replacing gas and coal furnaces in industry, producing green hydrogen, storing heat for days, to generating electrical energy with extremely high efficiency.

Well, advances in clean and renewable energy are becoming more and more surprising. Who knows, maybe the next time you travel, you'll be able to take free and unlimited energy with you wherever you go – yes, that's already possible.

Connecticut's own Annabelle—the haunted Raggedy Ann doll famously kept under lock and key in the Warrens' Occult Museum—is on tour across the U.S., and wherever she stops, things get weird. I could've told you this would happen.



Paranormal fans are thrilled, skeptics are raising eyebrows, and locals in each city are left wondering if they just hosted a cursed object.

According to MSN, Annabelle recently made a stop in San Antonio, Texas, where she headlined the Fourth Annual Psychic & Spirit Fest at the haunted Black Swan Inn. The event stirred up a frenzy both online and off. Social media users flooded TikTok with warnings like “DO. NOT. MOVE. HER,” referencing the late Ed and Lorraine Warren's firm belief that the doll should remain untouched. Paranormal investigator Ryan Daniel Buell, who's leading the “Devil's On The Run Tour,” told MySA he believes the Warrens used to travel with Annabelle themselves, though that's a claim that not everyone agrees on.

But maybe the strangest stop so far? New Orleans. According to KPEL, shortly after Annabelle's arrival at a private paranormal event in the French Quarter, the region experienced a series of disturbing events: a local jail break, a fire at the historic Nottoway Plantation, and a spike in reports of electrical issues and pets acting strangely. One attendee said, “I'm not saying Annabelle caused it… but all of this happening at once? It's too much to ignore."

Look, I've read just about everything there is on Annabelle—and written plenty myself—and I can say with confidence: she's not for me. I do believe in the paranormal, but I'm not quick to label every strange occurrence as supernatural. That said, here's where I stand: the more I've learned about the Warrens over the years, the more convinced I am they were more showmen than spiritual warriors—basically ghost salespeople.

However, when it comes to Annabelle, I do believe she's carrying something truly dark. I think the Warrens stumbled into something real and terrifying with her, and they didn't have a clue how to handle it. They were scared—but they also knew they'd found something that could print money. And long after Ed and Lorraine have passed on, Annabelle is still generating profit for someone.

I've been invited more than once to get up close with that doll. I won't go within 15 feet of her. Keep Annabelle far away—I'm good.

LORE CITY − Be it Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, Grassman or any other name, they all refer to the large, furry, humanoid creature rumored to hide in the woods.

Regardless of what you call this mysterious mythical creature, here in Ohio or somewhere else in the world, there is a large contingent of true believers in the state and around the country.

And so, the search continues year after year for the legendary creature as his popularity seems to grow.

In Ohio, a true sign that another summer Bigfoot exploration season is underway starts with the annual Ohio Bigfoot Conference, which took place at the Salt Fork State Park Lodge in early May.

The conference has been held for more than 30 years with the first meeting held in 1989 by Don Keating in Newcomerstown, Ohio. 

Current owner/organizer Marc DeWerth took over the organization from Keating during the 2012 season and made the move to Salt Fork State Park.

"Our mission statement has always been to educate folks on the probability and possibility that Bigfoot or Sasquatch does in fact roam the Ohio woodlands," DeWerth said. "Our goal of the event is to have a fun, family friendly environment for people to come to that gives them an opportunity to learn more about Bigfoot in a positive manner."

Salt Fork Park naturalist John Hickenbottom, a local authority on and self-proclaimed Bigfoot enthusiast, feels the real attraction of the conference is the opportunity to meet other Bigfoot fans.

"To me the core of the conference is getting to meet other Bigfoot folks," Hickenbottom said. "Getting together with other individuals in the Bigfoot community ... that's the core reason to attend the conference to me. You get to spend a weekend with people who are interested in Bigfoot.

"I mean, you would have to consider interest in Bigfoot to be a fringe amount of the population. Well now, by attending the conference, you get to mingle, meet and talk with around 3,000 people who share your interest in the 'Big Guy.'"

A group of over 3,000 Bigfoot enthusiasts were estimated to be in attendance for this year's event, which featured an impressive list of guest speakers, including Ranae Holland and Cliff Barackman of Finding Bigfoot, which is an American reality television series on Animal Planet that follows a team of four researchers investigating potential evidence for Bigfoot, a human or ape-like mythical creature.

Many of the visitors taking in the conference took the opportunity to tour the brand-new Salt Fork Eco-Discovery Center, especially with the bigfoot-centric nature of the EDC, which opened to the public in April.

"Everyone loved how we handled Bigfoot here in the Discovery Center, by using him as an education tool for the children and a focal point of the center," Hickenbottom, who oversees the daily operations of the EDC, said. "Everyone was thrilled with it, and I received all kinds of compliments and positive impact from people."

Visitors to the Eco-Discovery Center can check out the Ohio Bigfoot Hall of Fame that the Ohio Bigfoot Conference created back in 2012. The EDC is now the permanent home of the Ohio Bigfoot Hall of Fame with the official Hall of Fame plaque proudly displayed inside.

'We created the Ohio Bigfoot Hall of Fame in 2012 with the idea that it was time to start giving recognition to the early pioneers of Ohio's Bigfoot research community," DeWerth said. "These individuals who took the time to investigate and document Ohio's vast Bigfoot history.

"Making the Eco-Discovery Center its home is a perfect place for it to be displayed so people truly understand that Ohio does in fact have a huge history when it comes to the Bigfoot phenomenon.  "

Interested in getting out into the woods and trying to catch a glimpse of the elusive Bigfoot? Then make plans to attend popular bigfoot hikes called Salt Fork Squatchin'

The hikes begin shortly after Memorial Day and are held monthly until around September.

"It is family friendly (not scary) Bigfoot hike that we call Salt Fork Squatchin', and there is no pre-registration and free of charge," said Hickenbottom, who organizes the hikes. "Visitors get to learn about the legend of Bigfoot here at Salt Fork and some of the research techniques that Bigfoot researchers use out in the field. They also learn about nocturnal animals, owls, coyotes, etc., ecology and habitat.

"We try to schedule them so it's just getting true dark as we are leaving the woods."

For more information on Salt Fork Squatchin', contact naturalist John Hickenbottom at 740-630-6105 or john.hickenbottom@dnr.ohio.gov.

The Salt Fork Squatchin' schedule will also be listed on Salt Fork State Park's Facebook page.

See you in the woods!
