                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CBO has estimated at least 15 million people would lose health care coverage due to the bill's cuts to Medicaid. This redistribution of wealth would come as a result of the bill's massive cuts to crucial welfare programs, combined with tax cuts for the rich. The CBO has estimated that 15 million people, and likely far more, would lose health care coverage as a result of the bill's $716 billion cuts to Medicaid and provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The bill also cuts other programs benefiting working class families, including student loan aid plans and environmental investments — while funnelling $150 billion to the Pentagon and more funding for Trump's horrific mass deportation agenda. At the center of the bill is a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy, including an extension of Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from 2017. These effects would compound upon decades of existing wealth redistribution to the rich. Since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act originally passed, U.S. billionaires have doubled their wealth to a collective $5.8 trillion, Americans for Tax Fairness found last year. It's not just the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that is fueling the growing wealth gap, however; according to an analysis by RAND published in February, the richest 1 percent of Americans have sapped $79 trillion in wealth from the bottom 90 percent since 1975.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president demands explanation from Cyril Ramaphosa for ‘very sad situation' Donald Trump ambushed Cyril Ramaphosa during their Oval Office meeting with footage he said showed white South Africans being persecuted. Turning to Mr Ramaphosa, the South African president, Mr Trump said people “were fleeing” while demanding an “explanation” for what he said was a “very sad situation”. Narrating over the footage, he continued: “These are burial sites right here, over a thousand of white farmers and those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning.” Mr Trump accused Pretoria of carrying out a “genocide” against white Afrikaner farmers, allegations South Africa has vehemently denied. And those people, in many cases, are being executed. Earlier this month the Trump administration admitted 59 white South Africans as refugees who have claimed they have been discriminated against because of their race. After the footage had finished playing, Mr Trump began flicking through a series of news articles printed out on A4 paper showcasing apparent white persecution. Pointing to him during the exchange, Mr Trump admitted he does not want” to get “Elon involved”, suggesting it was too dangerous. But I don't want to get Elon involved. There were moments of levity sprinkled throughout the press conference, with conversation intermittently turning to golf. Mr Ramaphosa was flanked by some of South Africa's top golfers in the Oval Office, including Ernie Els. Els, a former world number one is friends with both men and is understood to have been instrumental in persuading Mr Trump to set up the meeting with the South African president. Mr Trump cut off aid to South Africa over allegations the country was mistreating its minority white population. Experts in South Africa say there is no evidence of white people being targeted, although farmers of all races are victims of violent home invasions in a country that suffers from a very high crime rate. Mr Trump has falsely accused the South African government of a rights violation against white Afrikaner farmers by seizing their land through a new expropriation law. The Trump administration's references to the Afrikaner people — who are descendants of Dutch and other European settlers — have also elevated previous claims made by Mr Musk that the South African government is allowing attacks on white farmers in what amounts to a genocide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Media figures speak out as Orbán's party proposes penalising organisations that receive foreign funding More than 90 editors-in-chief and publishers from across Europe have signed a statement calling on the EU to take action over proposed legislation in Hungary, warning that, if passed, it could result in “effectively outlawing the free press”. Earlier this month, Viktor Orbán's rightwing populist party, Fidesz, put forward legislation that would allow the government to monitor, penalise and potentially ban organisations that receive any sort of foreign funding, including donations or EU grants. The Hungarian legislation, which would allow the government to blacklist organisations, levy steep fines on them and ban them from receiving donations, had been written “so broadly that it could be applied to virtually any organisation involved in public life or debate,” it said. Since Orbán's return to power in 2010, he has been repeatedly accused of working to weaken democratic institutions and undermine the rule of law in Hungary. Those who have borne the brunt of this crackdown include independent media, with press freedom plunging as Orbán is accused of wielding state subsidies to reward pro-government outlets and starve critical media. Weakened media outlets have, at times, been snapped up by entrepreneurs loyal to Orbán and turned into government mouthpieces, resulting in Fidesz and its loyalists now controlling more than 80% of the country's media. This month's draft law, however, has been described by critics as one of Orbán's boldest moves to date. In a statement, Márta Pardavi, the organisation's co-chair, added: “If this bill passes, it will not simply marginalise Hungary's independent voices – it will extinguish them.” “The consequences reverberate beyond Hungary's borders and are already spreading,” said Pardavi. “This model of illiberal repression is designed to be exported. “If adopted, this law will be immediately weaponised against those trying to preserve the rule of law in Hungary,” said Nick Aiossa, the director at Transparency International EU, in a statement. “Continuing to fund a corrupt regime openly undermining European values is unacceptable,” the letter noted. “At a moment when Europe faces profound external challenges, we must stand united in defence of democracy and fundamental rights, resisting any drift towards authoritarianism in our union.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>G7 finance ministers and central bank governors are meeting for three days in the Alberta resort town of Banff as a prelude to the Leaders' Summit next month.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press This week, finance ministers and central bank governors belonging to G7 countries are gathering in Banff, Alta., to discuss a range of global economic and financial challenges against the backdrop of a global trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump. It includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States. The European Union has also been included in the G7 since 1981 (when Canada hosted) as a “non-enumerated” member because of its large market size, according to think tank the Council on Foreign Relations. It began in 1975 as a gathering of the six other countries, excluding Canada. Members created the group in reaction to global economic crises of the time, where high oil prices caused instability, slow growth and high inflation. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton had thought adding Russia would help it align more with the West. The Leaders' Summit has consistently dealt with macroeconomic management, international trade and relations with developing countries, according to the University of Toronto's G7 Research Group. In the past, climate change, gender equality and, recently, artificial intelligence have also been major topics. G7 countries are all trying to strike trade deals with Washington to avoid the tariffs imposed – but then paused – by Mr. Trump, which he argued were necessary to remedy unfair trading practices by allies, as well as by competitors such as China. The G7 has been criticized for its lack of follow-through on policy initiatives and its exclusion of emerging powers, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. An awareness of this oversight has prompted host countries to include leaders from outside the G7 at summits, the think tank says. Last year, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, India, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritania, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were included at the summit in Italy. Canada has hosted six other summits in the past: All the heads of state of G7 countries are expected to attend, including Mr. Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. World leaders, ministers, delegates and special guests are invited. This year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are also expected to attend. Senator Peter Boehm, a former diplomat who played a central role in Canada's participation in the G7 for decades, said it's a key tool for Canada to exert influence and safeguard economic and security interests. The group originally focused largely on economic matters. The G7 also inspires projects, such as a monitoring service led by Canada that tracks how adversarial countries spread disinformation, particularly through social media during general elections. When hosting the G7, countries often launch a “signature initiative,” usually a multiyear development project that gets large amounts of funding from peer countries. In 2010, the Conservatives pledged $1.1-billion for maternal health, and got peer countries to focus part of their aid budgets on this cause.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until last week, a secretive fleet of ships ferrying Russian oil around the world showed no clear links to the Kremlin. That changed when, in a dramatic escalation, Russia used a fighter jet in an apparent effort to protect one of the tankers thought to be in the fleet. “This is something very new,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters Thursday at a NATO meeting in Turkey. Russia has now “officially tied and connected itself” to the so-called shadow fleet, he added. Related article Europe's undersea infrastructure keeps getting damaged. Estimated to be hundreds of vessels strong, with no official ties to Russia, the “shadow fleet” includes many old, poorly maintained ships, which have in some instances wreaked environmental havoc and, according to some, have been implicated in damage to vital undersea cables off the Baltic coast. Russia has denied any role in the damage. The tankers, many with opaque ownership structures, transport Russian oil for export to avoid Western sanctions. As such, they have themselves become a focus of further sanctions on Moscow. On Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that a sanctioned ship belonging to the shadow fleet was caught performing “suspicious maneuvers” near an undersea power cable that runs between Poland and Sweden, before the Polish military intervened. CNN has corroborated details of the footage, which was shared online by Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of Russian state media outlet RT. In response, Portuguese F-16 jets on a NATO mission in Estonia were rushed to the area to monitor the Russian aircraft, NATO said. The jets are part of a strengthened NATO presence in northern Europe since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “Probably what the Kremlin is trying to do is push back on that, so in the hope that NATO nations get spooked by what happened (last Tuesday),” said Arnold at RUSI. “There will be those within NATO who are a bit worried about this and say, ‘Well, hang on, do we really want to risk starting a wider confrontation with Russia over one ship? For the Estonians, the Russian jet's intrusion into Estonian air space is proof that Western sanctions are biting. The incident “demonstrates that monitoring and sanctioning the shadow fleet is effective and that such efforts must be further intensified,” the Estonian Defense Forces said in a statement. Related article Ships, sea drones and AI: How NATO is hardening its defense of critical Baltic undersea cables “We see the (Tuesday) incident as a reaction to Baltic Sentry,” Col. Martin O'Donnell, a NATO spokesman, told CNN. “Russia's destabilizing actions will not deter us from acting within international law to maintain maritime security, safety and freedom of navigation.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that a new sanctions package could be adopted as early as Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to join Russia's talks with Ukraine in Turkey last week. Merz had said earlier that Russia's “shadow fleet” – “permanently operating in the Baltic Sea with up to 300 ships” – would be specifically targeted in this package. In a possible tit-for-tat move, a Greek-owned oil tanker, Green Admire, was detained Sunday by Russia as it transited Russian waters on a route agreed by Estonia, Finland and Russia, Estonia's foreign minister posted on X. Estonian authorities have conducted more than 450 checks on vessels in Tallinn-controlled waters in the Baltic Sea since last June, according to the country's transport ministry.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A suicide attack on a school bus in southwestern Pakistan killed three students of a military-run school on Wednesday, officials said, in the latest attack that underscores the deteriorating security situation in the region. The explosion took place in the city of Khuzdar in restive Balochistan province and targeted a school bus carrying “a large number” of children of military officials, according to Yasir Dashti, a senior government official from the province. Dashti said 38 people were wounded in the attack. “The bus was carrying Army Public School children,” said Kaleem Ullah, a police official from Khuzdar. At least three children and two adults were killed, according to a statement from the Pakistan military. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack so far. Balochistan has been rocked for years by a separatist insurgency that seeks greater political autonomy and economic development in the strategically important and mineral-rich mountainous region. Related article Divided by a border, united by fear: Kashmiris pick up the pieces after India-Pakistan step back from the brink It did not give evidence for its claims. Pakistan has previously accused its neighbor and arch-rival of being behind attacks in Balochistan. India's foreign ministry rejected what it described as “baseless allegations” on Wednesday, and accused Islamabad of leveling such claims “to hide its own gross failings.” “India condoles the loss of lives in all such incidents,” a spokesperson for the country's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement to CNN. “However, in order to divert attention from its reputation as the global epicenter of terrorism and to hide its own gross failings, it has become second nature for Pakistan to blame India for all its internal issues,” the spokesperson added. India has long accused Pakistan of sheltering militant groups that have carried out attacks across the border, including a recent massacre of tourists in India-administered Kashmir, allegations Islamabad has denied. Wednesday's attack comes just over two months after the deadly hijacking of a train by separatist militants in Balochistan. In that incident the Baloch Liberation Army took more than 350 people – some of whom were security personnel – hostage, killing 27 of them. The Pakistani Taliban's most notable target was then 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot on October 9, 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brussels is beginning to realize it made an error by appointing Kaja Kallas as the EU's top foreign policy official, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement shared with TASS. "Kaja Kallas is a visible manifestation of the European Union's crisis. The SVR noted that officials at the European Commission have observed Kallas' utter lack of expertise in her duties as the EU foreign policy chief. According to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, the EU leadership was taken aback by Kallas' recent remarks criticizing US President Donald Trump, as well as her declaration that "the free world needs a new leader." "The West knows very well that Washington remembers such 'brave statements' once and for all. This significantly hinders Brussels' dialogue with its main ally," the press bureau pointed out. The SVR stressed that, in her five and a half months in the role, Kallas failed to forge working ties with most EU member state leaders. The press bureau also mentioned that dissatisfaction from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen led to Kallas being excluded from drafting strategic defense policy documents. "Kallas's role in discussions on settling the Ukrainian conflict has also practically been reduced to zero," the SVR added. The statement further asserted that the EU's approach of selecting senior officials based on gender and nationality is driving the bloc away from substantive politics. "The modern international situation demands that officials possess in-depth knowledge and professionalism, not ultraliberal pseudo-competencies, which the European bureaucrats lack," the Foreign Intelligence Service concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. The U.S. Senate is ready to vote on a bill on sanctions against Russia if peace talks over the war in Ukraine do not progress soon, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 20, as Voice of America journalist Tetiana Vorozhko reported. How this ends, I think, will greatly determine what happens with the future of Taiwan. And I want this war to end in a way that makes Xi (Jinping) think, 'Well, that didn't work out too well for (Vladimir) Putin,'" the senator said. If we do not get this right in Ukraine, and the world perceives that Putin got away with it, that will be even worse. The bill, introduced to the Senate in early April, would impose new penalties on Russia and slap 500% tariffs on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or uranium. The bill, proposed by Graham and Senator Richard Blumenthal, was supported by 72 senators, a majority in the Senate, according to Graham. Ukraine's European allies are tightening sanctions against Russia as Moscow refuses to cease fire. Despite Russia's refusal, no new U.S. sanctions have been imposed so far, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying that new sanctions "could also make it much worse" after he held a phone call with Putin. Several media outlets reported on European leaders' frustrations with the lack of U.S. sanctions against Russia, with a senior European official telling the New York Times (NYT) that Trump "never seemed invested in joining sanctions on Russia." We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

At 102 years old, Kitajima, who lives in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture, recalls why he became a pilot: to fulfill his childhood dream of flying. With almost 80 years having passed since the end of the war, there are fewer and fewer people who can share their wartime experiences. However, his life totally changed when he was 18 years old. He saw a call for volunteer soldiers in a newspaper and was inspired to become a pilot so he could fly out of the small world he had lived in so far. After studying at the school, he went on to the Mito army aviation school, where in addition to receiving flight training and classroom lectures on meteorology and other subjects, he listened to sermons by a Buddhist monk. In March 1943, he graduated from the aviation school and was assigned to an Army Air Force unit in the south. He always displayed a photograph of his father and mother in the cockpit. During aerial combat over the sea separating Luzon and Borneo, his plane experienced engine trouble and he made an emergency water landing. He thought no one would come to save him, but he was eventually rescued by a ship and narrowly avoided death. Whenever news of a comrade's death reached his base, he always thought, “That will be me someday.” For respite, he enjoyed Javanese chocolates, which he had never tasted in Japan, the sweet flavor distracting him from the war. Around the beginning of 1945, fewer than 20 Japanese fighter planes had to intercept twice as many enemy fighter planes at a higher frequency than ever before. Kitajima felt strongly that the war situation was deteriorating for Japan. Many of his fellow pilots who had headed back to Japan on resupply missions did not return, sparking concerns over a shortage of war supplies. Every time this happened, he would come close to losing all hope. However, he encouraged himself by thinking, “We have to win.” Kitajima learned that the war had ended when he was in Java. Tears fell from his eyes as he thought, “I can return to Japan alive.” He spent six months as a captive in Singapore before returning home to his parents in Shizuoka Prefecture. After the war, he worked at a machinery component manufacturer in Fujisawa until he reached the age of retirement. In addition to being involved in activities that contributed to the community, he helped to establish the Chiran Peace Museum in Kagoshima Prefecture, which exhibits the articles of Kamikaze pilots, since he escorted fighter planes on such kamikaze special attack missions during the war. Even after 80 years, he still recalls being in the cockpit, pushing a button with his left hand to shoot and seeing an enemy fighter plane hit by the bullets falling slowly. “I only survived the war by chance,” he said. “I want our society to be based on the fundamental principle of not waging war.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. WALLY ADEYEMO is Carnegie Distinguished Fellow at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. From 2021 to 2025, he served as U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. DAVID SHIMER is an Adjunct Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. From 2021 to 2025, he served in the National Security Council, including as Director for Eastern Europe and Ukraine and as Director for Russian Affairs. As Russia continues its war against Ukraine and the Trump administration reduces U.S. aid to Kyiv, European countries have stepped up their support of the Ukrainian people. At this critical moment, the European Union should seize the immobilized Russian sovereign assets that sit in Europe and use those resources to provide Ukraine with a sustainable source of assistance. In February 2022, just days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the United States worked with the G-7 to freeze approximately $300 billion in Russian assets, the vast majority of which were held in Europe. Before the decision was made, some European countries raised economic and legal concerns, but they ultimately agreed. Over the course of the Biden administration—which both of us were a part of—the United States encouraged Europe to go one step further and seize Russia's funds so that they could be put to use, as opposed to sitting frozen in accounts. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected calls for a 30-day cease-fire and has stalled peace talks by making maximalist demands, presumably betting that Ukraine's position will deteriorate as U.S. aid winds down and as China, Iran, and North Korea maintain their support for Russia. They have, for example, sent military and financial aid, implemented an unprecedented price cap on Russian oil, and enacted 17 sanctions packages against the Russian economy. Europe cannot afford to see Russia triumph over Ukraine. By seizing Russia's assets, European governments can send a clear message to the Kremlin that support for Ukraine will persist. The Biden administration, in its final year, argued that the immobilized assets should be used to support Ukraine, but some allies remained reluctant. As the war continued, and as it became more challenging to secure additional congressional funding for Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden and other G-7 leaders reached a compromise. In June 2024, they agreed to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans, paid back by the interest income earned from the immobilized assets. This was a meaningful step forward, but the time has come to use the full $300 billion to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. Some European officials have questioned the legal basis for seizing Russia's assets, arguing that it would violate principles of sovereign immunity, which are enshrined in international law. But there are clear and compelling legal arguments in favor of taking Russia's assets. As the UN General Assembly resoundingly affirmed in 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine violates the prohibition against aggression, which is a legal obligation owed to all countries. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Moscow can block legal and diplomatic efforts aimed at stopping the conflict. Under these circumstances, seizing Russia's sovereign assets is a legitimate countermeasure. Seizure is proportionate to the harm Russia has wrought, and because Russia has a legal obligation to pay Ukraine for damages from the war, seizure would be permissible in that it would set off Ukraine's claim to reparations. As the former U.S. government officials Larry Summers, Philip Zelikow, and Robert Zoellick argued in Foreign Affairs, there is precedent for taking an aggressor's assets: in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the United States and its allies led efforts to transfer frozen Iraqi funds to an international escrow account to finance reparations. European officials also worry that if they were to seize Russia's assets, then managers of other sovereign wealth would be reluctant to invest in Europe. But there is no evidence that seizing Russia's assets would cause investors to flee the continent. Investors did not leave when European countries froze the Kremlin's assets three years ago, and the line between indefinitely freezing assets and seizing them is an incremental one. Today, in fact, seizure poses fewer risks to Europe's economic and financial stability than at any other point during the war. Europe's ability to generate growth and maintain its economic stability—especially as investors remain concerned by the economic uncertainty being exported by the United States—matter far more to asset allocators than the status of Russia's sovereign assets. And the potential collapse of Ukraine is a much more significant threat to the European economy, because it could prompt massive Ukrainian refugee outflows and embolden Russia to threaten countries on NATO's eastern flank. Using the sovereign assets would help strengthen Ukraine and prevent such a scenario from taking place. Without U.S. aid, European governments will be forced to support Ukraine largely by themselves—even as they invest in their own military stockpiles and prepare for their own increased security needs. Europe can use Russian assets to procure the weapons that Kyiv urgently needs, fund Ukraine's innovative defense industrial base, and maintain the country's macroeconomic stability. As part of this approach, European leaders should try to negotiate an agreement with the White House to purchase U.S. capabilities for Ukraine, starting with air defense missiles, with the understanding that the U.S. Department of Defense would prioritize these purchases given Ukraine's urgent requirements. If successful, this model could be expanded to include other U.S. defense exports. There is also a diplomatic purpose to asset seizure. Putin believes that time is on his side in this war and that, eventually, foreign aid for Ukraine will dry up. Ukraine, with this long-term support in hand, would have more leverage in negotiations and would be better positioned to reach a just and sustainable outcome to this war. An important first step is for the European Union to pass its own version of the REPO Act, which will give member states the ability to seize and use Russia's assets at a time of their choosing. If the EU is unable to achieve consensus, then individual member states with Russian assets in their jurisdictions should take steps in their own national systems to enable seizure. With this authority in hand, European leaders should then develop and implement a plan to deploy the assets in support of Ukraine's military and economy. European countries can shift these dynamics, provide Ukraine with a lasting source of support, and persuade Putin to engage in meaningful negotiations. But with Russia's sovereign assets, Europe holds a card of its own.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2025, most people are inseparable from their laptops and smartphones. But there is a growing menace called zero-click attacks, which have previously targeted only VIPs or the very wealthy because of their cost and sophistication. It can happen just by receiving a message, call, or file. “Although public awareness has increased recently, these attacks have steadily evolved over many years, becoming more frequent as smartphones and connected devices proliferated,” Nathan House, CEO of StationX, a UK-based cybersecurity training platform, told The Epoch Times. Aras Nazarovas, an information security researcher at Cybernews, told The Epoch Times why zero-click attacks usually target VIPs rather than ordinary individuals. “It has been a billion-dollar market for years, selling zero-click exploits and exploit chains. But the increase in zero-click attacks in recent years “stems mainly from expanded spyware markets and greater availability of sophisticated exploits, rather than directly from AI-driven techniques,” he said. Alleged targets of Pegasus surveillance included French President Emmanuel Macron, Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, and Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi, who was slain in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. “While ordinary users can occasionally become collateral targets, attackers generally reserve these costly exploits for individuals whose information is especially valuable or sensitive,” Nazarovas said. House said defending against zero-click attacks is “challenging,” but some simple cybersecurity steps can reduce the risk. “Users should always keep software and operating systems updated, regularly reboot their devices, and use hardened security modes such as Apple's lockdown mode, especially if they believe they're high-risk targets,” he said. House said that whatever precautions are taken, it is crucial to recognize “exceptionally sophisticated attacks—like those from advanced nation-state adversaries—can bypass even the most robust defenses.” Telemetry data is information collected remotely from devices such as phones and computers. “When vulnerabilities that allow such attacks are detected, they can be quickly fixed and rolled out almost immediately to billions of people thanks to automatic updates,” Nazarovas said.</p>
