                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aaron Rodgers' frustration was palpable Tuesday when he exploded into a furious rant over his right to a private life amid rampant rumors shrouding his new marriage. The NFL veteran, 41, dropped a shock marriage bombshell during his first official Steelers training earlier this month when he confirmed to reporters that he had tied the knot 'a couple of months ago.' Even his family was said to be questioning whether the wedding took place. I lived in the public eye for 20 years, I had public relationships,' he began referring to his past high-profile romances with the likes of actress Shailene Woodley and NASCAR star Danica Patrick. 'Now I'm with someone who's private who doesn't want to be in the public eye, didn't sign up to be in the public eye, doesn't want to be a celebrity. Rodgers previously divulged to McAfee in December that he was in a relationship with a woman named 'Brittani', and that she did not have any social media. However, on Tuesday he refused to leak any more details, never even referring to his wife by a name. 'Now we have to dive into details of where you live, what you're doing and who you're with, who your wife is and if you even have a wife, and if you're doing so sort of attention-grabbing thing - because my wife is a private person, doesn't have social media. Just because I'm not selling wedding to the magazines or making a loving post on Instagram.' The former Super Bowl winner also insisted that his family members wouldn't know any details about his private life or his new bride as claimed 'they don't know anything about them' because he doesn't talk to them. Rodgers' feud with his younger brother Jordan has been well-documented for years now after the latter went on and won season 12 of The Bachelorette, marrying that year's star JoJo Fletcher. 'The entitlement to information about my private life is so f***ing ridiculous and embarrassing,' he added. The signal caller signed a one-year, $13.65million deal with the Steelers earlier this month after yet another offseason of speculation over his NFL future. But he also admitted Tuesday, that the upcoming NFL season is probably his last before he hangs his cleats up for good, saying, 'I'm pretty sure this is it.' And Rodgers suggested that beyond the end of the 2025 NFL season not only will fans no longer see him on the field, they won't see him at all as he vowed to keep his private life just that - private. And I know that I've chosen to be in the public eye for one more season, but my private life is staying private,' he insisted. Rodgers' last public relationship was with Woodley, with the pair going their separate ways in 2022 after two years together. The actress is believed to have moved on with 'Emily In Paris' star Lucas Bravo. Prior to his romance with Woodley he dated some high-profile figures in former racing car driver Danica Patrick and another actress in Olivia Munn. Patrick previously sensationally claimed that their relationship was 'emotionally abusive' and 'wore me down to nothing'. The former NASCAR driver and Rodgers started dating in January 2018 and made their red-carpet debut at that year's ESPY awards. However, their relationship didn't last much longer as they split in July 2020 after just over two years together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A dramatic new video showing a disc-shaped UFO, filmed by the US military, has been leaked to the public by independent journalist and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell. The thermal footage, along with two enhanced clips, was reportedly captured during a high-altitude reconnaissance mission and shows an unidentified object abruptly changing direction, without any visible signs of propulsion. Corbell, known for previous credible leaks involving UFO sightings, described the footage as historic. “This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,” he told DailyMail.com. BREAKING: NEW UAP FOOTAGE-Is it a sphere? )-Symbology looks legit (Wescam IR camera), filmed close to Afghan/Pakistan border-Any evidence of CGI? While most previously recorded UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) resemble “Tic Tac” or pill-shaped objects, this one clearly appears as a saucer-like disc, reminiscent of classic science-fiction depictions. ALSO READ: Indian Engineer Helped Design B-2 Stealth Bomber: But Why Noshir Gowadia Ended Up In US Prison Corbell says the object may be anywhere between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, although there is debate over its precise size. The footage, captured by thermal imaging, shows the object manoeuvring in ways inconsistent with any known aircraft, no exhaust, no wings, and a sharp directional shift mid-flight. Corbell released the footage after years of verifying its authenticity through trusted military and intelligence contacts. It was not supposed to be made public. Corbell previously leaked information about a giant unidentified object hovering over a US base and described similar cases dating back to 2004, when Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz carrier group saw a fast-moving “Tic Tac” object. ALSO READ: Five Major Questions Arise From Trump's Israel-Iran Ceasefire Agreement Announcement: What's Next? Another incident in 2015 off the East Coast, recorded by pilots on the USS Roosevelt, showed flying objects with no visible propulsion system. Corbell hopes this leak will push the government to be more transparent. “These objects have implications for national security, aerospace defence, and possibly even humanity's understanding of our place in the universe,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Overconfidence is a hallmark trait of people who believe in conspiracies, and they also significantly overestimate how much others agree with them, Cornell psychology researchers have found. The study indicates that belief in conspiracies may be less about a person's needs and motivations and more about their failure to recognize that they might be wrong. Conspiracy believers not only consistently overestimated their performance on numeracy and perception tests, revealing they tend to be less analytic in the way they think. The work counters previous theories that people believe conspiracies essentially because they want to, out of narcissism or to appear unique. "In many cases, they believe something that very few people agree with. Not only is it something that doesn't make a lot of sense, based on what we know about the world, but they also have no idea how far out in the fringe they are. Pennycook is the corresponding author of "Overconfidently Conspiratorial: Conspiracy Believers are Dispositionally Overconfident and Massively Overestimate How Much Others Agree with Them," which is published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. Rand and Pennycook started this research in 2018, observing that people who believe in conspiracies seem to have real faith in their own cognitive abilities, "which is paradoxical," Pennycook said, "because prior work has shown that people who believe in conspiracies tend to be more intuitive." Rather than completing specific tests with measurable outcomes, participants were given tasks where actual performance and their perceived performance were unrelated, such as quickly discerning an image so obscured, they essentially had to guess what it is. "Participants have little reason to believe that they did well—allowing higher estimated performance to more directly index higher levels of trait overconfidence without being confounded by actual performance," the researchers wrote. The studies then measured conspiracy beliefs by asking direct questions about popular—but false—conspiracy claims, including "the Apollo Moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood film studio," "Princess Diana's death was not an accident," and "Dinosaurs never existed." Results of these four studies show an association between a tendency toward overconfidence and belief in conspiracies, indicating that a disposition to overrate one's cognitive skills may play an important role in conspiracy beliefs. "If overconfidence is an important component of conspiracy beliefs, then it is likely that believers do not realize that they are in the minority," the researchers wrote. Another four studies tested the study participants' perceptions of others' beliefs, and found that overconfidence predicted both belief in conspiracies and the tendency to overestimate how much others believe in false conspiracies. On average, a minority of participants believed in the false conspiracies. Even so, they thought that a majority of others agreed with them in each study. That is, conspiracy believers massively overestimated how much others agreed with them. Conspiracy belief is a growing issue, thanks to an "expanded marketplace for conspiracy theories" online and on social media platforms, Pennycook said. However, the propensity to think most other people share these beliefs creates challenges for efforts to undermine false beliefs in conspiracies.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Methanol (methyl alcohol) and its isotopes (versions of elements) were detected in gases around a star called HD 100453, which is about 330 light-years from Earth. Researchers had previously detected methanol — but not its far rarer isotopes — in other star-forming disks. "Finding these isotopes of methanol gives essential insight into the history of ingredients necessary to build life here on Earth," study lead author Alice Booth, a research fellow at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said in a statement.

In HD 100453's disk, the researchers found that the ratio of methanol to other organic molecules was similar to that of comets in our solar system. The findings suggest that ices within protoplanetary disks eventually clump together to form comets loaded with complex organic molecules, which may then be delivered to planets through collisions.

"It was funny because there was a little, like, concern that, you know, we're gonna get Jared and Misha and Jensen together, and it's gonna be a little wacky, because, 15 years together, we got a little off," he added. Ackles, Padalecki and Collins announced the casting in February. Ackles portrays Ben, or Soldier Boy, on The Boys, which follows a team of vigilantes who take issue with dishonorable superheroes. Prime Video has yet to announce a premiere date for Season 5.</p>

Ackles was on the late night talk show to promote his new Prime Video series Countdown (premiering on Wednesday, June 25, with the first three episodes), but Jimmy Fallon did bring up his past show and ask about the potential for a Supernatural revival. “I mean, look, it's always hanging out there,” Ackles said. “ I think there's a reason we did it for 15 years. “I thought that they would fizzle out, like, once the show — show's been off for five years,” he admitted. Fallon wondered if that had to do with streaming, and Ackles did note that the show has done well on Netflix. “A lot of people during the pandemic, I think, found it, and they binged all 15 seasons, and now they're coming to these events, and they're wanting to ask us questions,” said Ackles. He pointed out that they don't get feedback on TV show sets from an audience while filming, but “now, we get to go and we get to see these crowds of people who really enjoy what we do, and it just it's energizing.” Supernatural did end with Dean dying on an ordinary hunt then flash-forwards showing Sam's life until he died of old age and joined his brother in heaven. But in the world of Supernatural, anything can be done to bring these characters back. Let us know in the comments section below. Read the story now on TV Insider.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Hastings has spent nearly five decades investigating one of the most unnerving and underreported patterns in modern military history: unidentified flying objects repeatedly interfering with nuclear weapons. Shortly after he began interviewing retired Air Force personnel in the early 1980s, Hastings says his phone started ringing after each call - but no one would speak. They wouldn't be monitoring me if I was some nut listening to liars.' Although initially shaken and concerned these mysterious calls would result in violent attacks or charges for divulging classified information, Hastings said he 'ultimately decided that this was important.' Hastings is best known for helping bring to light the now-infamous 1967 incident at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where multiple nuclear missiles were mysteriously disabled while security personnel above ground reported a glowing object hovering over the silos. Hastings' father worked at the base's radar facility, and as a teenager, Hastings took a janitorial job cleaning the air traffic control tower. Robert Hastings has spent nearly five decades investigating one of the most unnerving and underreported patterns in modern military history: unidentified flying objects repeatedly interfering with nuclear weapons One night, Hastings recalled, a radar supervisor waved him over to his screen and pointed out five unexplained blips. 'What he pointed out were these five unknown blips, which formally are called targets. That brief moment would go on to shape the rest of his life. Years later, he began interviewing military veterans who had witnessed similar strange phenomena - many of whom had direct experience with nuclear weapons. 'I began informally, at first very sporadically, seeking out Air Force veterans,' he said. And they were all telling me the same thing… these kinds of nuclear weapons related UFO incidents.' Among them was Captain David Schuur, a missile launch officer who described a chilling event at Minot Air Force Base in the 1960s. 'He said his missiles were actually temporarily activated for a period of time and were preparing to launch for all intents and purposes,' Hastings said. Hastings is best known for helping bring to light the now-infamous 1967 incident at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where multiple nuclear missiles were mysteriously disabled while security personnel above ground reported a glowing object hovering over the silos Hastings' experience inspired him to collect interviews from veterans who had similar experiences, especially around nuclear bases (pictured: Malmstrom) Hastings also described an event at Ellsworth Air Force Base where another witness allegedly encountered a UFO while working in a missile silo. Moments later, according to Hastings, a massive rhombus-shaped object appeared overhead - and the missile went offline. At times, the activity was even more alarming abroad. 'Unbelievably, one of the people I interviewed was a retired Soviet Army Colonel,' Hastings said. 'According to this document that George smuggled out and had translated… there was an intermediate range missile base in Soviet Ukraine… and for some 15 seconds, the missiles went into countdown mode. Despite the pattern, Hastings doesn't believe the so-called entities - what he refers to as NHI, or non-human intelligence - are attempting to start a war. 'What I emphasize to my audiences and in my book, to my readers, I don't think that the NHI who were involved in these incidents, either here or in the Soviet Union, were actually attempting to start World War III,' he said. He added, 'I think they're trying to keep humans from destroying ourselves, but also they don't want their activities terminated or negatively impacted by massive radiation surrounding the earth and so on years after the war.' CIA reference photograph of Soviet medium-range ballistic missile in Red Square, Moscow 'They were called together in a squadron wide meeting and told not to discuss what they quote "may or may not have seen," end quote.' But Hastings claimed his sources told a different story. 'It was apparently intermittent for 26 hours… I'm sure that the Air Force would not want to acknowledge that they had lost control or the ability to launch that many missiles for more than a day.' In his opinion, these incidents form a consistent and disturbing pattern. 'What my sources are confirming to me is that this has gone on repeatedly, year after year, decade after decade… The available testimony, the available evidence, even though it's anecdotal, confirms that the UFO nuclear weapons link is long standing, widespread and ongoing,' claimed Hastings, who has lectured at more than 500 colleges and universities over the course of his career. He meticulously verified each with official military discharge documents. On why he thinks UAPs are interfering with nuclear weapons: 'I think rather, what they were attempting to do is to scare the hell out of the nuclear forces, the nuclear powers, to basically say, "You better think twice. This file video grab image obtained April 28, 2020, courtesy of the US Department of Defense shows part of an unclassified video taken by Navy pilots that have circulated for years showing interactions with 'unidentified aerial phenomena' His work reportedly reached the highest levels of government. Even former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reportedly read Hastings' work, which helped convince him to back the secret Pentagon program known as AAWSAP and its successor, AATIP. Today, Hastings is 75 and retired due to congestive heart failure. He's no longer conducting new interviews, but he says his research continues to ripple through official circles - and among journalists and whistleblowers newly emboldened to speak out. 'I think it's just a question of time before the US government, probably in conjunction with other world governments, they're going to have to simultaneously admit… that these are NHI,' he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New footage shows an expressionless iRonCub MK3 robot taking off using four thrusters — two where its arms should be and two in a jetpack on its back. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Researchers have demonstrated the first successful vertical liftoff of a humanoid robot — a major step toward flying robots that mimic human capabilities. The new robot, dubbed iRonCub MK3, uses four thrusters to achieve vertical thrust, two built into its arms and two in a jetpack mounted on its back. In footage released by the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) to YouTube on 18 June, the mask-donning robot is held from a suspender and then activates, lifting off roughly 20 inches (50 centimeters) from the ground using its thrusters. It measures 3 feet (1 meter) tall while weighing 49 pounds (22 kilograms), adopting child-like dimensions, and donning a highly recognizable smooth and shiny "baby face" head. First launched in 2009 by the RobotCub Consortium of European universities, it is designed to be a testbed for research into human cognition and artificial intelligence (AI) and has been used in countless projects over the last 16 years. They added this work highlights the new possibilities that a flying, humanoid robot presents. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In contrast to many other robotic platforms currently in development, which typically focus exclusively on ground-based locomotion and manipulation, adding aerial mobility may pave the way for assistance in search and rescue missions, traversing collapsed buildings and flooded areas, or other terrain inaccessible to humans, the scientists said in the study. Combining flight with the ability to interact with its environment, a robot of this kind could clear debris and assist in locating or even extracting victims. They could even be deployed in hazardous environments where people can't safely operate, like the site of a nuclear or chemical leaks. This system is designed to allow a robot to emulate a number of human capabilities as it's being remotely controlled by an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) helmet-like heads-up display (HUD) and other specialized equipment. To ensure the chassis could handle the stress of takeoff and flight, the team performed a Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis — a problem-solving technique that centers around breaking a structure down into smaller interconnected components. One of the major challenges of achieving flight in a humanoid robot of this type is accounting for all of the joints and actuation points and adjusting them, as well as the thrusters, in a coordinated way, so the robot doesn't end up flying off course or upside down. The engineers managed this with what's called a Linear Parameter Varying Model Predictive Control (MPC), a complex flight controller that's constantly computing the optimal joint position and jet throttle. —Watch this humanoid robot perform a side flip for the first time The scientists extensively tested the system first in computer simulations before then launching real-world tests, in large part due to the safety risks of operating thrusters with exhaust temperatures in excess of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius). After successfully demonstrating a launch with a predefined trajectory and accurate tracking, the team now plans to focus its efforts on improving the flight controller to handle external disturbances that may occur during a real flight scenario, like wind or other inclement weather.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kate Shemirani, who had been struck off the nursing register, told her daughter to refuse chemotherapy Paloma Shemirani died last year at the age of 23 after refusing chemotherapy, despite having been told by doctors she had a high chance of survival if she had accepted the treatment. Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani told the BBC: “My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have.” Paloma began to have chest pains and breathing difficulties not long after graduating in 2023. Medics told her she had an 80 per cent chance of recovering from the cancer, which can cause death if left untreated, if she undertook chemotherapy. He told Paloma the 80 per cent chance of survival was “exaggerated”, and encouraged her to instead begin Gerson therapy, which involves a strict vegan diet, along with juices, supplements and coffee enemas. He said she should consider chemotherapy if her symptoms did not improve after six weeks. Paloma decided to go ahead with Gerson therapy during her hospital stay. Chantelle, a school friend, told the broadcaster: “I don't think her ideology was strong enough to make those decisions. She and her ex-husband, Paloma's father Faramarz Shemirani, wrote to the broadcaster to say they have evidence “Paloma died as a result of medical interventions given without confirmed diagnosis or lawful consent”. Mr Vickers denies playing a role in Paloma's death, telling the broadcaster its claims “are legally inaccurate”. She rose to online prominence during the pandemic, where she claimed Covid was a hoax and that vaccines were part of a plan to kill many people. In some posts she claims treating cancer with chemotherapy is “ill-informed” and akin to pouring mustard gas into people's veins. She charges around £70 for an annual membership to her site, while patients - including those with cancer - pay £195 for a consultation and personalised 12-week programme. He had begun a legal case before his sister died because he wanted an assessment of whether she was receiving appropriate medical treatment to be carried out. Gabriel had to inform his brother of the news. “I haven't come to terms with that at all,” he says.</p>
