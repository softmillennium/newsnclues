Steam's new in-game overlay performance monitor is in a public beta, allowing users to see the real FPS, including with DLSS and FSR frame generation, and today I'll show you how to install and configure it. On my Steam Deck and recent Linux gaming PC experiment, I use MangoHud to display live performance stats while I play; in fact, a version of it comes ready to go on Steam Deck. But there is a new means to monitor your performance, and it comes directly from Valve.First, what fresh features does this new monitor bring to the table? As you would expect, it reports the same as every other performance monitor: But with Steam's new in-game performance monitor, we can also see when DLSS / FSR frame generation has been enabled. Yes, the new Steam performance monitor can detect frame generation technologies and provide us with both the DLSS/FSR framegen-enhanced FPS and the baseline FPS in one-second intervals. With this, we can see, at a glance, the FPS boost provided by frame generation. If we are not using any form for frame generation, then we only see one set of FPS values. If frame generation is in use, we get both sets of FPS counters. Does the new performance monitor work in Linux? I just tested it with my Bazzite setup, currently in the lounge, ready for a quick gaming session. So, how can you get this working with your setup? I've detailed all the steps that you will need to do to get this working on your Windows and Linux gaming PC. Restart Steam for the change to take effect.

Mini PC specialist Geekom has shared a video which shows its latest IT15 model being subjected to unnatural levels of violence. We are accustomed to seeing devices, particularly portable ones, being dropped, crushed, and splashed as part of standard endurance testing. However, this cute little machine, packing up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 Processor 285H processor, endures torture like being spun in a washing machine, being hit by a sledgehammer, extremes of heat and cold, and the indignity of being dragged along the road by a motorbike. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: The following content is extremely satisfying.Get your GEEKOM IT15üîó https://t.co/rJjwsLAbnMGet 10% off with CODE: IT15F----#GEEKOM #MiniPC #tech #computer #Ultra #TechSolutions #extremechallenge #ExtremeGaming #test #hardware #pcbuild pic.twitter.com/3FXj2m70fdJune 20, 2025 A 1.8-ton car runs over the little 0.46-liter NUC-style device at least twice. Geekom's digital assassins were intent on whacking the IT15 some more, so they also sledgehammered it as it sat beneath two concrete blocks. Just when you think it might end, seeing the device being carried carefully on top of a stack of books, it gets ‚Äúdropped from height‚Äù down concrete steps. Someone in the Geekom team seemed to have then remembered that tests of devices enduring cold and heat were typical ruggedness assessment fare, so we saw the device chilled by sub-zero gases and then subjected to a blowtorch. After such rough treatment, the IT15 might be due a clean, right? It was a dry wash program, and not for too long, though. At last, the pummelling of the Geekom IT15 does actually come to an end, and we get a close-up of all its battle scars.

Beyond being tough, other notable specs of the IT15 include the device's compact size, and its decent expandability options (an extra M.2 2242 SSD slot, and room for a 2.5-inch SATA drive), plus it offers a broad selection of modern ports for its size. Geekom's recently launched IT15 is currently available direct, or from its Amazon store. We note that there's a $200 coupon available on Amazon US at the time of writing, which brings the top Intel Core Ultra9 285H, 32GB RAM, plus 2TB SSD storage configuration down to $999.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A court has determined that it was legal for Anthropic to train its AI tools on copyrighted works, arguing that the behavior is shielded by the ‚Äúfair use‚Äù doctrine, which allows for unauthorized use of copyrighted materials under certain conditions. In copyright law, one of the main ways courts determine whether using copyrighted works without permission is fair use is to examine whether the use was ‚Äútransformative,‚Äù which means that it is not a substitute for the original work but rather something new. ‚ÄúThis is the first major ruling in a generative AI copyright case to address fair use in detail,‚Äù says Chris Mammen, a managing partner at Womble Bond Dickinson who focuses on intellectual property law. He specifically rejected the argument that what humans do when reading and memorizing is different in kind from what computers do when training an LLM.‚Äù The case, a class action lawsuit brought by book authors who alleged that Anthropic had violated their copyright by using their works without permission, was first filed in August 2024 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. While Anthropic eventually shifted to training on purchased copies of the books, it had nevertheless first collected and maintained an enormous library of pirated materials. ‚ÄúAnthropic downloaded over seven million pirated copies of books, paid nothing, and kept these pirated copies in its library even after deciding it would not use them to train its AI (at all or ever again). Authors argue Anthropic should have paid for these pirated library copies. The lawsuit, Bartz v. Anthropic, was first filed less than a year ago; Anthropic asked for summary judgment on the fair use issue in February. It's notable that Alsup has far more experience with fair use questions than the average federal judge, as he presided over the initial trial in Google v. Oracle, a landmark case about tech and copyright that eventually went before the Supreme Court. Prior to this, there had only been one summary judgment decision issued in an AI copyright case. In Thomson Reuters v. Ross, a judge found that the AI startup Ross's training on materials from the Thomson Reuters-owned legal research firm Westlaw was not fair use‚Äîbut that case is already headed to an appeals court. In almost all of the ongoing copyright lawsuits, the AI company defendants are attempting to lay out ‚Äúfair use‚Äù arguments, so Alsup's decision will almost certainly play a large role in how these cases are argued going forward, especially cases where piracy isn't a factor. Fair use advocates are already celebrating this as a win. ‚ÄúJudge Alsup's ruling should be a model for other courts assessing whether Gen AI training on copyrighted material is fair use,‚Äù says Adam Eisgrau, the senior director of AI, Creativity, and Copyright Policy at the tech trade group Chamber of Progress. ‚ÄúHe found it is clearly transformative and affirmed that the purpose of copyright is to promote competition and creativity, not protect monopoly revenue streams.‚Äù Still, this is in many respects a truly split ruling, as Alsup heavily emphasized within the summary judgment that piracy was not legally excusable. During the discovery process of the lawsuit, Judge Alsup learned that Anthropic relied partially on downloading vast amounts of materials from pirated databases like Books3 to amass books to train AI tools like Claude. He offers details into the process in the summary judgment, noting that Anthropic cofounder Ben Mann downloaded the entirety of Books3 back in winter 2021, and didn't stop there: ‚ÄúAnthropic's next pirated acquisitions involved downloading distributed, reshared copies of other pirate libraries. In June 2021, Mann downloaded in this way at least five million copies of books from Library Genesis, or LibGen, which he knew had been pirated. And, in July 2022, Anthropic likewise downloaded at least two million copies of books from the Pirate Library Mirror, or PiLiMi, which Anthropic knew had been pirated,‚Äù Alsup writes. In Kadrey v. Meta, another hotly contested copyright lawsuit brought by authors, plaintiffs' lawyers have forcefully argued that Meta's acquisition of books from pirate libraries like LibGen was not legal nor shielded by the fair use doctrine. The lowest statutory damage for this type of copyright infringement is $750 per book, and Alsup notes that Anthropic's pirate library consisted of at least 7 million books, which means Anthropic faces billions in potential court-imposed penalties.

However, Redditor Fantastic-Ad8410 has been blessed with a Frankenstein AMD Radeon GeForce RTX 9070 XT, combining the best of both worlds. The Redditor was experiencing problems with his Asus TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition graphics card, leading him to return it to Micro Center for a replacement. Although the replacement GPU's packaging is labeled for the Asus TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition, the actual card inside features a shroud marked with both AMD Radeon and GeForce RTX branding. This unusual hardware issue appears to be a manufacturing mistake by Asus, directly stemming from the company's production line. Manufacturers often reuse designs across different graphics cards to save time and resources, especially within the same sub-brand. The TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition belong to the same TUF Gaming lineup, so it's normal that both models share identical designs. The TDPs for the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (300W) and Radeon RX 9070 XT (304W) are very similar, allowing Asus to use the same TUF Gaming cooler responsibly to cool both graphics cards adequately. It is not the first time Asus has experienced an assembly mistake. It suggests such errors are relatively common with Asus TUF Gaming graphics cards. Although it doesn't hold the same value as a misprinted banknote or trading card, it remains a very unique sample (one of two known cases), and perhaps a dedicated collector might be interested in buying it in the future. Meanwhile, Reddit users humorously suggest that the two owners should meet and swap shrouds. Jokes aside, at least this was a human mistake at the assembly line, and both owners received genuine graphics cards, unlike one unlucky victim involved in an assembly line theft who was given a pile of backpacks inside a sealed box instead of a GeForce RTX 5090.

This super tiny drone, put together by a team from China's National Defense University of Science and Technology, is akin to something out of a spy movie. The team, based in Hunan Province, China, recently shared a new drone they have developed, which is small enough to fit between your fingers. This pesky little spy device first buzzed on our radar shortly after its debut on CCTV state TV channel CCTV 7. This was picked up by the South China Morning Post, which highlighted Liang Hexiang, a student, showing off the tiny drone by holding it in between his fingers. There are several iterations of the design, but we get a good look at two in particular. One has just two wings, while the other has four and is controllable using mobile devices, such as a smartphone. Remote technology like this isn't just used for spy-related tasks. They can also be resourceful tools for recovering people and equipment from dangerous areas without risking additional bodies. Drones like the ones featured here can be highly flexible and useful in various military applications. Another key component in using remote devices like these is power. The unit needs to have enough charge to perform its task and bring itself back, or otherwise transmit the data it recorded before it completely dies. It appears to be a research project at this time. If the thought of an extra tiny mosquito drone piques your interest, you should check out this custom 3D-printed winged VTOL drone. Both of these projects demonstrate how a little ingenuity can result in an incredible final design. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal judge William Alsup ruled that it was legal for Anthropic to train its AI models on published books without the authors' permission. This marks the first time that the courts have given credence to AI companies' claim that fair use doctrine can absolve AI companies from fault when they use copyrighted materials to train large language models (LLMs). While the ruling is not a guarantee that other judges will follow Judge Alsup's lead, it lays the foundation for courts to side with tech companies over creatives. Fair use rulings take into account what the work is being used for (parody and education can be viable), whether it's being reproduced for commercial gain (you can write ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù fan fiction, but you can't sell it), and how transformative a derivative work is from the original. Companies like Meta have made similar fair use arguments in defense of training on copyrighted works, though before this week's decision, it was less clear how the courts would sway.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a lot to love about X-Men '97‚Äòs continuation and evolution of the iconic X-Men: The Animated Series when its first season rolled out last year, but perhaps one of the best was the reminder to X-fans who's primary experience with the character had been in adaptation, rather than in the comics, that Cyclops has always been one of the best X-Men characters. Marrying people's memories of Scott from the original show with the huge development the character underwent throughout the 21st century was a key part of updating him for X-Men '97‚Äìand now you can get some insight as to how it all happened in the series' expansive new artbook. Published by Abrams and written by James Field, X-Men '97: The Art and Making of the Animated Series dives into the early days of Marvel Television's decision to revive one of its most legendary cartoon series for a modern age. Featuring insight from creatives at every level of making the series, from head of Marvel TV Brad Winderbaum to artists and producers, the book also includes hundreds of new, never-before-seen concept art, storyboards, and early design concepts for how the team updated the '90s aesthetic of the show, while incorporating elements of comics designs and evolutions from across the X-Men's entire history. It's a perfect pickup for anyone who's in the long haul waiting for the show's highly anticipated second season, but for now, io9 has an exclusive first look inside the book for you to check out below, with insight on the earliest days of bringing X-Men '97 to life, as well as an exclusive look at the book's section on Cyclops. X-Men '97: The Art and Making of the Animated Series hits shelves July 1, and is available to preorder now.

Noctua's next-generation NF-A12x25 G2 120mm fans are finally available for purchase. A follow-up to the original NF-A12x25 fans, which launched back in 2018, the second-generation model made its first appearance at this year's Computex trade expo as part of a collaboration with Asus. Noctua continues to use its patented Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) for the fan construction, which is said to offer high tensile strength and low thermal expansion characteristics compared to traditional thermoplastics. The fan is available in three versions: a standard PWM model with speeds of up to 1800 RPM, an ultra-quiet LS-PWM model that tops out at 1100 RPM, and an Sx2-PP set that includes two fans. The two fans in the set are intentionally offset by 50 RPM, a design choice that is said to improve push-pull performance and help reduce acoustic interference when multiple fans operate side by side. According to the company, the new NF-A12x25 G2 fans can be used in a range of scenarios, including general case ventilation and more demanding tasks, such as cooling heatsinks or water cooling radiators. In internal testing, Noctua reports that the G2 model performed 3.5¬∞C better than the original NF-A12x25 at a 200W heat load on a 120x49 mm radiator, with both fans operating at similar noise levels. The Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 120mm fans can be purchased as set of two which saves $4.90. In case airflow scenarios, the G2 fan is said to deliver around 9% more airflow than its predecessor at the same pressure drop. Additionally, the updated model can operate approximately 1.5 to 3.5dB quieter in certain conditions while maintaining comparable thermal performance, particularly when used on radiators. Noctua will also offer a six-year warranty on its new NF-A12x25 G2. The company has plans to launch an all-black ‚ÄòChromax' version of the fan, which is expected to happen next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft wants everything to be an Xbox, but the problem with its ongoing ambition to rebrand every gaming-capable device as a pseudo gaming console is so few devices look like an Xbox. The next step on Microsoft's wacky, winding road to regaining hardware supremacy is a $400 bundle that includes a Meta Quest headset with a unique colorway, an Xbox controller, and a few months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for game streaming. If you were looking to dip your toe into VR, the $300 Quest 3S is still your best option, and the bundle adds enough to make it worth the extra Benjamin. Just know that the Quest 3S' displays don't offer everything you truly want for a big picture VR gaming experience. All it truly provides is access to Microsoft's streaming service, an extra Xbox controller, and the ergonomic Elite Strap that may help you game for longer without suffering a potential bout of neck strain. You just won't have the best displays for game streaming. I've become very intimate with the Quest 3S since it hit the scene last year, and it's what I usually suggest to anybody who wants to try VR without breaking the bank. The more expensive headset also uses better-looking pancake lenses compared to the older and lesser-quality Fresnel lenses on what's normally a $300 headset. While they both have the same internal specs and performance, there's a clear visual quality difference between both VR headsets. If you were planning to buy a VR device mainly to do game streaming on a giant, virtual display, I would normally suggest you go for the one that will help your games look their best. This can make some text on notes in a game like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nearly indecipherable unless you're directly looking at that memento directly in front of you and from close up. While Game Pass is easily one of the best game streaming services available, the Quest 3S makes streaming pitfalls a little harder to navigate. Games on Quest stream at 1,920√ó1,080 resolution, and Xbox Cloud Gaming suggests you have at least 20 Mbps internet speeds and a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. On the Quest 3S screens, any loss of visual clarity is so glaring that normally beautiful titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 appear like a pixelated mosaic. Speaking of Clair Obscur, you need very stable gameplay to hit those tight dodge or parry timings. I'm already terrible at hitting a parry, so suffering a team wipe because of lag is worse than agonizing. If you don't own a controller that pairs well with Quest 3S, the Xbox Edition has a fair amount of value for what you get. The controller's suggested retail price sits at around $65. Three months of Game Pass Ultimate would set you back another $60. If you plan to use your headset for game streaming‚Äîwhether through Xbox or Steam Link to hit up PCVR titles‚Äîyou won't have many issues with running out of storage. Most games on the Meta Store don't take up much space either, so you should feel safe sticking with the smaller storage option. Beyond a good deal, what you really want from this special edition are the Xbox colors. The neon accents help sell it as a ‚Äúgamer device,‚Äù enough that it shouldn't stick out standing shoulder to shoulder with your typical Razer PC gaming gear. Outside of Apple with its $3,500 Vision Pro, Meta is one of the few players still interested in doing large-scale, cheap VR/XR headsets. In the same vein, Game Pass is still one of the best deals in gaming, though it has become more expensive as of late. Now that hardware like the Xbox Series X and individual games cost more, streaming is starting to appear more enticing. Even then, Microsoft has promised a whole ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of new hardware devices that includes an Xbox-branded handheld PC made by Asus. In that case, Microsoft is reengineering its Windows operating system to provide a more console-like experience. Until we see where Microsoft next takes us on its grand gaming journey, we'll probably see even more devices that look a little more like an Xbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Eventual founders Sammy Sidhu and Jay Chia were working as software engineers at Lyft's autonomous vehicle program, they witnessed a brewing data infrastructure problem ‚Äî and one that would only become larger with the rise of AI. There wasn't a tool for Lyft engineers that could understand and process all of those different types of data at the same time ‚Äî and all in one place. This left engineers to piece together open source tools in a lengthy process with reliability issues. ‚ÄúWe had all these brilliant PhDs, brilliant folks across the industry, working on autonomous vehicles but they're spending like 80% of their time working on infrastructure rather than building their core application,‚Äù Sidhu, who is Eventual's CEO, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. Sidhu and Chia helped build an internal multimodal data processing tool for Lyft. When Sidhu set out to apply to other jobs, he found interviewers kept asking him about potentially building the same data solution for their companies, and the idea behind Eventual was born. Eventual built a Python-native open source data processing engine, known as Daft, that is designed to work quickly across different modals from text to audio and video, and more. And that's kind of where we saw, usage just increased dramatically.‚Äù While the original idea behind building Daft stemmed from the autonomous vehicle space, there are numerous other industries that process multimodal data, including robotics, retail tech, and healthcare. The company now counts Amazon, CloudKitchens and Together AI, among others, as customers. Eventual recently raised two rounds of funding within eight months. This latest round will go toward bulking up Eventual's open source offering as well as creating a commercial product that will allow its customers to build AI applications off of this processed data. ‚ÄúDaft fits into this huge macro trend of generative AI being built around text, image, video, and voice.

It blends high-fidelity audio of your favorite songs with internal vibrations. As a sex toy reviewer and former college radio DJ, I was immediately game. The company sent me a prototype version to test ahead of the Kickstarter launch‚Äîthis isn't a full review because it's a preproduction unit, and WIRED doesn't like to make definitive statements on crowd-funded products until the company starts shipping to customers. That said, this internal music player is in a class of its own. Sex tech has come such a long way, and people expect their toys, whether they're vibrators, dildo, or butt plugs, to be aesthetically pleasing. There's the main speaker with a dial on the side, as well as a round puck and two small speakers on top. With Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, and Dua Lipa, I knew it wouldn't do much for me. But what I discovered during that brief foray into commercial pop was that music with bass was essential to really experiencing what the creators of the Groove Thing had intended. As the instructions for the Groove Thing emphasize over and over, this isn't a device designed to get you off or even necessarily give you an orgasm. For me, those songs came from post-rock bands like Mogwai and Godspeed You! However, as much as I can listen to those bands on repeat for hours, I can't say that feeling the bass inside me was particularly enjoyable. While I did explore a handful of songs and experimented with different volumes to feel varying intensities inside me, done via the dial on the Groove Thing, it didn't take long for me to lose interest. You just lay there while the vaginal (or anal) attachment bounces against your G-spot (or P-spot) to the beat of whatever song is on. The motor is also quite noisy, which I found distracting. This could be ironed out with the finished product. While it's not something for me, I can see how this type of sex toy, which emphasizes musical pleasure, could be enticing for others. I have a mildly unhealthy obsession with music, but there's a difference between that and wanting to feel your favorite song in your vagina or butt. It doesn't help that the final MSRP is expected to be $275. If music and sex are intimately intertwined for you, the Groove Thing might pique your interest. But let's make one thing clear‚Äîthis is hardly the first internal music player. Plenty of others exist, like Ohmibod's Freestyle G music vibrator, Lovehoney's Juno Music-Activated Vibrating Butt Plug, or the Lovense Vulse. Groove Thing will say its vibrations are more dynamic, and maybe that's true, but not enough for me to keep the tunes going.

Portable power stations have surged in popularity in recent years, becoming essential gear for a range of situations‚Äîwhether you're facing winter power outages or heading outdoors for summer adventures like camping. In contrast to standard power banks, this device offers enough juice to run small appliances like mini fridges as well as more energy-intensive electronic devices. The Bluetti power station, especially in this deal, takes it a notch higher by offering a 100W solar panel, and makes it a great investment if you're considering going green with off-grid power. Currently, Amazon is offering the Bluetti EB3A power station with 100W solar panel included at a record low price of $299, down from $599. The Bluetti EB3A is a compact portable power station that includes a compact 268Wh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery to provide safe, stable, and reliable power. It has two 600W AC outlets with a surge capacity of 1200W, thus it can be used with a wide range of devices from laptops and phones to appliances and even delicate devices like desktop computers. Where other competitors require utilizing their large power bricks to charge, the EB3A can be charged at 350W using a single cable. The onboard MPPT controller can accept up to 200W of solar input so you can upgrade with additional solar equipment in the future if desired. Bluetti EB3A is also a reliable uninterruptible power supply that can seamlessly shift to battery power in the event of grid failure: This is valuable in protecting sensitive electronics from data loss or destruction in unplanned outages. The power station is also equipped with many output ports such as USB-A, USB-C, and DC which are able to support most devices you might want to charge. What's more, its small and lightweight size make it easy to carry whether to a camp or picnic or just for power backup at home. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Best for AthletesSkratch Labs Hydration Sport Drink MixRead more We spoke with experts and tasted powders galore to narrow down your hydration options, like our top pick, Liquid I.V. Overall, you want to find something with a good balance of electrolytes, sugar, and carbohydrates. And make sure you're drinking water on a daily basis‚Äîno magic powder is going to help if you're just plain thirsty. Be sure to check out our related buying guides! has been a staple in my household for years. And when I inevitably run out of ice on day three, it helps my water taste better, too. This powder has a solid mix of ingredients in concentrations that aren't too high, making it a reliable option to reach for in day-to-day life. It's way higher both calorie-, carb-, and sugar-wise than other hydration powders on this list. But it doesn't bother my stomach despite those higher ingredient concentrations, and it's easy to drink a lot of, whereas some other powders are a bit of a slog once you get the first few gulps down. It's high in carbohydrates, which translated to a boost in energy while working out that I noticed after just a few minutes, and it's also a bit higher in sugar content than some others I tried. This is a good powder for athletes that are quickly running through their body's stores. They're sweet, salty, and candylike, immediately making you produce a bunch of saliva. They're available in large pill bottles as well as small five-serving packets, making them ideal for when you truly need electrolytes on the go. The balanced sodium and carbohydrate content makes these a good option for when you're working out intensely and need to re-up your electrolytes every 30 minutes. But darn if I don't like it anyway. It does have a balanced mix of sodium, carbohydrates, and sugars, making it a good option for rehydration outside of intensive exercise. I find that the pleasant flavor and higher sodium and carb content help my hangovers go away quickly in comparison to just drinking plain water (or something with higher sodium content, which can taste a bit abrasive when my head is spinning). Celsius is known for its (frankly delicious) energy drinks, but the manufacturer makes caffeine-free hydration packets too. The packets were frustrating to open sometimes, but upon mixing with 16.9 ounces of water, they're tasty. This formula is distinctly saltier than others I tried. Bodyarmor has a few different caffeinated flavors, with 95 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The resulting color is basically neon, and the flavors are concentrated enough that I found them most palatable when mixed with nearly 30 ounces of water. They're also quite salty‚Äîthis powder made me thirsty long after it was gone, which could be a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it. I don't love the mix of ingredients‚Äîit has a high sodium and potassium content, but it's very low in carbohydrates, so pair this drink with a snack if you can. My favorite was the watermelon flavor, which I could happily guzzle all day long. The manufacturer recommends using at least 12 ounces of water per stick, but it tasted the best to me if I dissolved it in around 18 to 20 ounces. I also liked that the calories were negligible‚ÄîI don't have to worry about meeting my deficit as much as I do with some other packets. I quite liked the light blood-orange flavor I tested of these caffeine-free electrolyte packets, as well as the fact there are no artificial colors or off-tasting chemical notes. (There's also a raspberry melon flavor, but I can't vouch for that one.) One packet is enough for 8 ounces of water, though more often than not I used 16 ounces and could still taste enough of the flavor. If that doesn't bother you, you can buy directly online without a rep, and your purchase is FSA and HSA eligible. My favorite part about DryWater's electrolyte powders is how nuanced the flavors are. They're not overly sweet or flavorful‚Äîthey're still a bit sweet, but they taste more like enhanced water and less like an entirely different beverage altogether. If you want assisted hydration without the zip and tang of typical sports beverages, this is what you're looking for. The taste won't win any awards, as it's sweetened with stevia, and that's definitely the predominant flavor of all the varieties (blood orange, cactus pear, pineapple ginger, ‚Äútidal wave‚Äù), but if you're used to energy drinks, this is a cheaper, more multifaceted way to get your fix at just under $2 per packet. Shelley Balls, MDA, RDN, LDN, registered dietitian and nutritionist for Flawless Bloom. Melissa Jaeger, RD, LD, head of nutrition for MyFitnessPal. TL;DR Don't choose something with ultra-high amounts of sodium, carbohydrates, or sugar unless you need to based on your exercise levels or a sweat test. Amy Brownstein, a registered dietitian nutritionist at MyNetDiary, says electrolytes are minerals that exist naturally in your body. These include magnesium, calcium, chloride, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous. Electrolyte powders usually contain these, as well as sugars and carbohydrates which can help a little bit with the absorption of the electrolytes. Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist, says humans usually lose sodium when working out or spending time in hot temperatures and also that carbohydrates are important to help replenish and preserve muscle glycogen stores to prevent fatigue, especially if you'll be active for more than 30 minutes. Basically, if you're working out a lot and not replenishing lost carbs, you'll feel fatigued much faster‚Äîand that's especially true for intense workouts or long sporting events, in which case she recommends re-upping carbohydrates every 30 to 45 minutes. Sugars like glucose serve similar purposes, helping to replenish muscle glycogen as well. If you're just looking for supplements for day to day life or to soothe your hungover brain, you don't need as much sodium or carbohydrates. Brownstein says to choose a powder within the context of your daily habits and diet; Most people already consume the recommended 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, so if you're not depleting sodium stores with intense exercise, you probably don't need a powder with a high sodium content. Ultimately, the best way to figure out exactly what you need is by getting a sweat test done to analyze the contents of your sweat. But short of doing that, your best bet is to choose a powder that lives somewhere in the middle of ingredient concentration‚Äîunless you're sweating a ton, working out in high heat, or training in high altitudes. Brownstein adds that if you notice white, chalky residue on your skin or clothes after working out, you might need to up your sodium intake. Luckily, if you want to avoid these ingredients, many of our recommendations omit them. To avoid stomach upset, Balls mentions that you might want to look for powders that are lower in magnesium (which can have a laxative effect in high amounts). She also mentions that calcium and iron can interfere with the absorption of one another, so choose a powder that has balanced, lower amounts of those two supplements. Brownstein mentions that high sugar and sodium content can upset some peoples' stomachs, too, and that you should read the labels to make sure you're not over-supplementing (or over-caffeinating). If something contains 100 percent of your daily recommended zinc content, for example, you want to make sure you're not also taking a multivitamin with the same amount of zinc. Per Heather Gosnell, a pediatrician, sodium is the key ingredient for effective rehydration. She also says a little sugar and carbohydrates help your body absorb water but to avoid high-sugar drinks. Balls says to look for a powder that includes the key electrolytes lost: sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. She says, if possible, to avoid drinks with artificial sweeteners. Hallie Zwibel, director of the Center for Sports Medicine at New York Institute of Technology, adds that ‚Äúin addition to causing upset stomach and reduced fluid absorption, repeatedly consuming high sugar foods and beverages can lead to diabetes, as well as potential weight gain.‚Äù He also said, ‚ÄúWhile electrolyte packets can help replenish essential minerals lost through sweat, they should not replace daily water intake.‚Äù She adds, ‚ÄúElectrolyte drinks are helpful after intense exercise or heat exposure but avoid high-sugar options. For everyday hydration, simple water and healthy foods are best.‚Äù Balls adds that if you're sweating a lot or are physically active for more than 30 minutes, plain water won't be as beneficial to promote optimal hydration status. She also reminds us that a balanced diet can help with lost electrolytes‚Äîas can drinking dairy or soy milk, or just using plain old table salt to replenish lost sodium. And to keep things simple, Heather Jaeger, head of nutrition at MyFitnessPal, says she recommends the ‚Äú3H‚Äù method to know when to reach for a hydration powder: "If you're active for an hour or more, exercising in hot conditions, or working hard enough to sweat, that's when electrolytes can really support rehydration and recovery.‚Äù Gosnell says that hydration solutions and powders are safe for most healthy adults when used as directed, but for children and those with medical conditions, consult a doctor first. She adds, ‚ÄúIf you have health concerns or severe dehydration, seek medical advice before using electrolyte drinks.‚Äù Brownstein adds that, over time, unnecessarily high sodium concentrations can contribute to high blood pressure and can potentially contribute to other problems, so avoid ultra-high sodium concentrations unless you're exercising intensively. I drank each powder, dissolved in water following the packaging instructions. I tested these powders over the course of a few weeks in my day-to-day life, including while working out and while hungover. I looked for adequate nutrition (per my conversations with dietitians), convenient packaging, and good taste.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Whether through your glasses, laptop, or smartphone, companies have hopped on the bandwagon to integrate blue light blockers to cut the wavelength from reaching your eyes. The claim is to help improve sleep and reduce eyestrain, even though studies have yet to find these blockers effective. It has been manufacturing phones and tablets with its ‚ÄúNxtpaper‚Äù LCD technology for a few years, and the third generation in the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G smartphone is good enough to block 61 percent more blue light than a normal tablet to ‚Äúprotect your eyes and reduce eye fatigue.‚Äù I've used this $250 Android phone for more than a week, and I don't think the claims hold up, but I've still come to enjoy the matte paperlike screen. Don't buy it for the blue-light blocking promises; buy it because the matte screen looks and feels nice. It has a pleasing paperlike texture and isn't reflective. Colors are a smidge more muted than phones with OLED screens, and text and app icons can appear a little fuzzy‚ÄîI only really noticed this when comparing it side by side with another handset. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I don't mind the marble pattern, but the camera module isn't symmetrical and feels a little out of place. Still, it doesn't look like any other $250 smartphone. On the right edge of the phone is the Nxtpaper switch, and flicking it up lets you choose from three display modes: Color Paper Mode, Ink Paper Mode, and Max Ink Mode. I'll get to what these modes do, but I want to point out that the switch feels cheap and has a slight rattle. (You can at least set it so that it enters a specific mode when you flip the switch instead of having to choose every time.) This is still an LCD, but to my eyes, it's better than Android phones that try to use E Ink. You get a similar paperlike reading experience and a matte screen, but unlike the Minimal Phone or the Boox Palma 2, it's not frustrating or slow. The 120-Hz screen refresh rate and decent onboard CPU make it perform like a normal phone. I've enjoyed switching to either of these modes when I'm reading, whether through Chrome, Google News, or even doomscrolling through Bluesky. I usually turn it off and use the standard mode when swiping through Instagram Reels, though nothing's stopping you from watching videos in these modes if you prefer the desaturated look.

You'll get notifications from these apps, and them alone. This mode is designed to be used for large bouts of reading, say in the Kindle app, and if that's what you end up doing, it greatly extends battery life to several days. Again, a mode like this makes way more sense than buying a Boox Palma 2, because it gets very close to the experience of an E Ink screen, without the annoyingly slow refresh experience. But there is one big problem with TCL's Nxtpaper tech: it's hard to see in direct sunlight. In shady areas or even on cloudy days, I didn't have much trouble reading the screen. But with the sun directly overhead, it's nearly impossible to read. The company says this has been addressed with its Nxtpaper 4.0 generation, but that's a hardware change, so you'll only see it in new TCL phones and tablets with Nxtpaper 4.0 technology. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The 5,010-mAh battery feels like it should last longer‚ÄîI routinely hit around 30 to 25 percent by bedtime with average use, though you can extend it with Max Ink Mode. There's no wireless charging, but this phone has all the accouterments you'd want, from a microSD card slot for expandable storage and NFC for contactless payments to a headphone jack. The phone feels a little slippery and top-heavy, so I recommend finding a case to be safe, though I've dropped it a handful of times and luckily don't see any scratches on the glass screen. It'll work with every major US carrier and is exclusively sold unlocked on Amazon, a nice break from many other TCL phones that are locked to a carrier in the US. Speaking of, I didn't have any issues with the 5G connectivity, but I did get some comments about call quality. I didn't have trouble hearing others, though I wish the call volume could get louder, but a few people struggled to hear me via the phone's speaker mode. I tested this with some friends, who didn't have any issues, so it's hard to say if it's a network problem or the caller's hardware.

That leaves the camera, which isn't terrible for a $250 phone. Quality heavily depends on the lighting, and even indoors during daylight, you'll probably want to turn on Night mode to avoid a blurry photo. The 50-MP main can struggle with high-contrast scenes, and colors don't look super accurate, but the results are passable. No problems scanning QR codes, at the very least. It's not significantly worse than other phones at this price, but Motorola now offers two Android upgrades for its Moto G phones. I'd buy a CMF Phone 2 Pro ($279) over the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G, as it looks better, has stronger performance, and nicer cameras. But the pleasing matte screen has this calming quality that I've come to enjoy over the past week, and I like the ability to switch to even less saturation or monochrome if I'm reading a lot. If you've eyed something like the Boox Palma 2 for some time, I think you'll have a much nicer experience with this TCL. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waymo robotaxis can now be hailed in Atlanta via Uber. Uber, which has locked in partnerships with 18 autonomous vehicles companies, said it has an annual run-rate of 1.5 million mobility and delivery AV trips on its network. Meanwhile, Waymo said it provides 250,000 paid robotaxi rides every week across Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco. The addition of Atlanta to that list should push those numbers up. Waymo's fleet in Atlanta is in the ‚Äúdozens‚Äù and will eventually be expanded over time, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. The ‚ÄúWaymo on Uber‚Äù service is a hybrid of sorts where robotaxis and human-driven vehicles intermingle. That structure differs from the other markets where Waymo operates. In those cities, riders use the Waymo One app to hail robotaxis. When an Uber user is notified they've been matched with a Waymo, they can choose to accept or switch to a human-driven ride. Robotaxi rides will cost the same as an UberX, Uber Comfort, or Uber Comfort Electric driven by a human, the companies said. Last September, Uber and Waymo announced plans to offer a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025 as part of an expanded partnership.

Earlier this year, Eric Antonow was in a coffee shop with his family when he felt the familiar, twitchy urge to reach for his phone. He patted his pockets for relief‚Äîthe cool, thin slab was still there. He joked to his family that, like an addict jonesing for a hit, he would one day need a medical-grade solution to detox from his phone. Antonow, a former marketing executive at Google and Facebook, has been committing to bits for half a decade, making what he calls ‚Äúmindless toys.‚Äù His online shop features projects like a ‚Äúlistening switch‚Äù to indicate when one is paying attention, and a vinyl for silent meditation, with 20 minutes of recorded silence on each side (record player not required). From that original generative sketch emerged a more realized design: a 6-inch slab of clear acrylic with rounded corners, like the iPhone, and green edges that resembled glass. Antonow placed an order for samples, and started an Indiegogo campaign for the Methaphone: to ‚Äúleave your phone without the cravings or withdrawal.‚Äù The first Methaphones were sold for $25 through a crowdfunding campaign. The dilemma of the smartphone is that we all want to use our phones less, but few of us actually do. In response, a cottage industry has emerged to offer detachment tools. There are apps with symbolic names, like Freedom and Focus, that block distracting content. (Unpluq's cofounder, Jorn Rigter, says people use the device equally to block social apps, like Instagram, and work apps, like Slack, which have become just as sticky.) There's Yondr, a lockable pouch to prevent phone use in courtrooms and concert halls. And there's a growing lineup of ‚Äúdumb phones,‚Äù some at premium, postmodern prices. You can buy stickers that look like app icons. Unlike those solutions, the Methaphone doesn't do much of anything. It's more of a statement: ceci n'est pas un phone. But in a culture of technological excess, the project has resonated widely, like Ozempic in an epidemic of screen obesity. In May, when the first batch of Methaphones arrived, Antonow sent them to a dozen friends to get their reactions. One recipient was Catherine Goetze, who quickly posted a video about the Methaphone to her 400,000 followers on TikTok. In the video, Goetze is standing in line at a San Francisco boba shop, hunched over just like everyone else‚Äîbut instead of scrolling her phone, she's scrolling ‚Ä¶ a slab of clear acrylic. Within five days, the video had more than 53 million views. After Goetze's video, Antonow says the Methaphone ‚Äúmassively sold out.‚Äù (He had initially ordered a run of 100 units, sold as a limited release, for $25.) While he plans to restock, he says the future of the Methaphone is less about individual purchases than larger-scale experiments‚Äîsay, a restaurant that offers a Methaphone on the menu so that people can dine without distractions. ‚ÄúOur phones have really become like pacifiers,‚Äù she says. She compares it to a smoker using a zero-nicotine vape: ‚ÄúThe ritual remains, but the hit is gone.‚Äù (She adds that this is not, in fact, how methadone works.) Antonow isn't the first to parody phone addiction. The NoPhone, launched in 2014, is a plastic brick that bills itself as ‚Äúa fake phone for people addicted to real phones.‚Äù It now comes in three flavors: Original (no screen, no battery, no charger, $20), Selfie (with a mirror, $23), and Air (an empty bag, yours for $9). Antonow has recently taken his own design further: He now sells the Methaphone with an optional sticker pack featuring ‚Äúanalog apps,‚Äù like Walk, Read, See Friends, and Daydream. Antonow encouraged me to treat it like a set of rosary beads‚Äîsomething to touch instead of my phone, whenever the impulse struck. One morning, I brought it with me to a coffee shop. Then I slipped it back into my pocket for good.
