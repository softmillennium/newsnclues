            At least 120 children have been kidnapped by jihadist insurgents in northern Mozambique in recent days, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Tuesday, warning of a rise in abductions in the country's troubled Cabo Delgado province.



            The children are reportedly being used by an Islamic State‚Äìlinked group known locally as al-Shabab to transport looted goods, perform forced labor, and in some cases serve as child soldiers or be forced into marriage.
    


            Mozambique has been battling the Islamist insurgency in Cabo Delgado since 2017. Government forces have struggled to contain the violence, relying on support from troops sent by Rwanda, South Africa, and other regional partners.
    


            In 2020, the insurgents carried out a wave of attacks in which they beheaded dozens of people, including children. Witnesses have said that children abducted from towns and villages have been used as fighters in subsequent attacks.

            The violence has displaced more than 600,000 people and spilled into neighboring provinces, according to the United Nations. HRW said there had been a resurgence of attacks and child kidnappings in the last two months and called on Mozambique's government to do more to find the children and prevent further abductions.
    


            The problems in Cabo Delgado were largely overshadowed by Mozambique's deadly and long-running post-election protests last year. Cabo Delgado has also been battered by several recent cyclones and hurt by US President Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid.



            The secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Jan Egeland, visited Cabo Delgado this month and described the situation in northern Mozambique as a neglected crisis.
    


            ‚ÄúClimate shocks, increasing violence and spiraling hunger are having a terrible impact on the population,‚Äù Egeland said.
    


            The NRC said more than 5 million people faced critical levels of hunger and more than 900,000 people faced emergency hunger conditions.

Serbia has temporarily stopped all ammunition exports and will focus on replenishing its domestic stockpiles, President Aleksandar Vucic announced on Monday. The move comes in response to Russian accusations that Belgrade has been secretly supplying arms to Ukraine.

The president made the remarks following a meeting of the extended board of Serbia's General Staff. Speaking to local media, Vucic said the country has ‚Äúnow stopped literally everything and [is] sending it to our army.‚Äù

Belgrade is seeking new markets for its military production, Vucic noted, adding that he would not deprive some 150,000 Serbs ‚Äì military plant workers and their families ‚Äì of their livelihoods. However, Serbia will tighten its export rules, and any shipments abroad will now require special approval, he said.

‚ÄúIt will no longer be the case that permission is given by two ministers and the goods flow smoothly. We'll see what will happen in the future in accordance with the interests of Serbia,‚Äù Vucic stressed.

The announcement came after Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) accused Serbia of covertly sending munitions to Ukraine, despite Belgrade's assertion of neutrality in the conflict and traditionally strong ties with Moscow.

‚ÄúThe ammunition produced at Serbian defense plants, primarily for heavy long-range systems, is sent to NATO countries in the interests of Ukraine in the form of full assembly kits. This allows Kiev to formally receive military products that are no longer Serbian but assembled at defense factories in Western countries,‚Äù the SVR said.

A similar accusation was made by the SVR in late May, when the agency alleged that Serbian companies had covertly supplied around 100,000 munitions for multiple rocket launchers and one million small arms rounds to Ukraine. The ammunition was reportedly funneled through various countries and accompanied by falsified end-user certificates.

At the time, Vucic denied the existence of any direct contracts with Kiev, noting that Serbian law prohibits arms sales to nations at war. He blamed third countries for possibly redirecting shipments to Ukraine and pledged to crack down on any attempts to circumvent Belgrade's export restrictions.

By Nadezhda Romanenko, political analyst

The recent revelation that Iranian nuclear scientist Mostafa Sadati-Armaki was killed along with his entire family ‚Äì his wife, two daughters, and son ‚Äì in an Israeli airstrike should stop even hardened strategists in their tracks. This wasn't just a precision strike. It was an execution of a household.

Sadati-Armaki was not a senior official. He was a mid-level scientist‚Äîan engineer working within Iran's nuclear framework. That role may have made him a target in the logic of modern conflict. But nothing, not even that logic, can justify killing his children in their own home.

This wasn't an isolated incident. On June 13, at least five other nuclear scientists were killed in Israeli strikes across Tehran: Fereydoon Abbasi, Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, Abdolhamid Minouchehr, Ahmadreza Zolfaghari Daryani, and Seyed Amir Hossein Feghhi. Their credentials tied them to Iran's nuclear program. All had played some role, technical or administrative, in Iran's nuclear development. None were combatants. Most were academics. Some had already retired from state positions.

Crucially, they weren't alone. In multiple reported cases, family members died alongside them. Wives. Daughters. The daughter of a senior official.

These were not errant missiles landing in crowded urban spaces. These were targeted strikes on homes, in residential areas, at night, when families were together. This isn't the fog of war. It is its deliberate weaponization. The children didn't make enrichment policy. The spouses didn't oversee uranium labs. But they died because of proximity‚Äîbecause they were related to someone deemed dangerous.

To call this ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù is cowardice. When decision-makers approve a strike on a home, knowing who sleeps inside, the outcome is no longer an accident. It is a choice.

Some argue that in an asymmetrical war, deterrence must be personal. But this is not deterrence‚Äîit's liquidation. It suggests that no civilian life adjacent to state infrastructure is worth preserving. It sends the message that not even scientists' families will be spared, as if moral limits are luxuries we can no longer afford.

This is not a defense of Iran's nuclear posture. It is a defense of the basic principle that families‚Äîchildren‚Äîcannot be combatants. If we abandon that line, we are not winning anything. We are declaring that fear is stronger than law, that vengeance is smarter than diplomacy.

Killing scientists' families doesn't dismantle programs. It doesn't prevent future threats. It only makes peace more remote and retaliation more likely. What we normalize now, others will imitate later.

This is not strength. It is strategic and moral collapse. And if this is where warfare is headed, then everyone‚Äîregardless of nationality‚Äîshould be deeply, urgently afraid.

Iran has agreed to a ceasefire with Israel since Tehran's military objectives have been achieved, the Iranian Supreme National Security Council has announced.

US President Donald Trump announced earlier that there would be a truce after nearly two weeks of tit-for-tat strikes. Trump claimed that Israel and Iran had approached him ‚Äúalmost simultaneously, and said, ‚ÄòPEACE!', adding that the Middle East and the whole world would be ‚Äúwinners‚Äù in a cessation of hostilities.

Iran's top security body announced ‚Äúthe national decision to impose the cessation of war on the Zionist enemy [Israel] and its vile supporters‚Äù in a statement on Tuesday.

The Iranian military ‚Äúwithout any trust to the words of the enemy and with their hands on the trigger, are ready to deliver a decisive and deterring response to any violating act by the enemy,‚Äù it warned.

Tehran delivered a ‚Äúhumiliating and exemplary response to the enemy's cruelty,‚Äù including a missile attack on the US base in Qatar on Monday and the latest wave of strikes against Israel.

‚ÄúThe courage and sacrifice‚Äù of the Iranian military ‚Äúforced the enemy into regret and accepting defeat and the unilateral cessation of its aggression,‚Äù it added.

A few hours before, Israel also officially confirmed agreeing to the ceasefire.

The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would ‚Äúrespond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.‚Äù

The statement thanked Trump and the US military, which hit targets in Iran on Sunday, for ‚Äútheir support in defense and their participation in eliminating the Iranian nuclear threat.‚Äù

Netanyahu's office also said he held a cabinet meeting to report that ‚ÄúIsrael has removed a dual immediate existential threat ‚Äì both in the nuclear and ballistic missile fields‚Äù posed by Iran.

Moscow welcomes the ceasefire between Israel and Iran, and hopes that it will be ‚Äúsustained,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.

‚ÄúThis is what Russia has been calling for from the very beginning of this conflict. So yes, this can and should be welcomed,‚Äù Peskov told journalists.

TEHRAN, June 24. /TASS/. Tehran had a contingency plan in place for restoring its nuclear facilities in case they were attacked, and is currently assessing the damage caused, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) head Mohammad Eslami said.

""We took necessary preparatory measures and are currently evaluating the damage. Restoration plans for [nuclear facilities] were provided for in advance, and our objective is to avoid any interruptions in production and services,"" he told National Iranian Radio and Television.

Earlier, Iran's central military headquarters Khatam al-Anbiya said that the US attack on the Islamic republic's nuclear facilities was absolutely ineffective.

Overnight into June 13, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, aimed at Iran's nuclear program. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that 200 fighter jets attacked more than 100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities.

On the evening of June 13, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced that Iran retaliated by attacking dozens of targets in Israel with missiles, including military facilities and air bases, striking, in particular, the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. In the following days, Israel and Iran exchanged more strikes. Both sides reported casualties and losses as a result of these attacks and admitted that some targets were hit but claimed that the damage was limited. Russia has condemned Israel's actions and expressed readiness to mediate the conflict.

The United States joined the armed conflict nine days after its escalation: in the early hours of June 22, American bombers attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. On Monday evening, Tehran launched a missile strike on the United States' Al-Udeid military base in Qatar. According to the US, there were no casualties, nor any significant damage caused in the attack.

TEL AVIV, June 24. /TASS/. The Israeli army only attacked a radar system near Tehran in response to two Iranian missile attacks that took place after the introduction of the ceasefire, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reported.

According to its statement, the attack was limited to this one strike. ""Pursuant to the conversation between [US] President [Donald] Trump and [Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, Israel has refrained from additional attacks,"" the office said.

The Israeli side emphasized that the attack retaliated the recent Iranian missile strikes, which Tel Aviv considered a violation of the ceasefire agreements.

""The ceasefire was set for 7:00 a.m. (4:00 a.m. GMT) this morning. At 3:00 a.m. (12:00 a.m. GMT), Israel forcefully attacked in the heart of Tehran, struck regime targets and eliminated hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces personnel. Shortly before the ceasefire was due to take effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which took the lives of four of our citizens in Be'er Sheva. The ceasefire took effect at 7:00 a.m. (4:00 a.m. GMT). At 7:06 a.m. (4:06 a.m. GMT), Iran launched one missile at Israeli territory, and two additional missiles at 10:25 a.m. (7:25 a.m. GMT). These missiles were either intercepted or fell in open areas, and caused neither casualties nor damage. In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar installation near Tehran,"" the statement said.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had fully agreed to implement the ceasefire agreement about six hours after its announcement, that is about 7:00 a.m. Moscow time (4:00 a.m. GMT). According to the US leader, Tehran will cease fire first, followed by Tel Aviv twelve hours later, and ""upon the 24th hour, an official end to the 12-day war will be saluted by the world.""

Later, the Israeli army press service said that servicemen had recorded a new missile attack by Iran. According to the military, northern Israel was shelled. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Iran had violated the ceasefire and ordered the servicemen to launch new powerful strikes against Tehran. The Iranian Armed Forces General Staff had previously refuted reports of missile attacks on Israeli territory following the ceasefire. US President Donald Trump got involved in the situation, expressing his unhappiness with both Iran and Israel and urging all sides to seek detente.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, June 24. /TASS/. The West is now pleading for a ceasefire in Ukraine without preconditions - something Vladimir Zelensky categorically rejected just a few years ago, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has stated.

""Recall how it all started. Russia is to be strategically defeated on the battlefield. They were practically shouting and going hysterical. Over time, their narrative shifted; they began loudly asserting that Russia must not be allowed to win in Ukraine. Now, they are begging and demanding an immediate ceasefire with no preconditions. This is exactly what Zelensky firmly refused a couple of years ago, when he still championed the goal of a strategic defeat for Russia on the battlefield,"" Lavrov explained at the 11th Primakov Readings, an international forum of scholars and experts.

He added, ""The failure of Western strategy and tactics is clear, yet Europe continues to try.""

Lavrov observed that, unlike the West, Russia has maintained consistent approaches to the Ukraine settlement. ""President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed these principles in detail during the discussions at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum,"" he noted. ""In contrast, Western leaders' strategies are constantly shifting, which, in essence, highlights the failure of their original plans,"" he emphasized.

The Primakov Readings forum has been held annually since 2015 in memory of the Russian statesman and diplomat Yevgeny Primakov. The forum discusses scenarios for the development of international relations, challenges in the field of international security, as well as new models of interaction among global political actors.

US president orders Israel to turn around its planes, warning bombing sorties would be ‚Äòmajor violation'

Middle East crisis ‚Äì live updates

Donald Trump has reacted furiously after an Israel-Iran ceasefire he had brokered and taken credit for was violated within a few hours, ordering Israel to turn its warplanes around midair and abort their planned bombing sorties, which he warned would be a ‚Äúmajor violation‚Äù.

Israel claimed Iran had been the first to break the truce, saying it had shot down two ballistic missiles heading for northern Israel at about 10.30am, about two and a half hours after the ceasefire was announced.

Nevertheless, on waking in Washington to the news that his truce had been broken so soon, Trump reserved his greatest rancour for Israel, for the scale of its planned retaliation, but also for the amount of bombs Israeli planes had dropped between agreeing the ceasefire on Monday night and it coming into force at 5am GMT on Tuesday.

‚ÄúIsrael, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen,‚Äù he said, in the strongest-worded public rebuke of Israel of any US president in history. ‚ÄúWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,‚Äù Trump said.

On his own private online platform, Truth Social, he issued a blunt instruction, writing: ‚ÄúISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!‚Äù

After a conversation with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, he returned to the platform to announce: ‚ÄúISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‚ÄòPlane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!‚Äù

Minutes later, however, explosions were reported by Iranian media around Tehran and in the north of the country.

The US website Axios reported that Netanyahu had told Trump that he could not cancel the strike entirely, and that ultimately ‚Äúit was decided to significantly scale back the strike, cancel the attack on a large number of targets and strike only one target‚Äù. Haaretz reported that the single target was an Iranian radar installation.

Iran denied having broken the truce or launched missiles that Israel claimed to have intercepted mid-morning on Tuesday, but Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered immediate retaliation on Tehran.

Trump had used social media to announce the ceasefire just after 5am GMT on Tuesday, asking the warring parties not to violate it. Both sides carried out an intense exchange of fire before signalling their acceptance, but hours after the declaration it remained unclear if the truce would stick.

The all clear was later sounded in the north of Israel but the country's hardline finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, posted a message on the social media platform X vowing a response, warning: ‚ÄúTehran will tremble.‚Äù

Iranian state media suggested the ceasefire had been ‚Äúimposed on the enemy‚Äù after ‚Äúfour waves of attacks on Israeli-occupied territories‚Äù. The Israeli authorities confirmed Iran had fired 20 missiles, and that five Israelis had been killed and more than 22 wounded in the southern city of Beersheba.

Ninety minutes after Trump's announcement, Israel ‚Äì which began the war with a surprise attack on 13 June ‚Äì also acknowledged the truce and claimed victory.

In the hours before the declaration of a ceasefire, Israel carried out some of its most intense airstrikes on Tehran yet, residents said.

The Tasnim News Agency said nine Iranians had been killed in the north of the country, while Israel claimed to have struck missile launchers in western Iran and struck dozens of targets in Tehran in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The prime minister's office claimed to have killed hundreds of militants in the Basij, a volunteer force used to suppress internal dissent, and targeted an Iranian nuclear scientist, bringing the toll of assassinations of Iranian scientists to at least 15.

Iranian state media named the scientist killed overnight as Mohammad Reza Seddighi Saber, saying he had been targeted at his parents' residence in Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh in northern Iran. His 17-year-old son was reported to have been killed in a strike on the family home in Tehran several days ago, state television said.

An Iranian social media user in Tehran wrote that the Israeli strikes on the capital city were ‚Äúintense‚Äù in the run-up to the announced ceasefire. ‚ÄúThe bombardment tonight in Tehran was extremely intense. For a full hour the explosions wouldn't stop. We are a completely defenseless people,‚Äù the user wrote.

After the Israeli government officially accepted the ceasefire, the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said it was also time to end Israel's war in Gaza. ‚ÄúIt's time to finish it there too. Bring back the hostages, end the war. Israel needs to start rebuilding,‚Äù Lapid said on X. An estimated 56,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over 20 months of Israeli bombardment.

The ceasefire was announced after an Iranian missile launch against a US base in Qatar, in reprisal for American participation in strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday. Iran said it had given advance warning of the missiles to Qatar and there were no reported injuries, suggesting its response was carefully coordinated to allow Tehran and Washington an off-ramp.

Trump advisers privately said they believed Iran would accept the US president's olive branch in order to avoid continued strikes by Israel, and because they had inflicted symbolic retaliation.

The ceasefire announcement also appeared to be an effort to reframe the metrics for success for the US operation, after it was unclear whether the deeply buried Fordow nuclear site had been destroyed.

In a post on social media, Trump said the Iranian sites had been ‚Äútotally destroyed‚Äù. But the UN's nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, said: ‚ÄúAt this time, no one, including the [International Atomic Energy Agency], is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.‚Äù

Trump advisers tried to suggest it did not matter if Fordow was destroyed because Iran had been forced to the negotiating table ‚Äì even though that would mark a departure from what Trump said he was aiming for over the weekend.

Still, the actual damage to the nuclear facilities remains an important question in advance of possible talks between the US and Iran ‚Äì expected to be led by Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff ‚Äì as it would affect Witkoff's negotiating leverage.

Other senior administration officials claimed victory, including the vice-president, JD Vance, who claimed Iran was ‚Äúincapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it‚Äù.

The US attack followed a wave of missile strikes between Israel and Iran, with Israel bombing the notorious Evin prison, and took place after Trump raised the prospect of regime change in Tehran. But as of Monday evening, senior US officials had suggested the Iranian attack on Qatar was designed to avoid a further escalation that could lead to an all-out war which could imperil the Iranian regime.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Nato spending plan overlooks risks to security posed by environmental breakdown and social decay, say economists

Europe risks choosing militarism over social and environmental security, economists have warned, as the head of Nato said all 32 members had agreed to increase weapons spending.

Analyses drafted in anticipation of a Nato summit beginning on Tuesday warned of the opportunity cost that higher military spending would pose to the continent's climate mitigation and social programmes, which are consistently underfunded.

The alliance's leading member, the US, and its Dutch secretary general, Mark Rutte, expect members to agree to proposals to dramatically raise defence spending targets from 2% to 5% of GDP.

But critics say the focus on military spending, which comes on top of big increases by European countries over the past few years, overlooks the risks to security posed by environmental breakdown and social decay.

‚ÄúEurope's public finance debate has never been about what we can afford, but what governments choose to prioritise,‚Äù said Sebastian Mang, senior policy officer at the New Economics Foundation (NEF).

‚ÄúHaving already committed to higher defence budgets, plans to raise spending even further expose the double standard applied to investment in climate, housing and care.

‚ÄúIf extraordinary sums can be mobilised for the military, with far lower economic returns and much lower social benefits, then the refusal to fund a just transition and stronger public services is clearly political, not economic.‚Äù

According to the Nato proposals, members would increase spending to 3.5% of GDP for ‚Äúhard defence‚Äù such as tanks, bombs and other military hardware, while devoting a further 1.5% to broader security, including cyber threats and military mobility.

An analysis by NEF found the 5% GDP target would require Nato's EU members alone to increase spending by ‚Ç¨613bn a year ‚Äì a sum considerably higher than the annual shortfall in meeting the bloc's green and social goals, estimated at ‚Ç¨375bn to ‚Ç¨526bn.

Even to meet just the 3.5% target, EU Nato members would collectively need to find an additional ‚Ç¨360bn each year for military spending.

Justifying the increase, Donald Trump and other voices in the US have complained repeatedly that European allies rely too heavily on US military support, while Rutte warned of a ‚Äúsignificant and direct threat‚Äù from Russia. But NEF said it made little sense, either in terms of economics or security.

‚ÄúIncreasing military budgets at the same time as cutting green and social spending, risks fuelling a public backlash, widening inequality and eroding trust in democratic institutions,‚Äù NEF said in its analysis. ‚ÄúAsking citizens to tighten their belts while defence budgets and arms investors' profits surge undermines the very social resilience that security depends on.‚Äù

The UK on Monday committed to raising its target from 3% of GDP spent on defence to 5% by 2035 after weeks of diplomatic pressure. The Common Wealth thinktank found that an increase in military spending to 3.5% of GDP would cost the UK an extra ¬£32bn annually.

‚ÄúDemands for further increases to military spending have a stark opportunity cost ‚Äì prioritising clean energy would deliver the energy security whose absence was so painfully exposed in 2022,‚Äù said Chris Hayes, chief economist at Common Wealth.

Not only is there an opportunity cost, increases in military spending imply vast increases in CO2 emissions, with fossil fuel-hungry tanks, warships and aircraft built and operated at scale.

Earlier this month the Guardian reported that the military buildup planned by Nato members excluding the US could increase greenhouse gas emissions by almost 200m tonnes a year.

Far-right AfD party welcomes ruling in favour of Compact, which sets high bar for any government crackdown

A German federal court has overturned a ban on a magazine classed by the government as rightwing extremist, in a high-profile legal battle seen as pitting efforts by the authorities to protect the democratic order against media freedom.

The federal administrative court said that while Compact, a publication with close ties to the far-right Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party, had produced ‚Äúanticonstitutional‚Äù content, it did ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù represent a threat to the state.

‚ÄúThe basic law guarantees even the enemies of the constitution, with faith in the power of free societal debate, freedom of expression and the press,‚Äù the presiding judge Ingo Kraft said.

The interior ministry last July outlawed the monthly magazine, as well as the company that publishes it, Compact-Magazin GmbH, and an affiliated media production firm, Conspect Film.

Nancy Faeser, the interior minister at the time, argued that Compact was ‚Äúthe main mouthpiece for the rightwing extremist scene‚Äù and fomented ‚Äúunspeakable‚Äù hatred of Jews, Muslims and foreigners while propagating pro-Kremlin views, conspiracy theories and historical revisionism.

Faeser belongs to the Social Democrats, junior partners in the current government under the conservative leader Friedrich Merz, which has also signalled forceful action against rightwing extremists. The interior ministry did not immediately comment on the ruling.

The office for the protection of the constitution (BfV), the domestic intelligence agency, designated Compact-Magazin GmbH in 2021 as confirmed rightwing extremist and placed it under surveillance.

The Leipzig-based federal administrative court, which hears cases challenging association bans, issued a temporary reprieve for Compact last August, finding that the ministry had failed to make the case that the magazine's publishers were credibly agitating to overthrow constitutional democracy.

Tuesday's ruling in favour of a complaint by its editor and chief executive, J√ºrgen Els√§sser, marked the final legal decision in the case and will allow Compact, which was founded in 2010, to resume operations immediately.

During contentious hearings before the court under tight security, Els√§sser disputed any seditious intent behind the publication, saying that although it gave a platform to fierce critics of the government, ‚ÄúCompact is not rightwing and certainly not rightwing extremist‚Äù.

‚ÄúSieg!‚Äù (Victory!), Els√§sser posted on X after the ruling. He later said he was considering suing the government for damages.

Compact had a circulation of 40,000, while its online video channel reported up to 460,000 page views a post, according to information provided by the court.

The legal victory for the magazine took place against a backdrop of calls to outlaw the AfD, Germany's biggest opposition party since February's general election.

The BfV in May deemed the pro-Russian, anti-immigrant party to be confirmed rightwing extremist and placed it under observation, potentially paving the way for an official ban.

Although some top officials in Merz's right-left governing coalition support such a move, the constitutional as well as political hurdles would be high. The AfD's ‚Äúextremist‚Äù designation is under judicial review.

Bj√∂rn H√∂cke, the leader of the party's most radical wing, welcomed Tuesday's ruling in favour of Compact as setting a high bar for any government crackdown. ‚ÄúInstead of going after Islamists, she [Faeser] hunted down harmless critics of the government,‚Äù he posted on X.

Els√§sser thanked the judges and predicted the ruling would have a chilling effect on any attempt to outlaw the AfD. ‚ÄúIf it wasn't possible to ban Compact, it's also impossible to ban the AfD,‚Äù he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (Ëî£Ëê¨ÂÆâ) on Monday highlighted Taipei's environmental governance policies, especially those on waste disposal and traffic, at a summit in Paris of world mayors focused on climate change.

The only mayor representing an Asian city at the ‚ÄúSummit of Mayors: From Paris to Belem: 10 Years of Global Action for Climate‚Äù held in Paris, Chiang first talked about Taiwan's ‚Äúkeep trash off the ground‚Äù program.

The approach keeps streets clean and litter-free by limiting public trash bins, with garbage trucks making scheduled rounds, allowing residents to bring out their trash at designated times for collection, he said.

Taipei also collects a fee per garbage bag, requiring residents to use designated bags that they must buy, while no such rules apply for recycled waste, he said.

Because residents can save money by generating less trash, the policy has reduced household garbage by 65 percent, while the proportion of recycled waste to total waste has risen from 2 percent to 66 percent, he said.

Regarding traffic, Chiang touted the Taipei MRT's daily ridership of 2 million people, calling it one of the most reliable metro systems in the world.

He also highlighted an incentive program he introduced as mayor for the city's YouBike rental system that offers the first 30 minutes of each ride for free, leading one in four residents to switch from driving or riding motorcycles to using the city's bicycles instead.

Chiang also outlined plans to transform the city's Beitou-Shilin Technology Park (ÂåóÊäïÂ£´ÊûóÁßëÊäÄÂúíÂçÄ) into a net zero demonstration zone, featuring low-carbon buildings, a wind corridor layout and sustainable infrastructure.

With Nvidia Corp planning to set up its Taiwan headquarters in the area, the initiative aims to showcase the potential for ‚Äúgreen growth.‚Äù

The mayor's summit marks the 10-year anniversary of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate.

Despite protests from displaced residents, a city official defended the government's relocation efforts, saying transitional housing has been offered.
The renovation of the park in Taipei's Wanhua District (Ëê¨ËèØ), near Longshan Temple (ÈæçÂ±±ÂØ∫), began at 9am yesterday, as about 20 homeless people packed their belongings and left after being asked to move by city personnel.
Among them was a 90-year-old woman surnamed Wang (Áéã), who last week said that she had no plans

Bayern Munich coach Vincent Kompany said his team would go into the new German Bundesliga season with ‚Äúalmost no preparation‚Äù because of their participation at the FIFA Club World Cup, but also highlighted some positives of being at the tournament. 

FIFA's new expanded competition in the US, finishing on July 13, means participating clubs would get limited time to rest and recover ahead of the 2025-2026 season. 

As well as the riches on offer, with US$1 billion in prize money on the line in total, Kompany said there are some other benefits coming with working in a group abroad for several weeks.

‚ÄúI think there's two sides to the argument,‚Äù Kompany told a news conference on Monday. 

‚ÄúI think there's the argument of us building team cohesion and spending time [together]. It's perhaps faster for the integration of players like Jonathan Tah and Tom Bischof, and players who are just joining,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I think there's a counterargument as well that for the next season we will have almost no preparation.‚Äù 

Kompany said that the team would not be able to operate with their usual preseason schedule. 

‚ÄúI mean, if you look at all the scientific research around what is the right type of preparation to prepare a new season, we are just throwing the book away, and we're just going to start the new season, with all the pressures that you have to win every game as well,‚Äù he said. 

Kompany compared the tournament with national team events like the FIFA World Cup and European Championships, with the players grouped together. 

However, he said unlike in international football, higher-level concepts can be worked on, because the players are not just getting to know one another. 

‚ÄúIt's got its advantages as well, because we're working on details, whereas in national teams you're working on basics,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt's an interesting experience.‚Äù 

Bayern ruthlessly dispatched Auckland City of New Zealand 10-0 in their first outing, before edging Boca Juniors 2-1.

The 39-year-old Ramos slipped through the penalty area for the score just as he did for so many years in the shirts of Real Madrid and Spain's national team, with whom he combined smarts, timing and physicality.
Ramos' clever goal and his overall defensive play at the Rose Bowl were major factors in Monterrey's impressive 1-1 draw against the UEFA Champions League finalists in the clubs' first match of the tournament.

Canada and the EU on Monday signed a defense and security pact as the transatlantic partners seek to better confront Russia, with worries over Washington's reliability under US President Donald Trump.

The deal was announced after a summit in Brussels between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.

‚ÄúWhile NATO remains the cornerstone of our collective defense, this partnership will allow us to strengthen our preparedness ... to invest more and to invest smarter,‚Äù Costa told a news conference. ‚ÄúIt opens new opportunities for companies on both sides of the Atlantic.‚Äù

The pact seeks to bring Canada's defense industry more closely into European efforts to revamp the domestic industrial base.

It opens the door for Ottawa to join common procurements under a 150 billion euros (US$174 billion) loan program backed by the EU's central budget to boost rearmament.

It also paves the way for Canadian defense firms to tap into the scheme, although that requires the signing of a separate deal.

The EU said that the pact would deepen cooperation in areas including crisis management, defense industry collaboration, hybrid threats and military mobility.

The UK signed a similar defense partnership in May, and Australia and the EU announced they had started negotiating another one last week.

Carney said the deal with the EU would help Canada ‚Äúdeliver on our new requirements for capabilities more rapidly and more effectively.‚Äù

At a time of international instability, Canada is looking to diversify and strengthen its international partnerships, Carney added.

‚ÄúWe turn first and foremost to our most reliable allies, those who share our values of democracy, freedom and sovereignty,‚Äù he said.

Ottawa buys much of its military equipment from the US, but relations have soured under Trump, who has repeatedly called for Canada to become the 51st US state and announced tariffs on its exports.

The EU is Canada's second-biggest commercial partner. Bilateral trade in goods was 75.6 billion euros last year, up 64 percent since 2017, when a free-trade agreement provisionally entered into force.

Several eruptions sent ash up to 5km into the sky on Tuesday evening to yesterday afternoon. An eruption on Tuesday afternoon sent thick, gray clouds 10km into the sky that expanded into a mushroom-shaped ash cloud visible as much as 150km kilometers away.
The eruption alert was raised on Tuesday to the highest level and the danger zone where people are recommended to leave was expanded to 8km from the crater.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 15 people and injuring scores of others, local officials reported.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak said the morning strike ignited a large fire and also damaged a dormitory, a gymnasium, and an administrative building in the city.

The Russian military also struck the nearby town of Samarske, Lysak said. Casualties were reported in both locations.

""Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere,"" he said. According to Lysak's latest update, there are currently more than 200 casualties in Dnipro, including 15 killed. Twelve of the wounded are in a serious condition. 

In Samarske, two people were killed, and nine injured. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition.

""As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: ""The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase.""

Around 6 p.m. local time, the death toll rose to 15, while the number of wounded increased to 174, Lysak reported. Almost a hundred of the victims remain in hospital, he added.

Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. 

""Ukrzaliznytsia is preparing a replacement train in Dnipro to evacuate passengers to Zaporizhzhia,"" the company said in a statement.

In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care.

The attack came as NATO leaders convened for a high-level summit in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat.

Editor's note: The story was updated after the White House confirmed the meeting between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and his American counterpart Donald Trump.

U.S. President Donald Trump will meet his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky during a NATO summit in The Hague, the White House confirmed on June 24.

The last time Zelensky and Trump met was in April on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral amid concerns that Washington would withdraw from mediating peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow.

The White House did not provide any further details about the meeting between the two leaders.

The talks between Zelensky and Trump were scheduled for the ""early afternoon"" on June 25, the source told AFP, adding that ""the teams are finalizing the details"" of the meeting.

Trump and Zelensky are expected to discuss Ukraine's ""purchase of a defense package, a large part of which consists of air defense systems,"" according to the source. 

The discussion will also focus on ""sanctions against Russia, and a price cap on oil,"" the source added.

Earlier, Trump said that he ""would probably meet"" Zelensky in The Hague after the two presidents did not manage to talk during the G7 summit in Canada earlier in June, AFP reported on June 24. 

When asked what he would say to Zelensky, Trump replied: ""I'll say: 'How are you?' He's (Zelensky) in a tough spot, he shouldn't have been there at all"".

Zelensky also said in an interview with Sky News that he planned to meet Trump in The Hague. Asked whether the meeting would be a formal discussion or an informal encounter, Zelensky said it was a matter of scheduling: ""They are talking about timing. It's timing.""

Zelensky's participation in the summit was confirmed by the European Council on June 20, following reports that he was reconsidering the visit due to uncertainties surrounding Trump's participation.

Upon arrival in The Hague on June 24, Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's presidential office, said he held a ""substantive"" discussion with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the upcoming Zelensky-Trump meeting. Yermak said the two discussed the structure, agenda, and key topics for the meeting.

Zelensky is also scheduled to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte during the summit.

In the interview, Zelensky also addressed concerns about Trump's perceived closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""It is a complicated question because I truly do not know what relationship Trump has with Putin,"" Zelensky said. ""I think what I know, you know, and the media knows. There are various signals about that.""

He added that he believes Trump understands Ukraine is a U.S. ally and that ""the real existential enemy of America is Russia.""

""They will never be friends. They may be short-term partners, but they will never be friends,"" Zelensky said.

Zelensky expressed hope that Trump's approach to Russia is tactical, intended to pressure Putin into peace negotiations. ""I would like this approach to be only a way to force Putin to the negotiating table and to end the war. And let us hope so,"" he said.

Zelensky was scheduled to meet Trump at the Group of Seven (G7) summit, held June 15-17. However, the U.S. president left the multilateral event early due to the renewed conflict between Israel and Iran.

 Zelensky also left the summit early, citing Russia's mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump's allies insist he had the authority to take unilateral action against Iran to eliminate what they called a potential nuclear threat posed by Tehran.Carlos Barria/Reuters

Three Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a war powers resolution on Monday to check President Donald Trump's use of military force against Iran after U.S. strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites over the weekend.

Trump's Republican Party holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and it is unlikely any resolution restricting Trump's actions could pass both chambers.

Iran targeted a U.S. base in Qatar on Monday in retaliation. The Israel-Iran war, which began on June 13 when Israel attacked its regional rival, further raised tensions in a region already on edge since the start of Israel's war in Gaza in October 2023.

Mr. Trump on raised the question of regime change in Iran following U.S. strikes against key military sites over the weekend, as senior officials in his administration warned Tehran against retaliation.

The joint statement issued late on Monday by Democratic U.S. Representatives Jim Himes, Gregory Meeks and Adam Smith came hours after Trump claimed on social media Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. 

‚ÄúPresident Trump must not be allowed to start a war with Iran, or any country, without Congressional approval,‚Äù the lawmakers said, adding that Trump ordered the strikes ‚Äúwithout meaningful consultation or Congressional authorization.‚Äù

Analysis: Donald Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear sites were ‚Äòobliterated' seems stretched

Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers had called on Congress to rein in Trump's use of military force in Iran and prevent U.S. involvement in the conflict. Many Democratic U.S. lawmakers said Trump's actions were unconstitutional and that it was Congress that had the power to declare war on foreign countries.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier on Monday it was not the time to consider a war powers resolution.

Trump's allies insist he had the authority to take unilateral action against Iran to eliminate what they called a potential nuclear threat posed by Tehran.

The Democratic lawmakers said Trump's actions appeared broader.

‚ÄúThe president has posted on social media about regime change, undermining any claim that this was a narrowly tailored operation to eliminate a nuclear threat,‚Äù the Democratic lawmakers said, referring to a Sunday post in which Trump raised the prospect of overthrowing Iran's government.

‚ÄúNo thoughtful deliberation nor careful planning occurred here - and serious actions demand serious debate, not presidential impulse,‚Äù they added.

Israel is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons and says its war against Iran aims to prevent Tehran from developing its own nuclear weapons.

Iran, which says its nuclear program is peaceful, is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty while Israel is not.

The tech mogul is marrying Lauren Sanchez in a wedding with star-studded guests, but some say they are not welcome. The celebrations are expected to last three days, and it's unclear when Bezos and Sanchez will arrive.

Greenpeace on Monday became the latest group to protest the lavish wedding Amazon owner Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have planned in Venice.

Members of the environmental organization and British group ""Everyone Hates Elon"" unfolded a giant banner in central St Mark's Square with a picture of Bezos laughing and a sign reading: ""If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax.""

It is the latest protest against this week's multi-day event, expected to attract some 200 guests, including US President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Kylie Jenner, and Kim Kardashian, and billionaires Eric Schmidt of Google and Bill Gates of Microsoft.

Mayor Luigi Brugnaro and regional Governor Luca Zaia believe the wedding will help local businesses by boosting the economy.

Zaia said the celebrations were expected to cost ‚Ç¨20 to ‚Ç¨30 million ($23-$34 million).

Local anti-tourism activists said they were determined to disrupt the festivities, saying city bosses were prioritizing tourism over resident needs.

They have already hung anti-Bezos banners from the city's famous Rialto Bridge reading ""No space for Bezos!""

""Bezos arrogantly believes he can take over the city and turn it into his own private party venue,"" said Tommaso Cacciari, from the ""No space for Bezos"" campaign.

Greenpeace said it wanted to draw attention to the low taxes many billionaires pay, while allegedly exacerbating the climate crisis through their unsustainable lifestyles.

""The problem is not the wedding, the problem is the system. We think that one big billionaire can't rent a city for his pleasure,"" Simona Abbate, one of the protesters on Monday said.

According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, more than 90 private jets carrying celebrity guests are expected to land at Venice's Marco Polo Airport in the coming days.

While the exact date of the wedding remains confidential, celebrations are expected to span three days, likely from June 26 to 28. The wedding party is reportedly set to take over the entire island of San Giorgio, located across from St. Mark's Square, where the Greenpeace protest took place. However, the specific location of the ceremony itself has not been disclosed.

It is also unclear when Bezos and Sanchez will arrive, though reports suggest they will stay at the Aman Venice, a luxury hotel on the Grand Canal where George and Amal Clooney stayed during their 2014 wedding.

Bezos will also make sizable charity donations, including ‚Ç¨1 million euros for Corila, an academic consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem.

The wedding comes at the height of tourism season in the fragile city that has long been overrun with visitors.

Venice has already reintroduced an entry fee this year, which was piloted last year for day-trippers. They will have to pay between ‚Ç¨5 and ‚Ç¨10 to enter the city during the peak season.

About 49,000 people live in Venice's historic city center. According to various estimates, more than 20 million tourists visit the city each year.

The chancellor says, ""Europeans must become stronger on our own"" as Germany invests record sums in defense and infrastructure. Follow DW for more.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for Europe to boost its defense spending and reduce reliance on the United States, warning that American support is no longer guaranteed. 

Speaking in Berlin, he emphasized the need for strategic independence, resilience against hybrid threats, and long-term support for Ukraine.

Germany is targeting 2.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense-related spending this year and increase it gradually to 3,5% by 2029.

Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of Germans now back the idea of a European nuclear deterrent that doesn't rely on the US, according to a new Forsa poll.

Support stands at 64%, with solid backing across age groups, regions, and party lines ‚Äî something rare in German foreign policy debates.

The blog, with major updates from Germany on Monday, June 23, is now closed. We've moved here.

A coalition of 30 non-governmental organizations is urging the German government not to reduce its foreign aid budget, as the Cabinet prepares to approve the 2026 federal budget on Tuesday.

""Germany should lead by example and encourage other countries to invest in a fairer world,"" the NGOs said in a joint statement.

The appeal has been signed by the aid groups Caritas International, Brot f√ºr die Welt, Welthungerhilfe, Kindernothilfe, Oxfam and others. It warns that deep cuts seen in other donor countries are undermining progress and trust.

""They also erode confidence in international cooperation and make it nearly impossible to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030,"" the organizations state.

""There are no national solutions to global challenges. Either we lose alone ‚Äî or win together.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said Europe can no longer ""free-ride"" on US security and must invest more in its own defense to become strategically independent.

Speaking at the Day of Industry in Berlin on Monday, Merz said US tolerance of low European defense spending ""will not"" continue, and warned that even a new US administration would not return to old assumptions.

""We Europeans must become stronger on our own,"" he said.

Merz urged European countries to build on their strengths and address weaknesses gradually. He also emphasized the need for long-term support for Ukraine, citing the Russian government's ""very rigid stance.""

""Our resilience is required not only militarily, but above all politically,"" Merz said.

Merz added that Europe must protect its freedom from sabotage, cyberattacks, disinformation, destabilization efforts, and attempts to divide the continent. Merz became chancellor last month.

Germany plans to increase its defense budget to 3.5% of GDP over the next five years, government sources said on Monday, aligning with a proposed new NATO target for core military spending.

Defense spending is set to rise from 2.4% of GDP this year, as the German government moves to strengthen its armed forces amid growing security threats from Russia and continued pressure from US President Donald Trump.

The share of children growing up in large families in Germany has been rising again in recent years, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), driven mainly by immigration since 2015.

In 2024, 26% of children were living in households with at least three children. That figure had declined from 25% in 1996 to 23% in 2015, but then rose again to 26% by 2024.

""The development over the past ten years is likely due mainly to immigration starting in 2015,"" Destatis said.

Families with a migration background were found to have three or more children nearly twice as often as families without foreign roots. In 2024, 19% of migrant families had at least three children, compared to around 10% of other families.

Also in 2024, 8% of children lived with three or more siblings, while 18% had two siblings. The largest group ‚Äî 44% ‚Äî lived with one sibling, and 30% were only children.

Larger families were slightly more common in the western federal states, where 13% of families had at least three children, compared to 11% in eastern Germany.

The figures come from the annual microcensus, which surveys 1% of the population. Families are defined as parent-child groups living in the same household ‚Äî children who have moved out are not included.

Bavarian Premier Markus S√∂der has reaffirmed his call for the return of compulsory military service, citing growing threats to European security.

The German government ‚Äî especially under the current coalition ‚Äî has proposed a new form of military service based initially on volunteering. As part of this concept, the Bundeswehr has started sending out questionnaires to young people to ask whether they would be interested in serving. S√∂der, however, says he sees this as insufficient.

""I am in favor of conscription and not just a few questionnaires being sent out. We need it to defend our freedom,"" S√∂der said Monday on German broadcaster ZDF.

Pointing to the threat from Russia, S√∂der noted that Sweden and Finland joined NATO last year ""because they say their waters and airspace are constantly being challenged and violated.""

""We have to make an assessment: How much time do we have?"" he added. ""We don't alone decide the timing ‚Äî the international situation does.""

The coalition agreement between the center-left Social Democrats and the conservative CDU/CSU bloc mentions a new form of military service, initially based on voluntary participation.

""I think it's okay to say we want to increase voluntary recruitment, but if you want to defend a NATO border, defend national borders, and truly become the strongest army in Europe, it probably won't be enough with just questionnaires and volunteering,"" S√∂der said.

S√∂der heads the junior partner in the Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative bloc, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU).

The German government is adjusting its security measures in anticipation of possible retaliatory strikes by Iran, following US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, a government official said Monday.

""We have done so since before the operations began. We will continue to do so. But we are making ongoing adjustments and are in very close and very constructive consultation with our partners,"" the official said.

The official added that the issue had been discussed with Britain and France on Sunday

The ""abstract threat"" to US military bases in Germany has increased following American strikes on Iran's nuclear program, a top German government official warned Monday.

Thorsten Frei, head of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's office, said Sunday's attacks have changed the security environment. ""The abstract threat has without a doubt risen after the developments of the last few hours,"" Frei said in Berlin. ""I believe we must assume that, and be prepared for it.""

Frei, a member of Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said German security authorities are doing everything possible to protect US facilities in the country.

Security around Jewish and Israeli institutions had already been increased following Israel's attacks on Iran on June 13.

""We stand on the side of the US and Israel,"" Frei said.

A survey has shown that many workers in Germany are staying at home to work for more days a week than their employers officially permit.

In many cases, employees made unofficial agreements with their superiors, but often the rules were simply not policed, the survey from the German job portal Indeed showed.

More than a quarter of the 1,000 people questioned in the survey said their direct superiors often allowed more days than permitted by their companies.

The opposite also occurs, with 13.8% of respondents saying they were sometimes called into the office more often than was officially required.

More than two-thirds said their employers had clearly stipulated how often work from home ‚Äî known in German as ""Homeoffice"" ‚Äî was allowed, but more than half said there was little monitoring of whether people stuck to the rules.

The survey showed that more than half of respondents were not satisfied with the rules on working from home laid down by their employers and that those who could decide themselves whether and when to work from home tended to be more content with the situation.

The wish of many employees to be free to work from home is also shown by the fact that more than the half of respondents said they deliberately scheduled appointments with doctors and tradespeople, for example, so they could do so.

German customs officials stopped a van on a highway in Brandenburg carrying more than half a ton of pyrotechnics. 

The vehicle contained some 520 kilograms (about 1150 pounds) of fireworks, some of which, due to their hazardous classification, can only be imported into Germany with a special permit. 

The Potsdam Main Customs Office said the import had not been authorized and was discovered during a check near the distrcit of Spreeau, just outside Berlin. 

Tax criminal proceedings were initiated against the 33-year-old driver in connection with a violation of the Explosives Act.

Upon opening the trunk, customs officials discovered a total of 34 boxes full of pyrotechnics as well as individual loose rockets. The driver said he had bought the fireworks for a wedding celebration and was headed from Poland to France. Police confiscated the haul. 

Germany's foreign minister has said Iran must engage in direct talks with the United States after recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, while affirming the European Union's continued role in diplomacy.

""Iran says it only wants to negotiate with Europe and we see that as a good sign but we do also say that's not sufficient. We want to see the United States being involved,"" Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters in Brussels ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers.

""I renew my call on Iran to now be ready for talks. We have, however, been asked by the US, over the last few weeks and also just now, to remain in touch and Europe does have a role,"" he said.

Migrant arrivals in the European Union have been more highly educated in 2024 than ever before, according to a new German study.

The Rockwool Foundation Berlin (RFBerlin) reports that 32.1% of migrants from non-EU countries had a university degree or equivalent qualification in 2024 ‚Äî up from 30.9% in 2023. The study, released Monday, describes this as a ""record level"" and part of a continued upward trend over the past decade.

In Germany, the share of highly educated non-EU migrants rose from 29.4% to 31.1% over the same period. For migrants from other EU member states, the percentage holding a tertiary qualification climbed from 33.8% to 35.2% EU-wide, and from 28.6% to 30.1% in Germany.

""This continuous rise in education levels highlights the potential migrants bring to EU labor markets,"" said Tommaso Frattini, co-director of the Center for Research and Analysis of Migration at RFBerlin and professor at the University of Milan. He said that if migrants' skills are fully utilized, ""they can be a key driver of economic growth across the EU.""

Almost two-thirds of Germans are in favor of a European nuclear deterrent independent of the United States, according to a new poll.

The survey, conducted by the Forsa institute for ""Internationale Politik"" magazine, found that 64% of respondents were in favor of setting up a European nuclear shield, while 29% were opposed.

Before taking office in May, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had already signaled his intent to pursue discussions with the United Kingdom and France ‚Äî Europe's two nuclear powers ‚Äî on developing a joint European nuclear strategy.

The goal is to reduce Europe's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella, especially amid concerns over the unpredictability of President Donald Trump.

Support for a European deterrent was consistent across demographic and political lines ‚Äî an unusual level of consensus on foreign policy in Germany.

In western Germany, 66% backed the idea, compared to 52% in the east. Among respondents under 45, support was 58.5%, rising to 67.5% among those over 45.

By party affiliation, 78% of Green Party voters supported the concept, followed by 71% of supporters of Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Support also stood at 65% among Social Democratic Party (SPD) voters, 54% among Alternative for Germany (AfD) voters, and 52% among those backing The Left.

The UK's nuclear deterrent is operationally independent but technologically reliant on US systems. France's version is both operationally and technologically independent.

The poll was carried out in the second week of June, before the latest escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, which has involved direct US military action against Tehran's nuclear program.

Guten Morgen from a cloudy Bonn am Rhein. Welcome to DW's coverage of developments in Germany on Monday, June 23.

A study has found that most Germans are in favor of Europe developing a nuclear deterrent that is independent of the United States. 

Almost two-thirds of people who were asked said they were in favor of a shared nuclear strategy for Europe.

The aim would be to reduce Europe's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella, especially amid concerns over the unpredictability of President Donald Trump.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has addressed parliament ahead of a NATO summit that he said would be historic. Merz promised that Germany would do its fair share as part of the alliance to counter the threat from Russia.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared on Tuesday that Germany is once again a reliable global actor and promised it would show leadership through its alliances.

The German leader was delivering a key foreign policy speech in parliament just hours before departing for a NATO summit in The Hague.

Merz said Germany and its NATO allies were convinced that Russia in particular was threatening the security and freedom of the European and Atlantic region ""actively and aggressively.""

Germany, he emphasized, could help shape the development of the world in the coming years through its alliances.

""We must together be so strong that no one can dare to attack us,"" he said.

""Therefore, it is a historical situation we find ourselves in. In this situation, Germany must also take responsibility and we are doing that,"" the chancellor said.

""We will perform and assume a fair share of alliance work,"" he said, adding that this meant that Germany would ""fulfill the capability targets we agree on with our alliance partners.""

""We have shown our international partners: You can rely on us,"" said Merz, whose conservative-led government took office last month.

""This new decisiveness is being registered in the world, and warmly welcomed by our partners and friends.""

The speech came ahead of two high-level meetings this week: the NATO summit in the Netherlands and an EU summit in Brussels.

Merz said Germany must help shape global developments in the years ahead with its allies, but noted that doing so requires two essential qualities: ""We need both strength and reliability, both internally and externally.""

Merz was delivering his government statement on the upcoming NATO summit and the following EU summit.

Merz's speech came as Germany's government pledged Tuesday to make major new investments through record borrowing.

His Cabinet presented its budget plans aimed at reviving the economy and strengthening the military to Germany's lower house, the Bundestag.

The plans, approved by Chancellor Friedrich Merz's cabinet, include the long-delayed 2025 draft budget as well as a financial framework extending through 2029. The budget process was postponed following the collapse of the previous government last year.

Donald Trump will prioritise pageantry over diplomacy at the Nato summit, arriving in the Hague in time for an opulent dinner with the King and Queen while eschewing key meetings.

Mr Trump will arrive in the Hague, Netherlands, on Tuesday evening just in time for the Royal dinner, but will in turn skip a string of Nato meetings earlier in the day.

The flying 24-hour visit, which was originally scheduled to be twice as long, is a reminder of just how much the world's most powerful man chafes at the business of international summitry but never misses an opportunity to revel in pomp and ceremony.

Last week he left the G7 summit in Canada half way through, insisting he had to return to Washington to deal with the escalating crisis in the Middle East.

However, insiders pointed out that he announced he was leaving after sitting through a session on wildfires, exactly the sort of scheduling that he hates.

‚ÄúHe thinks these things are a total waste of time,‚Äù said a source who was at the G7 last week.

Nato officials need no reminder.

He left his last Nato summit abruptly when Justin Trudeau, the then Canadian prime minister, was caught on camera joking about Mr Trump's penchant for turning any event into a press conference.

That was six years ago just outside Watford.

This time there is more pomp and glamour in a schedule that has been carefully tailored to keep him happy. There was even talk of slotting in a round of golf on Tuesday, although the abbreviated plan means that has been jettisoned.

Instead he arrives in time to dine at the Huis ten Bosch, one of three official residences of the Dutch royal family.

He leaves the next afternoon after a press conference.

The main theme of the summit will be member states' commitment to spend five percent of gross domestic product on defence ‚Äì one of Mr Trump's hobby horses and a chance for him to claim a huge win that has eluded previous American presidents.

The usual three sessions have been reduced to one three-hour meeting.

And officials have shrunk the joint communiqu√©, to be released at the end of the summit, to just one page, focused almost entirely on the member states' pledge to raise defence spending to five percent of gross domestic product.

The short schedule meant it made sense of Mr Trump to cut down his visit from two nights to one, said Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary.

‚ÄúMore action, less talk,‚Äù she told The Telegraph.

She added that he was also going to be spending the night at a royal palace, ‚Äúwhich he is very excited about.‚Äù

It means he will get to enjoy the ceremony of the summit without having to endure the nitty gritty of negotiations or the platitudes of diplomacy.

However, plans to keep contentious issues off the agenda ‚Äì such as Ukraine's request for membership ‚Äì have faltered.

Mr Trump will arrive fresh from ordering strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and retaliatory strikes on US bases in the Middle East.

He may face awkward questions from allies about the legality of the move and even Sir Keir Starmer, who has a good relationship with the US president, and his team have sidestepped questions about the justification for striking Iranian territory.

Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, has kept up a positive tone during the run up.

And on Monday he said he was not planning to raise Iran during the meetings,

‚ÄúIt is deviating from the core issue at hand,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúAnd that doesn't mean that individual allies will not discuss this here.‚Äù

A senior US official painted a picture of a president keen to get down to the business of increasing defence spending and getting allies to sign up to a five percent spending pledge from member states.

‚ÄúThis effort builds on the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending increases already achieved across the alliance since 2017 thanks to president Trump's diplomacy in his first term,‚Äù said the official.

‚ÄúThe president will urge allies to revitalise their industrial capacities in order to create Western supply chains capable of producing the critical minerals, infrastructure, weapons and other products necessary for the security of America and her allies.‚Äù

			Trump dismisses ‚Äòweak response' from Tehran, as missiles are shot down in attack hours before a ceasefire

Iran fired missiles at America's largest and most fortified military base in the Middle East in retaliation for attacks on its nuclear programme and hours before a ceasefire came into effect.

Al Udeid, which also hosts RAF planes, came under fire from a barrage of ballistic missiles in an attack that forced the airspace to close abruptly across the Gulf.

Explosions were heard over the financial hub of Doha, Qatar's capital, as defence systems worked to intercept the missiles close to the American military base.

Iran also said it had attacked the smaller Ain al-Asad base in Iraq but the US later confirmed no strikes were detected there.

The strikes came hours before Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, which took effect from about 5am BST, potentially bringing an end to the conflict that started on June 13.

On Monday, the US president and his national security team monitored the attacks from the situation room in the White House while US jets scrambled from nearby Saudi Arabia.

Iran gave the Qataris advance notice of the strikes and the Trump administration was aware of the attack, sources said.

On Monday night, Mr Trump called for ‚Äúpeace and unity‚Äù in the Middle East as he thanked Tehran for giving the advance notice.

The US president said Iran had launched 14 missiles, describing it as ‚Äúa very weak response‚Äù which did not harm any Americans nor cause much damage.

He appeared to signal that the US would not retaliate against the attack and said he would encourage Israel, which bombed Iran on Monday, to make peace.

Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social: ‚ÄúIran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered.‚Äù

He continued: ‚ÄúI am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done.‚Äù

The Pentagon said there were no casualties at the US military base and analysts said the attack had been calibrated to provide a way for both the US and Iran to avoid further direct strikes.

Hours later, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran appeared to come into effect.

‚ÄúCONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,‚Äù the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday evening.

He continued: ‚ÄúDuring each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL.‚Äù

The war between the two countries would officially end 24 hours after the ceasefire begins, Mr Trump said.

Iran's foreign minister said the country has not agreed to a ceasefire but it would stop attacks if Israel ceased its ‚Äúillegal aggression‚Äù by 4am local time (1.30am in the UK).

Iran launched Monday's attack after Mr Trump dispatched seven B-2 stealth bombers to drop massive bunker-busting bombs on the heavily fortified enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz on Sunday.

The US then warned Iran that retaliating would be ‚Äúthe worst mistake they've ever made‚Äù.

Nevertheless, on Monday, Iran launched operation ‚ÄúBasharat Fath‚Äù (Promise of Victory) using the code ‚ÄúYa Aba Abdullah,‚Äù in reference to a Shia martyr, the Tasnim news agency reported.

‚ÄúThe number of missiles used in this successful operation was equal to the number of bombs that America used in its attack on Iran's nuclear facilities,‚Äù said a statement from Iran's Supreme National Security Council.

The country's armed forces said they had targeted the Al Udeid base with a ‚Äúdevastating and powerful‚Äù missile attack.

It threatened that any further attacks on Iran would accelerate ‚Äúthe collapse of America's military pillars in the region‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe Islamic Republic of Iran, relying on Almighty God and the faithful and renowned people of Islamic Iran, will under no circumstances leave aggression against its territorial integrity, sovereignty and national security unanswered,‚Äù the statement said.

Mr Trump has no plan to hit back and views the Iranian strikes as ‚Äúlargely theatrical‚Äù according to Charlie Kirk, a key Trump ally citing US officials.

However, some urged the president to strike back to force Iran to give up its nuclear programme completely.

John Bolton, a national security adviser under Mr Trump's first administration, told The Telegraph: ‚ÄúTrump should respond very forcefully. I don't think they [Iran] should be allowed to play games like this.

‚ÄúThe whole purpose of what they're doing is just to buy more time to stop the American attacks, stop the Israeli attacks, and let's have negotiation, as they have done the past 25 years, which has led them to do absolutely nothing to reduce their pursuit of nuclear weapons.‚Äù

Iran's nuclear facilities, including the heavily fortified enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz struck during Operation Midnight Hammer, remain viable targets, he added.

Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said Iran's response was simply an attempt to ‚Äúsave face‚Äù without provoking the US.

‚ÄúThe Iranians don't want to escalate, because it's one thing to claim that you are a superpower ‚Äì it's another thing to actually be one,‚Äù he told The Telegraph.

‚ÄúThe Iranians know that they're getting pummelled, and the longer this goes on, the more they're to get pummelled.‚Äù

An Iranian statement declared that ‚Äúthe period of hit-and-run has ended‚Äù and warned of the country's determination to respond to any future attacks.

The Al Udeid air base is home to US Central Command's HQ and British military personnel serve there on rotation, too. It also hosts the RAF's operational headquarters in the Middle East. However, many planes have been moved in recent weeks, satellite imagery shows.

While the US still maintains a presence at its Iraq base, it is significantly smaller than during the peak of the Iraq war.

British soldiers are not currently stationed at Al Udeid, a senior government insider monitoring the situation playing out over Qatar told The Telegraph.

The insider said there was a ‚Äúdegree of calm‚Äù during the early moments of Iran's retaliation to the American air strikes.

UK Government figures are monitoring the situation to make an assessment about whether the strikes over Qatar are a genuine attempt by Iran to injure Americans or a public show of standing up to the US primarily aimed at a domestic audience.

It emerged that Sir Keir Starmer had been informed about the US attack on Sunday one hour before it struck Iran.

The Prime Minister was informed by an aide shortly before 11pm, The Times reported.Britain is thought to be the only ally outside Israel that was given forewarning.

Qatar, which has one of the best relations with Iran of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, condemned the attack on the US base, saying it was a ‚Äúflagrant violation‚Äù of sovereignty.

Doha reportedly received advanced notice from Iran before the attack, shutting down its airspace moments beforehand.

A number of commercial flights approaching the United Arab Emirates from the west were seen to turn away from Emirates airspace, indicating the country's skies have been closed to inbound civilian traffic.

Doha said its air defences ‚Äúthwarted the attack and successfully intercepted the Iranian missiles‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe State of Qatar strongly condemns the attack that targeted Al-Udeid Air Base by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard,‚Äù a spokesman for the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement shared to social media.

‚ÄúWe consider this a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international law, and the United Nations Charter.‚Äù

Iran's Supreme National Security Council said that the targeted base ‚Äúwas far from urban facilities and residential areas in Qatar‚Äù and said the action posed no threat to Qatar or its people.

The attack bears similarities to Iran's measured response after a US drone strike killed General Qassem Soleimani in January 2020.

Then, Tehran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at Al Asad Air Base and another base in Erbil, Iraq, but analysts viewed the response as calculated, designed to send a message without provoking a full-scale war.

Mr Rubin said Iran was relying on ‚Äúthe same playbook‚Äù it used after Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force.

‚ÄúStep one, swear revenge. Step two, bluster. Step three, warn people in advance an attack is coming so you don't accidentally hit anyone,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnd then step four, have this performative action that you can show on state television to show that you got your revenge.‚Äù

The attacks on Qatar came amid fears Iran was preparing to block the Strait of Hormuz, a move that would cause huge disruption to global oil supplies.

Ships heading through the narrow pinch-point began turning around, according to tracking data. There were also reports that Iran was attempting to jam communication data.

On Monday morning Iran also struck Israel, raining down ballistic missiles in its latest barrage.

Israel bombarded Tehran as well, targeting bases belonging to the hardline Revolutionary Guard and also striking the notorious Evin prison.

Israeli forces blew up the gates of the jail, which houses Iran's political prisoners, causing damage to parts of it and raising the possibility that dissidents may have been able to escape.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual citizen, was held there for four years on bogus espionage charges.

Israeli forces also struck the Sayyid al-Shuhada Corps, a Revolutionary Guards unit. Additional strikes targeted the headquarters of Iran's internal security forces' information security unit.

Later in the day it emerged some 63 vulnerable British citizens had been evacuated from Israel on RAF planes.

Many more are trapped in the country, forced to take cover in bomb shelters as the war has escalated.

Meanwhile, Iranian officials met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, where they delivered a letter requesting help from Russia.

Russian diplomats told The Telegraph that Putin was ‚Äúavoiding‚Äù becoming entangled in the war in order to maintain relations with Mr Trump. Officials said they were pleased with relations over Ukraine, and did not want to rock the boat.

Iran also lashed out at the West in a statement to the UN.

The Iranian mission accused Israel of ‚Äúhijacking‚Äù US foreign policy and dragging its allies into the war.

‚ÄúUndoubtedly, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Israeli regime, and the IAEA General Director will bear full responsibility for the death of innocent civilians in Iran, especially women and children,‚Äù a spokesperson said.

Iranian state TV has reported that around 500 people have been killed since Israel's attack against Iran on June 13, citing the country's health ministry. Some 24 Israelis have been killed.

The court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries.

The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily lifted a lower court order that had required the Trump administration to give migrants the chance to challenge their deportation to a country other than their nation of origin, clearing the way for resumption of such removals and prompting a strongly worded dissent from the three liberal justices.

The conservative majority behind the ruling did not offer a rationale for the order, but said that the preliminary injunction handed down by a district court judge in April is stayed, pending appeal.

‚ÄúTotally unexplained Supreme Court ruling on 3rd-country deportations will produce widespread confusion in lower courts. Did the court object to nationwide aspect? Think judges lacked jurisdiction? Something else? Who knows?‚Äù wrote Politico's senior legal affairs reporter Josh Gerstein, offering a prediction of what's to come.

Trump administration efforts to deport immigrants to countries they are not from has become one of the most contentious aspects of U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.

In May, the Trump administration put eight men, most of whom are not from South Sudan, on a flight said to be headed to South Sudan, though the flight instead landed in Djibouti. The men have been held in Djibouti since. U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy told Trump administration officials that they ‚Äúunquestionably‚Äù violated a court order he issued in April when it attempted to carry out those third-country deportations to South Sudan.

The Supreme Court's order stays that ruling from Murphy issued in April, which directed the Trump administration not to deport immigrants to countries other than their home countries without giving them adequate notice to raise concerns that they might face danger if sent there.

However, ‚Äúin an order Monday, Murphy said the eight men in Djibouti remain protected from immediate removal despite the Supreme Court's ruling, referencing another order he had issued last month ‚Äî separate from the one put on hold by the Supreme Court,‚Äù according to ABC News.

In a blistering dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the ruling exposes ‚Äúthousands to the risk of torture or death‚Äù and comes down on the side of the Trump administration even though it had violated the lower court's order. Sotomayor was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson

‚ÄúThe government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,‚Äù she wrote in her dissent.

‚ÄúApparently,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúthe court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled. That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.‚Äù

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the ruling a victory on Monday. ‚ÄúDHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,‚Äù she said in a statement. ‚ÄúFire up the deportation planes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you think it can't get worse, it does!‚Äù said Jill Wine-Banks, an MSNBC legal analyst, in response to the ruling.

A ceasefire truce between the two countries appeared to be on shaky ground less than one day after Trump announced it.

As President Donald Trump announced a deal brokered between Israel and Iran on Monday evening, new polling shows that a plurality of Americans disapproved of his military strikes on Iran last weekend, and that very few voters have confidence that the conflict will not escalate.

The Reuters/Ipsos polling, conducted after Trump ordered the military operation against Iran on Saturday but before he announced a supposed truce between the two sides on Monday, found that only 36 percent of Americans view the U.S. airstrikes positively, while 45 percent said they were opposed to them. Nineteen percent said they were unsure of how they felt.

When asked whether they had concerns about the conflict growing, the answers from respondents were more uniform, with 84 percent saying they were concerned about that possibility and only 15 percent saying they were not. 

Perhaps because of Trump's actions within the conflict, his approval rating reached an all-time low within Reuters/Ipsos polling during his second term in office so far. According to the most recent poll, just 41 percent of Americans approve of his job performance at this time, with 57 percent disapproving, resulting in a net -16-point approval rating. The next-lowest net rating for Trump, at -12 points, was found in a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month.

Despite concerns from most Americans that the conflict would escalate, Trump announced a tepid ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran on Monday evening. 

‚ÄúCONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,‚Äù Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. 

By Tuesday morning, it was unclear how strong that agreement was, with Trump even acknowledging that fact.

‚ÄúTHE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!‚Äù Trump wrote in a subsequent post.

As the Israeli military appeared to be conducting more missions, Trump lashed out, demanding that they halt their operations against Iran.

‚ÄúISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!‚Äù Trump wrote. 

Speaking to reporters as he was departing the White House Tuesday morning for a NATO summit at The Hague, Trump condemned both countries for violating the truce he had bragged about brokering less than 24 hours earlier.

‚ÄúThere was one rocket that I guess was fired overboard after the time limit and now Israel is going out. These guys [have] got to calm down,‚Äù Trump said.

He then uttered an expletive out of frustration with both countries' failure to abide by his demands.

‚ÄúWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,‚Äù Trump said.

 Kori Schake

President Donald Trump's rise to power and enduring political appeal have been fueled in part by his depiction of the United States as a failure: exhausted, weak, and ruined. In a characteristic act of self-contradiction, however, his foreign policy is based on a significant overestimation of American power. Trump and his advisers seem to believe that, despite the country's allegedly parlous condition, unilateral action on Washington's part can still force others to capitulate and submit to American terms.

But since the end of World War II, American power has been rooted mostly in cooperation, not coercion. The Trump team ignores that history, takes for granted all the benefits that a cooperative approach has yielded, and cannot envision a future in which other countries opt out of the existing U.S.-led international order or construct a new one that would be antagonistic to American interests. Yet those are precisely the outcomes the Trump administration is hastening.

The political scientist Michael Beckley has argued in Foreign Affairs that the United States is becoming ‚Äúa rogue superpower, neither internationalist nor isolationist but aggressive, powerful, and increasingly out for itself.‚Äù That portrait is accurate but incomplete, since it does not fully capture the extent to which American dominance can be undercut or constricted by others. In the Trump era, many have speculated about whether or to what degree the United States will withdraw from its leading role in the world. But a more pressing question might be, what if the rest of the world beats Washington to the punch, withdrawing from the cooperative U.S.-led order that has been the bedrock of American power?

Some may counter that even if U.S. allies and neutral countries don't like the way Trump exercises American power, they have little choice but to go along with it now and will accommodate themselves to it in the longer term, placating the United States as much as possible and hedging only when absolutely necessary. After all, they might come to loathe and distrust the United States, but not as much as they already loathe and distrust China, Russia, and other American rivals. In this view, the United States that Trump wants to create would be the worst possible hegemon‚Äîexcept for all the other possible candidates. Besides, even if other countries wanted to opt out of the U.S.-led order or work around Washington, they don't have the ability to do so, individually or collectively. They might yearn for the days when a more internationalist, open, cooperative United States shaped the world order. But they'll learn to live with a more nationalist, closed, and demanding United States.

That view results from a failure of imagination‚Äîa common source of strategic failure, since statecraft requires one to anticipate how other actors in the international system will react and what forces they might set in motion. Lacking the ability to do that, the Trump team has instead taken an approach predicated on a pair of faulty assumptions: that other countries, international organizations, businesses, and civil society organizations have no alternative to capitulation in the face of U.S. demands and that even if alternatives emerged, the United States could remain predominant without its allies. This is solipsism masquerading as strategy. Instead of producing a less constraining order in which American power will flourish, it will instead yield a more hostile order in which American power will fade.

Despite Trump's disparagement, the United States is incredibly strong and dynamic. No other advanced country relies so much on its domestic market and so little on trade. Around half of global trade and almost 90 percent of global foreign exchange transactions are conducted in U.S. dollars, an extraordinary repository of value that affords Washington the luxury of deficit spending that would be outrageous anywhere else. Unlike almost every other developed country, the United States has a growing prime-age workforce. The country boasts abundant natural resources, has friendly neighbors, draws the world's most talented people to its universities and companies, fosters social and economic mobility that reduce ethnic and religious animosities, and is governed by a political system that is well adapted to a diverse society.

But Trump and his team are burning through those advantages at an alarming rate. Since he took office in January, elements of the country's constitutional democracy have been undercut‚Äîor, worse yet, weaponized to serve partisan ends or indulge Trump's personal vendettas. The White House has aggressively expanded the executive branch's power by trampling on Congress's authority, refusing to comply with court orders, and calling into question the independence of vital institutions such as the Federal Reserve. Trump has targeted elite American universities, starving them of the federal funding they use to create innovative technologies and medical advances. He has allowed Elon Musk, a billionaire tech titan who donated massive sums to his campaign, to run roughshod over the federal bureaucracy, forcing out many of the talented career civil servants who make the federal government work and carry out U.S. foreign policy.

Meanwhile, Trump's erratic trade war, which targets rivals and allies alike, has whipsawed markets, spooked investors, and convinced Washington's partners that they can no longer trust the United States. Trump has threatened the sovereignty of allies and publicly berated their leaders, all while lavishing praise on the dictators and thugs who threaten them. The administration's radical and peremptory elimination of U.S. foreign assistance removed a lever of American influence and telegraphed a level of indifference that will not go unnoticed. As the country's friends have looked on in horror and its rivals have watched with glee, the United States has gone from indispensable to insufferable.



The American experience of dominance in the international order is historically anomalous because it has occasioned so little hedging on the part of others. Typically, a rising power creates incentives for other countries to counterbalance its influence: in the fifth century BC, the rise of Athens caused neighboring states to seek protection from Sparta; in the Great Northern War of the early eighteenth century, the ambitions of King Charles XII of Sweden provoked an anti-Swedish coalition; a century or so later, France's growing power fostered the coalition that eventually defeated Napoleon. But the international order that the United States and its allies created out of the ashes of World War II prevented that seeming inevitability. Its agreed-on rules and consensual participation maximized the influence of small countries and midsize powers that enjoyed the safety provided by American power. The United States voluntarily restrained itself to encourage cooperation. As a result, the American order was remarkably cost-effective, because the rules so seldom had to be enforced. No dominant power has ever had so much assistance from others in maintaining its dominance.

That order is now collapsing. Trump has a deep-seated ideological conviction that allies are a burden. His tactic in negotiations is to use U.S. leverage to wring concessions from all counterparties at all times. But this approach fails to account for how cooperation can act as a force multiplier. Take the case of Iran. The United States has maintained draconian sanctions on the Islamic Republic since 1979. American pressure alone, however, was not enough to get Tehran to come to the negotiating table over its nuclear program. Doing so required China, Russia, and Washington's European allies to sign on to a sanctions regime.

The war in Ukraine offers another example. To bring an end to the war, the Trump administration may want to relax sanctions on Russia or force Ukraine to capitulate to Moscow's aggression. But it would take European acquiescence for the Russian economy to recover, and European countries could continue to support Ukraine even without American assistance. Instead of securing the cooperation of European allies in the negotiations, however, Trump has frozen them out. Similarly, the United States wants to restrict China from acquiring certain kinds of advanced technology, such as tools and components critical to manufacturing semiconductors. But without the compliance of countries that manufacture such things, including Japan and the Netherlands, U.S. restrictions won't work. Threats to exclude countries from the U.S. market or to strip their ability to use the U.S. dollar for transactions won't be effective if Washington is going to restrict market access no matter what, or if the dollar loses its centrality to the global economy.



The Trump administration has hardly been alone in abetting the corrosion of an international order advantageous to the United States. Washington has been weaponizing economic interdependence for decades, and in response to a widespread belief among American voters that free trade harmed U.S. manufacturing and hollowed out the American economy, the last three presidential administrations have all been hostile to providing market access, even to preferred trading partners whose inputs are essential to U.S. production.

For many years, U.S. allies‚Äîparticularly those in Asia, which fear China's growing power‚Äîhave pleaded with Washington to pursue an economic strategy that would allow them to reduce their reliance on China. During President Barack Obama's second term, his administration negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which offered a collaborative way forward. The deal would have linked 12 economies, taken advantage of Asia's economic dynamism, and used the promise of access to American markets to compel higher environmental and labor standards that would, in turn, make U.S. production more competitive. But the Obama administration let the deal languish instead of pushing for congressional ratification. Both major-party presidential candidates disavowed it in 2016, Trump withdrew from the negotiations in 2017, and Joe Biden chose not to join the pact after he became president in 2021.

When it comes to burning bridges, however, nothing matches the speed and destructiveness of Trump's policies in the past few months. According to a recent survey conducted by the opinion-research firm Cluster 17 and the journal Le Grand Continent, 51 percent of Europeans ‚Äúconsider Trump to be an enemy of Europe.‚Äù And this sentiment is strongest in countries that had previously been most supportive of the United States, such as Denmark and Germany. ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äîat least this part of the Americans, this administration‚Äîare largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,‚Äù said Friedrich Merz, now Germany's chancellor, after his center-right party prevailed in elections in February. As a result, he said, ‚Äúmy absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the United States.‚Äù His words captured what would have been a fringe belief a decade ago but has become conventional wisdom in Europe today.

In recent years, U.S. adversaries including China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia have stepped up their cooperation in the face of Washington's efforts to isolate them, helping one another skirt sanctions, arm their militaries, and carry out various acts of aggression. This hardly comes as a surprise, and American policymakers have plenty of experience in dealing with such machinations. What they lack, however, is any experience of a world in which traditional American allies and more neutral countries also start working together‚Äîbut against the United States.

The first signs of this process might look like little more than symbolic protests, as countries and institutions seek ways to strip Washington of its traditional convening power. Heads of state might avoid Oval Office meetings, foreign officials might be unavailable for phone calls to coordinate policy with their American counterparts, and the heads of international organizations might not schedule the kinds of summits that grant U.S. officials stature and allow them to set the agenda and meet with many world leaders at once. Fearing that Washington plans to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Europe, the NATO secretary-general might cancel the alliance's annual summit to avoid giving the American president a platform to announce the move; the UN secretary-general could choose not to accommodate U.S. scheduling requests for Security Council meetings or decline to give U.S. representatives the floor for arguments. Although such acts might seem trivial, they would erode Washington's ability to make sure that its policy proposals form the basis of international debate and action.

A global retreat from Washington would quickly begin to have far more palpable effects by taking a toll on the American economy. Countries might choose not to invest in U.S. Treasuries or might buy them only at higher interest rates, imposing higher costs on Washington for servicing the national debt. The United States can sustain the eye-popping profligacy of its national debt only because investors consider the U.S. dollar to be a safe haven. But Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are destroying that hard-earned privilege with tariffs and a budget that will push debt levels to unprecedented heights. (It should have come as no surprise when, in May, Moody's downgraded the United States' credit rating.) Over time, the United States might suffer an exodus of investors, who cherish not only the growth they have come to expect from U.S. markets but also the stability, rule of law, and regulatory independence that undergird the American economy. Meanwhile, foreign governments might begin to use subsidies and regulations to create supply chains that avoid American-made components.

If Washington continues to erect significant barriers to foreign goods, its trading partners will seek out other markets, increasing their integration with one another at the expense of American companies. In March, Japan and South Korea, the two Asian U.S. allies most dependent on the United States, held a trade summit with China, after which the three countries jointly announced a plan to pursue a new trilateral free trade agreement and pledged to work together to develop ‚Äúa predictable trade and investment environment‚Äù in the region. Washington needs Tokyo and Seoul on its side to create economies of scale and circumvent Chinese supply chains. Japan and South Korea are the two anchors of Asian economic dynamism; without them, American efforts to marginalize China cannot succeed.

Trump's disdain for multilateralism is also imperiling the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. For decades, they have helped shape the global economy to Washington's advantage. But the Trump administration has accused them of ‚Äúfalling short‚Äù and has demanded they align their agendas with the president's, creating concern that Washington might withdraw from them‚Äîor starve them, as it has the World Trade Organization.

U.S. national security would also suffer if countries started to decouple from Washington. Consider intelligence sharing, another area in which Washington can expect less cooperation. That practice requires U.S. partners to trust that any information they share with Washington won't be used to disadvantage them and that the sources and methods for acquiring that intelligence will remain secret. In Trump's first term, U.S. allies quickly learned that the president was cavalier about classified information. In May 2017, The New York Times reported, Trump casually discussed classified information about a terrorist plot, which Israel had provided to the United States, with Russian officials visiting the White House. The cause for concern has only grown in his second term. In March, a number of Trump's cabinet officials used Signal, an unclassified commercial mobile app, to share and discuss classified details about an imminent U.S. strike on Houthi militants in Yemen. Such laxity might cause other countries to become more cautious about what they share with Washington, as well as how and when they share it.

Trump's approach to managing the U.S. military could also contribute to a flight from American leadership. Some of the military's most highly trained units are now being diverted from high-intensity combat preparations at the army's National Training Center in order to assist with immigration enforcement at the border with Mexico. In pursuit of such presidential priorities, the country's armed forces will lose operational proficiency, making them a less valuable partner and a less available one, as well. Allies may choose to avoid acquiring U.S.-made weaponry for fear that Washington or an American company might deny them permission to use it in a crisis‚Äîjust as Musk denied Ukraine the ability to use his Starlink communications network to carry out an attack on Russian forces in Crimea in 2022. That avoidance, in turn, may pose problems for interoperability. Getting militaries to work intimately together is difficult enough when they're using compatible equipment; increasing the degree of difficulty will chip away at one of the central advantages Washington and its allies enjoy over potential adversaries.



The U.S. military's ability to project power across the globe relies on partners and allies. The Pentagon cannot provide a surge of forces to the Middle East without using ports in Belgium and Germany, or dispatch forces across the Pacific (much less sustain combat operations against China) without using bases in Japan and the Philippines. The United States cannot carry out airstrikes on terrorists in Afghanistan without permission to transit Pakistani airspace, and many more American service members would have died in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq had the U.S. military not maintained access to its Ramstein Air Base and Landstuhl hospital in Germany. Washington would not be able to carry out war plans with the requisite speed without preferential passage through the Panama and Suez Canals. American military power isn't autarkic; it's dependent on others. But growing antipathy to U.S. policies will alienate publics in other countries and make it more difficult for their governments to provide support to American military operations, much less participate in them. Imagine if terrorists carried out a massive attack on the United States and allies didn't rush to help, as they did after the 9/11 attacks, in part by supporting U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

The United States' dense web of alliances and partnerships also enables the ‚Äúextended deterrence‚Äù that protects Washington's friends from their enemies. But Trump has already weakened that pillar of the post‚ÄìCold War order. In 2019, for example, after Iranian proxies attacked major oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia, American allies took note that Trump chose not to retaliate.

The Trump administration seems to believe that if Washington forces its allies to stand on their own, they will make choices that would benefit the United States. That is unlikely to be true. Although most American allies have militaries superior to those of their potential adversaries, they generally lack the confidence to use them. Washington's European allies could unquestionably defeat the Russian military in a conventional, nonnuclear war. Finland alone could probably defeat Russia in such a fight if backed by security guarantees from at least one of its nuclear-armed allies, France or the United Kingdom.



But U.S. allies in Europe have too little confidence in their own strength. And if the United States walks away from them, they are likely to make compromises with aggressors that would harm their interests and Washington's, as well. That is what France and Germany did after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, and the Obama administration barely reacted. The European powers pressured Ukraine into accepting the so-called Minsk agreements, which formalized a buffer zone of Russian occupation on Ukrainian territory. But that didn't stop the fighting: Russia reinforced its positions, violated the accords, and invaded again in 2022.

In the years to come, a Russian encroachment onto the territory of a Baltic member of NATO, coupled with threats to use nuclear weapons if NATO resisted, could fracture the West. The Trump administration might be unwilling to trade New York for Tallinn‚Äîand France, Germany, and the United Kingdom might fold, too. A Europe consumed with such insecurity wouldn't be particularly keen to help Washington deal with Chinese military and commercial aggression or to help constrain the Iranian nuclear program.

Trump routinely calls into question the reliability of U.S. security guarantees by demonstrating his indifference to the security of treaty allies that do not spend what he considers to be the proper amount on defense. And the shameful way that he equates Russia's aggression against Ukraine with that country's heroic defense of its sovereignty has eroded the sense of basic American morality‚Äîimperfect and inconsistent though it might be‚Äîthat attracts cooperation from like-minded countries. If U.S. policies are overtly amoral and thus indistinguishable from those of China and Russia, other countries might opt to side with those powers, betting that at least their behavior will be more predictable.

The Trump administration may be relying on the antipathy that U.S. allies feel toward the ideologies that guide American rivals such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In this view, even if U.S. partners don't like certain things Washington does, they're ultimately going to stick with the United States out of a sense of democratic solidarity. But U.S. allies easily overcame whatever ideological objections they may have had and continued trading with Russia after the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and with China despite its repression of Uyghurs and its crackdown in Hong Kong in recent years. Besides, the Trump administration itself hardly considers ideological differences to be an obstacle to cooperation. A mismatch between American and Russian values has not prevented Trump from taking Moscow's side in the Ukraine war. Under his administration, Washington won't be ‚Äúgiving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs,‚Äù Trump assured a gathering of investors and Saudi leaders in May. If Washington doesn't act as if ideology matters, it shouldn't expect that others will.

Trump and his team may also believe that the convergence of Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, and Russian power is of such magnitude that European resistance would prove futile without American heft. Better, in this view, to revive the nineteenth-century practice of the great powers dividing up the world. Doing so, however, would concede Europe to Russia and Asia to China, which would constitute a colossal loss. Moreover, there is no reason to assume that such concessions would slake Chinese and Russian ambitions: consider, for example, what Beijing's massive investments in Latin America and attempts to corrupt the Canadian political system suggest about Chinese intentions.

Another potential explanation for the Trump administration's approach is that it sees most forms of alliance management as at best a distraction from and generally an impediment to winning the contest with China. Trump administration officials would hate the comparison, but that position is a continuation of the Biden administration's argument that the most important thing for the United States is to strengthen itself at home: to have the best economy, the most innovative technology, and the strongest military.

According to this logic, winning in those dimensions will draw global support because people like to be on the side of a winner. But that won't be the case if others don't have access to the American market or if they consider American technology dangerous to them or believe the U.S. military offers them no genuine protection. The United States should, of course, strengthen itself. But when it does so without benefiting others, they will try to shield themselves and limit their exposure to American power.

And if Trump is truly aiming to make the country stronger abroad by making it stronger at home, he is doing so in a curious way. The administration's ill-conceived tariffs are increasing market volatility and making business planning practically impossible. Republican legislation advocated by Trump is likely to explode the deficit and increase inflation. The association of U.S. technology titans with the administration's assault on government agencies and the rule of law is damaging their brands and imperiling their market values and adoption rates. And according to the defense analyst Todd Harrison, the budget proposal Trump has championed would result in a $31.5 billion reduction in defense spending in 2026 compared with what the Biden administration had projected for that year, which was itself inadequate to the security challenges the country faces. This is an agenda for weakness, not strength.

Trump and his team are destroying everything that makes the United States an attractive partner because they fail to imagine just how bad an order antagonistic to American interests would be. The United States' indispensability was not inevitable. In the post‚Äì¬≠Cold War world, the country became indispensable by taking responsibility for the security and prosperity of countries that agreed to play by rules that Washington established and enforced. If the United States itself abandons those rules and the system they created, it will become wholly expendable.

The self-destruction of American power in the Trump years is likely to puzzle future historians. During the post‚ÄìCold War era, the United States achieved unprecedented dominance, and maintaining it was relatively easy and inexpensive. All of Trump's predecessors in that period made errors, some of which significantly reduced U.S. influence, aided the country's adversaries, and limited Washington's ability to induce cooperation or compliance on the part of other countries. But none of those predecessors intended such outcomes. Trump, on the other hand, wants a world in which the United States, although still rich and powerful, no longer actively shapes the global order to its advantage. He would prefer to lead a country that is feared rather than loved. But his approach is unlikely to foster either emotion. If it stays on the path Trump has started down, the United States risks becoming too brutal to love but too irrelevant to fear.

In the years to come, the alliances it took decades to foster will begin to wither, and U.S. rivals will waste no time in leaping to exploit the resulting vacuum. Some of Washington's partners may wait for a while, hoping that their American friends will come to their senses and try to reestablish something akin to the traditional U.S. leadership role. But there is no going all the way back; their faith and trust have been irreparably damaged. And they won't wait long, even for an American return to form that would amount to less than a full restoration. Soon, they will move on‚Äîand so will the rest of the world.

In Donald Trump's first go-round as U.S. president, his heterodox approach seemed to portend a dramatic transformation in American foreign policy and potentially even the end of the rules-based international order. And yet for the most part, prevailing institutions, groupings, and rules endured. Washington's alliances held fast, U.S. adversaries advanced their interests in real but limited ways, and American power proved resilient. As a result, the Biden administration was able to renew traditional elements of American influence and restore key fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy, such as active global leadership, alliances and partnerships, and the defense of an open, rules-based international order.

But when Trump leaves office in January 2029, there will be no going back. Trump's reelection dashed the view that his first presidency was a mere aberration, and his second administration's early, seismic actions on global trade, skepticism toward allies, and affection for erstwhile adversaries have already changed the United States' role and image in the world. Some may argue that it is too soon to plan the next administration's foreign policy because no one knows what further disruptions are coming. But thinking of the future of American foreign policy solely in terms of the post-Trump inheritance runs the risk of being overly reactive or reflexively restorationist. One notable lesson from the early months of Trump's second term has been the scope and scale of policy change that is possible in a very short period. The next president should enter office with a clear and constructive vision for the future of American foreign policy and move to realize it with the same alacrity the Trump administration has displayed in its first 100 days. It is not too soon to start debating the contours of that vision.

To begin, the United States needs what accountants refer to as a ‚Äúzero based‚Äù review of its foreign policy: a clean slate from which to reevaluate and justify its long-held interests, values, and policies. Four years from now, many of the familiar pillars of U.S. grand strategy‚Äîfrom alliances to multilateral organizations to global treaties‚Äîwill likely be transformed beyond recognition. What's more, the world these tools were intended to help manage will have changed profoundly. No new president, whether a Democrat, a more traditional Republican, or a Trump disciple, will have the option of returning to the familiar approaches of the post‚ÄìCold War era. Starting from a zero base will guard against the tendency to default to old structures and concepts that might no longer reflect the United States' vital interests and geopolitical context or the needs and preferences of the American people.

Trump has exposed the growing cracks in the U.S.-led international order. But he is not interested in fixing them‚Äîquite the opposite. By the time his second term is over, that old order will be irreparably broken. Whoever follows Trump will have to reckon with a complex, multipolar international order and decide what role the United States should play in it.

During his first term, Trump's animosity toward international trade, opposition to multilateralism, and deep skepticism of alliances signaled an end to the rules-based international order. His unorthodox policy views had a magnifying effect on major global trends that had been well underway before Trump was elected, including the global diffusion of power, rapid and disruptive technological change, and political polarization and policy volatility. Writing in Foreign Affairs in 2019, we argued that the United States would have to tend to an international order that was badly in need of renovation, including in the domains of critical and emerging technologies and through new forms of order building in the Indo-Pacific.

But to a degree that surprised us even after we joined the Biden administration, American power and global leadership proved highly resilient once Trump departed the scene. When President Joe Biden told the world ‚ÄúAmerica is back,‚Äù the world largely believed him. Relieved that the Trump era appeared to have passed, U.S. allies and partners aligned more closely with the United States. Growing coordination between China and Russia helped the Biden team rally Washington's closest partners in both Asia and Europe. The U.S.-led response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrated the United States' unparalleled ability to provide decisive military and intelligence assistance while isolating Russia from the global financial system.

Meanwhile, the combination of China's coercive ‚Äúwolf warrior‚Äù diplomacy, draconian COVID-19 pandemic response, and worsening economic slowdown highlighted the benefits of aligning with the United States and diminished the appeal of hedging strategies that courted closer economic and technological ties with Beijing. The impressive post-COVID economic recovery in the United States‚Äîthe strongest among advanced industrialized economies‚Äîunderscored continued U.S. power, and allies and partners embraced Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy by aligning their own foreign policies with the United States and one another, spending more on defense, and pushing back against Beijing's aggressive actions from Taiwan to the South China Sea.

For at least the first two years of the Biden administration, American politics appeared to have moved past Trump, creating space for some notable areas of bipartisanship. Trump's decisive loss in 2020, the outrage at his attempts to overturn the result and at the ensuing insurrection, and the strong performance by Democrats in the 2022 midterms all seemed to indicate that Trumpism had run its course. Although partisan polarization remained as acute as ever, the passage of major legislation such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act suggested that Congress was not only able to function but also finally ready to make much-needed generational investments in U.S. competitiveness that could modernize the country's global role.



On the biggest foreign policy challenges the Biden administration faced, Republican members of Congress often pushed for sharper versions of the administration's preferred policy, such as advocating more aggressive support for Ukraine. Indo-Pacific policy was remarkably bipartisan, and a solid consensus formed around central tenets of Biden's China policy, which itself reflected some continuity with Trump's first-term approach. Taken together, these dynamics made the Biden presidency feel like a return to normalcy‚Äîa restoration, not an interregnum.

Yet the immediate success of this approach reduced the urgency within the administration to more fundamentally remake U.S. grand strategy for a new era. The war in Ukraine in particular appeared to reinforce the centrality of traditional foreign policy constructs by positioning the United States as the leader of a coalition‚Äîcentered on its NATO allies‚Äîto defend the free world against the threat of Russian aggression. In areas in which the Biden administration recognized that reforms were needed‚Äîto modernize alliances, create new multilateral configurations, and attempt to build a post-neoliberal approach to international economics‚Äîthe changes were evolutionary and in some cases incomplete. For instance, the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and reduce the United States' global counterterrorism footprint was bold and necessary, and it could have set the stage for a new era of strategic discipline. But despite defining China as the most consequential challenge for the United States and elevating the Indo-Pacific as the primary theater of competition, the Biden administration was consumed, from 2023 onward, by the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, precluding military posture changes and readiness investments that would have better aligned U.S. assets with U.S. strategy.

The risks of metastasizing instability in Europe and the Middle East, threats to Israel and close allies in NATO, and domestic political pressures diverted attention from long-term strategic adjustments to immediate crisis management. In short, the allies' and partners' warm reception of the American return, coupled with challenging conflicts, meant that in the time it had, the Biden administration prioritized foreign policy restoration over reinvention.

No responsible analyst can claim to predict what will happen over the course of the first year of the new Trump administration‚Äîlet alone all four. But the haphazard rollout of unprecedented global tariffs in April and the White House's goal of reshaping the postwar order indicate that upheaval is not just incidental but a central policy objective. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was explicit on this point in his confirmation hearing: ‚ÄúThe post-war global order is not just obsolete,‚Äù he told Congress, ‚Äúit is now a weapon being used against us.‚Äù

Although the secretary's characterization is extreme, it contains a kernel of truth: as the United States and the world have transformed, the liberal international order has not kept pace. Thanks to early moves by the Trump administration and dramatic shifts in economic, military, and technological power, the United States no longer has the option of returning to the international order and grand strategy it has known since the Cold War, perhaps even World War II. Trump's foreign policy is hastening the arrival of a multipolar world by unleashing and accelerating forces that will be difficult to reverse. Trade policies intended to punish China may well advantage Beijing and diminish the United States. As allies and partners grow more capable of self-defense, they will also become more autonomous. Already faltering multilateral institutions will further diminish in capacity. Threats to invade allies will undermine international norms of sovereignty and nonaggression. And great-power competitors will seize diplomatic ground the Trump administration freely cedes.

These trends converge most clearly in trade and economic policy. Trump's ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariff announcement in April was expected to target China, a great-power competitor with whom the United States has a large trade deficit by dint of China's role as a manufacturing powerhouse that sends American consumers inexpensive goods. The 125 percent tariff that was levied outstripped even the most extreme forecasts and led to a monthlong trade war that roiled the global economy. Although a truce was reached in Geneva, it is a fragile one that could easily be broken by new U.S. sectoral tariffs. And in exchange for the upheaval, the United States extracted no concessions from Beijing.

Meanwhile, close U.S. allies and partners in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam, were not spared from Trump's crippling tariffs. These countries are also manufacturing giants and were critical partners in U.S.-led efforts to break China's monopoly on global manufacturing. Many U.S. companies and partners are in the midst of moving their supply chains out of China to push back against the rising power's coercive economic efforts. Now, even if these partners manage to negotiate lower rates for themselves, the Trump administration's ten percent baseline tariff, should it stand, may make such an undertaking prohibitively expensive. Should these allies ultimately face tariff levels that are similar to China's, the ‚ÄúChina plus one‚Äù strategies pursued by many companies to diversify manufacturing to countries other than China will be infeasible. And regardless of what tariff levels land, including as court proceedings play out in the United States, the shock of being economically kneecapped by a close ally has made many Indo-Pacific states rethink their reliance on the United States as a guardian of an open international economic order.



The Chinese government clearly intends to use the U.S.-led turmoil to its advantage. Throughout the standoff, official statements from Beijing projected confidence in the resilience of the Chinese economy, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping toured the Southeast Asian countries hit the hardest by U.S. tariffs, promising close partnerships and portraying China as the defender of the international order. That the United States folded so quickly has almost certainly validated Beijing's approach. Beyond its trade policy, the Trump administration has given little indication of its broader strategy toward China or the rest of the Indo-Pacific, creating ample incentive for even close allies to resume hedging and for Beijing to gain ground.

Indeed, Trump's hard protectionist turn strikes at the heart of the U.S. alliance system, which has historically paired strategic alignment and security guarantees with privileged access to American markets, resulting in impressive development curves for many American allies. The trade deficits that Trump abhors were a predictable and benign byproduct of this arrangement, particularly because the United States exports services that do not figure in these tallies to many of its closest partners. After 1945, the United States assumed global security and economic leadership because it believed that both served Washington's best interests. Redefining these interests is not simply a U.S. policy matter; it means the postwar international order is less appealing to the countries that accepted American leadership as the price for a system that enabled their own security and prosperity.

Trump's erratic approach to trade is converging with other economic and technological policies to undermine the United States' preeminent role. The American economy still has unmatched capacity for resilience and growth. But assuming that some tariffs will remain, many analysts have projected that the United States will likely enter a recession before year's end, if it is not already in one. Bond market volatility is also calling the dollar's primacy into question, and the United States' global credit rating has slid. Coupled with acute uncertainty, rising prices, and supply shortages, the American economy is wobblier than at any point since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Technologically, the United States can continue to lead in AI and other critical sectors, but it faces more challenges to its innovation edge than at any time since the Cold War. Sectoral tariffs may make it more challenging for the Trump administration to invest in domestic manufacturing, including in critical technologies such as semiconductors, since the levies would increase the costs of imported components and make U.S.-manufactured chips less globally competitive. The administration's rescission of Biden's rules on AI chip exports, meanwhile, may make it easier for exquisite technologies to wind up in competitors' hands. And the administration's turn away from investments in clean energy technologies increases the likelihood that China could come to dominate that sector while cuts to education and basic research funding undermine long-term U.S. competitiveness overall.



These shifts will impose compounding geopolitical costs on the United States. Although it's difficult to know how much ground China or Russia may gain, it already appears likely that U.S. partners from Southeast Asia to Europe will hedge in China's direction. As revisionist authoritarian states such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia continue deepening their cooperation, the United States is inching further back from its role as the leader of a coalition of advanced industrial democracies. This is not an accident. In stark contrast with his first term, in which many senior officials steered the administration to focus on great-power competition, Trump appears to be pursuing a transactional approach to geopolitics based on dealmaking with other major powers. His early desire to coerce Ukraine into an unfavorable deal with Russia, for instance, and signs that he could seek an accommodation with China have raised fears that the United States will recede to the Western Hemisphere and leave Europe and Asia to Russia and China, respectively.

Whether Trump will commit to a spheres-of-influence approach is uncertain. But the question of which countries Washington views as adversaries and allies and why is very much open, particularly as the world watches Trump's assault on democratic norms and institutions at home. Partners will be hard-pressed to escape the conclusion that Washington has completely redefined its self-interests, even if the nature of its desired leadership role is not yet clear.

All of this will accelerate a profound global reordering. Some global rules, institutions, alliances, and groupings will withstand the test. But even as familiar structures remain, their roles, missions, and contexts may shift beyond recognition, and global perceptions of the United States will be forever altered. The post-Trump world will present both an opportunity and an epochal challenge: the need to build a new American strategy that goes beyond merely reacting to Trump and also avoids reverting to decades of postwar policy thinking.

Since the global financial crisis and the failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it has been clear that the United States is overstretched. But the temptation to tweak the United States' role in the world rather than overhaul it has carried the day in the last two Democratic administrations. After Trump's second term, the impulse to merely repair and restore traditional American leadership will seem quaint at best. The next administration will inherit something closer to a grand strategic tabula rasa than policymakers have seen since the end of World War II.

In accounting, zero-based budget exercises begin with clean financial slates in order to justify every expense and allocate resources efficiently to meet strategic goals. In foreign policy, strategists should use this moment to zero out their assumptions about the U.S. role in the world rather than accept inherited premises. In bucking conventional foreign policy wisdom, the Trump administration has conducted a version of this exercise‚Äîone guided by impulse instead of analysis and strategy. The next administration can and must do better, taking advantage of an American foreign policy ‚ÄúOverton window‚Äù that has been blown wide open.

Such a review must start by taking stock of the conditions that best assure the security and prosperity of the American people. American grand strategists, for instance, have long defined U.S. interests in terms of preventing a hostile power from dominating Eurasia. But this construct implicitly favors military calculations and neglects the power and influence that come from dominating technological ecosystems, such as AI, clean tech, and quantum computing‚Äîthe advantages of which may prove more consequential than securing particular geographies over the coming decades. Revising this assumption could reorient American strategy, centering technology cooperation with allies and partners and elevating the importance of Africa and Southeast Asia as regions whose demographics create opportunities for rapid growth in their digital economies. It could also put a premium on new tools of economic statecraft, such as revamped development finance and a U.S. government strategic investment fund, that enable Washington to help finance other countries' purchase of U.S. technology and infrastructure.

American grand strategists also need to ask whether the country still benefits from being the preponderant provider of global public goods, such as freedom of navigation. Defending the global commons‚Äîparticularly shipping lanes‚Äîhas been a guiding principle for the U.S. military in the post‚ÄìCold War world, whether countering piracy in the Horn of Africa, defending against Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, or conducting freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea. A zero-based review could help prioritize these missions, assessing whether the United States has sufficient capacity for the most taxing contingencies and identifying areas in which other countries could accept greater responsibility.

A zero-based review could also consider the appropriate place for values in American foreign policy. American grand strategy has long been oriented around the country's identity as a democracy. But is the spread or at least the defense of democracy still in the national interest? What role should democracy and human rights play in shaping Washington's global objectives and identifying its partners? A review might suggest a more modest emphasis on values as a matter of both rhetoric and substance and reckon with diminished American moral authority as a result of democratic challenges at home and perceptions of hypocrisy abroad. Such an approach might center international partnerships on shared principles rather than shared values, expanding the role for nondemocracies in U.S. coalitions. It could call for greater restraint in the use of sanctions to performatively punish countries for their internal conduct‚Äîespecially if those sanctions compromise the United States' ability to cooperate on areas of mutual interest. And it could create space for expanded diplomatic engagement with countries whose values the United States finds repugnant.



Finally, a zero-based review must account for newfound constraints on American power and allow for tradeoffs demanded by a more multipolar world. Multipolarity, after all, does not imply equipoise. This version of it will be complex, with significant power wielded by the United States and China but with major roles for other players, including an increasingly autonomous Europe, a recalcitrant Russia, and an ever more powerful India. It will require a realistic assessment of American capabilities‚Äîacknowledging, for example, that the U.S. military already faces a readiness crisis, the cost of servicing the U.S. debt already exceeds spending on defense and Medicare, and Trump's cuts have already slashed the capacity of the federal workforce, including diplomats and development experts. In a more multipolar world that no longer presumes consistent American leadership, the exercise of influence over newer forms of international order could prove more taxing. With more limited capabilities, strategists will want to work with, rather than resist or reshape, the major geopolitical changes that are already underway.

Consider how policymakers might choose to approach the U.S. alliance system in a post-Trump world. The next several years could witness a crisis that tests alliances in Europe and Asia, as the United States continues to press partners to spend more on defense and threatens to pull back its commitments‚Äîand perhaps even does so. American unpredictability is already inspiring allies to take steps to invest in their own self-defense individually and through new collective arrangements and could result in some allies seeking nuclear capabilities.

Rather than reflexively aiming to reverse these trends, zeroing out decades-old assumptions could yield a fresh approach. New alliance bargains could prioritize countries with which the United States has the greatest strategic alignment and focus on domains that benefit the American people while dispensing with the separation of security, economic, and technological cooperation that has traditionally characterized U.S. partnerships. Alliances have long focused on nuclear and high-end conventional deterrence, but they could be recentered on economic and technological cooperation. New negotiated arrangements could include the harmonization of industrial policy; cooperation on vital supply chains, such as critical minerals and semiconductors; the alignment of climate and tax policy; and frameworks for collaboration on frontier technologies, such as AI, including aligned tech regulations and standards. Refashioning alliances in this way, moreover, will bring them into domains that manifestly benefit everyday Americans and better align them with the requirements of long-term competition with China.

These changes could also transform the United States from a wholesale security provider to something more like a security enabler, with allies assuming more responsibility for conventional deterrence and the United States supporting them with weapons sales and coproduction, technology sharing and innovation partnerships, intelligence collaboration, and operational integration. With European allies in particular, there could be an opportunity to strike a new bargain that accelerates investments in independent European self-defense, focuses allies squarely on the Russian threat, and reassesses the U.S. military posture on the continent. If smaller configurations of European defenses are layered atop NATO, the United States could explore new alliance approaches that leverage those efforts.



Such shifts would allow Washington to update its global force posture without hasty changes that surprise allies and create security gaps leading to deterrence failures. The United States could concentrate its military presence in a relatively small number of frontline allies, prioritizing Asia but including Europe, and it could focus on partners whose threat perceptions and capabilities are most closely aligned, such as Japan, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, and the Baltic states. Within other alliances, the United States could then pay more attention to the areas of cooperation that benefit it most, such as technology cooperation and defense coproduction.

Without a zero-based review, strategists risk succumbing to restorationist tendencies that will leave the United States unequipped to meet the moment. In the wake of Trump's disruptive presidency, for instance, policymakers might choose to recommit to all treaty allies in Europe and Asia equally, particularly if Russia continues to threaten eastern Europe and Chinese-Russian cooperation increases. But in a world in which a smaller subset of European allies have supercharged their own defenses, an undifferentiated return to NATO risks perpetuating age-old frustrations about allied defense spending and burden sharing. A return to business as usual for NATO would also make it difficult to deal with the reality that some NATO allies will have warmed to China and others to Russia as hedges during the Trump years. What's more, it would fail to account for increased European capability and autonomy, and it would risk a recommitment of resources to the continent that the United States cannot afford.

A zero-based review would also create an opportunity to account for the American people's foreign policy preferences, when they are discernible, and free strategists from imagined political constraints. Foreign policy practitioners and thinkers often discount the role of public opinion in foreign policy, arguing that the American people's preferences need not constrain the options available to policymakers. But this moment of profound change is occurring precisely because of a widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo. Many Americans, for instance, believe that the faraway military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq were a mistake. Nearly every year since 2004, a majority of Americans have reported that they are dissatisfied with the country's role in the world. Although the public does not have clearly formed consensus views on many issues, post-Trump planners have an opportunity to better align grand strategy with public perceptions, which in turn should make public support for U.S. foreign policy more stable over time and across parties.

A zero-based review should also embed the new political openings that the second Trump administration will have enabled. In the past, U.S. presidents on a bipartisan basis have winced at foreign policies that might be seen as controversial within and across parties, including initiatives to negotiate with adversaries such as Iran or North Korea or the fundamental necessity of pressing allies to increase burden sharing. With the Trump team dispensing with all policy assumptions and conventions, more options will be available to whoever comes next.

Foreign policy analysts often refer to Present at the Creation, a book by former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson, when discussing the extraordinary global order-building effort undertaken by the United States after World War II. Explaining the title, Acheson noted that in the immediate postwar world, the Truman administration's task was ‚Äújust a bit less formidable than that described in the first chapter of Genesis. That was to create a world out of chaos; ours, to create half a world, a free half, out of the same material without blowing the whole to pieces in the process.‚Äù

Acheson's creation, of course, survived remarkably well. It was refashioned and embellished many times over and persisted after the end of the Cold War, which it helped win. Because history at that moment broke in Washington's favor, it produced a world in which American policymakers saw few constraints and many opportunities. The alliances and institutions that survived the midcentury competition between East and West appeared too healthy and American power too strong to warrant a post‚ÄìCold War overhaul.

The picture is completely different today. As new technologies, new rising powers, and long-standing tensions combine to form fresh chaos, the Trump administration has decided to wipe the slate clean. The world's opinion of the United States and receptivity to its desire to assume a refashioned leadership role are themselves new variables. Although global demand for American power has proved resilient before, there are no guarantees that an American president of either party come 2029 will be able to shape patterns of trust and cooperation the same way presidents have in the past. The world, meanwhile, continues to churn, as allies, partners, and adversaries make consequential decisions that will constrain the choices available to the next U.S. president. Washington needs a strategy fashioned for this post-primacy reality. To deflect this task would be to miss an exceptionally rare chance not only to be present at the creation of a new order but to be prepared for it.

The early months of the second Trump administration have left Europe adrift. The continent was already reeling from the war in Ukraine and increasingly worried about the specter of Russian aggression. Now, new leadership in Washington is casting doubt on its commitment to the defense of European allies.

In the eyes of Europeans, even the U.S. nuclear umbrella, which for decades has shielded the continent from outside threats, no longer seems fully dependable. ‚ÄúI want to believe that theUnited States will stay by our side,‚Äù French President Emmanuel Macron said in March. ‚ÄúBut we have to be prepared for that not to be the case.‚Äù

The way forward, Macron has argued, is to protect the continent from attack without relying on the deterrent power of American nuclear weapons. France's contribution, he has suggested, might be to put its own nuclear arsenal in the service of its European neighbors.

It is too early to tell what will come of the French president's offer. A similar proposal Macron made in 2020 was ignored in other European capitals. But the continent's geopolitical predicament has grown much direr in the years since, and the probability of an attack on European NATO members is now at a level not seen since the late 1970s. Given that reality and the seeming indifference of the Trump administration to it, the continent needs to rethink its own deterrence strategies. If the American nuclear umbrella is no longer open, Europe might need one of its own. Ironically, this would run counter to U.S. President Donald Trump's ambition, stated in 2017, to ‚Äúde-nuke‚Äù the world.

The credibility of any nuclear deterrent rests on two pillars: having the right capabilities and having the resolve to use them. Judged by those criteria, neither Macron's proposal nor any other option for an independent European nuclear deterrent currently passes muster. But even if the moment for Europe to decouple its security from that of the United States has not yet arrived, the continent's leaders must prepare for the possibility that it may before long. And that means beginning to take serious stock of their nuclear options. In the short term, doing so will signal that Washington needs to take Europe's deterrence concerns seriously. But it would also lay a foundation on which Europe could build should its fears of abandonment by the United States really come true.

Historically, most European countries have viewed nuclear weapons with skepticism and, in some cases, outright hostility. Antinuclear sentiment peaked in the 1980s, when NATO's ‚Äúdual track‚Äù decision, which included plans to station American intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe, set off massive protests in cities across the region. Popular opposition was fueled in part by the belief that U.S. nuclear weapons were not a deterrent against Soviet aggression, as NATO leaders argued, but a vehicle for reckless provocation and warmongering. The 1983 film The Day After offered a fictionalized preview of what might lie in store: a U.S.-‚ÄãSoviet confrontation in Berlin spiraling into a small-scale nuclear war and, eventually, a global nuclear wipeout. Among the record number of dystopian nuclear-themed works of science fiction to have come out of the 1980s, many played on such fears.

In reality, what followed was not Armageddon but d√©tente. The Americans and the Soviets agreed to limit their arsenals, and those agreements held after the Soviet Union fell and Russia took its place. As the Cold War receded into history, fears of nuclear war abated.

But in European policymaking circles, resistance to the logic of nuclear deterrence persisted. Outside Europe's two nuclear powers, France and the United Kingdom, European officials and thinkers still tend to associate all things nuclear with destruction more than with deterrence.

Even so, the war in Ukraine has brought the nuclear issue back into focus, mainly in light of a renewed and growing nuclear threat from Russia. Part of the problem is the sheer size and potency of Russia's arsenal of around 5,580 nuclear warheads. It is unclear how many of those warheads are meant to target central or western Europe. But the dozens of nuclear warheads Russia has stationed in Belarus are cause for concern, as they could easily strike NATO countries such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.



More worrying than the arsenal itself, however, is Russia's potential willingness to use it, including as a means of coercion and blackmail. Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated nuclear threats against Ukraine and its European supporters portend trouble for the rest of the continent, particularly in conjunction with the ongoing reorganization and modernization of Russia's armed forces. Russia appears to be reorienting its military capabilities and strategy toward the possibility of protracted conflict with Europe. It also aims to increase active military personnel from 1.3 million to 1.5 million by 2027, raising the possibility of a return to Soviet-style mass mobilization.

Even as the geopolitical danger from the East has increased, the protection afforded by the American nuclear umbrella no longer seems guaranteed, at least not since Trump took office for the second time in January. Of course, the United States still has the ability to provide Europe with a credible nuclear deterrent. What is increasingly uncertain is whether, under Trump, it still wants to do so. Trump and those around him have repeatedly suggested that the United States might not come to its allies' rescue if they were attacked, musing about pulling U.S. troops out of Europe and implying that Washington might not defend NATO members that do not spend sufficiently on their own defense.

To be sure, such rhetoric may just be an attempt to pressure European allies into higher defense spending. To actually push those allies out from underneath the American nuclear umbrella would undermine the United States' status as a superpower, alienate some of the most important partners in its geopolitical competition with China and Russia, reduce its leverage over Europe, and perhaps open the door to nuclear proliferation on the continent. But security experts could find themselves in a similar position to that of economists: despite near-total expert consensus that tariffs will spark a trade war and hurt the U.S. economy, Trump plowed ahead. In the economic realm, such missteps are harmful. In the domain of national security, the ramifications could be existential.

As the former U.S. diplomat and political scientist Ivo Daalder wrote in Foreign Affairs earlier this year, the principle of collective defense enshrined in NATO's founding treaty ‚Äúderives its credibility less from the formal treaty than from a belief among the members that they are all prepared to come to one another's defense.‚Äù Potential aggressors must believe the same thing. Europe's entire post‚ÄìCold War security architecture rests on this belief. To throw it into doubt risks undermining the entire system from within and without.



So far, European debates on how to establish deterrence without U.S. assistance have centered on conventional, nonnuclear military capabilities, and understandably so. The limited conventional military capabilities of European NATO members could tempt Russia into carrying out a limited attack‚Äîseizing a small piece of territory from one of its Baltic neighbors, say, or engaging a European military vessel‚Äîwith the expectation that it would not suffer any serious consequences. If such an attack took place and Europe lacked the means for an appropriate military response, NATO's credibility would be shattered. Recognizing that danger, most European countries have pledged significant increases in defense spending. It will likely take several years for those investments to fill the gaps, but at least the necessary political decisions have been made and there is broad public support for them.

A potential European nuclear deterrent is a different matter. European politicians have sporadically expressed concern about the nuclear threat from Russia, and defense experts have begun discussing Europe's nuclear options more seriously. What is lacking, however, is an informed public debate, despite Macron's recent proposal.

The conditions for such a debate are better than they have been in years. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, polling indicated that in four European countries that hosted U.S. nuclear weapons‚ÄîBelgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands‚Äîa plurality of respondents opposed such hosting arrangements. By contrast, in a March poll of nine European countries, 61 percent of respondents said they would welcome a French nuclear umbrella covering the entire continent.

An extended nuclear deterrent of this type, provided by France but ideally also supplemented by the United Kingdom, would certainly merit closer scrutiny if the United States further diluted or even disavowed its security guarantees. Two other options, which seem less pertinent because they are even more controversial, also deserve attention. One is a collective nuclear deterrent: that is, an arsenal that would be controlled by a pan-European institution. The other is the acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional European states. If Europe chose any of these paths, it would need to meet two criteria to make its nuclear deterrent credible. First, its arsenal would have to be sufficiently large, technically sophisticated, and capable of surviving a first strike. Second, whoever controlled the arsenal would have to demonstrate a willingness to use it.

Of the three options, only one has been seriously discussed so far: an extended nuclear deterrent provided primarily by France, with complementary support from the United Kingdom. The new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has indicated interest in such an arrangement, even if he has said it would serve only to supplement American nuclear guarantees, not to replace them. And in May, France and Poland signed a treaty to deepen their security ties, a step that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described as a step toward a potential French nuclear umbrella for his country.

As of today, however, French and British nuclear capabilities raise serious credibility concerns. Some 290 French nuclear warheads are ready for deployment; the United Kingdom can provide another 225. Taken together, that is a mere ten percent of what Russia can field.

Deterrence is no simple numbers game, but a gap this wide is a clear liability, for reasons of both objective and perceived weakness. For one thing, it effectively restricts European allies to what nuclear experts call ‚Äúdeterrence by punishment.‚Äù Such deterrence rests on the threat of overwhelming retaliation‚Äîattack us, and we will respond by laying waste to your cities. For that threat to work, one's own nuclear assets must be able to survive the enemy's initial attack. France certainly has that capability, since most of its warheads are deployed on submarines, which are notoriously hard to detect and destroy. But what if the aggressor used low-yield tactical weapons, and what if the target lay on the far edges of the Franco-British nuclear umbrella? Would France and the United Kingdom, which lack tactical nuclear warheads of their own, be willing to use their high-yield strategic arsenal in response‚Äîand risk total annihilation if the enemy responded in kind?



The answer might be no, and the obvious implication is that France and the United Kingdom cannot currently offer their allies the kind of extended deterrent afforded by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Getting there would require substantial investments in their respective arsenals to increase the number of strategic warheads, acquire tactical ones, and deploy them in a way that they could survive a first strike by an opponent. Given their budgetary constraints, it is unlikely that Paris and London could shoulder the burden of these investments on their own. Instead, most of the bill would have to be footed by the nuclear umbrella's future beneficiaries‚Äîthat is, other European allies.

France and the United Kingdom have consistently maintained that any decision to use nuclear weapons is a matter of national sovereignty. They would thus need to issue credible assurances of protection to any third-party investors. Europe's limited geographic scale and deep economic integration make such assurances more plausible than transatlantic pledges of protection by the United States. Nonetheless, a credible deterrent would require further arrangements. Nuclear-sharing agreements between the United States and its allies offer a useful template: under these pacts, the U.S. military deploys nuclear weapons to a number of allied states, and the host countries then provide some components of the necessary delivery systems, such as carrier aircraft and pilots. But Washington retains the sole authority to order a nuclear launch. The credibility of Paris's and London's assurances could also be enhanced by the creation of a consultation mechanism similar to NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, which discusses nuclear issues and reviews member states' policies but of which France is not a member.

Still, another major weak spot would remain. Judging by the outcomes of recent elections in France and the United Kingdom, one cannot rule out the rise, in both countries, of right-wing populist governments whose geopolitical instincts would lead them to pursue a France-only or United Kingdom‚Äìonly nuclear policy. In other words, a Franco-British nuclear umbrella might one day snap shut for the same reasons the American one did.

To mitigate the uncertainties that would complicate the Franco-British option, European leaders could set their sights on a more ambitious one: a collective, pan-European nuclear deterrent. During the Cold War, officials in the Kennedy administration considered a version of this arrangement: a multinational fleet of ships and submarines armed with American nuclear weapons but operated, owned, and controlled entirely by European NATO allies. The fleet would have carried enough warheads to destroy anywhere from 25 to 100 Soviet cities. But British opposition to the plan, as well as disagreements among other allies on how to implement and fund it, caused it to founder.

A modern version of this proposal could place French and British nuclear weapons under the control of the European Union or a new body. This plan would solve the political problem posed by the Franco-British option, since it would be less vulnerable to a change of heart on the part of France or the United Kingdom. In the short term, the technical shortcomings of the Franco-British option would remain, since the collective deterrent would rely on the two countries' arsenals. But Europe's nonnuclear powers would have a much stronger incentive to share the financial burden of modernizing and expanding the French and British nuclear stockpile than they would have under the first option, since they would be investing in a jointly controlled arsenal rather than in weapons wholly controlled by others.

Joint control would represent the arrangement's greatest strength for most of the continent, but it would be a nonstarter for Paris and London. Neither government would want to hand over its national arsenal to a European body and give up the final say on the weapons' use. Even if a multilateral nuclear force provided enhanced capabilities and thus a higher level of deterrence‚Äîwhose benefits would also redound to the French and the British‚Äîthe question of who held the ultimate launch authority would likely outweigh any other considerations.

Joint control raises other thorny issues, too. If only a single member state of the multilateral force suffered a nuclear attack, would the others really prove willing to respond? If they didn't, would that give the attacked country the right to conduct a unilateral retaliatory strike, using nuclear weapons stationed on its territory as part of the multilateral force? Would a nuclear strike require unanimity among member states, or would a majority suffice? In either case, decision-making would require more time than is available during a potential nuclear conflict. To avoid delays, launch authority could be delegated to a supranational body. But that body would not have enough democratic legitimacy to make life-or-death decisions for hundreds of millions of people. Until European nations have reached a level of integration that would allow a directly elected European government to make such a decision, option two would fail the credibility test.

What remains is undoubtedly the most controversial and far-reaching option: instead of relying on or investing in the existing French and British arsenals, other European countries could build nuclear weapons of their own. If these states accumulated arsenals comparable in size to those of France and the United Kingdom, Europe's collective capabilities would extend beyond deterrence by punishment. Rather than merely threatening retaliation in the wake of an attack, European states would be able to engage in ‚Äúdeterrence by denial‚Äù‚Äîthat is, to make it difficult or even impossible for an adversary to carry out a devastating strike in the first place.

Several major European powers, chief among them Germany and Poland, could theoretically acquire the technological capabilities and allocate the financial resources necessary to amass enough enriched uranium and ultimately develop nuclear weapons. But doing so would still take time‚Äîcertainly enough time for a potential nuclear-armed aggressor such as Russia to carry out a preemptive conventional strike on enrichment sites and other development facilities. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, such a strike would have been unthinkable. Nowadays, hardly anything can be excluded.

To mitigate that risk, France and the United Kingdom could ‚Äúlend out‚Äù some of their nuclear weapons on a temporary basis. The incentive for Paris and London to go along with this plan and support the nuclear ambitions of their allies would be to achieve strength in numbers: even without joint control, multiple European nuclear powers could establish a greater level of deterrence than France and the United Kingdom can establish for themselves today. The United States, for its part, would at long last be relieved of the burden of protecting Europe, freeing resources for alternative uses. But if the benefits are of historic proportions, so, too, are the potential costs‚Äîespecially the raised risk of provoking a conflict with Russia.



In practice, there is no obvious contender for the position of Europe's third nuclear power. So far, only Poland seems to be weighing the option in earnest. ‚ÄúPoland must pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons,‚Äù Tusk, the country's prime minister, told Polish parliamentarians in March. ‚ÄúThis is a serious race‚Äîa race for security, not for war.‚Äù

The debate in Germany, meanwhile, is complicated by historical, political, cultural, and strategic considerations. Despite decades of reconciliation, integration, and democratic stability, the first half of the twentieth century‚Äîand Germany's role in it‚Äîstill weighs heavily on European minds. A nuclear-armed Germany would entail a significant rebalancing of power in Europe and trigger deep concern in neighboring capitals. That is to say nothing of German society's own wariness. Its pacifist and antinuclear leanings run deep, as do its aversion to risk and its reservations about taking on international military responsibilities. Even the civilian use of nuclear energy has been phased out, with the last reactors shut down in April 2023. These societal and political instincts are hardly compatible with the role of a nuclear power.

The legal constraints on Germany are significant, too. As a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the country has renounced the production and possession of nuclear weapons. The same commitment is enshrined in Article 3(1) of the Two Plus Four Treaty, the 1990 agreement that provided the legal foundation for the post‚ÄìCold War reunification of East and West Germany. The Two Plus Four Treaty, in particular, is a daunting legal obstacle, as a violation of one of its central elements could put the validity of the whole document into question. That, in turn, would cause major concerns among its signatories and among Germany's immediate neighbors.

To be sure, recent events have already undercut the treaty's political basis. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the possibility of a U.S. withdrawal from Europe each threaten the very achievement that the accord was meant to secure, namely the full sovereignty of a reunified Germany. These unsettling changes could be reason enough for a joint decision by Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States to override Article 3(1). Nevertheless, any move by Germany toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons would be imaginable only in close consultation and concert with other European states, first and foremost Poland, where a nuclear-armed Germany would cause the most apprehension.

For the time being, none of the three options easily pass the credibility test. A French and British nuclear umbrella would lack the necessary capabilities, and its beneficiaries would likely doubt its reliability in times of crisis. A pan-European nuclear deterrent appears even less feasible. It would transfer an existential political decision to an entity with only indirect democratic legitimacy. Doing so would amount to a serious challenge to European democratic norms at a time when they are already under assault by illiberal forces.

Nuclear proliferation in Europe might provide effective and credible deterrence. But it would carry legal and political risks that, for the time being, are too great for European leaders to countenance. It could also set off a wave of nuclear proliferation outside Europe, including in states that Western governments consider hostile.

Then again, even if Europe stays put, there is no knowing if nonproliferation will hold in other parts of the world. If anything, current trends suggest that the first place it will buckle is East Asia. If the Trump administration continues to create a sense of uncertainty about the U.S. security guarantee to South Korea, for example, leaders in Seoul could reach a breaking point. As things stand, South Korea faces three politically hostile nuclear powers‚ÄîNorth Korea, China, and Russia‚Äîin its immediate neighborhood. South Korean defense strategists have pointed out that this situation would become untenable if their country's only nuclear ally, the United States, were to withdraw. A nuclear-armed South Korea would, in turn, encourage Japan to pursue the same course.

Nuclear proliferation in East Asia would also alter the terms of the debate in Europe, where it might be viewed as a shift more real and definitive than Trump's threats alone. It is a sobering scenario: European leaders, faced with nothing but bad options, may prove incapable of breaking their nuclear impasse unless someone else takes the plunge first. Europe's safest bet, until then, is to at least prepare for all contingencies.

‚Ä¢ Trump weighs in: President Donald Trump flashed intense anger today as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile. Before heading to the NATO summit in the Netherlands, the president conveyed he was particularly unhappy with Israel, which he said quickly violated the truce. Trump also said he does not seek regime change in Iran because he doesn't want to see ‚Äúchaos.‚Äù
    


‚Ä¢ Ceasefire violations alleged: Israel struck a radar site north of Tehran hours after the ceasefire was due to take effect, following accusations that Iran had fired several missiles at Israel. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel refrained from conducting further strikes after Netanyahu spoke to Trump in what a White House source said was a ‚Äúfirm and direct‚Äù call.
    


‚Ä¢ CNN poll on strikes: Meanwhile, the US president's decision to launch airstrikes against Iran during the weekend is broadly unpopular with Americans, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after the strikes.
    


            Israel's ‚Äúcampaign against Iran‚Äù is not over, the country's military chief said Tuesday.
    


            Speaking at a situational assessment after the Israel-Iran ceasefire took effect, Israeli Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said that a ‚Äúsignificant phase‚Äù has ended and that Israel is entering a ‚Äúnew phase, based on the achievements of the current one.‚Äù
    


            The military chief cautioned challenges remain for the armed forces, and he urged them to remain focused amid the ongoing campaign in Gaza.
    


            ‚ÄúNow the focus shifts back to Gaza ‚Äî to bring the hostages home and to dismantle the Hamas regime,‚Äù he said.
    


            On the rubble-strewn streets of Beer Sheva, Yogev Kudady and his wife were sitting on the sidewalk, hardly able to speak.
    


            The city in southern Israel was one of the last places targeted by Iran before a ceasefire between the two countries came into effect Tuesday. Just before 6 a.m. local time, a ballistic missile slammed into a residential building, killing at least four people.
    


            By the afternoon, the residents of Beer Sheva were still trying to come to terms with what had happened.
    


                    ‚ÄúI'm speechless. I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do,‚Äù Kudady told CNN. ‚ÄúIt's like a nightmare.‚Äù
                





            Kudady, his wife and their four children ‚Äî aged 10, 8, 5 and 1 ‚Äî took cover in a bomb shelter after Israeli authorities issued an air raid warning. ‚ÄúI told my family, keep close to each other, and close to the wall,‚Äù he said. Their house was damaged in the blast.
    


            Dana Blitz, 21, lives in a building near the one struck by the missile. The blast from the explosion shattered her windows, filling a room with ‚Äúdust and glass,‚Äù she told CNN. She said her front door, made of sturdy metal, was bent in half and the ceiling had collapsed.
    


            Blitz said she was ‚Äúheartbroken‚Äù by the damage to her childhood home. ‚ÄúI'm so glad the house didn't fall down,‚Äù she said.
    


            Blitz said she had been ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù about a possible attack for days, and she had prepared a bag of her belongings in case she had to evacuate.
    


            ‚ÄúEverybody says, ‚ÄòIt's not going to happen to me, it's not going to happen around me.' But you never know,‚Äù she said.
    


            Iranian media outlets are broadcasting footage of a large crowd gathering in central Tehran, which they report is showing support and appreciation for the country's armed forces.
    


            The gathering in Revolution Square was reported by state and state-affiliated news agencies IRNA, Fars and Mehr.
    


            According to reports, demonstrators are vowing to stand by the armed forces until the end, praising their ‚Äúcrushing response to the aggressions‚Äù of Israel and the United States.
    


            Video footage broadcast by Iranian media outlets showed people chanting in support of Iran while carrying Iranian flags and posters of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
    


            It's unclear whether the Iranian regime organized the rally.
    


            Iranian airspace partially reopened today, following the country's ceasefire with Israel after 12 days of hostilities, according to aviation monitoring company FlightRadar24.
    


            ‚ÄúIranian airspace is now open to international arrivals and departures to/from Tehran with prior permission,‚Äù FlightRadar24 said on X.
    


            Iraqi airspace has also reopened, it added.
    


            Iran ‚Äúdoes not seek nuclear weapons in any way‚Äù but is ‚Äúonly seeking its legitimate rights,‚Äù its President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Tuesday, according to the state-affiliated Fars News Agency.
    


            ‚ÄúIran is not Gaza or Lebanon that cannot respond to the military attacks of the Zionist regime,‚Äù Pezeshkian said during a phone call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
    


                    ‚ÄúWe expect you to explain to them in your interactions with America that the Islamic Republic of Iran is only seeking its legitimate rights and has no desire beyond that, it has not and does not seek nuclear weapons in any way,‚Äù Pezeshkian said as cited by Fars News Agency.
                





            Iran ‚Äúis only seeking to create a good future for its people, the region, and other countries by interacting with its neighbors and other countries,‚Äù Pezeshkian added.
    


            Iran has maintained that it does not seek to build nuclear weapons. It has spent decades developing its nuclear program and has seen it as a source of national pride and sovereignty. It says the program is solely for peaceful energy purposes and plans to build additional nuclear power plants to meet domestic energy needs and free up more oil for export.
    


            Classified briefings on the situation in Iran set to take place on Capitol Hill today have been postponed, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            The all-Senate briefing has been moved to Thursday, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Two separate sources familiar told CNN the briefing for all House lawmakers has also been postponed. It was not immediately clear why it was being delayed or when it would be rescheduled.
    


            President Donald Trump took credit for brokering peace between Israel and Iran, framing the recent ceasefire as a direct result of US airstrikes authorized under his leadership.
    


                    ‚ÄúBoth Israel and Iran wanted to stop the War, equally! It was my great honor to Destroy All Nuclear facilities & capability, and then, STOP THE WAR!‚Äù he said on Truth Social.
                





            Trump is currently on his way to the NATO summit in the Netherlands.
    


            US lawmakers were expected to receive classified briefings this afternoon on the situation in Iran, but sources tell CNN that they have been postponed.
    


            ‚ÄúPresident (Donald) Trump owes the facts to the American people, and so far, we've received no real information in the Congress,‚Äù Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN earlier today.
    


            Blumenthal said Trump deserves credit ‚Äúif, in fact, Iran's nuclear capability has been destroyed,‚Äù adding that the Israeli forces and US military also played a significant role.
    


            ÔªøNorth Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer said, ‚ÄúI'd like to hear some real specifics about what we know about any missing materials that there may or may not be and what Israel would know about them.‚Äù
    


Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, told CNN that he didn't believe Trump's decision to strike the nuclear facilities was well thought out and that he wanted more details. ‚ÄúIn my view, this was somewhat reckless,‚Äù he said.
    


            On the House side, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries argued that Trump has ‚Äúbotched‚Äù his promises to bring peace to the region.
    


                    ‚ÄúThe real question that people are asking here in America is what the F is Donald Trump doing,‚Äù Jeffries told reporters this morning, referring to Trump's comments earlier that Israel and Iran ‚Äúdon't know what the fuck they're doing.‚Äù
                





Speaker Mike Johnson told members at a House Republican conference meeting that he spoke with Trump earlier in the morning, and the president told him he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to retaliate against Iran, according to a person in room. Punchbowl News first reported on Johnson's comment to members.
    


            Johnson also insisted that ceasefire will hold, though he acknowledged it is ‚Äúfragile,‚Äù and dismissed allegations from Democrats ‚Äî and some Republicans ‚Äî that Trump violated the War Powers Act by striking Iran without congressional approval. Johnson, a former constitutional lawyer, told reporters he is ‚Äúpersuaded‚Äù by the argument that the War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional.
    


            Republican Rep. Buddy Carter, who is running for US Senate in Georgia, announced that he has nominated President Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his handling of the Iran-Israel conflict.
    


            ‚ÄúThere's no one else who deserves it more than this president deserves it,‚Äù he said.
    


This post has been updated with additional remarks.



            President Donald Trump showed visible anger this morning as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile.
    


            Trump was critical of both sides, but reserved his harshest condemnation for Israel, which he said ‚Äúunloaded‚Äù on Iran ‚Äúas soon as we made the deal.‚Äù
    


Here's what else the president said:



            Iran's president has said the country will not violate the terms of its ceasefire with Israel, unless Israel breaks the pact first, as reported by state-affiliated Nour News
    


                    ‚ÄúIran will not violate the ceasefire, unless the Zionist regime does,‚Äù President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a statement Tuesday, according to Nour News. ‚ÄúTehran is ready for talks and to defend the rights of the Iranian people at the negotiation table.‚Äù
                





            Israel had earlier accused Iran of breaking the terms of the deal, announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday, by firing rockets into Israel hours after it went into effect. Tehran denied it had broken the ceasefire.
    


            President Donald Trump has walked back his comments of the possibility of a regime change in Iran following weekend strikes on three nuclear facilities.
    


            Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University Qatar, explains why regime change in Iran is complex. ‚ÄúPopular discontent, by itself, is not enough, for the collapse of the government,‚Äù Kamrava said.
    


Watch Kamrava discuss the feasibility of the Iranian regime collapsing:



            President Donald Trump shared screenshots on social media of a message he received from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who lauded him for his ‚Äúdecisive action‚Äù in Iran.
    


            ‚ÄúCongratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, that was truly extraordinary, and something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer,‚Äù Rutte wrote in the first message Trump published.
    


Trump makes his way to NATO summit: The messages show Rutte also praised Trump for securing a landmark defense spending agreement among NATO allies.
    


            ‚ÄúYou are flying into another big success in The Hague this evening, it was not easy but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent,‚Äù Rutte added, referring to Trump's push for NATO allies to increase defense spending.
    


            A NATO official confirmed to CNN that the messages shared by Trump on Truth Social were sent by Rutte.
    


            NATO is preparing to announce a new commitment requiring all member nations to spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense, a longtime demand of Trump's, which now seems closer than ever to becoming official policy.
    


This post has been updated with confirmation that Rutte sent the messages to Trump.



Joseph Ataman in The Hague contributed reporting.



            The US military's second-most senior officer overseeing the Middle East told lawmakers today that he believes Iran ‚Äúhas been weakened‚Äù since the October 7, 2023 attacks. He added that Israel's campaign against Iran has helped American national security.
    


                    ‚ÄúAt the strategic level, I think they've been weakened since the events of 7 October. At the tactical level, I think they've been degraded, and the degree to which that degradation has taken place ‚Äî particularly in the last 12 days ‚Äî is best discussed in a classified form,‚Äù Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of US Central Command who has been nominated to take over as commander, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
                





            Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the committee, asked him: ‚ÄúWould you agree with me that the remarkable effectiveness of Israel's military campaign against Iran and against its terrorist proxies has directly effected in a positive way American national security?‚Äù
    


            ‚ÄúI would, sir,‚Äù Cooper responded.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that he does not want a regime change in Iran because he does not want to see ‚Äúchaos.‚Äù
    


            Asked to clarify a social media post from over the weekend where he floated the possibility of regime change, Trump told reporters on Air Force One: ‚ÄúNo, if there was, there was, but no I don't want it. I'd like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible.‚Äù
    


                    ‚ÄúRegime change takes chaos, and ideally we don't want to see so much chaos,‚Äù the president added. ‚ÄúYou know, the Iranians are very good traders, very good business people, and they've got a lot of oil. They should be fine. They should be able to rebuild and do a good job. They're never going to have nuclear but other than that, they should do a great job.‚Äù
                





            Trump had raised the possibility of a change in leadership in Iran after the US struck three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend.
    


            ‚ÄúIt's not politically correct to use the term, ‚ÄòRegime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!‚Äù Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.
    


            At least 606 people have been killed in Iran since Israel launched its attack on June 13, including 107 on Monday alone, according to figures shared by Iran's health ministry during a crisis meeting in Tehran on Tuesday.
    


            The ministry said 95% of the victims died at the scene of the attacks, with Monday marking the deadliest day of the conflict.
    


            Israel struck a radar site north of Tehran on Tuesday but refrained from conducting further strikes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Donald Trump, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement.
    


            The strike on Iran, which was launched hours after the ceasefire was due to go into effect, came after Israeli officials accused Tehran of violating the truce by firing several missiles at Israel.
    


            The PMO said Trump ‚Äúexpressed his great appreciation for Israel‚Äù and that Netanyahu committed to refrain from additional strikes.
    


Trump-Netanyahu call: A White House source told CNN that Trump spoke to Netanyahu Tuesday morning and was ‚Äúexceptionally firm and direct.‚Äù
    


            Iran's state-affiliated news agency Fars said Tuesday that its correspondent heard explosions in northern Iran, hours after Israel and Iran agreed to the ceasefire.
    


            The Fars correspondent reported that an explosion was heard in the coastal city of Babolsar, north of Tehran. Rescue vehicles and ambulances are moving toward the site of the explosion, Fars said.
    


            According to Israel, two Iranian ballistic missiles were launched toward Israel approximately three hours after the ceasefire announced by Trump went into effect. At the White House, Trump later described it as ‚Äúone rocket that didn't land ‚Äî that was shot ‚Äî perhaps by mistake, that didn't land.‚Äù
    


            With a war they ‚Äúdid not want‚Äù on their doorstep, Gulf nations are gripped by ‚Äúfear,‚Äù Greg Carlstrom, Middle East correspondent at The Economist, told CNN's Becky Anderson on CNN Newsroom.
    


            The ceasefire is ‚Äúremarkable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can't think of another time when a country has been attacked and then turns around the next morning and brokers a ceasefire involving the country that attacked it and another country.‚Äù
    


            Carlstrom said the swift diplomatic choreography reflects ‚Äúdeep unease‚Äù across the Gulf, especially in Qatar, where residents were sent running for cover as missiles and interceptor fragments fell near shopping malls and roads.
    


            ‚ÄúThese are countries in the Gulf that have long prided themselves on being oases of stability in an otherwise very chaotic region,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThey did not want this war between Israel and Iran to have ripple effects, to come home.‚Äù
    


            The Kremlin has welcomed the news of a ceasefire between its ally Iran and Israel on Tuesday, a day after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
    


            ‚ÄúIf a ceasefire has indeed been reached, then this can and should only be welcomed,‚Äù Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters during his daily briefing on Tuesday.
    


            ‚ÄúThis is what the Russian Federation has been calling for from the very beginning of this conflict,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe hope that this will be a sustainable ceasefire.‚Äù
    


            Iran has been one of Russia's strongest allies during its war on Ukraine and Moscow was quick to condemn US attacks against Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.
    


            Peskov said that Araghchi ‚Äúhighly praised‚Äù Russia's ‚Äúclear position‚Äù on the Middle East crisis when he met Putin on Monday.
    


            Asked about a Reuters report that Araghchi delivered a letter from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to Putin requesting additional support, Peskov denied he had done so but acknowledged that certain messages were conveyed.
    


            ‚ÄúThere was no written document,‚Äù Peskov said. ‚ÄúIt is true that there were some signals from the Iranian leadership, but overall, the Reuters report does not reflect reality.‚Äù
    


            Peskov added that Iran and Russia did not discuss Tehran's response to the American strikes during the talks in Moscow.
    


            President Donald Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday morning and was ‚Äúexceptionally firm and direct,‚Äù a White House source said about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire.
    


            This source said Netanyahu understood the severity of the situation and Trump's concerns.
    


            Trump, who was jubilant yesterday evening when he announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, stayed up well into the night watching the coverage as it was set to go into effect.
    


            He became increasingly angry when he believed both countries were violating the agreement, several sources told CNN ‚Äî anger that was on full display as he departed for his trip to the NATO summit.
    


            US and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù Iran's centrifuge program, used to enrich uranium close to weapons-grade levels, according to an assessment by a former United Nations nuclear weapons inspector.
    


            David Albright, now president of the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), told CNN that, having reviewed satellite imagery and spoken to sources with knowledge of Iran's nuclear program, he assesses that Iran's centrifuge program has been ‚Äúdestroyed,‚Äù after the US joined Israel's strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


                    ‚ÄúIt's amazing how much damage has been done to that program. I think that part of the mission has been accomplished,‚Äù Albright said Tuesday.
                





Uranium stockpile: However, Albright said ‚Äúresidual‚Äù parts of Iran's program likely remained intact, most importantly its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a short step away from the 90% needed to build a nuclear weapon.
    


            Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on Monday was unable to confirm the whereabouts of Iran's 400-kilogram (880-pound) stockpile of this nuclear material. Grossi said Iran ‚Äúmade no secret that they have protected this material,‚Äù amid speculation that Iran moved the stockpile to a safer location before Sunday's strikes.
    


            But even if Iran was able to safely hide its enriched uranium, Albright said that turning this into weapons-grade material ‚Äúis not going to be a fast process,‚Äù since the US and Israeli bombing campaign has ‚Äúdone serious damage to build a nuclear weapon.‚Äù He assessed that it would take Iran ‚Äúa good year or two‚Äù to build a nuclear weapon, if it chose to reconstitute its program.
    


            Albright detailed how Iran's Fordow plant, buried deep in a mountain, had been targeted by the US strikes, which used 12 ‚Äúbunker buster‚Äù bombs to penetrate the rock.
    


            By analyzing post-strike satellite imagery ‚Äî and using designs of the plant from before the strike ‚Äî Albright said the US strikes had targeted parts of the site that were particularly vulnerable: a ventilation shaft that is ‚Äúabsolutely critical‚Äù to the operations, and a target above where the centrifuges are stored.
    


            Albright stressed that insider information will be required to be certain of the extent of the damage, but said the satellite imagery suggested that the Fordow plant had been destroyed.

Follow:


            The Supreme Court on Monday granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their homeland, including places like South Sudan, with minimal notice.
    


The decision is a significant win for the Trump administration, which had argued that a lower court usurped its authority by ordering the Department of Homeland Security to provide written notice to the migrants about where they would be sent as well as an opportunity to challenge that deportation on the grounds that they feared being tortured.
    


            The court's three liberal justices ‚Äì Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson ‚Äì dissented in a fiery opinion.
    


            The high court's order pauses a decision from US District Judge Brian Murphy, which found that the government's efforts to deport migrants to third-party countries without due process ‚Äúunquestionably‚Äù violated constitutional protections.
    


            Sotomayor, in a dissent aimed at the administration's broader approach, said her colleagues in the majority were ‚Äúrewarding lawlessness‚Äù with the decision, asserting that the Trump administration has ‚Äúopenly flouted‚Äù previous court orders.
    


            ‚ÄúRather than allowing our lower court colleagues to manage this high-stakes litigation with the care and attention it plainly requires, this court now intervenes to grant the government emergency relief from an order it has repeatedly defied,‚Äù she wrote.
    


            The court itself offered no explanation for the decision.
    


            Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, described the ramifications of the court's order as ‚Äúhorrifying.‚Äù
    


            Realmuto's group represented several of the migrants at the Supreme Court.
    


            The decision, she said, ‚Äústrips away critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death.‚Äù
    


            Like other cases on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, the ruling Monday was not the final word ‚Äì and it did not resolve the underlying legal questions the appeal raised. Instead, it allowed the administration to continue the policy while the legal challenge moves through the lower courts.
    


            But that will nevertheless have immediate and practical impacts.

            ‚ÄúIt's difficult to overstate how big a deal today's ruling is, especially in conjunction with the Supreme Court's two emergency docket rulings last month that, respectively, allowed the Trump administration to cancel temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans and parole for hundreds of thousands of other migrants,‚Äù said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
    


            ‚ÄúIn those earlier rulings, the court cleared the way for the government to treat as many as a million migrants as removable who previously weren't. And today's ruling allows the government to remove those individuals and others to any country that will take them ‚Äì without providing any additional process beyond an initial removal hearing, and without regard to the treatment they may face in those countries.‚Äù
    


            The Trump administration quickly praised the ruling on social media.
    


            ‚ÄúFire up the deportation planes,‚Äù Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote on X.
    


            DHS Secretary Kristi Noem posted an image of the court's decision alongside a GIF of Trump dancing.
    


            The response underscores how the administration might try to capitalize on a ruling that could dramatically change the way deportations are carried out‚Äîallowing officials to deport migrants to countries where they have no ties. One of the major hurdles for previous administrations was trying to send people back to their home countries who would refuse to receive them for a host of reasons, including frosty relations with the United States.
    


            The case has drawn growing scrutiny after immigrant rights groups revealed that a group of migrants, initially bound for South Sudan, were being detained by the US at a military base in Djibouti and have been unable to contact their attorneys. The migrants, including some from Cuba, Vietnam and Laos, were being held in a converted Conex shipping container.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision set off a flurry of briefings on behalf of those migrants in Murphy's court. Their lawyers argued that the high court's order didn't directly address their situation because Murphy had issued a subsequent order for them that the government did not appeal.
    


            In a new order late Monday, Murphy said that his May 21 directive remained in ‚Äúfull force and effect‚Äù despite the Supreme Court's decision. That order required the government to give the migrants at issue ‚Äúa reasonable fear interview in private, with the opportunity for the individual to have counsel of their choosing present during the interview.‚Äù
    


            Humanitarian groups describe the situation in South Sudan as dire. The United Nations recently warned about food insecurity in the country, which is also facing political instability and escalating violence.
    


            ‚ÄúThese individuals are stranded incommunicado in Djibouti, a country of which they have no knowledge, and en route to another country, South Sudan, where none have ever set foot,‚Äù the National Immigration Litigation Alliance and other groups told the court.
    


            In May, the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston rejected the government's request to pause a lower court ruling halting the policy, a decision that came amid reported plans to send migrants to Libya, a country widely criticized for mistreatment of detainees and ongoing civil unrest.
    


            Libyan officials denied any agreement to accept deportees.
    


            The Trump administration has argued that a lower court's order requiring officials to give them an opportunity to claim fear of torture under federal law oversteps legal bounds and complicates foreign policy. The administration has also claimed that the migrants who were sent to third countries have significant criminal records and represent the ‚Äúworst of the worst‚Äù of people in the US illegally.
    


            But the migrants' lawyers pushed back on that assertion this week, noting in a filing to the Supreme Court that many of the detainees have no criminal convictions, contrary to the administration's characterization.
    


            At issue is the Convention Against Torture, ratified by the Senate in 1994, that generally bars deportation or extradition to countries where there is a possibility that the migrant might be tortured. The law is vague about how an administration is supposed to make that determination and what process rights are due to the migrant at issue.
    


            The Trump administration has said that in cases where it has received ‚Äúassurances‚Äù from a foreign government that a migrant removed there will not be tortured, that officials do not have to notify a Cuban national, for instance, that he is being deported to South Sudan. In cases in which the government has not received those assurances, DHS policy requires the migrant to be notified so they can make a fear-of-torture claim.
    


            The groups representing the migrants argued that the administration, in some cases, has provided less than 24-hours' notice. Murphy, nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, ruled that was insufficient, and he ordered the government to give migrants 10 days to raise a claim about fear of torture and 15 days after that to contest a denial of that claim. It is that timeline the Trump administration was fighting at the Supreme Court and had framed as a usurpation of ‚Äúsensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.‚Äù
    


            Trump has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals at the Supreme Court and most of them ‚Äì including several dealings with immigration ‚Äì have been successful. A majority of the court supported Trump's efforts to end temporary protected status for Venezuelan nationals, for instance, as well as the administration's plan to unwind a form of humanitarian parole for Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.
    


            However, the high court has also repeatedly shut down efforts by Trump to speed deportations without offering due process for the affected migrants. In perhaps the most notable example of that, the court ruled that the administration could not deport people under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act without giving them sufficient opportunity to contest their removability.

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) ‚Äî Officials in South Dakota are pushing hard to build President Donald Trump ‚Äòs proposed National Garden of American Heroes in the Black Hills near Mount Rushmore, but the effort has sparked a backlash from Indigenous groups who see the area as sacred.

A mining company has offered to donate 40 acres (16 hectares) less than a mile from Mount Rushmore, where massive sculptures of four of the nation's most prominent presidents are carved out of granite.

‚ÄúThe Black Hills mark the perfect location to achieve your vision for the National Garden of American Heroes,‚Äù Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden wrote in a letter to Trump. ‚ÄúTogether, we will make this project happen in a way that honors America's heroes, takes advantage of South Dakota's natural beauty, and incorporates the most iconic monument to our greatest leaders: Mount Rushmore National Memorial.‚Äù

But the Black Hills have long been the subject of disputes between South Dakota and its tribes. The 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie recognized that the Black Hills belong to the Sioux people, but the U.S. government seized the land less than a decade later to mine for gold. A 1980 Supreme Court decision found that the U.S. violated the treaty, but the tribes refused the $1.3 billion in compensation they were offered and maintained their rights to the land.

The mining company, Pete Lien & Sons, also has had conflicts with Indigenous groups in the area, most recently because of an exploratory drilling project for graphite near the sacred Lakota site of Pe' Sla. The company also is working with theme park designer Storyland Studios to build an attraction in the Black Hills opposed by some Indigenous groups.

‚ÄúIt's absurd for Storyland Studios and Gov. Rhoden to claim they care about preserving history while they watch Lien & Sons attempt to destroy Pe' Sla, and do nothing,‚Äù said Taylor Gunhammer, an organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective.

‚ÄúThey are the ones erasing and paving over history, not preserving it,‚Äù Gunhammer said.

Rhoden's press secretary, Josie Harms, wrote in a statement that the garden ‚Äúwill have no disruption to either state or tribal land‚Äù because the tract of land is owned by Chuck Lien, owner of Lien & Sons, and his family. 

Pete Lien & Sons did not respond to multiple requests from The Associated Press for comment.

Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to build the garden, to feature 250 life-size statues of historical figures in honor of the country's 250th birthday on July 4, 2026. Applications for sculptors are due in early July, though the administration no longer seeks to have it completed by next summer.

The U.S. House has approved $40 million for the project, which is being overseen by the Department of Interior and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The Senate hasn't yet approved the funding.

Trump first announced the project in his first term in a July 3, 2020, speech at Mount Rushmore at a time during the Black Lives Matter movement when some protesters were tearing down statues depicting Confederate generals and others.

‚ÄúAngry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our Founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities,‚Äù Trump said in that speech. ‚ÄúBut no, the American people are strong and proud, and they will not allow our country, and all of its values, history, and culture, to be taken from them.‚Äù

In a 2021 executive order, Trump called for statues depicting a range of prominent figures, from the likes of Amelia Earhart, Muhammad Ali and Steve Jobs to more controversial ones like Christopher Columbus and President Andrew Jackson. No site was selected, however, and the garden was never funded by Congress.

The Department of Interior said the revived garden project is still in the ‚Äúplanning and discussion phase‚Äù and declined to say which sites it is considering.

It's unclear if any other states are seeking to host the statue garden.

When Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was the state's governor, she offered the mining company's 40 acres of land in the Black Hills. Her successor, Rhoden, doubled down on that offer in his letter, emphasizing the site would be ‚Äúin sight of Mount Rushmore.‚Äù

South Dakota Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson also wrote a letter to Trump, and said he will ‚Äúkeep advocating for this iconic landmark to make its home in the Black Hills‚Äù in a social media post.

Darren Thompson, director of media relations for the Indigenous nonprofit Sacred Defense Fund, called for more discussions with Indigenous groups in the Black Hills.

‚ÄúIt's a very touchy and sensitive subject that I think requires input by the local Indigenous people who have claim to the land and cultural ties to the land,‚Äù Thompson said.

CLAYMONT, Del. (AP) ‚Äî Lawmakers in Texas, Oklahoma and Nevada have recently approved changes aimed at helping their states dip into the lucrative side of corporate litigation that Delaware, with a specialized court and business-friendly laws, has dominated as the world's incorporation capital. 

Concerned that these changes may lure corporations away from Delaware, thereby causing the small state to lose millions in corporate franchise taxes, Delaware officials have responded with their own changes to solidify their status in the business world.

In Texas, which opened a business court last year, there was bipartisan support for legislation diminishing shareholder powers and giving businesses more legal protections against shareholder lawsuits. Nevada lawmakers approved a corporation-friendly update to its business laws, also with bipartisan support, and separately moved toward asking voters to consider changing the state constitution to create a dedicated business court with appointed judges. 

Billionaire Elon Musk had advocated both states as better options for incorporation after a Delaware judge struck down his shareholder-approved $56 billion compensation package from Tesla. Musk's businesses have also changed where they're incorporated: Tesla and SpaceX relocated to Texas, while Neuralink moved to Nevada.

Oklahoma also took action to get in the mix, as the Republican-led Legislature sanctioned the creation of business courts in its two most populous counties, a move the governor said would help Oklahoma become the most business-friendly state.

‚ÄúThis is an area in which states, in many ways, are behaving like businesses,‚Äù said Robert Ahdieh, dean of the Texas A&M University School of Law. ‚ÄúDelaware is selling something. Texas is selling something that they hold out to be better. So it is very much a comparative exercise.‚Äù

Since 2024, several billion-dollar companies including TripAdvisor and DropBox have relocated to Nevada. More than a dozen others, including the AMC theater chain and video game developer Roblox Corporation, have announced plans to incorporate there this year. Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre filed a request for shareholders to approve a Texas relocation in April, citing Delaware's ‚Äúless predictable‚Äù decision-making process ‚Äî a common thought among exiting companies.

Amid concerns about more companies reincorporating elsewhere in a so-called ‚ÄúDexit,‚Äù Delaware passed its own legislation to help protect its status as the corporate capital, limiting shareholders' access to records and increasing protections for leadership. Opposition dubbed it ‚Äúthe Billionaire's Bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúUltimately, I think the damage is done because businesses successfully undermined shareholder rights in Delaware,‚Äù said Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at Consumer Federation of America, who argues that the Delaware bill was a rash acquiescence to ‚ÄúDexit‚Äù concerns.

However, some business law experts, like Ahdieh, say the average shareholder is focused on increasing their returns and does not care about shareholder power or where the company is incorporated.

Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer has vowed to win back companies that leave, arguing his state's experience ‚Äúbeats going to Vegas and rolling the dice.‚Äù 

Companies flock to Delaware for its well-respected Court of Chancery, a sophisticated and separate forum focusing on equity, corporate and business law. This incorporation machine generates $2.2 billion annually, about one-third of the state's operating budget.

There is comfort in working in the familiarity of Delaware law, said Ahdieh, but that predictability has come into question in the last decade as corporate leaders grew unhappy over losing precedent-setting court decisions governing corporate conflicts of interest.

Widener University Commonwealth law school professor Christian Johnson acknowledged a shift in Delaware but said reincorporating elsewhere might be ‚Äúa bit of an overreaction.‚Äù Although a few big-name companies have moved, there are still more than 2 million legal entities incorporated in Delaware, including two-thirds of the Fortune 500. 

Statutes in Texas and Nevada may appear more flexible, but they have not been extensively tested, and their courts are not as experienced working with the larger entities that favor Delaware, Johnson said.

In May, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation providing greater securities for corporate officers and adding restrictions to shareholder records requests. The bill also allows corporations to require an ownership threshold, no more than 3% in outstanding shares, before a shareholder can initiate a derivative lawsuit, typically on behalf of the company and against its own board or directors. 

Restrictions on who can initiate such lawsuits are not uncommon, but Texas' implementation imposes a ‚Äúfar higher barrier than the norm,‚Äù Ahdieh said.

Consumer advocates worry the changes endanger shareholder and investor protections by giving owners and directors more protection against lawsuits that could hold them accountable if they violate their fiduciary duty.

For businesses, the changes mean potentially saving millions of dollars in shareholder lawsuit settlements and legal fees by mitigating the likelihood of those costly cases reaching court. For the states, attracting the companies means millions in business activity and revenue from regulatory filing and court case fees and taxes.

Eyeing a piece of that, Oklahoma is on pace to establish its recently approved business courts in 2026. 

‚ÄúI'm trying to take down Delaware,‚Äù said Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican. ‚ÄúWe want to be the most business-friendly state.‚Äù

Nevada wants to compete, too. It has run business dockets in Washoe and Clark counties since 2001, and it's in the state's interest to expand operations considering its fast-growing economy and population, said Benjamin Edwards, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas law professor who studies business and securities law.

But he said it could take decades to build up a court comparable to Delaware, which has a valuable reputation for handling cases relatively quickly. 

Nevada's proposed business court wouldn't take effect until 2028 at the earliest and would require amending the state constitution, which would need approval by the 2027 legislature and voter approval in 2028 to allow for the appointment of judges.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) ‚Äî The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.

The roadless rule adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.

The rule impeded road construction and ‚Äúresponsible timber production‚Äù that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.

‚ÄúThis move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,‚Äù Rollins said.

Scientists say that worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has allowed fuels to build up.

The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres (24 million hectares), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.

State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.

Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.




The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab. 

Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands. 

Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new ‚Äúera of abundance‚Äù on public lands under President Donald Trump's administration in the development of natural resources including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.

Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting ‚Äúnot for sale‚Äù and carrying signs that read, ‚ÄúThis land belongs to you and me‚Äù and ‚Äúkeep our public land free for future generations.‚Äù

On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas ‚Äúanother example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.‚Äù

The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.

Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.

‚ÄúAny attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,‚Äù Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.

Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.

‚ÄúThis is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,‚Äù Hamby said in a statement.

In Alaska, home to the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.

During the latter part of Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.

Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.

The Tongass is a temperate rainforest of glaciers and rugged coastal islands. It provides habitat to wildlife such as bears, wolves, salmon and bald eagles.

NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Their chances of becoming the next mayor of New York City may have dimmed. Their mission now? Stopping former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from getting to City Hall.

In the final day of campaigning before the city's Democratic primary, candidates who are seen as longer shots to win the nomination urged voters to leave Cuomo off their ballots in the city's ranked choice election in a last-ditch effort to block the former governor's comeback from a sexual harassment scandal.

‚ÄúLet's make sure Andrew Cuomo gets nowhere near City Hall,‚Äù candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said Monday on WNYC radio, which interviewed the major candidates ahead of the election.

State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, another candidate, similarly asked voters not to vote for Cuomo, telling the station, ‚ÄúWe need fresh leadership, we need to turn the page and we need bold solutions at this moment.‚Äù

The pitches came as Cuomo, who has been considered the frontrunner for months, has been trying to fend off a charge from Zohran Mamdani ahead of Tuesday's election.

Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, would be the city's first Muslim and first Indian American mayor if elected. A democratic socialist who got elected to the Legislature in 2020, Mamdani started the campaign as a relative unknown but has won support with a energetic campaign centered on improving the cost of living.

He spent part the second-to-last day of the campaign visiting businesses and potential voters in northern Manhattan, followed by a crowd of supporters and a man banging a drum.




‚ÄúThis is the most expensive city in the United States of America and New Yorkers are tired of having to worry each and every hour of each and every day of whether they can afford to live here,‚Äù said Mamdani.

Cuomo spoke at a union hall, where he warned Democrats against both radicalism and picking a candidate without experience.

‚ÄúThis is not a job for a novice. This is not a job for a person who never really had a job before,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúWe need someone who knows what they are doing on day one, because your lives depend on it.‚Äù

Mamdani, meanwhile, exuded confidence, telling WNYC he is ‚Äúone day from toppling a political dynasty.‚Äù

Mamdani and Cuomo represent the Democratic Party's ideological divides, with Cuomo as an older moderate and Mamdani a younger progressive.

Former President Bill Clinton endorsed Cuomo on Sunday, saying voters should not ‚Äúunderestimate the complexity‚Äù of the challenges faced by a mayor. The New York Times didn't issue an endorsement this year, but wrote an editorial praising Lander and saying Cuomo would be a better choice than Mamdani, who it said was unworthy of being on people's ballots.

Mamdani has been endorsed by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.

The two candidates' reactions to the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites on Sunday offered more evidence of the party's internal split.

Cuomo, in a statement, criticized ‚Äúthe way Trump went about this without consulting Congress, without consulting the normal congressional officials‚Äù but stressed that ‚ÄúIran cannot have nuclear capability.‚Äù

Mamdani released a statement that slammed Trump but quickly shifted focus back to his key issues, saying ‚Äúthese actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within.‚Äù

Cuomo, who won three terms as governor, resigned in 2021 after a report from the state attorney general concluded that he sexually harassed 11 women. He has denied wrongdoing.

New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters, that person wins the race outright. If nobody hits that threshold, the votes are then tabulated in multiple rounds. After each round, the candidate in last place is eliminated. Votes cast for that person are then redistributed to the candidates ranked next on the voter's ballot.

That continues until one candidate gets a majority.

Cuomo's opponents have urged voters not to rank him at all and therefore deprive him of support in later rounds of counting. 

Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) ‚Äî A Republican-sponsored proposal before Congress to mandate the sale of federal public lands received a mixed reception Monday from the governors of Western states.

A budget proposal from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee would mandate the sale of more than 3,125 square miles (8,093 square kilometers) of federal lands to state or other entities. It was included recently in a draft provision of the GOP's sweeping tax cut package.

At a summit Monday of Western state governors, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the approach is problematic in New Mexico because of the close relationship residents have with those public lands.

‚ÄúI'm open‚Äù to the idea, said Lujan Grisham, a second-term Democratic governor and former congresswoman. ‚ÄúExcept here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness, and they belong to all of us,‚Äù said Lujan Grisham, who was announcing written recommendations Monday on affordable housing strategies from the Western Governors' Association. ‚ÄúAnd selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, for at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.‚Äù

Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum was among the leaders from several federal agencies who attended the meeting that runs through Tuesday. He has touted the many potential uses for public lands that include recreation, logging and oil and gas production, saying it could boost local economies.

Several hundred protesters in downtown Santa Fe denounced efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting ‚Äúnot for sale‚Äù and carrying signs reading ‚ÄúThis land belongs to you and me‚Äù and ‚Äúkeep our public land free for future generations.‚Äù




Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon voiced qualified support for plans to tap federal land for development.

‚ÄúOn a piece-by-piece basis where states have the opportunity to craft policies that make sense ... we can actually allow for some responsible growth in areas with communities that are landlocked at this point,‚Äù he said at a news conference outside the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. ‚ÄúThere may be value there.‚Äù

Lee has said federal land sales under his proposal would target ‚Äúisolated parcels‚Äù that could be used for housing or infrastructure, and would not include national parks, national monuments or wilderness.

Land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would be eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected.

In some states, such as Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) ‚Äî U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ‚Äúcomplete and total ceasefire‚Äù soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for the American bombing of its nuclear sites. But the status of a possible ceasefire remained tentative after an Iranian missile barrage struck Israel after a first deadline for the proposal.




The Iranian barrages sent Israelis hurrying into bomb shelters as the sun rose, killing at least four people and injuring eight others, Israel's Magen David Adom rescue services said. Israel has yet to acknowledge Trump's proposal, which gives Israel more time to potentially strike back though Iran on its state television announced an overall ceasefire had begun at 7:30 a.m. local time.

In Beersheba, first responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. The streets around the impact site were littered with glass and debris, windows were blown out of buildings as anxious neighbors stood outside their damaged houses. Three people were rescued from nearby buildings.

The direct hit in the largest city in southern Israel came just days after the city's hospital sustained significant damage in a missile strike.

The Israeli military said people could leave bomb shelters but cautioned the public to stay close to shelter for the coming hours.




Trump's announcement that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ‚Äúcomplete and total ceasefire‚Äù came soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for the American bombing of its nuclear sites. Israel has not acknowledged the Trump ceasefire announcement.

Trump's announcement on Truth Social said the ceasefire beginning about midnight Washington time would bring an ‚ÄúOfficial END‚Äù to the war.

Writing over an hour after the first phase of the tentative ceasefire, which called for Iran to halt its attacks, Trump added: ‚ÄúTHE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!‚Äù

Israel did not immediately acknowledge any ceasefire, but there were no reports of Israeli strikes in Iran after 4 a.m. in Tehran. Heavy Israeli strikes continued in Iranian cities until shortly before that time. Israel in other conflicts has stepped up its strikes just before ceasefires took effect.

‚ÄúAs of now, there is NO ‚Äòagreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,‚Äù Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a post on X. ‚ÄúHowever, provided that the Israeli regime stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people no later than 4 am Tehran time, we have no intention to continue our response afterwards.‚Äù

His message was posted at 4:16 a.m. Tehran time. Araghchi added: ‚ÄúThe final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later.‚Äù

The Israeli military declined to comment on Trump's ceasefire statement and the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. 

Trump gave the conflict between Israel and Iran a name: the ‚Äú12 Day War.‚Äù That recalls the 1967 Mideast war, known by some as the ‚ÄúSix Day War,‚Äù in which Israel fought a group of Arab countries including Egypt, Jordan and Syria.

Trump's reference carries emotional weight for the Arab world, particularly Palestinians. In the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Though Israel later gave the Sinai back to Egypt, it still holds the other territories.

Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the ceasefire, according to a senior White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss the Monday talks. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff communicated with the Iranians through direct and indirect channels.

The White House has maintained that the Saturday bombing helped get the Israelis to agree to the ceasefire and that the Qatari government helped to broker the deal.

It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. He said earlier on social media that he would not surrender. 

Iran attacked a U.S. base in Qatar on Monday, but appeared to indicate it was prepared to reduce tensions. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties, said Trump, who dismissed the attack as a ‚Äúvery weak response.‚Äù

Qatar condemned the attack on Al Udeid Air Base as ‚Äúa flagrant violation‚Äù of its sovereignty, airspace and international law. Qatar said it intercepted all but one missile, though it was not clear if that missile caused any damage.

Iran said the volley matched the number of bombs dropped by the United States on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Iran also said it targeted the base because it was outside of populated areas.

Qatar Maj. Gen. Shayeq Al Hajri said 19 missiles were fired at the base that is home to the Combined Air Operations Center, which provides command and control of air power across the region, as well as the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, the largest such wing in the world. Trump said 14 missiles were fired, 13 were knocked down and one was ‚Äúset free‚Äù because it posed no threat.

Iran announced the attack on state television, with a caption calling it ‚Äúa mighty and successful response‚Äù to ‚ÄúAmerica's aggression.‚Äù

Earlier reports that a missile was launched at a base housing American forces in Iraq were a false alarm, a senior U.S. military official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said debris from a malfunctioning Iranian missile targeting Israel had triggered an alert of an impending attack on the Ain al-Assad base.

By early Tuesday, Qatar Airways resumed its flights after Qatar shut down its airspace over the Iranian attack on Al Udeid Air Base. Flight-tracking data showed commercial aircraft again flying in Qatari airspace, signaling Doha believed the threat on the energy-rich nation had passed.

The Israel Airport Authority said that the barrages from Iran forced them to close the country's skies for sevearl hours to all passenger planes that were expected to land and depart, including emergency flights.

Some flights were forced to circle over the Mediterranean Sea, according to Israeli media.

Israel's airports have been closed since the war with Iran began, but a handful of emergency flights had started arriving and departing over the past few days.

Israel and Iran traded barrages early Tuesday morning.

Iran struck Israel with missiles and drones while Israel said it attacked ‚Äúregime targets and government repression bodies in the heart of Tehran.‚Äù

In Tehran, Israel hit the headquarters of the military force that suppressed recent protests and blew open a gate at Evin prison, which is known for holding political activists.

Iranian state television aired footage it said was shot inside Evin, with prisoners under control. However, the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said many families of detainees ‚Äúhave expressed deep concern about the safety and condition of their loved ones‚Äù in the prison.

The Israeli military also confirmed it struck roads around Iran's Fordo enrichment facility to obstruct access to the site. The underground site was one of those hit in Sunday's attack by the United States. The Israeli military did not elaborate.

In Vienna, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said he expected there to be heavy damage at the Fordo facility following Sunday's U.S. airstrike there with sophisticated bunker-buster bombs.

Several Iranian officials, including Atomic Energy Organization of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, have claimed Iran removed nuclear material from targeted sites ahead of time.

Israeli officials insisted they did not seek the overthrow of Iran's government, their archenemy since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

But the latest strikes unfolded only hours after Trump himself mentioned the possibility of regime change a day after inserting America into the war with its stealth-bomber strike on three Iranian nuclear sites.

‚ÄúIf the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???‚Äù he asked on his Truth Social website. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later described Trump as ‚Äúsimply raising a question.‚Äù

Before the news of a ceasefire, an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss high-level internal deliberations, said Israel aimed to wind down the war in the coming days, but that it would depend on the Iranians.

Israel's preferred outcome is for Iran to agree to a ceasefire and reenter negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program, the official said. But Israel is prepared for the possibility of an extended low-intensity war of attrition or period of ‚Äúquiet for quiet,‚Äù in which it would closely monitor Iran's activities and strike if it identifies new threats.

In Israel, at least 24 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the war. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.

The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest such as the protests surrounding the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel.

The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.

There are roughly 700,000 American citizens, most of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, believed to be in Israel.

A visibly frustrated President Donald Trump said he is ""not happy"" with Israel for threatening the fragile ceasefire with Iran, as he said both countries ""don't know what the f*** they're doing.""

Former Cincinnati Reds shortstop Zack Cozart backtracked on his criticism of President Donald Trump and his plan to intervene in Iran and strike the country's nuclear facilities.

Cozart, a one-time All-Star, wrote on social media last week that he would ""no longer support"" the president if the U.S. was dragged into a war with Iran and Israel. However, after the president announced that a ceasefire agreement had been reached, Cozart fired off a new reaction.

""I'll gladly eat my words for what has transpired today‚Ä¶ lesson learned to trust the man,"" he wrote on X.

Cozart was far from the only person in the sports world to heap praise on Trump after Iran's retaliatory attack on a U.S. base in Qatar failed to do much of anything.

Auburn Tigers men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl wrote on social media that Trump should earn the Nobel Peace Prize.

""This is what a peace maker and the leader of the free world does, he steps in when both sides can't agree and he gives them an offer they can't refuse,"" the college basketball coach wrote on X. ""He should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. I pray that all sides can offer some grace and keep the peace.""

Trump on Tuesday made his way to a NATO summit while the ceasefire between Iran and Israel hung in the balance. He told the two countries to quit firing missiles at each other after the deal was brokered.

""I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning,"" Trump told reporters before he left.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to 'Sunday Morning Futures' following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites and why the Iranian regime underestimated President Trump.

The Trump administration's successful surprise strikes on Iran on Saturday night were executed without issue after the National Security Council saw massive overhauls earlier in 2025, and the national security advisor was replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to fulfill an additional job role that critics said would likely end in failure. 

President Donald Trump made a surprise announcement on Truth Social Saturday evening announcing the U.S. military carried out successful strikes on a trio of Iranian nuclear facilities as tensions and conflict heightened between Iran and Israel since June 12. 

""A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan,"" Trump said from the White House in an address to the nation just hours after the Truth Social announcement. ""Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success."" 

By Monday evening, Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire with Trump declaring the ""12 Day War"" was over following the U.S. strikes. 

The operation, which was also praised by Pentagon brass as a total success, was executed after the Trump administration slashed the National Security Council and replaced former national security advisor Mike Waltz with Rubio, who currently serves four different roles within the administration. 

Democratic lawmakers and former National Security Council staffers seethed against potential and finalized cuts to the council, alleging that Trump was politicizing and potentially crippling national security. 

TRUMP TO MEET WITH SECURITY TEAM AFTER US CARRIED OUT 'OPERATION MIDNIGHT HAMMER'

The Trump administration and its supporters, however, viewed the overhauls as the president coming through on his campaign promise to strip Washington of the ""deep state"" and streamline the office. 

The National Security Council operates within the White House to advise the president on foreign policy issues. 

It is chaired by the president, with other members including the vice president, the secretaries of state, treasury and defense, and the assistant to the president for national security affairs. Other staffers on the council include foreign policy experts who frequently join the team on loan from the Pentagon or State Department.

The Trump administration has made a handful of cuts to the National Security Council since Inauguration Day, most notably trimming roughly half of the National Security Council's 350-person team in May, Fox Digital previously reported. Waltz, who served as Trump's national security advisor for roughly 100 days, was removed from the post May 1 and named Trump's nominee to serve as ambassador to the U.N. following a Signal chat leak with a journalist. 

PENTAGON FLEXES US MILITARY'S DECOYS AND STRATEGIC DECEPTION THAT TOOK IRAN AND WORLD BY SURPRISE

Following Waltz's departure, Trump named Rubio as his acting national security advisor, and he carried out a massive overhaul to the office, including trimming it of more than 100 staffers ahead of Memorial Day.

""The NSC is the ultimate Deep State. It's Marco vs. the Deep State. We're gutting the Deep State,"" a White House official told Axios in May as Rubio took a hatchet to the NSC staff. 

A White House official told Fox Digital on Monday that Rubio's joint roles have allowed for ""greater coordination between the State Department and White House,"" which they said has led to ""more efficient execution of the president's foreign policy agenda."" 

Democrats, however, predicted that Rubio serving simultaneously as chief of the State Department and Trump's national security advisor, would prove to be a failure. They argued that he would be unable to juggle the high-profiled roles, in addition to serving as acting archivist of the U.S., as well as acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

""There's no way he can do that and do it well, especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD with Pete Hegseth being secretary of defense and just the hollowing out of the top leadership,"" Illinois Democrat Sen. Tammy Duckworth said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" last month. ""There's no way he can carry all that entire load on his own.""

Fast-forward less than two months; Trump and his national security team executed ""Operation Midnight Hammer"" in Iran, which has received widespread support among Republicans and a handful of Democrats. Historic critics of the president, such as Democrat New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, however, have railed against the operation as bypassing congressional authority. 

""The success of Operation Midnight Hammer speaks to the unmatched capabilities of the United States military, as well as President Trump's brilliant foreign policy strategy, which included working closely with his national security team to flawlessly execute this mission and obliterate Iran's ability to possess a nuclear weapon,"" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told Fox Digital on Monday. 

""As usual, Democrats and the legacy media were wrong ‚Äì President Trump has rightfully placed immense trust in his top officials, including Secretary Rubio, Secretary Hegseth, and Director Gabbard, to help him make the world safer,"" she added. 

Trump repeatedly met with the National Security Council and other administration leaders between June 12 and last Saturday, when the strikes were ordered on Iran. 

Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Vice President JD Vance were fixtures of the discussions, with photos showing them criss-crossing in and out of the White House last week as they reported to the Situation Room to meet with the president. The trio of U.S. officials flanked Trump as he addressed the nation about the operation Saturday night. 

The White House sees a ""substantial chance"" for renewed negotiations with Iran. 

""For 40 years, Iran has been saying, ‚ÄòDeath to America. Death to Israel.' They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs,"" Trump said in his address Saturday with the trio standing behind him. ""That was their specialty. We lost over a thousand people, and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and around the world have died as a direct result of their hate, in particular.""

""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated,"" Trump said. ""And Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks would be far greater and a lot easier."" 

The operation itself was cloaked in secrecy and took Iran and the world by surprise. Trump had said on Thursday ‚Äì via comment from press secretary Karoline Leavitt ‚Äì that he would make a decision on Iran within two weeks, which signaled a longer time frame than 48 hours for such a mission. 

RETIRED GENERAL TELLS CNN HE'S 'IMPRESSED' BY TRUMP STRIKING IRAN, SAYS AMERICAN LIVES POTENTIALLY SAVED

There were no media leaks or speculation that such strikes were imminent, while earlier on Saturday, six B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri were spotted en route to a U.S. Air Force base in Guam, which signaled the U.S. was likely making moves on Iran, but not in just mere hours from when news broke of the stealth bombers. The bombers were later revealed to be decoys. 

Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a press conference Sunday from the Pentagon, where they celebrated that strategic deception and misdirection played a key role in the operation. 

""At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprised of bombers launched from the continental United States,"" Caine said on Sunday. ""As part of the plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy ‚Äì a deception effort, known only to an extremely small number of planners and key leaders here in Washington and in Tampa."" 

TRUMP ADDRESSES NATION ON 'SPECTACULAR MILITARY SUCCESS' OF US STRIKES ON IRANIAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES

Hegseth said in his remarks before the media Sunday morning that the U.S. military had leveraged ""misdirection"" and total secrecy, aside from top national security officials, to carry out the strikes ""without the world knowing at all.""

""It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security. Our B-2s went in and out of‚Ä¶ these nuclear sites, in and out and back, without the world knowing at all,"" Hegseth said. ""In that way, it was historic.""

It was the longest B-2 spirit bomber mission since 2001, the second-longest B-2 mission ever flown and the largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history, Hegseth and Caine said during the Sunday press conference. 

Rubio spoke to the media on Sunday morning shows, telling ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo that the ""most important thing"" Iran should realize following the strikes is ""the game is up"" and it's time for peace. 

""They have played the world for 40-something years with these nuclear talks and delaying things‚Ä¶ they're not going to play President Trump, and they found out last night that when he says he's going to do something, he'll do it. And he doesn't want to do it. It's not his first choice, but it's the only choice. That's the choice the Iranian regime left us, because they play too many games,"" he said. 

Trump celebrated on Monday evening in another Truth Social post that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire deal and that the 12 Day War had ended.

""On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ""THE 12 DAY WAR."" This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't, and never will! God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!"" he wrote. 

Tensions are still flared in the Middle East, as both Israel and Iran accuse each other of violating the ceasefire on Tuesday morning, with Trump urging them to put down their weapons while triumphantly declaring Iran's nuclear capabilities have been crippled.

The Oklahoma City Thunder are the 2024/25 NBA Champions following a 103-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers. Tyrese Haliburton suffered a game-ending injury in the 1st quarter. Nick Wright, Chris Broussard, and Kevin Wildes look back at the series ...

Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton made a candid social media post reflecting on the team's NBA Finals loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder and the torn Achilles he suffered in Game 7.

Haliburton made a late-night post on X with a lengthy statement and a photo of himself in a hospital bed. It came more than 24 hours after he was seen writhing in pain on the floor at the Paycom Center.

""Man. Don't know how to explain it other than shock. Words cannot express the pain of this letdown. The frustration is unfathomable. I've worked my whole life to get to this moment and this is how it ends? Makes no sense,"" he wrote.

""Now that I've gotten surgery, I wish I could count the number of times people will tell me I'm going to ‚Äòcome back stronger'. What a cliche lol, this s--- sucks. My foot feels like dead weight fam. But what's hurting most I think is my mind. Feel like I'm rambling, but I know this is something I'll look back on when I'm through this, as something I'm proud I fought through. It feels good to let this s--- out without y'all seeing the kid ugly cry.

""At 25, I've already learned that God never gives us more than we can handle. I know I'll come out on the other side of this a better man and a better player. And honestly, right now, torn Achilles and all, I don't regret it. I'd do it again, and again after that, to fight for this city and my brothers. For the chance to do something special.""

THREE ACHILLES INJURIES IN ONE NBA POSTSEASON: WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW IS IT FIXED?

Haliburton apologized to the city of Indianapolis for letting fans down, though he did nothing of the sort.

He delivered one of the most epic playoff performances in recent memory as he broke the hearts of fans in Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York on his way to the NBA Finals. He nearly did it in Oklahoma City if it was not for a calf strain that hampered him as well as the torn Achilles.

""Indy, I'm sorry. If any fan base doesn't deserve this, it's y'all. But together we are going to fight like hell to get back to this very spot, and get over this hurdle,"" he added. ""I don't doubt for a second that y'all have my back, and I hope you guys know that I have yours. I think Kobe said it best when in this same situation. There are far greater issues/challenges in the world then a torn achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever."" And that's exactly right. I will do everything in my power to get back right.

""My journey to get to where I am today wasn't by happenstance, I've pushed myself every day to be great. And I will continue to do just that. The most important part of this all, is that I'm grateful. I'm grateful for every single experience that's led me here. I'm grateful for all the love from the hoop world. I don't ‚Äòhave to' go through this, I get to go through this. I'm grateful for the road that lies ahead. Watch how I come back from this. So, give me some time, I'll dust myself off and get right back to being the best version of Tyrese Haliburton.""

Haliburton is reportedly likely to miss the 2025-26 season as well.

President Donald Trump spoke to reporters Tuesday before departing for a NATO summit, saying that Israel and Iran ""don't know what the **** they're doing"" following his declaration of a ceasefire.

President Donald Trump expressed deep frustration with both Israel and Iran on Tuesday, saying the two countries ""don't know what the **** they're doing.""

Trump made the comments while departing from the White House for a NATO summit Tuesday morning. Both Israel and Iran fired missiles at one another following the imposition of a ceasefire on Monday night.

""I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning,"" Trump said.

He continued, ""We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the **** they're doing."" 

""I'm gonna see if I can stop it,"" he added.

ISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT: LIVE UPDATES

""ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social shortly after boarding Marine One.

Minutes later, he announced that Israel was canceling its plans for an attack Tuesday morning.

""ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‚ÄòPlane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect! Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he wrote.

He then topped it off with a post stating: ""IRAN WILL NEVER REBUILD THEIR NUCLEAR FACILITIES!""

Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran on Monday night, dubbing the conflict a ""12-day war.""

Qatar's prime minister secured Iran's agreement to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire after Iran's limited strikes on America's Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL AND IRAN 'HAVE TO FIGHT IT OUT' BUT BELIEVES DEAL IS POSSIBLE

A senior Israeli official told Fox News on Tuesday that Iran had launched two missiles toward Israel following the announcement of the ceasefire ""and we believe they are trying to fire more in the next couple of hours.""

""Unfortunately, the Iranians have decided to continue to fire toward Israel,"" the official said to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent  Trey Yingst after Trump unveiled the deal Monday.

""Now we will have to retaliate, this will happen of course,"" the official added. ""It could end within several hours, but they [the Iranians] need to make a decision.""

Caitlin Clark was fouled hard during the Indiana Fever's 88-71 victory over the Connecticut Sun. Colin Cowherd says this is great for the WNBA and Caitlin Clark's career and he discusses how she's impacted the league. 

Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham started out last Wednesday with just over 300,000 TikTok followers coming off a heated game against the Connecticut Sun, which saw her get ejected when she doled out some retribution before the buzzer sounded.

The moment she tussled with Sun guard Jacy Sheldon, who had poked Caitlin Clark in the eye earlier in the game, she became an instant sensation. Cunningham had previously gone viral before for her outfit choices while she was with the Phoenix Mercury. However, even she may admit that she never saw her popularity soar as it did over the last six days.

On Saturday, Cunningham surpassed more than 1 million followers on TikTok and thanked her newfound fans for their appreciation.

""should buy yall a beer or 2! Cheeeers friends,"" she captioned a video.

As of Tuesday morning, Cunningham had 1.4 million TikTok followers.

Cunningham gained huge favor for her apparent defense of Clark, who was not only poked in the face, but pushed to the floor in the team's win over the Sun.

She was fined for her actions following the foul on Sheldon and for the ejection, but she was adamant in her defense of Clark.

""During that, it was just part of the game. I think the refs had a lot to do with that. It was a build-up for a couple years now of them just not protecting the star player of the WNBA,"" Cunningham told reporters days after the team lost to the Golden State Valkyries. ""At the end of the day, I'm going to protect my teammates. That's what I do."" 

Ahead of Sunday's game against the Las Vegas Aces, Cunningham showed off her bond with Clark and fellow teammate Lexie Hull. She wore a shirt that read, ""Tres Leches.""

Chandler Jones, a former wide receiver who starred for the San Jose State Spartans and later for the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes, has died, the school announced on Monday.

He was 33.

Jones was identified as the victim in a pedestrian crash on the Marina Freeway in Los Angeles on Sunday, MyNewsLA.com reported, citing the Medical Examiner's Office. Authorities said Jones was struck and killed by a driver in a Toyota RAV4.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. local time. Jones was pronounced dead at the scene.

""Forever in our hearts, #89,"" San Jose State Football wrote on its X account. ""In loving memory of Spartan wide receiver and coach, Chandler Jones.""

Jones, a Los Angeles native, finished his collegiate career with the Spartans as the school's all-time leader in receptions (248) and touchdown catches (31). He was the only player in the school's history to record at least 50 receptions in each of his four seasons with the Spartans.

President Donald Trump stopped short of outright castigating Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday but suggested he is growing tired of Russia‚Äòs ongoing offensive against Ukraine.

Trump made the comments while flying to the Netherlands on Tuesday morning to attend the NATO summit. Though Trump's Saturday decision to launch airstrikes against Iran will likely overshadow this week's meeting of the NATO leaders, the treaty organization is expected to end the summit with a condemnation of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.

Trump has infuriated European leaders with his claims that both Ukraine and Russia bear responsibility for their three-year-plus war. However, in recent weeks, Trump has grown visibly frustrated with Putin as Russia has failed to commit to a lasting ceasefire.

‚ÄúWell, I'll have to take a look at it. But, you know, I'd like to see a deal with Russia,‚Äù Trump responded when asked Tuesday if he would sign on to a condemnation of Putin alongside the other NATO leaders. ‚ÄúAs you know, Vladimir called me up. He said, ‚ÄòCan I help you with Iran?' I said, ‚ÄòNo, I don't need help with Iran. I need help with you,' and I hope we're going to be getting a deal done with Russia.‚Äù

During that same Q&A session, Trump notably declined to fully uphold NATO's Article 5 on the mutual defense of NATO member states.

‚ÄúIt depends on your definition. There's numerous definitions of Article Five,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúYou know that, right? But I'm committed to being their friend. You know, I've become friends with many of those leaders, and I'm committed to helping them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm committed to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety,‚Äù he clarified later in the briefing. ‚ÄúAnd I'm going to give you an exact definition when I get there. I just don't want to do it on the back of an airplane.‚Äù

Republicans are staring down more complications this week with their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, this time from the Senate's parliamentarian, who ruled against several provisions that they included to win over conservative support.

The House narrowly passed the tax and spending legislation last month after weeks of fierce negotiations. Now the bill is in the Senate, where parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has ruled that specific provisions cannot pass using the special legislative process that allows Republicans to skirt the filibuster.

The changes forced by the parliamentarian threaten Republican leadership's vote tally on the bill, especially among conservatives who demand spending cuts. Many such lawmakers were already apprehensive about the bill because it does not sufficiently cut spending.

Usually, Republicans would need 60 votes in the Senate to pass this legislation. Advertently, Republicans are moving President Donald Trump's tax and border agenda through reconciliation, a legislative process that allows bills to bypass the filibuster and pass with only a simple majority in the Senate.

However, only specific matters are included in a reconciliation bill. The parliamentarian goes through the legislation and ensures its provisions comply with the Byrd Rule, which requires reconciliation to focus solely on fiscal matters and allows senators in the minority to raise a point of order if they believe there is ‚Äúextraneous matter‚Äù in the bill.

Some notable measures are already on the chopping block, threatening Republican votes. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), a fiscal hawk, took to social media Monday and branded MacDonough's changes to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as ‚ÄúNOT GOOD.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe OBBB is now 1) increasing deficits a LOT than the House bill, 2) watering down termination of the Green New Scam to less than 50%, 3) watering down food stamp reforms, 4) taking out HSA expansion, 5) gutting our (weak) effort to stop rogue judges, & 6) more‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ NOT GOOD,‚Äù Roy said.

One notable measure MacDonough ruled will not survive the so-called ‚ÄúByrd bath‚Äù is a provision to cut funding from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. According to congressional Democrats, that would have cut some $6.4 billion in funding for the agency.

Some Republicans also hoped to slip in provisions related to the REINS Act, which would give Congress more power over the federal bureaucracy and rulemaking. However, MacDonough cut a reworked version of the REINS Act that Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) had pushed for.

‚ÄúMoving in the wrong direction,‚Äù Lee said on Monday about the parliamentarian's rulings.

MacDonough's team also ruled against a GOP plan to make states pay a portion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, expenses in another blow for conservatives. The House version of that plan would have saved $130 billion.

The parliamentarian also ruled against a provision that would have prevented noncitizens from receiving SNAP benefits, with Democrats arguing that such a measure would violate the Byrd Rule. If it had not been on the chopping block, that would have been another $4 billion in savings.

The Senate parliamentarian also ruled against a Republican effort to restrict the power of federal judges to block Trump administration policies with preliminary injunctions.

Likewise, MacDonough ruled against cutting some $1.4 billion in pay for staff at the Federal Reserve.

Taken together, MacDonough's and her team's highly anticipated rulings are a big setback for Republicans, who are working to whip as much support from conservatives as they can for the legislation, with slim margins.

And the parliamentarian isn't done yet. MacDonough will go through other provisions in the coming days.

The bulk of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act extends or permanently implements the tax cuts that were part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and implements some of Trump's new tax priorities. Republicans have yet to make their final arguments to MacDonough on the Finance Committee language.

As the rulings and changes continue, especially if unfavorable to Republicans, more lawmakers might speak out about the process.

For instance, on Monday, Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO) accused MacDonough of being politically biased and called for her to be ‚Äúoverruled or fired.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Senate parliamentarian decided that a ban on illegal aliens receiving food stamps did not fit the ‚ÄòByrd rule,'‚Äù Onder said. ‚ÄúIt is pretty clear that this woman is not an impartial arbiter, but a liberal activist. She should be overruled or fired.‚Äù

TRUMP'S ‚ÄòBIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' GETS SMALLER AS SENATE REFEREE STRIKES GOP PRIORITIES

And if MacDonough keeps peeling away at provisions in the bill that Republicans included to save money and make the deficit hit of reconciliation more palatable to fiscal hawks, it could spell trouble for the overall bill, or at least make it more challenging for Republican leadership to get it to Trump's desk.

The rulings also come as Republicans try to pass the bill in the Senate before July 4th.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The House Democratic Steering Committee recommended Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) to be the next top Democrat on the powerful House Oversight Committee ahead of the caucus vote Tuesday morning. 

Four House Democrats, Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), Stephen Lynch (D-MA), Kweisi Mfume (D-MD), and Garcia entered the June 24 race to be named the next top dog on House Oversight and Government Reform after former Democratic Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly died last month of cancer. Since Connolly's death, 70-year-old Lynch, the most senior member on the panel, has been the acting ranking member.

The contenders for the job appeared before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee Monday evening, and then made recommendations ahead of the caucus votes Tuesday morning to solidify the top member. The members of the committee were allotted questioning time for these four members ahead of casting their votes, but the fight for the top spot will not be secured until the full caucus votes. 

Last year, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) came up short behind Connolly after a contentious race for the ranking spot on the committee. Despite not receiving the recommendation of the Steering Committee, Ocasio-Cortez still moved full steam ahead in her campaign for the caucus vote.

Ocasio-Cortez still came up short during the full caucus vote, however, and does not currently hold a seat on the Oversight Committee, as she now sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee this Congress, which opened the path for these four members to make their case. 

As Democrats search for messaging that will stick leading into the 2026 midterm elections, this spot has given a glimpse of a middle ground between the younger generation and seniority that usually takes precedence in the House.

Garcia, who won on the first vote, ran on the notion of generational changes in the party, but was careful with his push to still attract members of the caucus who value seniority. The 47-year-old sophomore served as the mayor of Long Beach, California, from 2014 to 2022 before being sworn into Congress. 

Garcia was the only member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus eyeing the seat, while two members, Mfume and Crockett, are both part of the Congressional Black Caucus. All three of these members are part of the Progressive Cause led by 35-year-old Chairman Greg Casar (D-TX), likely splitting the caucus on the secret ballot, if they continue ahead with their bids.

‚ÄúWe showed that government can be both progressive and effective,‚Äù Garcia wrote in his Dear Colleague letter announcing his bid. ‚ÄúDriven by values powered by innovation, and always working with the people we serve.‚Äù

The job's focus is countering GOP investigations into former President Joe Biden and other political investigations pursued by Chairman James Comer (R-KY).","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The New York mayoral candidate's defense of ‚ÄúGlobalize the intifada‚Äù is very telling.

Zohran Mamdani's opponents paint him as a dangerous radical. The young, socialistic candidate for New York City mayor wishes to dispel that perception‚Äîin some ways. Last week, he appeared on a podcast with The Bulwark's Tim Miller, a former Republican and the sort of moderate Mamdani knows he needs to win over, or at least neutralize, if he is to carry this week's Democratic primary. As Miller presented a litany of concerns about Mamdani's plans to freeze stabilized-housing rent, establish city-run groceries, and other offenses against Econ 101, the candidate expressed a willingness to hinge his policies on outcomes and abandon his plans if they failed.

But when Miller asked Mamdani about the pro-Palestine slogan ‚ÄúGlobalize the intifada,‚Äù the candidate's pragmatism and intellectual humility evaporated. ‚ÄúTo me, ultimately, what I hear in so many is a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,‚Äù he said.

Mamdani may sincerely believe this, as do some of his supporters. But he then delved into the semantics of intifada, citing the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's use of the word as the translation of ‚Äúuprising‚Äù in an Arabic version of an article the museum published about the Warsaw Ghetto. This comparison, to a Jewish armed rebellion against the Nazis, hardly dispels concern about the incendiary implications of the slogan. If the intifada is akin to the ghetto uprising, then it is a call for violence. If its theater of operations is global, then it is necessarily directed against civilians. Days before the Democratic primary, when Mamdani appeared to be gaining momentum, the controversy about his comments on Miller's show dragged the race's focus back to the Middle East, a subject that Mamdani has not emphasized in his campaign. Yet this debate has largely missed the significance. What makes the slogan so disturbing in an American context is not the intifada bit. It's the globalize part.

An unfortunate spillover effect of the war between Israel and Hamas is its extension into U.S. politics. If we are heading toward a future in which even candidates for local office in the United States run on their position toward the Middle East, American politics will come to resemble that intractable conflict. The pluralist alternative is to confine conflict over Palestine and Israel to any national elected office that could have actual influence on U.S. foreign policy. Everybody needs to be willing to live with a mayor who does not share their personal solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Mamdani's defense of globalizing the intifada has spurred more commentary about his left-wing views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But his beliefs about Israel are not the concern. The intifada is taking place inside Israel and the occupied territories. Globalizing the intifada definitionally involves events outside that region.

Jeffrey Goldberg: Sinwar's march of folly

Even if globalizing the intifada doesn't have to mean global violence, that interpretation is plausible. Indeed, some people inspired by the free-Palestine movement do take the slogan literally. Supporters of the movement have engaged in harassment, graffiti, and violence and terrorism against Zionists worldwide. In recent months, pro-Palestine activists have carried out homicidal or potentially homicidal attacks in Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and Colorado.

The ambiguity of the slogan is not a point in its defense but a point against it. The dual meanings allow the movement to contain both peaceful and militant wings, without the former having to take responsibility for the latter. If activists refused to employ slogans that double as a form of violent incitement, it would insulate them from any association with the harassment and violence that has tainted their protests. Their failure to do so reveals an unwillingness to draw lines, as does Mamdani's reluctance to allow any daylight between him and their rhetoric.

Mamdani is neither stupid nor politically naive. He has backtracked on his previous support for defunding the police and, as mentioned, courted moderates (such as my colleague Derek Thompson, in an interview for the latest episode of his podcast, Plain English) by saying that his governing agenda would be driven by outcomes over ideology. If Mamdani is willing to absorb the political pain of tying himself to a slogan that many Jews find frightening, in an election in which they constitute a major voting bloc, his gloss on the slogan implies a genuine commitment to everything the slogan represents.

Mamdani insisted to Miller, evasively, that he won't repudiate globalizing the intifada because, as he put it, ‚Äúthe role of the mayor is not to police language.‚Äù Yet there's no rule in politics that says a mayor or a candidate can't criticize political rhetoric. Nor has Mamdani bound himself to such a prohibition: He has policed the terminology of his opponents by, for instance, complaining that he has faced ‚Äúdehumanizing language‚Äù as a Muslim candidate for office.

Mamdani defended himself by denouncing anti-Semitism in broad terms and painting his opponents as cynics for using imputed anti-Semitism as a political cudgel against him. This offers little reassurance. Almost everybody is willing to renounce anti-Semitism on the opposite side of the political spectrum. The far right is stuffed with philo-Semites, who are willing and eager to attack the scourge of Jew hatred so long as it is on the left, while ignoring or apologizing for the rise of anti-Semitism in their own ranks. The key test of principle‚Äîthe only test, really‚Äîis whether you are willing to call out your allies' hatred. Mamdani's refusal on this crucial point is a signal that he will downplay anti-Semitism when it springs from the pro-Palestine movement.

American Jews should be willing to accept a candidate for municipal office who does not share their views about the Middle East. (Arab and Muslim Americans have long been obliged to do so.) A candidate who does not take seriously an incitement to violence against other Americans, though, is not something anybody should have to accept.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The public doesn't like it when the president actually does something.

President Donald Trump is now the most unpopular he has been during his second term.

More than half of American adults disapprove of the job he is doing, and he's underwater on nearly every important issue of the day.

The polling averages show this net disapproval clearly: On the economy, he's down 13 percentage points. On inflation, he's down 20 points. Even on immigration, he's down 2 points. (Those negative marks include foreign policy, though it's too soon to say how the public is reacting to Trump's decision to join Israel's bombing of Iran.)

Still, Trump's popularity decline has been a dramatic development: After entering office with a positive approval rating and popular support for his agenda, he's squandered much of it away through various political fights, policy decisions, and public spectacles.

That reversal has come in fits and starts, yet also demonstrated a curious trend in Trump's popularity. When Trump is at the center of the news, using his bully pulpit and making high-profile efforts to pursue his agenda, his popularity falls. When he recedes into the background, and the public is focused elsewhere, his popularity somewhat recovers.

In short, the more people pay attention to Trump, the less they like him ‚Äî which creates a kind of conundrum. Trump, who's uniquely capable of capturing the limelight, has shown he's also incapable (or unwilling) to do anything quietly.

Immigration policy is the latest example of this trend. Public opinion turned sharply against Trump's response to protests in California over raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Views of his deployment of the National Guard and a few hundred US Marines to the West Coast have similarly been resoundingly negative. And overall views of Trump's immigration policy, as a result, have fallen to their lowest point this year, per tracking polls by YouGov.

Beyond any one policy, these trends in public opinion suggest that Trump is turbocharging two features of modern presidential politics. The first is the idea of negative polarization: that members of one political party are bound together and mobilize against an opposing political party or movement more strongly than for their own side. And the second is of the electorate as operating a thermostat: preferring the opposite opinion or direction to whatever the president, or party in power, says.

These shifts matter. They tell us a lot about Trump-era politics and about how modern American politics might exist after him. And they offer a clue as to how the public might react to American military involvement in the Middle East. Presidents tend to see a public boost ‚Äî a rally-around-the-flag effect ‚Äî when America gets involved in military conflicts. Will Trump's popularity rebound? Or will this be yet another example of Trump being different?

A quick scan of the last six months of Trump's job approval shows something remarkably consistent: Almost every time Trump makes a big policy move or announcement, the public recoils in disapproval.

This dynamic is most pronounced in three sharp spikes in disapproval: after Elon Musk and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency rampaged across the federal government, after the rollout of tariffs, and as Trump picked a fight in California over ICE deportations.

DOGE kicked off the downward slump in his approval rating and popular support for his policies, in mid-March. As Trump reined in Musk, and DOGE faced more obstacles and public scrutiny, it began to fade from headlines, and Trump's approval rating began to recover.

Then the cycle repeated. As Trump mulled a trade war and signaled he would implement a new tariff regime in late March and early April, views on his handling of inflation, trade, and the economy began to nosedive. Disapproval of his trade and tariff approach, in particular, spiked during the late-March to mid-April period when ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs were being announced and the stock market was roiled with instability and distrust.

Since Trump ratcheted down his policy and softened his public entrenchment on tariffs, his ratings have stabilized, and even recovered a bit, according to an average of polls maintained by the pollster Adam Carlson.

The same cycle would play out again when Trump turned his attention to immigration policy, historically his best issue. Views of his approach to immigration and mass deportations have been much more volatile since late March and mid-April, when high-profile arrests and detentions of foreign-born students and immigrants began to dominate the news. It was around this time that the legal showdowns over Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a's deportation to a Salvadoran prison dominated headlines, and public opinion over Trump's immigration approach began to turn negative. 

For most of the period from his inauguration to April, Trump had enjoyed positive ratings on immigration. His mass deportation pledges were still popular with most Americans. But hunkering down on those mid-spring decisions resulted in the public turning against Trump's position. His immigration ratings saw a dive, which only began to recover once Trump backed down and turned his priorities on Congress and his legislative agenda.

Like a switch, public opinion on immigration policy began to get more positive during a time when Trump wasn't really creating that much news around the topic, until ICE raids began to pick up steam and small protests began to erupt in Democratic cities. His aggressive response ‚Äî federalizing the National Guard and sending Marines to Southern California ‚Äî has again triggered a collapse in public views. According to YouGov, approval of Trump's handling of immigration is now the lowest it's been this year, and it is lower than it was at this point during his first term.

It's all a bit confusing: Trump is doing what he repeatedly promised to do during his campaign ‚Äî the same campaign that won him enough popular support for a second term in the White House. The public, however, is punishing him for it.

This weird seesaw of the public reacting negatively to big policy decisions Trump makes is a defining characteristic of modern politics. He isn't the first president to deal with a reflexively reactionary public, as both Joe Biden and Barack Obama experienced this during their presidencies. Both Democratic presidents saw drops in public support once they began to implement their agendas, be it the Affordable Care Act beginning in 2009, or Biden's legislative packages and Afghanistan withdrawal in the summer and fall of 2021.

And so Trump's two terms seem to fit this pattern, what some political scientists call the ‚Äúthermostatic‚Äù model of public opinion. This basic idea ‚Äî that public opinion shifts in the opposite direction of whatever direction the government takes ‚Äî is a powerful predictor, but it doesn't fully explain Trump's second term.

Just like you'd turn a thermostat's temperature up or down depending on the feeling in a room, the public reacts positively or negatively depending on the actions taken by a president and party in power.

Plenty of political research demonstrates this thermostat in action: the public supporting spending cuts when the government begins to spend more, the public growing more liberal on social issues when a conservative president seizes on it (as on immigration and racial justice during the Trump years), support for the Affordable Care Act rising when Republicans try to cut it. These anti-incumbent shifts then suggest future political advantage for the political party or movement out of power.

But just because the public is cooling on Trump, that doesn't mean it, so far, is warming to Democrats ‚Äî or even to liberal policy positions.

Public views of the Democratic Party are still resoundingly negative: a little more than a third of Americans have favorable views of the party or of Democrats in Congress, both lower than views of Republicans. Democrats only enjoy a slight advantage in generic polling ahead of midterms next year. And views toward immigration in general, for example, are still much more negative than they've been at any point since 9/11, per Gallup tracking data. The pro-immigrant shift the country saw during Trump's first term hasn't materialized this time.

With the US now embroiled in a highly fluid, quickly evolving conflict with Iran, it's not at all clear if this thermostatic trend is holding: There hasn't been enough time to definitively poll those views, and it's likely that many people are still forming their opinions.

According to a weekend snap poll conducted by YouGov, more Americans disapprove of US bombings of nuclear sites than approve, but about 1 in 5 are withholding forming an opinion as of now. That poll was conducted after Trump announced the military strikes but before Iran carried out its own wave of missile launches against US bases in Qatar and Iraq. And whatever kind of escalation or deescalation comes next will influence how public opinion shifts.

Still, there are reasons to think the anti-Trump trend will hold. Military action against Iran was already unpopular before the US got involved. Plenty of Americans were wary of Israel's preemptive strikes earlier this month as well. And many Republicans opposed US involvement in military conflicts in the Middle East before this weekend. Of course, many of those Republicans will likely sort themselves to align with the position of their party leader. But how long that holds is another question.

Any kind of rally-around-the-flag effect that might result from this conflict also doesn't seem likely to be durable, as of now. Presidents have tended to enjoy a small bump in approval when the US conducts highly visible military operations: It happened for both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush during the Gulf War and 9/11, and for Obama after the killing of Osama bin Laden.

But as the Democratic strategist Dan Pfeiffer has pointed out, these poll boosts have been getting smaller over time as the effect of polarization has grown. And Trump is already massively unpopular, meaning any boost he gets isn't likely to get him a majority of the country's support.

This news story seems likely to get bigger, particularly if Trump chooses to respond to Iran's retaliatory strike. And that will feed the key determinant of this public opinion trend: Whatever position Trump takes becomes the defining, totalizing news story of the day. For now, all other news stories seem to have taken a backseat to this military conflict. And when Trump dominates the news, this trend becomes clearer.

Of course, other things could happen. It will take time for the public to process these developments. And more domestic news will be coming in the months ahead, as massive tax, health insurance, and public assistance cuts included in Trump's reconciliation bill (the ‚Äúbig‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù one) have yet to become law and receive the same public scrutiny other Trump policy moves have. So there's a lot more to come. But for now, it seems like the public thermostat is working overtime.

The Court picked a hell of a time to give lawsuit immunity to federal law enforcement.

Last week, federal agents arrested Brad Lander, a Democrat running for mayor of New York City and the city's incumbent comptroller, after Lander linked arms with an immigrant the agents sought to detain and asked to see a warrant. Last month, federal officials also arrested Newark's Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka while Baraka was protesting at a detention facility for immigrants. 

A federal law permits sitting members of Congress to enter federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight responsibilities. That didn't stop the Trump administration from indicting Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who was at the same protest as Baraka. Federal officers also detained and handcuffed Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) after he tried to ask Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem questions at a press conference.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

These arrests are part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to step up deportations, and to intimidate protesters who object. Most of these incidents are recent enough that the courts have not had time to sort through what happened and determine whether anyone's constitutional rights were violated. But one thing is all but certain: even if it turns out that federal law enforcement officers flagrantly and deliberately targeted protesters or elected officials, violating the Constitution's First or Fourth Amendment, nothing will happen to those officers.

The reason why is a pair of fairly recent Supreme Court decisions, which make it nearly impossible to sue a federal officer if they violate your constitutional rights ‚Äî even if the allegations against that officer are truly shocking. In Hern√°ndez v. Mesa (2020), the Court's Republican majority gave lawsuit immunity to a US Border Patrol officer who fatally shot a Mexican teenager in the face. And in Egbert v. Boule (2022), the majority reaffirmed this immunity ‚Äî albeit in a case involving a less sympathetic plaintiff.

Both of these cases are part of the Republican justices' crusade against an older Supreme Court decision known as Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971). Bivens held that federal law enforcement officers who violate the Fourth Amendment ‚Äî which protects against ‚Äúunreasonable searches and seizures,‚Äù among other things ‚Äî may be sued for that violation. 

Significantly, Bivens ruled that a victorious plaintiff in such a case ‚Äúis entitled to recover money damages for any injuries he has suffered as a result of the agents' violation of the Amendment.‚Äù So officers faced very real consequences if they violated the Fourth Amendment.

The Court's current majority, however, appears determined to destroy Bivens. Hern√°ndez and Egbert didn't explicitly overrule Bivens, but they ground down that decision to the point that it has little, if any, remaining force. And the Court appears to be laying the groundwork for a decision eliminating Bivens suits altogether. Significantly, Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion in Hern√°ndez warned that ‚Äúit is doubtful that we would have reached the same result‚Äù if Bivens were decided today.

That means that individuals who are unconstitutionally arrested by federal officers, or who face similar violations of their rights, will generally have no recourse against those officers. And that's likely to embolden the worst officers to violate the Constitution.

The Constitution places several restrictions on law enforcement, including the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable arrests and excessive force. But it is silent on what can be done when an officer violates these restrictions. 

Bivens, however, held that a right to sue federal officers is implicit in the Constitution itself. An officer who acts unlawfully ‚Äúin the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.‚Äù And so it follows, Bivens explained, that there must be a meaningful remedy to ensure that officers do not abuse this power.

In fairness, the Supreme Court started limiting Bivens suits not long after that case was handed down. Shortly after Bivens was decided, President Richard Nixon replaced two justices, creating a new majority on the Court that was more favorable to law enforcement. But the Court only recently signaled that it intends to destroy Bivens altogether. In Egbert, the Court's Republican majority declared that courts must reject Bivens suits if there is ‚Äúany rational reason (even one)‚Äù to do so. Even a minor factual discrepancy between a new case and Bivens, such as the fact that the officers who violated the Constitution belong to a different agency than the officers in Bivens, is frequently enough to defeat a Bivens suit.

President Donald Trump took office on twin promises to crack down on both undocumented immigrants and his perceived enemies ‚Äî ‚ÄúI am your retribution,‚Äù he told supporters in 2023 ‚Äî and it's not hard to see how decisions like Egbert and Hern√°ndez enable him to do so.

The Republican justices argue that nullifying Bivens is necessary to restore a more traditional vision of ‚Äúthe Constitution's separation of legislative and judicial power.‚Äù The Supreme Court, under this vision of the separation of powers, may not determine that a right to sue federal officers is implicit in the Constitution. This right, according to Alito, must come from an explicit act of Congress.

Alito's historical claim, that Bivens departed from a traditional understanding of the role of Congress and the courts, is somewhat dubious; the courts permitted at least some suits against federal officials who break the law for most of American history. In Little v. Barreme (1804), for example, the Supreme Court held that a Navy officer who unlawfully seized a neutral ship ‚Äúmust pay such damages as are legally awarded against him.‚Äù More recently, in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp. (1949), the Court declared that ‚Äúthe principle that an agent is liable for his own torts ‚Äòis an ancient one, and applies even to certain acts of public officers or public instrumentalities.'‚Äù

Hern√°ndez's call for granting immunity to federal officials would also have more credibility if the Republican justices hadn't recently ruled that Trump has broad immunity from prosecution if he uses the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. This concept of presidential immunity appears nowhere in the Constitution, and it certainly has no place in American legal tradition ‚Äî among other things, why would President Gerald Ford have pardoned former President Richard Nixon for crimes Nixon committed in office, if Nixon were immune from prosecution?

The Court, in other words, appears determined to remove legal obstacles that might have deterred federal officials from behaving illegally in the past ‚Äî regardless of what the law or legal traditions might dictate. And it removed important obstacles right before the United States took a dangerously authoritarian turn.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meta's largest AI competitors are fighting for users inside its most popular chatbot app: WhatsApp","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-competition-whatsapp-chatbot-battleground-2025-6","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

When Jayant Tyagi, a Salesforce software engineer, wants quick answers from ChatGPT, he doesn't bother opening the app or heading to his browser.

Instead, he fires off a voice message to ChatGPT inside WhatsApp, the world's most popular messaging service owned by Meta.

""I'm already an avid WhatsApp user, so it makes sense to access ChatGPT right there instead of installing yet another app,"" he told Business Insider. ""It's super quick.""

Tyagi is far from alone. Lately, WhatsApp has quietly become the place where users around the world talk to and juggle multiple rival AI chatbots like those from OpenAI and Perplexity alongside Meta AI, Meta's own assistant that the company bakes into the app.

WhatsApp, used by more than 3 billion people globally, is ""the largest surface that people use Meta AI on,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's April earnings call. The app is also becoming an AI free-for-all, with rival chatbots now jockeying for attention inside.

As WhatsApp becomes one of the most important battlegrounds in consumer AI, that competition could make it harder for Meta AI to become the default choice for the billions of users the company hopes to win over.

""A lot of people are finding WhatsApp to be a natural and useful place to explore AI,"" Meta spokesperson Vispi Bhopti told BI.

Bhopti added that more than a billion users use Meta AI across WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, although WhatsApp continues to see the strongest usage.

""We believe people will try multiple AIs and choose what's right for them,"" Bhopti said.

OpenAI, which made ChatGPT available on WhatsApp at the end of last year, said that the move is part of a broader accessibility mission.

""We're continuing to reduce barriers for people new to AI to experience the power of this technology,"" an OpenAI spokesperson told BI.

Perplexity's chatbot, which launched on WhatsApp in the spring, now handles more than a million queries a day on the app, a spokesperson told BI. Demand for the bot on WhatsApp was so strong that it briefly crashed at launch.

""Perplexity's WhatsApp bot has seen unprecedented demand ‚Äî volume far beyond anything we anticipated,"" Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas posted a month ago.

Rival chatbots plug in to WhatsApp through WhatsApp Business Platform, a service that lets larger businesses pay Meta to send messages to people asking to receive them, and which nets the company over $1 billion a year, Bhopti said.

This means any company can run a chatbot on WhatsApp simply by paying Meta, no formal partnership required. In practice, that has opened the door for rival AI companies to tap into WhatsApp's massive global audience without needing Meta's explicit blessing.

That reach is especially valuable in emerging markets. While WhatsApp has roughly 100 million monthly users in the US, its footprint is far larger in countries like India and Brazil, where it serves as a primary communication tool, and for many, the main gateway to the internet.

By plugging into WhatsApp, companies like OpenAI and Perplexity can grow their presence in these markets without having to convince users to download separate apps or sign up for new services.

""We do not think of users as 'monetizable,'"" a Perplexity spokesperson told BI. ""We think about them as people with questions, and our mission is to answer any question, any time, on any platform. Users choose to upgrade to Perplexity Pro for many reasons, but it's their choice. This experience aligns with the spirit of WhatsApp as well.""

For users, WhatsApp is becoming an AI marketplace where chatbots from different companies now compete for attention inside the same app.

Users can reach both ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp simply by saving their official numbers in your phone's contacts (1-800-CHATGPT ‚Äî handy!) and starting a chat ‚Äî no sign-up required. Both allow users to ask questions, generate images, and interact with voice notes.

""Using these bots directly in WhatsApp feels more natural, like texting a smart friend, compared to opening separate apps for each one,"" Sumit Gupta, an engineer at San Francisco-based productivity startup Notion, told BI.

Both bots are restricted to one-on-one chats. Meta AI, on the other hand, can be pulled directly into group conversations, which remains a key advantage for it.

""I use Meta AI a lot in groups to generate memes and create polls,"" Naga Santhosh Reddy Vootukuri, an engineering manager at Microsoft, told BI. ""But if I want something more creative, like Ghibli-style images, I'll go to ChatGPT. I still trust Perplexity's search the most.""

WhatsApp has long been a breeding ground for misinformation. Now, users are turning AI chatbots on the app into their own truth squads.

Vootukuri said that he often pulls Meta AI into group chats to ""bust fake videos,"" especially around politics, that crop up in conversations. Srinivas, the Perplexity CEO, highlighted the trend on LinkedIn earlier this year, urging users to forward misinformation to Perplexity's WhatsApp chatbot and get it fact-checked instantly.

A Perplexity spokesperson told BI that the company introduced the feature because ""WhatsApp, in particular, often struggles with misinformation through forwarded messages.""

AI chatbots through WhatsApp can work even on flights. Many airlines limit in-flight WiFi to basic messaging apps, and since the ChatGPT and Perplexity bots run entirely within WhatsApp, users can easily access them midair, as several people have posted on social media.

For power users, mixing and matching chatbots within WhatsApp has become second nature.

""I use Meta AI a lot for rephrasing messages or casual stuff where I don't care about accuracy,"" Manas Paldhe, a software engineer at Infinitus Systems, told BI. ""But when I want a more retrieval-based approach, such as getting links to news articles, I turn to Perplexity. For serious writing or deeper work, I still go back to ChatGPT.""

That kind of flexibility could make it harder for Meta to lock users into its own assistant.

For now, users seem happy with the growing AI mix inside the app. After all, the best chatbot is simply the one that gets the job done, no matter where it lives.

Hims & Hers stock plunged 35% on Monday after its collaboration with Novo Nordisk came to a halt.

The Danish pharmaceutical giant said it was ending the partnership because Hims is selling and promoting a cheaper copycat of Novo's blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy.

""Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" Novo said in a statement on Monday.

Novo added that according to its investigation, telehealth companies that compound semaglutide drugs use ingredients ""manufactured by foreign suppliers in China.""

Novo said that Hims would no longer have direct access to Wegovy. Novo's stock closed more than 5% lower on Monday.

In a statement on X on Monday, Hims' CEO Andrew Dudum said Novo was being anti-competitive and that Hims will continue to provide a range of treatments, including Wegovy.

""In recent weeks, Novo Nordisk's commercial team increasingly pressured us to control clinical standards and steer patients to Wegovy regardless of whether it was clinically best for patients,"" he wrote. ""We refuse to be strong-armed by any pharmaceutical company's anticompetitive demands that infringe on the independent decision making of providers and limit patient choice.""

Hims' stock has been on a roller coaster this year, with shares dropping and jumping sharply on new developments in the weight loss drug industry.

At the end of April, Hims stock surged 20% after Novo announced a long-term collaboration with Hims to make obesity treatments accessible on the Hims platform.

The announcement came just months after Hims' CEO said that the company would no longer sell compounded versions of Novo's weight loss drugs. Instead, it would sell ""personalized"" dosages of Wegovy under rules allowing it for clinical reasons such as decreased side effects. The company's stock fell over 19% following Dudum's remarks on Novo.

The company was allowed to make legal copies of Novo's weight loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during a shortage that began in 2022. In February, the US Food and Drug Administration removed semaglutide injection products from its shortage list and gave compounders 60-90 days to stop making copies.

Hims is up 74% this year. Novo is down 19% this year on worries that the company is rapidly losing market share to American pharmaceutical rival Eli Lilly.

Hims and Novo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oil prices are down sharply while stocks are up on Tuesday after Middle East tensions lessened.

President Donald Trump said Israel and Iran have agreed to a ""complete and total"" cease-fire and, early Tuesday morning, Israel agreed.

In a statement, Israel said it had ""achieved the objectives of the operation."" Hours before this, Iran's foreign minister posted on X that there was no cease-fire agreement ‚Äî but that if Israel stopped attacking Iran, Iran would not engage further.

Benchmark US West Texas Intermediate oil futures were down 3.2% to $66.30 a barrel at 6:10 a.m. ET, while international Brent crude oil futures were 3.4% lower at $69.08 a barrel.

Oil prices have now reversed gains from June 12, a day before Israel struck Iran.

US stock futures were higher at 6.10 a.m. ET:

Oil prices were already falling after Iran's retaliatory strikes on a US airbase in Qatar on Monday, following the American forces' strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

Though Iran targeted US military assets, markets are relieved that Iran did not target the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route for the global oil and gas trade, wrote analysts at Rystad Energy, a research and intelligence firm.

Tehran's strikes on US airbase in Qatar signaled ""a possible desire from Iran to de-escalate by inflicting minimal damage to US infrastructure in the region,"" wrote the analysts.

Qatar said Iranian missiles were intercepted. US officials said there were no reports of casualties.

The energy markets are now focused on developments in the Strait of Hormuz, where a quarter of seaborne oil and a fifth of global liquefied natural gas trade passes. If the Hormuz is affected and closes, the markets may turn again.

""The waterway handles significant volumes for global markets and its importance cannot be understated,"" added Janiv Shah, a vice president of oil markets analysis at Rystad Energy.

In an earlier Truth Social post, Trump described Iran's retaliatory attack as a ""very weak response,"" and thanked Tehran for giving the US early notice of the strikes.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould wrote in a note on Tuesday that markets ""will be watching closely to see if the cessation in hostilities is maintained and for Iran's next move.""

""There are still outstanding questions, from whether a ceasefire will hold given that mutual strikes had continued overnight, to the future of what remains of Iran's nuclear programme,"" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a blog on Tuesday.

""But as things stand, the past 12 days look set to join the long list of geopolitical shocks that proved temporarily disruptive but had little lasting effect on markets,"" they added.

Many couples go all-out for their wedding. But what exactly does it look like when the third-richest person in the world gets married in one of the most romantic cities in the world?

We could soon find out as billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren S√°nchez, a newscaster turned helicopter pilot, are set to tie the knot in Venice this week.

Business Insider asked luxury wedding planners, who were not involved in the Bezos and S√°nchez nuptials, in Venice and elsewhere, to dish on what exactly goes into planning a high-profile wedding like this one.

""Whoever you are, on your wedding day, you want a day that's more special than your ordinary everyday,"" said wedding planner and event producer Sarah Haywood. ""But if your ordinary everyday is Jeff Bezos', that's a challenge.""

When working on luxury weddings of this scale, the planners said no details would be overlooked.

""There's a really specific picture of what we're envisioning, and we're not leaving anything to chance for these types of weddings,"" said Chelsea LaFollette, owner, planner, and designer of Brilliant Event Planning.

As for how much Bezos and S√°nchez's wedding might cost, Roberta Camille Lione, a luxury wedding planner and founder of Italian Knot, said it could get into the eight-figure range.

Lione, who plans luxury weddings in Venice but is not connected to the Bezos wedding, told BI it was ""absolutely plausible"" for a multi-day, high-end wedding celebration in the city to cost 10 million euros, or about $11.5 million.

She said unconfirmed reports that the wedding will cost 30 million euros seemed quite high, even by luxury standards, but that it was ""not impossible ‚Äî especially if the couple is sparing no expense across accommodations, logistics, entertainment, and design.""

""Underneath everything is this huge machine with cogs going around making sure that the event's going to happen seemingly seamlessly,"" Haywood said of luxury weddings. ""We're preempting everything that the bride, the groom, their families, the bridal party, and the guests will want.""

That might mean creating tablescape pictures to pinpoint exactly where every type of fork, knife, and spoon goes. LaFollette said vendor timelines are so granular they're down to 5-minute intervals.

Whereas most couples might rent a bar, at more upscale weddings, ""everything is bespoke,"" said Haywood.

""From the platforms that they're dining on, to the staging, to the bars ‚Äî anything that you can see has been created especially for them,"" in many of these cases, she said.

Service alone can be a huge cost. For a multi-day celebration, as Bezos and S√°nchez's is expected to be, sometimes a couple can also expect to buy out a hotel just to put the workers up.

""Behind the scenes, we're often working with 100+ people to really pull these days together from start to finish to take care of every little detail,"" LaFollette added.

A hospitality team could also be hired to serve as a concierge for the wedding guests, taking care of their every need, with someone on call 24 hours a day.

Headline entertainment is also not out of the question, and a performer's technical rider can create some hefty expenses.

""If a global star like Beyonc√© were performing, that could add several million euros just for the performance, not to mention staging, production, and logistics,"" Lione said.

Another major cost driver would be if the couple is covering the stay for their guests at top-tier hotels, which could run into the millions of euros, she added.

""Transportation is an enormous cost, especially the luxury transportation for hundreds of people multiple times, which can be hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" LaFollette said.

And besides the wedding ceremony itself, the events leading up to a destination wedding that turn it into a ""mini-vacation"" for guests, like a welcome party or a local excursion, can add significantly to the costs for the couple.

Haywood said Venice made sense as the destination for Bezos and S√°nchez's wedding, saying, ""European glamour is having a bit of a renaissance"" right now.

While details about where the events will take place or where guests will stay have not been made public, several luxury hotels in Venice are largely booked for the week, including the Gritti Palace, Hotel Cipriani, and Aman, which was where George and Amal Clooney got married in 2014.

Two Italy-based wedding planners told BI that while Venice is a stunning location for a wedding, the floating city poses unique logistical challenges.

""With no cars in the city, all transport is via private boats, water taxis, and gondolas. For ultra-VIP events, fleets of luxury boats are arranged to handle guest transfers with discretion and style,"" Lione said.

Giovanna Wurmbrand Stuppach, founder of Anthea Wedding, told BI that a wedding of this reported size, around 200 guests, should not cause major disruptions to residents because they are typically ""very discreet"" and take place in private venues.

But she said she expects some businesses, from hotels to water taxis to florists, to benefit from the celebrations. ""The luxury sector will undoubtedly be the biggest winner in the city. This is certainly not to be underestimated,"" she said.

Weddings of the ultrawealthy also incur some expenses that many others don't.

There will likely be security watching the perimeter of the space, keeping an eye on the guest list, and even watching out for people flying drones to try to catch a glimpse.

""Nobody wants to have to think about their security plans"" for their wedding day, LaFollette says. ""But it's a reality for a lot of these clients.""

Lione said that Venice's narrow streets and crowded canals means ""discreet but robust security details are essential.""

""Coordination with local authorities is often necessary, especially for controlling access to public areas,"" she said, adding that VIP guests could also cause fan-driven overcrowding that would need to be managed and planned for.

When the Clooneys got married in Venice over a decade ago, the groom and guests arrived at the Aman via water taxis on the Grand Canal, which was lined with paparazzi and well-wishers.

However, protesters in Venice have said they plan to disrupt the Bezos-S√°nchez wedding, so the event organizers are likely also factoring that in when it comes to coordinating transportation and security.

The wedding planners may also coordinate with a couple's PR teams on the degree of social media posts and publicity that the wedding may or may not have.

Whatever Bezos and S√°nchez have in store for their nuptials, LaFollette said the celebrations would be ""setting the example of what weddings are going to aspire to for the next few years.""

GOP Tax Bill:

Senate Republicans are aiming to wipe away some $3.8 trillion of federal budget red ink from the GOP's signature tax-and-spending bill with an unprecedented parliamentary maneuver, stoking concerns about long-term US fiscal policy.

Republicans are using a fast-track legislative process known as reconciliation, which will allow them to make President Donald Trump's 2017 income-tax cuts permanent without Democratic support. The cost of such legislation has long been measured by comparing it to what would otherwise happen to the federal budget under the current law.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Israel-Iran War:

US President Donald Trump's declaration of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran may curb the exchange of missile fire, but the biggest mystery of the war remains unsolved: the location of Tehran's near-bomb-grade uranium. 

The International Atomic Energy Agency acknowledged just five days into the conflict its inspectors had lost track of Iran's 409 kilograms (902 pounds) of highly-enriched uranium ‚Äî enough for 10 nuclear warheads should Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei opt to pursue weaponization.

OpenAI:

Microsoft is struggling to sell its Copilot AI assistant to corporations because many of their employees want ChatGPT.

OpenAI's nascent strength in the enterprise market is giving Microsoft, its partner and biggest investor, indigestion.

Last spring, drugmaker Amgen Inc. announced plans to buy Microsoft Corp.'s Copilot AI assistant for 20,000 employees. It was a timely endorsement of the software company's multibillion-dollar bet on generative artificial intelligence, and Microsoft touted its new Copilot customer in three separate case studies.

Thirteen months later, Amgen employees are using a rival product: OpenAI's ChatGPT. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Oil prices fell sharply Tuesday after President Donald Trump said China can keep buying oil from Iran, a sign that the U.S. is easing its maximum pressure campaign on the Islamic Republic in the wake of a ceasefire with Israel.

Global benchmark Brent fell $4.06, or 5.68%, to $67.42 per barrel by 12:23 p.m. ET. U.S. crude oil was last down $3.88, or 5.66%, to $64.63 a barrel. Prices closed 7% lower on Monday as the oil market bet that the conflict in the Middle East was winding down.

""China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran,"" Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. ""Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S., also. It was my Great Honor to make this happen!""

Trump threatened in May to bar any country buying Iranian oil from doing business with the U.S. China purchases the vast majority of the 1.7 million barrels per day that Iran typically exports, according to data from Kpler.

""Trump has always seemed loath to remove Iranian supply from the market, given the upward pressure on oil prices it would have,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler. ""Now he has no beef with Iran given its diminished nuclear capabilities ‚Äî his focus is shifting to getting oil prices back down.""

Oil prices have tumbled to levels last seen before Israel started bombing Iran on June 13, as investors now believe the risk is low that a major supply disruption will occur in the Middle East.

The U.S. decision to join Israel's campaign and bomb three key nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend initially triggered fears that Tehran might try to choke off oil exports from the Persian Gulf in retaliation.

Instead, Tehran launched a missile attack on a U.S. airbase in Qatar that left no casualties, providing an off-ramp from further escalation. Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran shortly afterward.

The ceasefire teetered on the brink of collapse early Tuesday as Trump accused both Iran and Israel of violating the agreement shortly after it went into effect. The president demanded that Jerusalem and Tehran adhere to the ceasefire, reserving unusually harsh words for Israel.

""I'm not happy with Israel,"" Trump told reporters en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands. ""I'm not happy with Iran either but I'm really unhappy if Israel"" continues its bombing campaign Tuesday.

Throughout the conflict, traders feared that Israel might target the 3.3 million bpd of crude oil that Iran produces, or that the Islamic Republic might lash out by targeting energy infrastructure in the Gulf nations, including Iraq.

Investors also watched if Iran would try to close the Strait of Hormuz linking the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The strait, used to transport 20% of the world's crude, is a key route for Iranian and other Middle Eastern shipments, including Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait and Bahrain.

Amazon is expanding its rapid delivery machine to more rural corners of the U.S.

The company said Tuesday it plans to bring same- or next-day delivery to more than 4,000 smaller cities, towns and rural communities across the country ""for the first time"" by the end of this year.

The move is part of a previously announced small-town expansion that will see Amazon spend roughly $4 billion by the end of 2026 to triple the size of its rural delivery network.

Amazon has made speedy delivery a cornerstone of its juggernaut e-commerce business as it faces heightened competition from brick-and-mortar stalwarts such as Walmart, and newer entrants including Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop, which have hooked shoppers with their ultradiscounted wares.

""This expansion goes beyond speed ‚Äî it's about transforming daily life for rural customers, who typically live farther from brick-and-mortar retailers, have fewer product and brand choices, and face limited delivery options when shopping online,"" Amazon said in a release.

The announcement comes as Amazon prepares to kick off its longest-ever Prime Day. The 96-hour event will run four days this year starting at 12:01 a.m. PT on July 8, and continuing through July 11.

The U.S. and President Donald Trump are totally committed to NATO, the military alliance's chief said on Tuesday, looking to reassure allies following concerns that Washington could abandon the Western military bloc due to frustration over uneven defense spending.

""There is total commitment by the U.S. president and the U.S. senior leadership to NATO,"" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Tuesday morning, as the summit kicked off in The Hague Netherlands.

""However, it comes with an expectation. And the expectation is that we will finally deal with this huge irritant, which is that we are not spending enough as Europeans and Canadians,"" Rutte told a public forum at the summit.

""They want us to equalize with what the U.S. is spending,"" he added, saying it was not only fair to do so, but also necessary amid the continuing threat from Russia.

Tensions between Washington, Canadian and European allies' defense spending have overshadowed NATO for a number of years, however ahead of this summit, members agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035.

This year's gathering is taking place against a backdrop of conflict in the Middle East and ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. In addition there have been ongoing questions over the U.S.' commitment to the alliance given arguments over the varying amounts member states allocate to defense and security.

Rutte said his key message to European allies was to ""stop worrying so much.""

""Start to make sure you get [defense] investment plans done, that you get the industrial base up and running, that the support for Ukraine remains at a high level, this is what you should work on and stop running around worrying about the U.S., they are with us,"" he added.

NATO members pledged back in 2014 to spend 2% of GDP on defense but some countries, such as Canada and Spain, have struggled to meet even that threshold. Other member states, particularly those on the northern and eastern flanks of the bloc and closer to adversary Russia, such as Poland and Estonia, have far exceeded the 2% target.

As such, some allies will be in Trump's good books when he joins the summit later Tuesday, while others will not be.

Spain has already balked at the 5% spending target ‚Äî it is the lowest spender in the alliance ‚Äî and there were reports that it had received an exemption from the new threshold, but the Netherlands' Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans disputed that, telling CNBC that Madrid had to match the commitments made by others.

""I don't think Spain gets an exception, because they will sign the Joint Declaration tomorrow, and the rules that we have within NATO also apply to Spain, so they also need to take their responsibility. They also committed to the military plans [agreeing new capability targets] two weeks ago, and I expect Spain also to fulfil their commitment,"" he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the sidelines of the summit on Tuesday.

Allies will sense the need to keep Trump onside, given his well-known skepticism and criticism of collectives like NATO and the Group of Seven of industrialized nations as talking shops that lack substance. Last week, the president left a G7 summit early, ostensibly due to the situation in the Middle East, but the departure was also seen as an expression of his frustration with such summits.

Trump is due to join fellow NATO leaders on Tuesday evening for a red carpet ceremony and dinner hosted by the King and Queen of the Netherlands. It's expected that the alliance will issue a joint statement at the end of the summit on Wednesday, formally committing to the 5% defense spending increase.

Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kƒôstutis Budrys told CNBC Tuesday that Trump's presence at the summit, albeit shorter than other leaders' attendance, was ""proof that NATO is a strong alliance that is functional, that we are ambitious, and that we deliver.""

""And with the joint statement tomorrow, we will see that we are capable of agreeing on [an] ambitious benchmark on 5% of GDP being spent on defense, and that's a big thing, and it's also because of the leadership of President Trump and of leadership of our Secretary General Mark Rutte,"" he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick.

Uber and Alphabet's Waymo are now offering robotaxi rides to the public in Atlanta, as the companies continue expansion of their partnership.

The Waymo robotaxis available through the Uber app will cover approximately 65 square miles around Atlanta, but will not yet travel on highways or to the airport. The vehicles feature Waymo's driverless technology, known as the Waymo Driver, integrated into battery electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs.

The companies said in September that they would be jointly bringing Waymo One to Austin, Texas, and to Atlanta. Rides became available in Austin in March, launching in the Texas capital before Elon Musk's Tesla got its robotaxi service off the ground.

Tesla, which is now headquartered in Austin, debuted a pilot robotaxi service there over the weekend for invitees only. Tesla's robotaxis are Model Y SUVs equipped with the company's latest driverless technology. The Tesla robotaxis operate in daytime hours only in a geofenced area of Austin, and include a human valet who rides in the front passenger seat to ensure safety.

Waymo robotaxis in Austin, Atlanta and elsewhere operate without any human supervisor on board. They also employ sophisticated lidar and radar sensors that are not used in Tesla's vehicles today.

Once viewed as a driverless pioneer, Tesla is now fighting to catch up with Waymo, as well as competitors in China including Baidu's Apollo Go, and WeRide, which also partners with Uber.

In Atlanta and Austin, Waymo rides are only available through Uber's app, while in San Francisco and Los Angeles, passengers book through the Waymo One app. The Waymo-Uber partnership only covers passenger rides, not Uber Eats deliveries.

In this article

Google could face changes to its online search services in the U.K. after regulators raised concerns over the tech giant's dominance.

The Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday said it is consulting on a proposal to give Google ""strategic market status,"" a designation under new competition rules for tech firms that hold entrenched power in a certain market.

The watchdog was granted expanded competition and merger control powers this year as the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act came into force.

Similar to a European Union law known as the Digital Markets Act, the legislation gives the CMA the ability to directly enforce consumer protections on tech giants and take action ‚Äî including fines of up to 10% of global annual revenues for breaches.

The CMA laid out a roadmap of measures for Google if its strategic market status designation is successful, including:

In response to the CMA's decision, Google on Tuesday said the outcome of such changes ""could have significant implications for businesses and consumers"" in the U.K.

""The CMA has today reiterated that 'strategic market status' does not imply that anti-competitive behaviour has taken place ‚Äî yet this announcement presents clear challenges to critical areas of our business in the UK,"" Oliver Bethell, Google's senior director for competition, said in a statement.

""We're concerned that the scope of the CMA's considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided.""

Bethell added that Google plans to ""continue working constructively with the CMA"" to avoid such measures from being imposed.

It comes as regulators around the world have increasingly been looking to rein in Big Tech players over their significant market power.

In April, a U.S. judge ruled that Google holds illegal monopolies in two markets for online advertising technology, paving the way for antitrust prosecutors to seek a breakup of its ad products.

Meanwhile, an advisor to the European Union's top court last week recommended it dismiss Google's appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro ($4.8 billion) antitrust fine.

Before this week's annual NATO summit had even begun, allies reportedly agreed on Sunday to hike their defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035. Getting to that target, however is another matter.

The 5% figure is made up of 3.5% of GDP that should be spent on ""pure"" defense, with an extra 1.5% of GDP going to security-related infrastructure, such as cyber warfare capabilities and intelligence.

The Western military alliance's move on Sunday ‚Äî when NATO ambassadors reportedly agreed in principle on a compromise text on the spending rise ‚Äî showed member states were ready to acquiesce, at least publicly, to Washington's demands for allies to pull their weight when it comes to defense and security.

But one chart, based on NATO estimates for members' defense spending in 2024, shows what a tall order a 5% target will be for the 32 member states, with some struggling to even meet the 2014 pact to spend of 2% of GDP on defense.

Defense spending has long been a thorny subject for NATO members, and a persistent source of irritation for U.S. President Donald Trump, who was demanding that allies double their spending goals from 2% to 4% of GDP all the way back in 2018.

NATO defense expenditure has nevertheless sharply picked up among NATO members since Trump was last in power.

Back then, and arguably at the height of the White House leader's irritation with the bloc, only six member states met the 2% target, including the U.S. Times have changed, however; by 2024, 23 members had reached the 2% threshold, according to NATO data.

While some greatly surpassed that target ‚Äî such as Poland, Estonia, the U.S., Latvia and Greece ‚Äî major economies including Canada, Spain and Italy have lagged below the contribution threshold.

No NATO member has so far reached the 5% spending objective, and some are highly likely to drag their feet when it comes to getting to that milestone now.

Spain has already pushed against the spending hike with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying Madrid would not have to meet the 5% target as it would only have to spend 2.1% of GDP to meet NATO's core military requirements, Reuters reported.

""We fully respect the legitimate desire of other countries to increase their defense investment, but we are not going to do so,"" Sanchez said in an address on Spanish television, according to the news agency. Sanchez was reported last week to have called the hike, not only ""unreasonable but also counterproductive.""

Italy is another country that could struggle to meet the 5% target. In May it said it had just reached the 2% threshold and last week Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto questioned the relevance of the alliance, stating that NATO ""as it is, no longer has a reason to exist.""

Meanwhile, Canada has said it will meet the 2% by March 2026, having previously said it would meet the target by 2030.

Even countries that are towing the line on the 5% target, like Germany and the U.K., which both say they're in favor of the hike, could struggle to reach it, given economic pressures at home. Britain has reportedly requested a 3-year delay to the hike. CNBC asked the British government for comment but has yet to receive a reply.

Other countries are ahead of the game when it comes to the hike. Poland, on the eastern flank of the alliance and nervous of Russia's ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine, says it's already on track to spend 5% of GDP on defense soon.

Meanwhile, Estonia, which also shares a border with Russia, has approved a defense investment program that's expected to raise its annual defense budget to an average of 5.4% of GDP from 2026 to 2029.

The uneven geographical distribution of military spending increases across European states could still cause friction at this week's summit, Carsten Nickel, deputy director of research at risk consultancy Teneo said in emailed comments Monday.

""Yet, greater defense spending will in any case address only part of a deeper challenge to the transatlantic relationship,"" he noted, with frictions over military burden-sharing, trade deficits, and China policy also threatening relations between allies.

The country in 2024 spent around 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, coming in at over 90 billion euros ($104 billion), according to a NATO estimate. While that expenditure is in line with the existing NATO target, it falls short of the 5% spending goal members of the military alliance have now reportedly agreed on.

Under the new rules, members would be expected to allocate 3.5% of GDP to classic defense spending and 1.5% to broader related matters such as infrastructure and cyber security.

The U.S.-led push for more defense spending has been highly contested, with some NATO members saying they would struggle to assign more funds to such expenditures, while others have been supportive. While Germany has said that it backed the proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump's, questions linger over whether a 5% target is truly feasible for Europe's largest economy.

Jumping from a 2% GDP expenditure to 5% would see Germany spend additional tens of billions of euros on defense each year, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz saying earlier this year that 1% of the country's GDP would represent around 45 billion euros. 

These additional expenses will likely have to be financed by loans, Hubertus Bardt, managing director of economic institute IW Koeln, told CNBC.

""Despite this, such an increase will lead to notable distribution conflicts in the country's annual budget,"" he said, according to a CNBC translation. He added that, on top of loans, the Berlin administration would likely also have to hold discussions about implementing funding cuts elsewhere ‚Äî along with tax increases.

Emilie Hoeslinger, a researcher at the ifo institute, meanwhile pointed to Germany's recent fiscal U-turn. Berlin's new rules mean that defense expenditures above a certain threshold are exempt from Germany's so-called debt brake, which limits how much debt the government can take on and dictates the size of the federal government's structural budget deficit. Germany also approved a 500 billion euro special infrastructure fund.

""Financing defense expenditures through additional debt gives the government more leeway in the short term,"" she said according to a CNBC translation. ""But the increased need for debt will lead to higher interest costs in the medium-term, which will weigh on the federal budget,"" she said.

Bardt echoed these concerns.

""A complete financing through loans is almost impossible long-term,"" he said.

Another potential issue that experts have flagged in discussions around higher defense spending are the European Union's fiscal rules, which could get in the way of the bloc's members taking on more debt.

The rules can, however, be temporarily suspended under exceptional circumstances, and some countries including Germany have requested such a reprieve on defense and security grounds.

Germany could ""easily"" implement a 5% GDP defense target in the short term, but would struggle in the long run, according to Jens Boysen-Hogrefe, senior economist at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

""Medium-term, [the 5% spending target could be met] with certain challenges, long-term it would need a substantial reform of public budgets,"" he said according to a CNBC translation. He added that the EU is unlikely to offer deep resistance on the matter, and that eventually the German government should be able to counter any pressures by adapting their annual budgets.

Nevertheless, ""it will be difficult to get such expenses underway in a short amount of time. Even the 3.5% [target is] unlikely for the coming year and [for] 2027,"" Boysen-Hogrefe said.

""Historically it would be a very high figure, which can however be reached with enough time ‚Äî even though this won't be easy,"" IW Koeln's Brandt said, noting that much would also depend on whether the 1.5% dedicated to wider security related expenses will have to represent new costs.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Two Republican senators are planning to debut a framework on Tuesday for a major bill that would set the rules of the road for digital assets.

According to the framework, being introduced by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott of South Carolina and Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, who heads the panel's digital assets committee, the future bill will define when crypto is a commodity or a security, allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of digital currencies.

Also signing on are Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.

Those pushing the legislation say the proposed bill would also contain a ""small, common-sense package of measures directed at preventing money laundering and sanctions evasion.""

""These principles will serve as an important baseline for negotiations on this bill,"" Scott told CNBC in a statement. ""I'm hopeful my colleagues will put politics aside and provide long-overdue clarity for digital asset regulation.""

Scott is looking to build off the bipartisan momentum around crypto on display last week, when a bill on stablecoins passed the Senate. Nearly all Republicans were joined by 18 Democrats in supporting the legislation.

Taking to the Senate floor after the vote, Lummis said the stablecoin bill is ""only the first step,"" and she called on lawmakers to finish the more complex market structure bill this year.

A House version of the market structure legislation was approved by two committees this month ‚Äì the Financial Services Committee, which oversees the SEC, and Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC.

While President Donald Trump said on Truth Social that the House should move ""LIGHTNING FAST"" on the Senate's stablecoin bill, House Financial Services Chairman French Hill, R-Ark., said at an event that he wants stablecoin and market structure bills to move together. He avoided answering questions about whether the House would take up the Senate's differing stablecoin bill.

The Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the forthcoming bill at 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

Anthropic's use of books to train its artificial intelligence model Claude was ""fair use"" and ""transformative,"" a federal judge ruled late on Monday.

Amazon-backed Anthropic's AI training did not violate the authors' copyrights since the large language models ""have not reproduced to the public a given work's creative elements, nor even one author's identifiable expressive style,"" wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup.

""The purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate new text was quintessentially transformative,"" Alsup wrote. ""Like any reader aspiring to be a writer.""

The decision is a significant win for AI companies as legal battles play out over the use and application of copyrighted works in developing and training LLMs. Alsup's ruling begins to establish the legal limits and opportunities for the industry going forward.

CNBC has reached out to Anthropic and the plaintiffs for comment

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, was brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson in August. The suit alleged that Anthropic built a ""multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books.""

Alsup did, however, order a trial on the pirated material that Anthropic put into its central library of content, even though the company did not use it for AI training.

""That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft, but it may affect the extent of statutory damages,"" the judge wrote.

In this article

U.S. cafe chain Starbucks said it is not currently considering a full sale of its China operations, after Chinese financial magazine Caixin reported that it was, without disclosing where it obtained the information.

Starbucks has held preliminary talks with more than a dozen potential buyers, Caixin also reported on Monday, citing sources who did not specify what was for sale.

""I can confirm Starbucks is not currently considering a full sale of its China operations,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.

Starbucks kicked off a formal sale process of its China operations in May, inviting interested buyers to submit answers to a list of questions by the end of last week, said three sources with knowledge of the situation.

The Seattle-based company, advised by Goldman Sachs, asked interested buyers about their corporate culture, management style, sustainability measures, how they treat employees, as well as the potential deal structure and business plan for Starbucks China, said the people, who declined to be named as the information was not public.

Starbucks, however, has not decided yet whether to sell a controlling or a minority stake in its China business, or whether it will keep some parts of its China operations such as its supply chain, said two of the sources.

Starbucks declined to comment further on the details of the sale process. Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Starbucks opened its 1.5 billion yuan ($209 million) Coffee Innovation Park in the city of Kunshan, neighbouring Shanghai, in 2023. The 80,000-square-metre roasting plant has the capacity to supply all of Starbucks China's stores.

More than 20 institutions responded to Starbucks, including a number of private equity firms, one of the sources said.

Starbucks is expected to shortlist buyers for next steps, two of them said.

""The purpose was to let everyone tell their story freely and choose whatever the best prospect it is and proceed,"" one of them said.

Reuters reported in February KKR & Co, Fountainvest Partners and PAG are among buyout firms interested in acquiring a stake in Starbucks' China business.

The sale comes as Starbucks has lost market share to lower-priced Chinese rivals in recent years as consumers tighten their purse strings and ever-cheaper options from fast-growing rivals Luckin and Cotti made it more difficult to justify prices of around 30 yuan ($4.20) per cup of coffee.

Starbucks's market share in China has declined from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, according to data from Euromonitor International, a market research provider.

Price pressures have increased as big e-commerce firms in China offer consumer subsidies to stimulate their food delivery and ""instant retail"" businesses, referring to deliveries made within one hour.

These subsidies and coupons have pushed the price of a cup of coffee even lower, meaning consumers are often paying less than 5 yuan per cup of coffee delivered to their door.

Earlier this month, Starbucks announced its first-ever price drop in China, lowering the price of some non-coffee iced drinks by an average of 5 yuan.

It's a strange thought that launching attacks on other countries could lead to peace, but that seems to be the logic behind the abrupt escalation in conflict in the Middle East beginning Saturday. And now there's talk of a ceasefire soon.

Here's a quick recap.  

On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump authorized air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, pushing America into Israel's war with Tehran.

On Sunday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran ""reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.""

On Monday, Iran launched a retaliatory strike against America, targeting a U.S. military base in Qatar.

And on Monday evening stateside, Trump announced a ceasefire.

Trump said on Truth Social that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE"" that will, in effect mark ""an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR"" ‚Äî which began when Israel attacked Iran on June 12.

There are signs this isn't the usual empty rhetoric. Iran gave the U.S. ""early notice"" of its attack on the military base in Qatar, according to Trump. It was a ""retaliation that was expected,"" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said.

Qatar also received advanced warning from Iran, according to The New York Times, which cited three Iranian officials familiar with the matter. Iran's national security council said its missile strike ""posed no threat whatsoever to our friendly and brotherly nation, Qatar, or its honorable people.""

This, essentially, is ""the peace through strength strategy,"" Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC.

In other words, there's a small chance tensions in the Middle East might cool down following a carefully calibrated and symbolic exchange of strikes that projects strength from all parties, while also providing Iran an off-ramp to de-escalate tension.

Judging by the U.S. stock and oil markets ‚Äî which rose and fell, respectively ‚Äî investors are indeed hopeful the strategy of missile-led peace would work.

Trump announces an Israel-Iran ceasefireU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE"" that will begin around midnight Tuesday stateside. However, neither Iran nor Israel has publicly confirmed they have accepted Trump's ceasefire timeline. Read CNBC's live coverage of the latest developments on the Israel-Iran war here.

Iran strikes U.S. military base in QatarIran on Monday launched what its armed forces called a ""powerful and destructive missile strike on the United States' Al-Udeid military base in Qatar."" The Al-Udeid Air Base is the largest American military installation in the Middle East, with around 10,000 service members. Qatar's Defense Ministry said its air defense had intercepted the missile attack on Al-Udeid, and that there were no reported deaths or injuries.

Prices of oil post a huge dropOil prices fell sharply Monday after Iran's strike on Qatar had no reported casualties. U.S. crude oil fell 7.22%, to close at $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed 7.18% to $71.48 during U.S. trading. Trump on Monday demanded that ""everyone"" keep oil prices down or they would play ""into the hands of the enemy."" Trump didn't specify who he was referring to, but he seemed to be addressing U.S. oil producers.

Markets in U.S. rise on de-escalation hopesU.S. stocks rose Monday as investors seemed hopeful of de-escalation in the Israel-Iran war. The S&P 500 climbed 0.96%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.89% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.94%. Tesla shares popped 8.2% after the company launched its robotaxis in Austin, Texas, on Sunday‚Äî but regulators are looking into reports of robotaxis driving erratically. Europe's Stoxx 600 index fell 0.28%.

[PRO] Wall Street's thoughts on robotaxisWall Street closely watched Tesla's robotaxi launch in Texas over the weekend. Analyst outlooks on the event vary widely. While Wedbush's Dan Ives, who rode in the robotaxis over the weekend, said it ""exceeded our expectations,"" Guggenheim's Ronald Jewsikow called the event ""baby steps."" Here's what analysts think about what the robotaxis mean for Tesla's stock.

Airlines divert, cancel more Middle East flights after Iran attacks U.S. military base

Airlines diverted more Middle East flights on Monday after Iran's armed forces said the country launched a missile strike on a U.S. military base in Qatar, as the region's military conflict continued to disrupt airlines' operations.

Dubai-based Emirates said that some of its aircraft rerouted on Monday and told customers that delays or longer flights were possible as it would take ""flight paths well distanced from conflict areas,"" while operating its schedule as planned.

Air India said it had halted all flights in and out of the region and to and from the east coast of North America and Europe ""until further notice.""

Earlier, major international airlines including Air France, Iberia, Finnair and others announced they would pause or further postpone a resumption of service to some destinations in the Middle East.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European stocks ended the day on a high as the Israel-Iran ceasefire appeared to be holding.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index provisionally rose 1.2% for the day. Regionally, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 rose 1.6% and 1% respectively. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 tentatively closed flat.

Among the stocks losing the most were oil and gas related, such as tanker owner Frontline, energy giants Equinor and BP, as well as defense contractors BAE Systems, Thales, Dassault Aviation, Hensoldt, Renk and Rheinmetall.

Travel stocks and building materials firms led gains on the Stoxx Europe 600 index during afternoon trade.

Carnival Plc shares jumped 12% after the company beat adjusted earnings per share expectations for the second quarter with $0.35 per share.

Shares of TUI Group were also up by more than 10% after the company announced a deal to acquire a 20% stake in Swiss tour operator Bentour Reisen. TUI also sold a 20% stake in its subsidiary, Nazar Nordic, to Bentour Reisen.

Building materials and construction stocks, Amrize, Buzzi and Holcim were all trading up between 6% and 11%, indicating a risk-on mood among investors as the Israel-Iran ceasefire appears to be holding.

The government of Spain has approved BBVA's hostile takeover of peer Sabadell, the fourth-largest bank in Spain, with conditions.

Spain's second-largest bank can proceed with the takeover of its rival, provided they operate as separate entities for at least three years. The government said it will also be able to extend the duration by two additional years, if it deems necessary.

""The government has authorized the BBVA and Sabadell deal on the condition that, for the next three years, they remain separate legal entities and maintain separate assets, as well as autonomy in the management of their activities,"" Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo told a news conference, according to Reuters.

The conditions are in addition to those imposed by competition watchdog CNMC earlier this year, including payment services where BBVA said it would commit to divesting some of its stake.

The approval from the government would be the final hurdle before shareholders of the banks are able to approve the deal, currently valued at around 14 billion euros ($16.25 billion).

The euro, British pound and Swiss franc have been on the rise against the U.S. dollar throughout the session, and were last seen trading 0.2%, 0.6% and 0.3% higher against the greenback, respectively.

Sterling also made gains against the euro, jumping by around 0.4%.

The British currency has surged by 8.7% against the dollar so far this year, but the rally cooled somewhat in June, with the cable up by around 1% since the month began.

Amazon said Tuesday that it plans to invest ¬£40 billion ($54.4 billion) in the U.K. over the next three years.

The e-commerce giant announced several commitments as part of the multibillion-pound investment, including the development of four new fulfillment centers and upgrades to existing operations across the country.

The announcement was cheered by the British government, which has been courting investments from major tech players. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the investment would create thousands of new jobs and was a sign the government's growth plan was working.

‚Äî Ryan Browne

In its third-quarter Eurozone Economic Outlook report, published Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings forecast that euro zone economic growth would rebound from 0.8% this year to 1.4% by 2027 ‚Äî despite more severe tariff effects than previously anticipated.

Strong private balance sheets, regional fiscal policy and cooling interest rates would support the uptick in gross domestic product, S&P said.

""We do not expect tariff-related volatility to hamper the ongoing recovery in domestic demand,"" Sylvain Broyer, S&P's chief EMEA economist said. ""Public spending on infrastructure and defence should boost growth from 2026.""

European defense spending was forecast in the report to hit 800 billion euros ($928 billion) by 2029.

The Stoxx Europe Travel and Leisure index jumped 4% in early trade after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Iran and Israel had committed to a ceasefire.

London-listed airlines and leisure stocks also topped the Stoxx 600 in the morning. EasyJet rose 6.5%, InterContinental Hotels was up 3.3% and Carnival jumped 5.9%.

Multiple airlines announced on Monday they were diverting flights in the Middle East as the region's military conflict continued to disrupt flights. This morning, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian state media outlet Press TV confirmed a ceasefire had begun.

‚Äî April Roach

As investors weigh the latest developments out of the Middle East ‚Äî where Israel and Iran now have a ceasefire in place, according to U.S. President Donald Trump ‚Äî German defense stocks are selling off.

Shares of Hensoldt were last seen down 4.1%, while Rheinmetall, down 3.9%, and Renk, down 3.5%, were also among those in the defense sector seeing big downward moves.

Shares of Swedish carmaker Volvo were up 2.3% in early trade, paring earlier gains.

That came after the firm announced on Tuesday morning that its Volvo Construction Equipment arm would sell its ownership in China-based SDLG, and would acquire construction machinery supplier Swecon.

‚Äî Chloe Taylor

We're 20 minutes into Tuesday's trading session, and the regional Stoxx 600 is up by around 1.2%.

Travel and leisure stocks are leading the gains, with airlines jumping after the announcement of an Israel-Iran ceasefire. The Stoxx Travel and Leisure index was last seen trading 4.2% higher, putting it on track for its biggest one-day jump since April 10.

All major bourses are in positive territory, with Germany's DAX index jumping 1.8%.

‚Äî Chloe Taylor

The pan-European Stoxx 600 began the week on a negative note, ending Monday's trading session around 0.3% lower.

Looking at individual stocks, Monday's worst performers included Poste Italiane, which closed 6.3% lower, Danish jewelry maker Pandora, which shed 5.3%, and pharma giant Novo Nordisk, which also lost 5.3% during the session.

On Monday, it was announced that Novo had ended its deal with U.S. telehealth firm Hims & Hers over concerns about sales of Wegovy copycat drugs.

At the other end of the index, London-listed shares of Spectris jumped 15.7% on Monday after it was reported private equity firm Advent had agreed to take over the company for ¬£4.4 billion ($6 billion). The company, which makes testing equipment, rejected a bid from private equity giant KKR earlier this month. KKR said Monday that it ""strongly encourages [Spectris] shareholders to take no action with regards to the Advent offer.""

‚Äî Chloe Taylor

Good morning from London on Tuesday, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests a positive start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 0.3% higher at 8,792, Germany's DAX up 1.1% 23,541, France's CAC 40 1% higher at 7,618 and Italy's FTSE MIB also up 1% at 39,321.

Global market sentiment rose after President Donald Trump said that there is a ceasefire timeline for Israel and Iran, prompting U.S. stock futures and Asia-Pacific markets to rise on Monday night.

""It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE ... for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Neither Iran nor Israel has publicly confirmed acceptance of a ceasefire timeline, however.

NATO's annual summit begins on Tuesday, with a defense spending hike the focus of the two-day gathering in The Hague, in the Netherlands.

Allies have agreed in principle to sharply increase their defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035. Whether those pledges materialize will be the big question, with some member states already pushing back against the figure.

There are no major earnings or data releases Tuesday.

Bitcoin is heralded as the world's hardest money, but the network lacks one of the most foundational financial tools: a native, dollar-denominated stablecoin. While other native Bitcoin stablecoins already exist, they are backed by Bitcoin, not dollars.

That's changing today with the announcement of USDB, a new stablecoin that aims to bring a regulated, U.S. dollar-backed asset directly to Bitcoin's base layer.

Created by decentralized exchange Flashnet, USDB will be issued on Bitcoin layer-2 network Spark by Brale, a U.S.-licensed financial entity, and is backed entirely by Treasury bills. It is launching in collaboration with NFT marketplace Magic Eden, and is designed to bring dollar liquidity to Bitcoin without needing wrapped assets, synthetic structures, or bridges.

Although Bitcoin holds trillions of dollars in value, developers and users have typically relied on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana for stablecoin functionality. That has pulled liquidity away from Bitcoin, forcing traders and apps to operate outside its ecosystem. USDB is designed to change that.

‚ÄúIt's the first fiat-backed stablecoin on Bitcoin. Just like [USDC], or Tether, or any other big stable,‚Äù Ethan Marcus, CEO and founder of Flashnet told Decrypt. ‚ÄúOther Stablecoins on Bitcoin until today have been wrapped versions of the fiat backed assets, or synthetic assets with invisible risks.‚Äù

USDB introduces a new set of financial building blocks for the Bitcoin ecosystem, Flashnet says, bringing familiar functionality from other chains in a fully native format.

For traders, USDB enables the creation of native BTC-stable pairs for the first time, removing the need for custodial bridges or off-chain settlement layers. It allows Bitcoin to be traded directly against a stable unit of account.

Institutions will be able to hedge exposure and manage on-chain treasuries denominated in dollars without shifting assets off the Bitcoin network. This simplifies risk management while retaining the security and transparency of Bitcoin's base layer.

For developers and builders, USDB offers a reliable, dollar-denominated financial primitive to build with. It brings predictable infrastructure for payments, trading, and application logic, allowing builders to plug into fiat-anchored rails while staying fully native to Bitcoin.

‚ÄúIt gives users clear pricing. No one prices anything in BTC,"" Marcus added. ‚ÄúUsers can now quote and trade with their USDB, and save in BTC.‚Äù

In a move to ensure immediate market utility, USDB will launch later this summer via Magic Eden, Bitcoin's largest NFT and DeFi marketplace. The stablecoin will be integrated across Magic Eden's mobile and dapp interface, with fiat-to-BTC on-ramps powered by USDB.

BTC-USDB liquidity pools will also go live, giving users the ability to swap between BTC and dollars directly on Bitcoin layer-1 without relying on external bridges. These pools will also create a native Bitcoin yield opportunity for liquidity providers.

‚ÄúMagic Eden has one of the best brands in Bitcoin DeFi, as well as incredible reach in the ecosystem,‚Äù said Marcus. ‚ÄúThey're a no-brainer partner to get the flywheel spinning fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're excited to bet on Bitcoin DeFi,‚Äù Chris Akhavan, Chief Business Officer of Magic Eden told Decrypt. ‚ÄúUSDB being built natively on Bitcoin will enable frictionless DeFi primitives and create endless opportunities for builders on the mother of all chains.‚Äù

For Flashnet and its partners, USDB represents more than just another stablecoin launch. It's a first step towards building a truly native financial system on Bitcoin‚Äîone that combines the network's uncompromising monetary foundation with the everyday practicality of dollars.

Bitcoin and crypto have rebounded after a major escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict sent prices spiraling amid fears of a ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù scenario.

The bitcoin price has climbed back over $100,000 per bitcoin, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump's shock prediction of ‚Äúmassive‚Äù crypto investment.

Now, as the market digests a Congress game-changer expected to ‚Äúunleash‚Äù trillions, bitcoin and crypto prices are braced for Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before lawmakers‚Äîcoming after Trump suddenly flipped on firing him.

‚ÄúAside from any geopolitical updates, today's key event will be Fed chair Jerome Powell's testimony in Washington,‚Äù David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments.

Trump posted to his Truth Social account over night that the Federal Reserve board should ‚Äúactivate,"" forcing Powell, who he's branded ‚Äútoo late,‚Äù to cut rates by ""at least two to three points,"" and ""save the U.S. more than $800 billion per year.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over,‚Äù Trump added.

The Fed kept interest rates on hold again last week after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation.

‚ÄúAll eyes are on the Federal Reserve chair Jerome's testimony before Congress and Friday's PCE inflation print to determine how close the Fed may be to its long-awaited policy pivot,‚Äù Ray Youssef , the chief executive of NoOnes, said via email.

‚ÄúThe most bullish scenario would be confirmation of a Fed dovish policy pivot or a major de-escalation in global trade and geopolitical tensions, either of which could spark renewed interest in risk assets and push bitcoin towards retesting its all-time high.‚Äù

Expectations around an eventual Fed interest rate cut have been built up by crypto traders and influencers on social media.

‚ÄúBuckle up,‚Äù one crypto trader posted to X alongside a hopeful prediction that ‚Äútrillions‚Äù will flow in to crypto once the Fed eventually cuts rates‚Äînow priced at a 22% chance in July, up from just 10% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tracker.

Two Fed officials, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Austan Goolsbee, have this week joined Fed governor Christopher Waller admitting it may be time to lower interest rates.

‚ÄúIt is time to consider adjusting the policy rate,‚Äù Bowman told a gathering held in Prague, it was reported by Reuters, while Goolsbee reportedly said that Trump's trade tariffs have ‚Äúnot been what people feared.""

Powell has pointed to the expected increase in inflation as a result of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs as reason to take a ‚Äúwait-and-see‚Äù approach to adjusting interest rates.

Last week, Waller has said he doesn't expect Trump's tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.

‚ÄúIf you're starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don't wait,‚Äù Waller told CNBC.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin (BTC) price is stabilizing around $105,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday, following a 4.3% recovery the previous day. The rebound comes as global risk sentiment improves following a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a softer stance on crypto-related banking on Monday. Apart from this risk-on sentiment, institutional demand remained strong as corporations accumulated BTC in their reserves and fresh Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) inflows, suggesting a further recovery in BTC prices.

Bitcoin price recovered sharply on Monday, closing the day with a 4.3% gain, as news emerged that Donald Trump had announced a ‚Äúcomplete and total‚Äù ceasefire between Israel and Iran, effectively pausing the ongoing 12-day war. 

Later on Tuesday, Donald Trump's Truth Social account posted that ‚ÄúTHE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT,‚Äù and called on both nations not to violate it, fueling the risk-on sentiment in the global markets.

Gains in crypto markets were also supported by improved risk appetite and rising expectations of a dovish Federal Reserve (Fed), which have pushed the 2-year Treasury yield further below the 4% mark.  

Traders now await the US economic docket, featuring the release of the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index. This, along with speeches by Fed officials, will drive the US Dollar and overall market sentiment.

The main focus is on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee at 14:00 GMT , which could offer hints about the future rate-cut path and influence risky assets such as Bitcoin.

The US Federal Reserve Board announced on Monday that ‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù will no longer be a component of its examination programs in supervising banks. 

This news added fuel to the ongoing recovery of Bitcoin, as the ‚Äúreputational risk,‚Äù also commonly known as Operation Choke Point 2.0, had previously prevented banks from providing custody services for crypto assets and financial services to digital asset companies. 

This policy shift and the Fed's more lenient stance on crypto-related banking could boost the wider adoption and acceptance of digital assets. However, the Fed still expects banks to maintain robust risk management to ensure safety and soundness, as well as compliance with laws and regulations.

Senator Cynthia Lummis says on her X account, ‚ÄúThis is a win, but there is still more work to be done.‚Äù 



Bitcoin institutional demand starts the week on a positive note. Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, announced on Monday that it has added 245 BTC to its holdings. The firm currently holds 592,345 BTC. 

Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also purchased an additional 1,111 BTC, bringing the total holding to 11,111 BTC. Following the footsteps of the Strategy and Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group confirms the acquisition of 75 BTC, bringing its total holding to 1,728 BTC. 



According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $350.43 million on Monday, continuing its 10-day streak of gains since June 9.

Bitcoin price reached a low of $98,200 on Sunday and recovered sharply by 4.3% on Monday, surpassing the 50-day EMA and closing above $105,300. At the time of writing on Tuesday, it hovers at around $105,200.

If BTC continues its recovery, it could extend the rally toward its May 22 all-time high at $111,980.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart hovers around its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bullish momentum. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI should continue to move above its neutral level. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is hinting at a bullish crossover (the MACD line is close to crossing above the signal line), which, if completed, would give a buy signal.

However, if BTC faces a correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,188, it could extend the decline to retest its Sunday low of $98,200.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an ‚Äúimproved‚Äù version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Japan's Financial Services Agency has proposed a rule change to bring crypto assets under the jurisdiction of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The proposal, to be reviewed on June 25, could pave the way for the listing of Bitcoin ETFs.

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $105,000 on Tuesday after a 4.33% gain on Monday, driven by easing geopolitical and regulatory concerns. Global risk appetite is increasing as the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, along with the Fed's softer stance on crypto-related banking, takes hold.

Tensions in the Middle East have taken the backseat after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran on Monday. Global markets, including cryptocurrencies, ticked up, boosting BTC's recovery above $105,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday.

Pi Network edges higher on Tuesday, holding above a crucial psychological and trendline support. The Pi Core team teases a potential Generative AI feature to be announced on Pi2Day, June 28.  

Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Will tariffs end the golden age of bitcoin mining in America?

After China banned crypto in the summer of 2021, a huge chunk of the mining industry was forced to relocate ‚Äî to Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada and other countries with cheap electricity. The biggest beneficiary of this exodus, however, was the United States, which over the last four years has overtaken every other country in the world in terms of hashrate (meaning that more bitcoin is produced in the U.S. than anywhere else).

Yet President Donald Trump's tariff policies, unveiled on April 2 but paused for the time being, threaten to increase the costs of ASICs, the extremely powerful computers used to produce bitcoin. Only a handful of companies know how to build these ASICs, and the majority of their manufacturing facilities are located in Southeast Asia, in nations that face roughly 10% to 50% tariffs.

While the new taxes probably won't make it prohibitively expensive for U.S.-based miners to import new machines, they will likely slow down the industry's expansion in the country, multiple experts told CoinDesk.

‚ÄúThe U.S. is still going to be the major source of hashrate globally for the foreseeable future, but its overarching dominance will likely erode as bitcoin mining becomes a much more global business,‚Äù said Taras Kulyk, CEO of bitcoin hardware firm Synteq Digital.

‚ÄúWe're certainly going to see U.S. hashrate plateau in terms of relative growth,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúOther countries are coming into the space in a big way. Pakistan just announced it will dedicate two gigawatts of power to bitcoin mining. There are all sorts of projects happening in Ethiopia and abroad. They will certainly take up quite a bit of hashrate capacity growth.‚Äù

Tariffs are only a piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors, such as the enormous demand for new data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) and the diminishing number of ideal U.S. locations for firms to set up mining facilities, are likely to have a larger impact on a miner's calculations when it comes to choosing a jurisdiction in which to operate.

U.S.-based operations are still, in the short-term, able to tap into a robust secondary market in order to acquire mining rigs without paying tariffs. In the long-term, ASIC manufacturers are taking steps to produce their machines on U.S. soil.

The consensus seems to be that, far from destroying bitcoin mining in the U.S., tariffs are simply shaping up to be a new variable that the quick-moving, hyper-competitive industry has to contend with.

Tariffs mostly presented a challenge to miners in April because of how sudden and steep they were. Miners and logistics companies rushed to push ASIC shipments into the U.S. before the policy's implementation in order to avoid paying substantial taxes ‚Äî only for the White House to push the deadline back a few months.

Now, however, mining firms have adapted to the idea that imported ASICs will cost at least 10% more than they used to. But there is uncertainty as to whether this is the new normal. The Trump administration is still in the midst of trade negotiations, and the court system has yet to provide a definite ruling on the lawfulness of its new policies.

‚ÄúIt's likely going to take a long time for us to have a definitive answer on what tariffs will look like ‚Äî at least until the Supreme Court weighs in,‚Äù Lauren Lin, head of hardware at bitcoin hardware firm Luxor Technology, told CoinDesk in an interview. ‚ÄúWe expect it to take a few months, even over a year.‚Äù

In the meantime, Luxor (which also runs a freight-forwarding business) isn't seeing any signs of panic among its clients, though there has been an uptick in questions on how to prepare for Washington's policy changes, according to Lin. Nor is the ASIC secondary market (where U.S.-based firms can acquire pre-owned, cheaper machines) slowing down, she said. In other words, miners are plodding along.

But there are new difficulties, like the fact that tariffs also impact imported electrical hardware. Transformers, for example, are mostly manufactured overseas and were already difficult to obtain before April. Tariffs have only worsened the situation. This has been a bigger source of frustration for miners than tariffs on ASICs, according to an individual who works for a crypto trade organization.

Overall, the White House's initial tariffs on Southeast Asian nations should only be seen as a starting point for a policy that will likely evolve over time, Jeff LaBerge, head of capital markets and strategic initiatives at bitcoin miner Bitdeer, told CoinDesk in an interview. ‚ÄúWe're pretty optimistic that there'll be a reasonable outcome at the end of this,‚Äù he said.

The $30 billion ASIC market is dominated by Bitmain, a Chinese firm whose machines power roughly 80% of Bitcoin's hashrate, according to TheMinerMag. Its competitors include MicroBT, Canaan and Bitdeer.

These companies manufacture the vast majority of their ASICs in Malaysia, Thailand and China, though MicroBT already has at least one facility in Pennsylvania, and Bitmain announced in December that it was launching a new production line in the United States. Canaan has also completed a U.S. trial run, meaning that it now has the capacity to build ASICs in the country if it chooses to.

The Trump administration's tariffs are accomplishing one of their stated objectives (to boost U.S. industry) in that they're incentivizing these ASIC manufacturers to scale up their operations in the country.

Canaan told CoinDesk that, while production in the U.S. is costly, it brings the advantages of being geographically closer to their customers and of reducing supply chain risks. The firm said that it is currently exploring the possibility of partnering with existing U.S.-based manufacturers for its own purposes. MicroBT is also looking into ways to avoid tariffs by ramping up U.S. production.

Bitdeer, a new but technologically advanced player in the ASIC scene, is looking at the situation as an opportunity to seize market share from the incumbents. ‚ÄúWe'd like to migrate as much as we can to the U.S.,‚Äù LaBerge said. ‚ÄúIt will take some time to ramp that up.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeing a manufacturer and a miner gives us tremendous optionality, because we'll always have a home for the rigs that we produce, whether it's in our own data centers or with a third party,‚Äù he added. Bitdeer has mining operations in Texas and Ohio, among other locations.

The heavyweight, Bitmain, has not communicated new plans to ramp up U.S. production since tariffs were announced in April. But the company will likely want to demonstrate that it's building in the U.S. in accordance with the Trump administration's goals, Synteq's Kulyk said. Bitmain did not respond to a request for comment.

In any case, the consensus seems to be that expanding production capacity in the U.S. will be a slow and costly process.

‚ÄúWhether we scale our machine manufacturing in the U.S. depends on our ability to cut costs as well as demand from our U.S. customers. If demand from U.S. customers is low, manufacturing here doesn't make sense,‚Äù Canaan told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúIn addition, if tariffs on products from Southeast Asia [end up being] low, then we don't necessarily need to build up our manufacturing capabilities in the United States.‚Äù

So miners are quickly adapting to the new reality of tariffs, and ASIC manufacturers look ready to ramp up local production. Nevertheless, Bitcoin's U.S.-based hashrate (currently worth over 40% of global hashrate) is unlikely to keep growing as fast as it has in the last four years.

For one thing, tariffs do have an impact. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, and companies are always looking for ways to cut costs. If the choice is between opening a new mining facility in Texas or in Ontario, tariffs may swing the decision in favour of the latter.

More important, however, is the fact that it's getting harder to find new U.S. locations that meet the necessary requirements for spinning up new bitcoin mining operations. ‚ÄúMost of the low-hanging fruit has been picked in the U.S.,‚Äù LaBerge said.

Not to mention that competition has become more intense. Data centers dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC) are popping up all over the country in order to scale AI capabilities, and the industry's major players ‚Äî Microsoft, Meta, Google ‚Äî are deep-pocketed. If a site is suitable for both mining and HPC, the miners are unlikely to win a bidding war.

Nor would they necessarily want to. HPC data centers are more complex and capital intensive to build, but they also bring in much higher profits; this has led a number of bitcoin mining firms to diversify into AI.

‚ÄúHPC chasing electrons is the main theme for the next two to 10 years,‚Äù Kulyk told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúBitcoin miners most certainly have targets on their backs for acquisition and consolidation in the space‚Ä¶ As a sector, they will likely get eaten or absorbed into overall digital compute.‚Äù

This phenomenon is likely to stay contained to the U.S. because of the technical sophistication required to build and run HPC centers. Political considerations also play a big part, considering the ongoing AI arms race between the U.S. and China. In other words, bitcoin miners outside of the U.S. won't be impacted by the rapid growth of the HPC industry the same way.

For U.S.-based miners, the path forward may no longer be expanding in terms of megawatts, but in terms of efficiency, according to LaBerge.

‚ÄúIf you look at the global hashrate right now‚Ä¶ the majority of rigs have an efficiency of 30 joules per terahash (J/TH) or higher,‚Äù he said. For comparison, Bitmain and Bitdeer's latest generation machines are closer to 10 J/TH in efficiency. ‚ÄúIn today's economics, that's marginally profitable at best.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of those rigs need to be refreshed,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe see this as a $4-6 billion a year addressable market for the next three to five years.‚Äù

CORRECTION (June 24, 2025, 16:30‚ÄØUTC): Canaan isn't looking into building its own U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, as previously stated by the article, but is mulling the idea of partnering with existing U.S. manufacturers.

Ethereum could soon run twice as fast.

That's according to a new proposal floated by core developer Barnab√© Monnot to reduce the network's slot time from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, effectively doubling the number of blocks produced per minute.

The idea, part of EIP-7782, could be included in the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade slated for 2026. Proposals or publicly discussed ideas are commonplace in the blockchain world, and may not necessarily move to testing.

If implemented, the proposal would reduce time across three key consensus steps: block proposals (3 seconds), attestations (1.5 seconds), and aggregation (1.5 seconds). That would shave 6 seconds off the current 12-second cycle.

Faster blocks mean quicker confirmations, fresher onchain data for wallets and apps, and a more seamless experience for users. For the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) economy, that could translate to tighter arbitrage windows, lower trading fees, and higher liquidity ‚Äî all of which improve market efficiency.

However, not everyone may benefit. Slower validators could struggle to keep up with tighter deadlines, bandwidth requirements could increase, and poorly tested changes could risk network instability.

The Glamsterdam hard fork is currently in the early planning stages, with a broader focus on gas optimizations and protocol efficiency.

Ethereum's price action in the past 24 hours has been characterized by a fall toward $2,100 before rebounding to the upside very quickly. Ethereum's price dropped to $2,130 in the past 24 hours on crypto exchange Coinbase amidst a broader fall in the crypto industry, which also saw Bitcoin break below $100,000 very briefly. 

Despite the sudden Ethereum price correction, analysts have presented arguments that hint at a strong Ethereum rally once this current downturn is complete. Notably, their projections are not short-term, and one of them puts Ethereum's next major target around $6,000.

Wave A Complete, But Downside Likely Before Rally

The first detailed analysis came from @CryptoWaveV, a trader who uses Elliott Wave Theory to forecast market structure. According to his recent post, Ethereum's price has now completed what he considers to be wave A of a larger corrective structure. His chart shows Ethereum breaking down from a high around $2,900 and falling almost directly into a Fibonacci-based support zone between $2,134 and $1,957.

Now that the Wave A pattern is complete, the prediction is a short-term bounce to as high as $2,792 as part of a wave B retracement. However, this upward move would likely be temporary before another Wave C leg downward, which could drive the Ethereum price to as low as $1,706 before a meaningful bottom is confirmed. 

This level is what the analyst refers to as his ‚Äúideal buy zone‚Äù for long-term accumulation. Although the short-term view includes price crashes, a full bullish impulse will resume once this corrective phase is complete.

Wyckoff Structure Points $6,000 ETH Price

Merlijn, a popular analyst on X, shared a contrasting yet converging perspective. In this case, the analyst's outlook is based on Wyckoff's accumulation framework. Merlijn stated, ‚ÄúEthereum: Wyckoff says go.‚Äù 

According to the daily price chart that followed his analysis, the analyst showed that the crypto had already completed the spring and test phases, which are both components of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern. What comes next, according to the Wyckoff method, is the markup phase. 

The chart Merlijn posted aligns with this outlook. The chart projected that Ethereum will reclaim a horizontal range between $2,150 and $2,450, followed by a steady progression above $3,850, and then another strong move past $4,800, before ultimately culminating around $6,800 to $7,000. This bullish setup suggests that while the recent dip to $2,100 might have shaken confidence, it may have served a larger structural purpose. The spring and test patterns imply a final shakeout of weak hands, clearing the path for long-term buyers to step in.

Finally, the outlooks from both analysts converge on a six-month to one-year trajectory that could see Ethereum breaking into the $6,000 range, if not higher. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,420, up by 7.4% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum price plunged 13% in one week. That being said, major investors seem to ignore the current crypto market volatility. On the contrary, they are increasing their purchases. This suggests a bullish outlook in the medium term. More details in the following paragraphs!

Within ten days, Ethereum lost more than $600 in value. Specifically, the ETH price went from $2,869 to $2,233. Mainly fueled by tensions between Israel and Iran, this drop could have triggered a panic movement. Yet, onchain analysis data reveal quite the opposite.

According to CryptoQuant, wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH accumulated over 265 million dollars on June 21. At the same time, net inflows to ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù wallets surpassed 871,000 ETH. A record since 2017! This behavior of sustained accumulation reinforces the idea that major investors anticipate a near-term recovery for Ethereum.

Another strong signal: spot ETFs like BlackRock's have not recorded any significant outflows since their launch. On the contrary, they continue to attract capital. This simply means that institutions seeking strategic digital assets are increasingly turning to Ethereum.

Technically, Ethereum's weekly chart shows a structure identical to the consolidation phase observed between 2019 and 2021. The price of this crypto asset is indeed trading above its 50-week moving average. It thus forms a bullish chart pattern (ascending triangle). For some crypto experts, the ETH token could break its all-time high.

But beware! If the $2,350 resistance doesn't break, a fallback to $2,100 (or even $1,800) remains possible. Some crypto analysts even mention an extreme drop to $900 in case of prolonged selling pressure.

The market thus remains tense. Nevertheless, accumulation signals on Ethereum are clear. Between institutional resilience and solid technical outlook, the market's No. 2 crypto seems to be preparing a rebound. The breakout above $2,350 could change everything. To be continued‚Ä¶

Crypto prices spiked during early Asian trading hours Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire between Iran and Israel had come into effect, triggering a sharp recovery across major altcoins and largely erasing weekend losses tied to the conflict.


""THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post.

The rally represents a relief following the seeming resolution of a crisis that sent crypto markets tumbling over the weekend when U.S. forces joined Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

However, questions remain over whether the ceasefire will hold, with Israel declaring that Iran had launched missiles mere hours after Trump's announcement, and vowing to ‚Äúrespond with force.‚Äù Tehran, for its part, denied that it had fired upon Israel, and warned that ""any further aggression will be met with a decisive, firm, and timely response by Iran.""

Ganesh Mahidhar, Investment Professional at Further Ventures, anticipated further volatility in the coming days. ""In the midst of three very unpredictable heads of governments, the markets are only going to be playing ping pong,"" he told Decrypt. The key takeaway, he added, was Bitcoin's ""resilience"" in the face of geopolitical developments, pointing to ""the continued dominance of the asset despite risk assets going up and down like meme stocks.""

For the time being, altcoin prices are up following Trump's ceasefire announcement.

Sui (SUI) led the surge with a 11.8% jump to $2.80, while Chainlink (LINK) gained 9.7% to $13.04 and Avalanche (AVAX) climbed 5.6% to $18.04, in the last 24 hours.

Solana (SOL) rose 7.4% to $144.14, while XRP (XRP) gained 7.8% to $2.18 and Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 6.5% to $0.1634, as per CoinGecko data.

Ethereum (ETH) is up by 6.3% to $2,402, and Cardano (ADA) climbed 6% to $0.5799, akin to Monday's rally.

Market experts attributed the surge directly to the ceasefire announcement, pointing to crypto's sensitivity to major geopolitical developments.

""While other factors may be at play, the bulk of today's price movement appears to have been driven by the Iran-Israel ceasefire news,‚Äù Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Labs, told Decrypt. ‚ÄúThe sharp recovery occurred during early Asia hours, which aligns closely with the timing of the announcement.""

""This represents a textbook example of how quickly crypto markets respond to major geopolitical developments,"" Annu Shekhawat, global ecosystem lead at Avail, told Decrypt.

Asia-Pacific markets rallied on the ceasefire announcement, South Korea's Kospi surged 2.8%, Japan's Nikkei‚ÄØ225 climbed 1.3%, and Hong‚ÄØKong's Hang‚ÄØSeng rose 1.8%.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) led the crypto recovery, surging 3.1% to top $105,000 and nearly fully recovering to pre-weekend levels.

The world's largest crypto had fallen below the psychologically important $100,000 level on Sunday before staging its comeback.

Ganesh Mahidhar, Investment Professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt that ‚Äúwe will see a lot of the pairs fluctuate this week,‚Äù due to market volatility.

He pointed to policy and liquidity drivers, saying ‚Äúon the background of the GENIUS Act and promise of new infusion of capital into all crypto pairs, market is looking for a reason to be up.‚Äù

In the short term, Mahidhar said, ‚Äúthat is geopolitical stability,‚Äù while longer-term gains depend on ‚Äúreduced inflation, reducing interest rates, and increasing adoption of stables.‚Äù

The sequence of events began over the weekend when U.S. and Israeli forces targeted Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan using more than 125 aircraft.

Iran retaliated Monday by striking Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military installation in the region, in an operation dubbed ""Besharat al-Faith.""

While Qatari officials reported all incoming missiles were neutralized with no casualties, the escalation had kept markets on edge until Trump's ceasefire announcement.

BloFin's futures market performance meets top-tier standards in liquidity and trade execution quality.

Road Town, Virgin Islands, 24th June 2025 ‚Äì BloFin strengthens its position as a global leader in futures trading liquidity and slippage control, outperforming mid-tier competitors and matching the performance of top-tier exchanges.

BloFin Exchange has achieved a significant milestone in future market performance, establishing itself as a top-tier competitor in both liquidity and trade execution quality.

According to the latest official data collected via API monitoring from June 16 to June 19, 2025, BloFin's futures market depth and slippage performance position the exchange alongside long-established industry leaders such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit, further solidifying its reputation among global futures market participants.

Tier-1 futures liquidity achieved, with a top-two global ranking across depth metrics

In cumulative futures depth at both the 0.1% and 0.05% price deviation levels, BloFin ranked firmly among the top three global exchanges. Its liquidity performance not only outpaced all mid-tier platforms but also closely matched or exceeded several tier-1 competitors.



These results demonstrate BloFin's consistent capacity to support high-volume, low-slippage trading activity for institutional participants and large-volume retail users.

Whale-grade slippage control delivers execution quality on par with leading exchanges

In addition to liquidity depth, BloFin exhibited robust trade execution metrics under stress-tested conditions.

The funding round, announced Tuesday (June 24), was led by DRW Venture Capital and Tradeweb Markets, with participation from numerous investors including Goldman Sachs, which had helped launch the blockchain.

‚ÄúThis funding accelerates institutional and decentralized finance adoption on the Canton Network, the only public, permissionless Layer-1 blockchain that offers configurable privacy and institutional-grade compliance at scale,‚Äù the company said in a news release.

The capital expands the integration of hundreds of billions of real-world assets (RWAs) onto Canton, while also strengthening the relationship with many of the companies already part of the network, including Goldman, that have played roles related to testing, governance, infrastructure or app development on the Canton Network since its debut.

‚ÄúThis funding milestone validates the inevitability of what we envisioned years ago: a privacy-enabled public blockchain designed specifically for institutional adoption,‚Äù Digital Asset Co-founder and CEO Yuval Rooz said in the release.

‚ÄúCanton is already actively supporting numerous asset classes ‚Äî from bonds to alternative funds ‚Äî and this raise will accelerate onboarding even more real-world assets, finally making blockchain's transformative promise an institutional-scale reality.‚Äù

PYMNTS wrote about the Canton Network's launch last year, noting that its pilot effort was aimed at demonstrating the interoperability of 22 independent distributed ledger applications (dApps) in the capital markets domain ‚Äúand prove how a network of interoperable applications can seamlessly connect to enable secure, atomic transactions while reducing counterparty and settlement risk.‚Äù

The pilot's chief finding was the ability of distributed ledger networks to leverage blockchain technology and preserve the privacy and controls regulated institutions require. The lack of control over data and the need to trade interoperability for privacy have historically curbed firms' ability to use the efficiencies that blockchain technology provides.

‚ÄúCanton allows previously siloed financial systems to connect and synchronize in previously impossible ways while abiding by the current regulatory guardrails,‚Äù Rooz said at the time.

In other blockchain-related news, PYMNTS wrote this week about some of the custody issues tied to corporate bitcoin treasuries.

Insurance for digital assets is still in its early stages, that report noted, a reality that has led some companies to weigh creative solutions, like distributed custody arrangements or programmable insurance smart contracts. Others are waiting for clearer regulations that would make insurers more confident about underwriting policies at scale.

‚ÄúAs for on-premises solutions, holding bitcoin securely requires technical knowledge, robust infrastructure and detailed internal controls,‚Äù the report added. ‚ÄúThe company, in essence, needs to become a bank itself. That is likely a radically different model than most finance departments are used to.‚Äù

 Digital Asset raised $135 million from Goldman Sachs, Citadel and others to scale its Canton Network and drive tokenization of real-world assets in finance. 

Institutional blockchain infrastructure provider Digital Asset raised $135 million from investors including Goldman Sachs and Citadel.

According to a Tuesday announcement, Digital Asset raised $135 million in a strategic funding round led by DRW Venture Capital and Tradeweb Markets, with participation from financial heavyweights including Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, BNP Paribas and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Crypto-focused backers included Paxos, Polychain Capital and Circle Ventures.

Digital Asset said the funding is intended to accelerate the adoption of institutional and decentralized finance on its Canton Network.

Canton Network is a permissionless layer-1 blockchain that offers configurable privacy and institutional-grade compliance. With the new capital, Digital Asset hopes to expand the integration of ‚Äúbillions‚Äù of real-world assets (RWAs) into the network.

Digital Assets had not answered Cointelegraph's request for comment by publication.

Digital Asset and a group of firms, including Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and Deloitte, announced the Canton Network in May 2023. In September 2024, Digital Asset and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) completed their US Treasury Collateral Network pilot project on the Canton Network.

In early October 2024, Digital Asset completed another large pilot project with clearing and settlement service Euroclear, the World Gold Council and global law firm Clifford Chance. As part of this initiative, gold and bonds ‚Äî Eurobonds and gilts ‚Äî were tokenized on the Canton Network.

As of mid-March 2024, the Canton Network had seen institutional investors execute over 350 simulated transactions via distributed ledger technology in areas such as tokenized assets, fund registry, digital cash, repo, securities lending and margin management. The tests involved 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, three exchanges and Paxos. Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset, said:

RWAs surged in the first half of 2025 amid increasing regulatory clarity. The total RWA market increased by over 260% during the first half of 2025, surpassing $23 billion in total valuation.

The RWA industry is a hot spot of development. Earlier this month, cryptocurrency payment platform Alchemy Pay expanded into RWAs through a new partnership with tokenization firm Backed, allowing access to tokenized US investment products.

Also, this month, US investment manager Guggenheim expanded its digital commercial paper offering through a partnership with Ripple. As a result, the firm's fixed-income product will be available on the XRP Ledger.

Digital Asset, the builder of privacy-focused blockchain Canton Network, raised $135 million in a strategic funding round led by DRW Venture Capital and Tradeweb Markets, the companies said on Tuesday.

The round also included a mix of big-name institutions from traditional finance and crypto, including BNP Paribas, Circle Ventures, Citadel Securities, IMC Trading, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Virtu Financial, Paxos and others.

Privacy has been a key consideration for enterprise users of blockchains, particularly banks and big financial institutions, stretching back a decade or more. Digital Asset's Canton Network has kept configurable privacy at its forefront, courting companies including Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon to test real word assets (RWAs) on the platform.

‚ÄúEverybody can connect to Canton, but if I wanted to issue an asset on Canton, I can decide what are the privacy settings of that asset,‚Äù CEO Yuval Rooz said in an interview. ‚ÄúSo I can have an asset on Canton with no privacy. That would look like Ethereum. On the same network, I can have an asset with full privacy that you wouldn't even know exists. These can all coexist on the network, and I can even compose a transaction across these two types of asset.‚Äù

The capital raise will expand the reach of RWAs onto Canton, which currently includes bonds, money market funds, alternative funds, commodities, repurchase agreements (repos), mortgages, life insurance and annuities.

‚ÄúToday, major players from crypto and traditional finance have joined Digital Asset on its mission to catalyze the next evolution in markets,‚Äù said Don Wilson, the founder and CEO of DRW in a statement. ‚ÄúWith trillions of dollars' worth of real-world assets already leveraging the Canton Blockchain, this next round of funding creates significant momentum for the company, and cements Canton as the de facto protocol for global collateral mobility.‚Äù

Das Kunstwerk, als NFT auf der WISe.ART Plattform tokenisiert, wird sicher auf einem WISeSat-Satelliten mit eingebetteten Hardware-Sicherheitsmodulen und Blockchain-Authentifizierung gespeichert.

Dieser Meilenstein folgt auf WISe.ARTs Erfolg im Jahr 2022, als ein weltraumbasiertes NFT mit der Schauspielerin Brooke Shields an der NASDAQ gepr√§gt und √ºbertragen wurde. Die Mission zeigt den innovativen Ansatz des Unternehmens, sichere Satellitentechnologie, Blockchain-Infrastruktur und NFTs zu kombinieren, um K√ºnstlern und Kreativen zu erm√∂glichen, ihre Werke aus dem Orbit zu pr√§sentieren.

WISeKey combines space tech, blockchain, and art in a unique satellite NFT launch, showcasing innovative technological capabilities that extend digital assets into orbit.

WISeKey's subsidiary WISe.ART has successfully launched Spanish artist Mayte Sp√≠nola's digital artwork ""The Galactic Christ"" into low Earth orbit via a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, creating a unique space-based NFT. This represents a technical demonstration of WISeKey's capabilities in combining several emerging technologies: satellite communications, blockchain security, and NFT tokenization.

The company has deployed sophisticated technology including embedded hardware security modules and blockchain-based authentication protocols to secure the artwork on their WISeSat satellite. This implementation showcases WISeKey's core competencies in cybersecurity and blockchain integration, demonstrating practical applications of their security infrastructure in extreme environments.

This isn't merely a publicity stunt but rather a proof-of-concept for WISeKey's vision of orbital digital asset storage and transmission. The company appears to be positioning itself at the intersection of space technology and digital authentication - a potentially unique market niche with applications beyond art. Their previous 2022 space-based NFT featuring Brooke Shields confirms this is part of a consistent strategic direction.

From a technical perspective, the implementation of post-quantum secure elements in their satellite security architecture suggests forward-thinking engineering, addressing future cryptographic vulnerabilities. The two-way data connectivity for metadata validation demonstrates practical functionality beyond simple storage.

While the immediate revenue impact may be limited, this launch establishes WISeKey's technical credentials in a highly specialized domain and potentially opens new commercial applications for secure, space-based digital asset management and authentication services.

WISe.ART Launches Mayte Sp√≠nola's ‚ÄúGalactic Christ‚Äù into Space Aboard SpaceX Mission Pioneering Space-Based Art NFTs and Digital Expression  



Geneva, Switzerland, June 24, 2025 ‚ÄìWISeKey International Holding Ltd (‚ÄúWISeKey‚Äù) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a leading global cybersecurity, blockchain, and IoT company, today announces that WISe.ART, its secure NFT marketplace subsidiary has successfully launched Spanish artist Mayte Sp√≠nola's digital artwork El Cristo C√≥smico (‚ÄúThe Galactic Christ‚Äù) into low Earth orbit (LEO) aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, marking another milestone in the company's strategy to expand the frontier of digital expression through space technology.

The launch occurred at 23:11 CET on June 23, 2025, placing a WISeSat satellite carrying Sp√≠nola's artwork into orbit. Tokenized as an NFT on the WISe.ART platform, the artwork is securely stored on the satellite using embedded hardware security modules and blockchain-based authentication protocols.

This mission is part of WISe.ART's broader initiative to pioneer the use of space as a platform for artistic and personal expression. By combining secure satellite technology, blockchain infrastructure, and NFTs, WISe.ART is enabling artists, creators, and public figures to engage with audiences globally and now, extraterrestrially.

‚ÄúSpace is not only the next frontier for technology, it is a new medium for human expression,‚Äù said Carlos Moreira, Founder of WISeKey and WISe.ART. ‚ÄúThrough WISeSat and WISe.ART, we are giving artists and celebrities a secure and visionary way to project their work and messages from orbit.‚Äù

This is not WISe.ART's first milestone in space. In 2022, during a special ceremony at the NASDAQ headquarters in New York, WISe.ART minted and transmitted a space-based NFT featuring actress Brooke Shields, demonstrating the platform's early commitment to combining celebrity expression, secure blockchain, and satellite communications.

Mayte Sp√≠nola, one of Spain's most celebrated contemporary artists and founder of the Grupo Pro Arte y Cultura, shared her thoughts on the occasion: ‚ÄúSeeing my work orbiting Earth is deeply symbolic. It represents the union of art, science, and faith, transcending borders and reminding us that peace is a universal message.‚Äù

Technical details of the mission:

With this launch, El Cristo C√≥smico becomes a space-hosted digital artifact, merging art, spirituality, and space technology. It showcases how WISe.ART is redefining the role of NFTs, offering creators new dimensions for secure global, and now orbital engagement.

By combining secure satellite technology, blockchain infrastructure, and NFTs, WISe.ART is enabling artists, creators, and public figures to engage with audiences globally and now, extraterrestrially.

‚ÄúSpace is not only the next frontier for technology, it is a new medium for human expression,‚Äù said Carlos Moreira, Founder of WISeKey and WISe.ART. ‚ÄúThrough WISeSat and WISe.ART, we are giving artists and celebrities a secure and visionary way to project their work and messages from orbit.‚Äù

This is not WISe.ART's first milestone in space. In 2022, during a special ceremony at the NASDAQ headquarters in New York, WISe.ART minted and transmitted a space-based NFT featuring actress Brooke Shields, demonstrating the platform's early commitment to combining celebrity expression, secure blockchain, and satellite communications.

Mayte Sp√≠nola, one of Spain's most celebrated contemporary artists and founder of the Grupo Pro Arte y Cultura, shared her thoughts on the occasion: ‚ÄúSeeing my work orbiting Earth is deeply symbolic. It represents the union of art, science, and faith, transcending borders and reminding us that peace is a universal message.‚Äù

Technical details of the mission:

With this launch, El Cristo C√≥smico becomes a space-hosted digital artifact, merging art, spirituality, and space technology. It showcases how WISe.ART is redefining the role of NFTs, offering creators new dimensions for secure global, and now orbital engagement.

If you've been anywhere near the internet in the last few years, chances are you've heard the buzz about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) ‚Äî those digital collectibles that have taken the art world, social media, and even pop culture by storm. But what exactly are NFTs, and why are people spending millions on pixelated images, funky animations, or even tweets? Well, to really get why NFTs are more than just a flashy trend, it helps to take a step back and dive into the origin of NFTs.

Understanding where NFTs come from isn't just a history lesson‚Äîit's like unlocking a secret door to how digital art, ownership, and creativity have been reshaped by the vibrant world of crypto culture. Knowing their roots gives you a clearer picture of why NFTs have sparked a whole new art movement, fueled by community, technology, and a dash of internet magic. So buckle up, because exploring the origin of NFTs is your ticket to joining one of the coolest conversations happening in the digital age.

NFT stands for non-fungible token, which sounds fancy but is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. ‚ÄúNon-fungible‚Äù basically means something unique‚Äîone of a kind. Imagine a rare baseball card or a custom pair of sneakers. You can't just swap it for another because it's special. That's what makes NFTs different from regular money or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are fungible‚Äîone Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin.

At the heart of NFTs is the blockchain, a secure and shared digital ledger spread across thousands (or even millions) of computers worldwide. Here's why it's a big deal:

When you buy or sell an NFT, the blockchain updates this ‚Äúdigital notebook,‚Äù proving you own that unique digital item.

To understand the origin of NFTs, we need to rewind to the early days of crypto culture‚Äîwhen it wasn't just about digital money, but about big ideas like decentralization and digital ownership.

Decentralization means no single group or company controls the network. Instead, power is spread across many people. This idea excited internet rebels who wanted to take control away from banks and governments.

Digital ownership was the dream of owning something online that only you could claim‚Äîsomething rare, special, and truly yours.

Some early digital collectibles showed how fun and valuable digital ownership could be:

These projects proved that digital art and collectibles could be more than just files; they could be unique, tradable assets with real value.

Much of the early NFT magic happened in digital hangouts like:

These spaces weren't just marketplaces‚Äîthey were creative hubs. Artists, coders, and collectors shared ideas, inspired each other, and pushed the boundaries of what NFTs could be.

So, while NFTs might look like a flashy new trend today, their origin lies in a passionate community that believed in a new way to own and share digital art. It's a story of culture, creativity, and connection as much as technology.

Once the tech-savvy crowd laid the groundwork, it didn't take long for artists to see the potential‚Äîand that's when things really started to get creative. The origin of NFTs as art began with a few pioneering projects that showed digital artwork could be rare, valuable, and collectible, just like a Picasso or a Banksy‚Äîexcept online, and sometimes animated.

Before NFT art made headlines at Christie's auctions, there were a few trailblazing projects that turned heads:

These projects helped shift NFTs from tech novelty to full-blown creative outlet.

In the traditional art world, artists often have to go through galleries, agents, or auction houses to sell their work‚Äîand those middlemen take a big cut. NFTs changed that. Now artists could mint (i.e., create) an NFT of their work, upload it to a marketplace like Foundation, OpenSea, or Rarible, and sell it directly to collectors with a few clicks.

What's cooler? Many platforms let artists earn royalties every time their NFT is resold, giving creators ongoing income‚Äîa major win that doesn't exist in most physical art sales.

Before NFTs, digital art had one big problem: anyone could right-click, save, and claim it as their own. There wasn't a clear way to prove who created it, who bought it, or whether a version was ‚Äúauthentic.‚Äù

NFTs flipped the script by using blockchain tech to:

With that, artists finally had a way to make digital art feel just as ‚Äúreal‚Äù and exclusive as anything hanging in a museum.

So while the origin of NFTs may have started in code and crypto chats, their evolution into a new form of art was a wild and wonderful leap‚Äîpowered by innovation, a whole lot of memes, and a creative rebellion against the old way of doing things.

By the time NFTs were starting to feel like real art, things didn't just grow‚Äîthey exploded. What began as a niche corner of crypto culture quickly snowballed into global headlines, eye-popping price tags, and celebrities minting cartoon apes like it was the new red carpet look. This boom phase is when the origin of NFTs went from underground tech to full-blown pop culture moment.

There were a few huge moments that blew the lid off the NFT scene:

These weren't just sales‚Äîthey were signals that digital art had officially arrived, and that NFTs weren't just for crypto nerds anymore.

Behind every viral NFT sale was a platform that helped make it possible. These online marketplaces are the art galleries, auction houses, and community hubs of the NFT world‚Äîall rolled into one.

Some of the most important players:

These platforms didn't just make NFTs easy to buy and sell‚Äîthey made them feel legit. With auction timers, trending tabs, and slick interfaces, they helped transform crypto art from ‚Äúweird internet thing‚Äù to ‚ÄúI need this on my digital wall now.‚Äù

The NFT art boom wasn't just about money‚Äîit was a culture shift. Artists were empowered. Collectors became curators. Memes turned into million-dollar assets. It was chaotic, loud, inspiring‚Äîand totally internet.

And while this explosion built on the quiet groundwork laid in the early origin of NFTs, it also marked a moment when the entire world woke up and realized: oh, this isn't just hype. This is history being minted.
            




To really understand what made NFTs feel different‚Äîand why they became more than just digital files with price tags‚Äîyou've got to look at the culture that built them. The origin of NFTs wasn't just about technology. It was about a vibe. A community. A movement that blended internet weirdness, creative rebellion, and crypto ideals into something totally new.

In the old-school art world, a few gatekeepers decided who got shown in galleries or bought at auctions. But crypto culture had no interest in that. Instead, it championed community-driven innovation, where artists and collectors hung out in the same Discord channels, collaborated on drops, and helped each other build.

It was grassroots. It was messy. It was magic.

One big idea kept pumping through it all: decentralization. That's just a fancy way of saying no central authority gets to make all the rules. This idea shaped everything from how NFTs were sold to how they were created.

This wasn't just art for art's sake‚Äîit was a rebellion against the middlemen. The blockchain didn't just store art; it freed it.

You can't talk about the NFT movement without talking about memes. Yes, actual memes. From laser-eyed frogs to pixelated punks, internet culture didn't just inspire NFT art‚Äîit became the art.

Why? Because crypto people love a good joke, a shared wink, or a meme that means more than it looks.

The origin of NFTs may have started with a few devs and artists tinkering with token standards, but the culture that followed? It turned the NFT space into a global gallery where internet jokes, social movements, and blockchain dreams collided in glorious, pixelated harmony.

If the origin of NFTs gave us the tools, it was crypto culture that gave us the flavor. And not just any flavor‚Äîthink neon nacho cheese with a side of laser-eyed cats. The NFT movement didn't just rise out of a tech upgrade or a fancy financial model. It was fueled by wild ideas, tight-knit communities, and a deep love for the chaotic beauty of the internet.

NFTs weren't created in corporate boardrooms‚Äîthey were born in Discord servers, Twitter threads, and late-night Zoom calls. Artists, developers, collectors, and crypto degens all showed up to build something weird and wonderful together.

It was like an indie music scene meets a startup ecosystem, except instead of guitars and pitch decks, people were trading generative skulls, animated JPEGs, and pixelated wizards.

At the heart of it all was a big, rebellious idea: decentralization. That meant no one person, company, or institution got to decide what art mattered or who could participate. The blockchain kept records of ownership, royalties, and sales‚Äîtransparent and permanent.

This ethos empowered creators to:

It turned the art world on its head‚Äîand many artists loved every second of it.

Crypto culture has never taken itself too seriously. That's why memes, jokes, and absurd humor weren't just tolerated in NFT art‚Äîthey were celebrated. The same crowd that invested in DeFi and debated tokenomics also dropped ETH on pixelated rocks and rainbow-haired apes.

NFT art absorbed the language and lore of the internet. It was self-aware, a little chaotic, and unapologetically weird‚Äîwhich made it all the more real.

So, while the origin of NFTs was about ownership and innovation, what really brought them to life was the culture: the jokes, the community hype, the rebellious spirit, and the shared belief that art doesn't have to be stuffy or serious to matter. It just has to mean something‚Äîto someone, somewhere on the chain.

If the origin of NFTs felt like a quiet crypto experiment in the basement, what came next was a neon explosion in the middle of the traditional art world's dinner party. Suddenly, galleries, auction houses, and legacy creatives had to reckon with pixelated punks selling for millions, GIFs being treated like Rembrandts, and artists minting wealth without ever setting foot in a gallery. The rules? Changed. The gatekeepers? Rattled.

One of the most beautiful things NFTs did? They leveled the playing field. Geography, status, and even language barriers shrank when the marketplace became the internet and the medium was blockchain.

It was the art world's version of ‚ÄúWe're not waiting to be discovered‚Äîwe're uploading our own spotlight.‚Äù

Of course, not all was pixel-perfect in paradise. As fast as the NFT scene rose, it attracted criticism from all sides. Some of the biggest:

And yeah, scams, rug pulls, and copy-minting didn't help the rep. For every heartfelt creator making magic, there was someone flipping derivatives of derivatives or trying to sell a stolen image.

But here's the twist: all art movements face backlash at first. Impressionists were mocked. Dada was chaos. NFTs? They're just the latest art-world rebel, shaking the frame a little (okay, a lot).

So whether you love them or love to roast them, one thing's clear: the origin of NFTs didn't just create a new art format‚Äîit lit a fire under an entire industry. And that flame's still burning, one mint at a time.

From quirky blockchain experiments to headline-grabbing art sales, the origin of NFTs has sparked a global creative movement that blends tech, culture, and pure imagination. What began in crypto circles is now reshaping how we think about art, ownership, and expression.

NFTs gave artists a new way to share and sell their work, let collectors become part of the story, and invited the internet's chaotic energy into the creative world. They're not just code or collectibles‚Äîthey're digital artifacts of a new cultural era.

And the story's still unfolding. Whether you're here to collect, create, or just explore, the NFT space is open, weird, and waiting for your curiosity.

DFZ Labs, the parent company of the Deadfellaz NFT collection, has teased that a ‚Äúsmol‚Äù new addition is on its way for their ecosystem.

Psych, Director of DFZ Labs, took to the DFZ Labs Discord to share that ‚Äúsomething smol is brewing‚Äù, alongside a tweet that included a .gif of a full-body Deadfellaz character with changing hairstyles. This follows an image shared on May 17, depicting a similar character with multiple expressions and poses.

Though full details on the nature of this project have yet to be shared, this would mark another addition to the Deadfellaz ecosystem ‚Äì which has recently seen the debut of their Coldlink tool and Ghost Machine NFT collection, and will soon see the debut of their Death Touch TCG and Wallhugger games.

Deadfellaz is a 10,000-piece zombie-themed NFT avatar collection which debuted on Ethereum in August 2021.

A highly-popular collection during the peak of the NFT market in late 2021, its success led to the foundation of DFZ Labs ‚Äì a company led by founders Betty and Psych ‚Äì to build and grow the Deadfellaz brand.

February 2022 saw the debut of Deadfrenz ‚Äì a 13,000-piece canine-based companion collection to Deadfellaz. This was followed by headline partnerships with names such as Wrangler, Steve Aoki‚Äòs Dim Mak, and DraftKings.

2025 has been a big year for Deadfellaz so far. March 2025 saw the introduction of Coldlink ‚Äì a tool which allows hot wallets, social media handles and other identifiers to be securely used to prove ownership of assets in a cold wallet. June 2025 saw the arrival of Ghost Machine ‚Äì a 50,000-piece hyper-pop art collection on ApeChain, with all NFTs minted for just $1 USD.

Alongside this ‚Äúsmol‚Äù Deadfellaz project, the team are know to be working on Death Touch ‚Äì an upcoming Web3 trading card game, and Wallhugger ‚Äì a Roblox-based PvP horror title.

As exact details have yet to be shared regarding this ‚Äúsmol‚Äù teaser, it's left up to the community to theorise on what DFZ Labs are working on.

Combining the May 17 image with this ‚Äúsmol‚Äù teaser, it would appear that Deadfellaz are working on some sort of avatar system, where users will be able to customise their own Deadfellaz characters. This could allow holders to use perks from their Deadfellaz or Deadfrenz NFTs on their avatars ‚Äì similar to Doodles 2 ‚Äì or allow players to customise their appearance across DFZ Labs upcoming suite of games.

This is all theory-crafting so far. The possibilities are endless ‚Äì but whatever the end result is, it looks like it will be a boon for the Deadfellaz ecosystem.

Coffee Sustainability Support Database screenshot.

 

As organizations throughout the coffee value chain continue to call for more transparent and collective action for coffee sector sustainability, navigating the complex forest of sustainability initiatives remains a challenge.

Late last week, the International Coffee Organization (ICO) unveiled an expansive new map of the trees, compiling hundreds of sustainability initiatives within a slick new filterable and navigable database called the Coffee Sustainability Support Database (C2SD).

Formerly known as the Coffee Sustainability Initiatives Map, the relaunched database includes an improved interface with dedicated country views and program views.

The database launched with 440 sustainability initiatives involving more than 600 project-leading organizations and more than 170 donors. It also offers filtered lists and graphic insights into specific project types, goals, locations and status.

‚ÄúWe are very proud of the new Coffee Sustainability Support Database, which reflects our ongoing commitment to the ICO's mission of promoting the sustainable and inclusive growth of and by the global coffee sector,‚Äù ICO Executive Director Van√∫sia Nogueira said in an announcement of the launch.

Daily Coffee News photo by Nick Brown.

The C2SD came to life through a collective effort between members of the ICO's Coffee Public-Private Task Force and was supported by the International Trade Centre (ITC).

The platform is open for voluntary project submissions through an online form, while allowing for project updates following initial validation.

According to the ICO, the map can be used to scale up individual sustainability efforts by aligning with broader collective strategies, as well as to identify synergies, overlaps, and funding gaps. The group is planning to broaden the database to include projects from investment banks and development funds.

‚ÄúSince its inception, the goal of the Coffee Sustainability Support Database has been to consolidate scattered information and make it accessible to key stakeholders,‚Äù Nogueira said. ‚ÄúThis relaunch marks a major step forward in that mission, offering enhanced tools for decision-making, collaboration and strategic funding.‚Äù

When MEXC quietly rolled out its new Launchpad feature this past June 6th, the exchange knew that it had something special. In its inaugural two weeks, over 100,000 users had participated in four oversubscribed projects, with some reaching over 200x their funding targets. But beyond the numbers, MEXC might have tapped into something deeper: a shift in how token launches are structured and who they're really for.



In a market where token offerings have gradually tilted toward institutional players and insiders, MEXC's new approach attempts to correct the imbalance. By blending accessibility with strong returns, and fairness with flexibility, the Launchpad might be more than a product. It could be the beginning of a new phase in crypto fundraising.



To understand the significance of what MEXC is doing, it's worth revisiting the last several years of project fundraising. The ICO boom of 2017 promised democratized investing; anyone with a wallet and some ETH could participate in a project's early days. But without oversight, scams flourished, and investor trust eroded.



In response, centralized exchanges launched the first IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings) in 2019. These brought vetting and execution under the umbrella of reputable exchanges. But new barriers emerged: limited allocations, high entry thresholds, and a tendency for whales to dominate the process.



Later, lottery-style IEOs emerged to broaden access but they often introduced more luck than logic, turning token launches into glorified raffles. Over time, the excitement surrounding new launches gave way to frustration. Participation became confusing, outcomes opaque, and the sense of community and fairness, once a hallmark of the crypto ethos, was lost.



MEXC's new feature seeks to reverse this ‚Äúinvolution‚Äù that has taken place.



MEXC's Launchpad isn't just another IEO platform. It's an intentional reset, designed to offer two distinct value paths.



On one side, it offers early access to promising, curated projects like IDOL and BEE, with two to three new launches each week and historical post-listing returns in the 5x to 8x range. On the other, it caters to more conservative users by offering discounted access to blue-chip tokens like Bitcoin, sometimes at up to 90% off market prices, effectively giving participants a second chance at 2017-era valuations.



Together, these two streams speak to both sides of the trading community. That is, the risk-tolerant early adopter, and the long-term investor looking for value.



Launchpad simplifies token subscriptions while promoting equitable access, making it refreshingly accessible when token launches are usually overly complicated or engulfed by whales. After standard KYC verification, users can explore the available Launchpad events through the platform's event page.



Participation involves subscribing to token sales using supported currencies (such as MX, USDT, etc.) or other eligible assets. The process avoids convoluted barriers. There are no arcane staking requirements or loyalty tiers to navigate. Instead, users need to complete a few basic tasks, such as depositing funds or executing trades, in order to become eligible for a given event.



What sets MEXC apart is its proportional distribution model. Rather than relying on a lottery or first-come-first-served mechanism, the Launchpad ensures that each qualifying participant receives tokens in direct proportion to the amount they commit. This guarantees that smaller investors aren't sidelined by larger players, and everyone knows exactly what they're getting into.



If an event is oversubscribed, the system adjusts allocations proportionally, and any unused funds are automatically returned to users, typically within 24 hours. In the case of under-subscription, users receive their full allocation based on their committed amount.



The result is a launch experience that feels fair, intuitive, and genuinely accessible to everyone.



While both MEXC Launchpad and Launchpool offer users opportunities to acquire new tokens, they serve fundamentally different purposes and cater to distinct trading strategies.



The new Launchpad, as we've explored, focuses on providing early access to tokens through time-limited subscription events. It's geared toward traders who want to get in on the ground floor of high-potential projects, or purchase well-established tokens at steep discounts.



Launchpool, by contrast, lets users stake existing assets like MX or USDT into reward pools, earning new tokens passively over time.



Both paths are valuable but which one fits best depends on the user's appetite for risk and preferred strategy.



In a crowded field of centralized exchanges offering token launch products, MEXC's Launchpad stands out not by being louder but by being smarter in its design. While major platforms like Binance, OKX, and KuCoin have long operated launchpads of their own, they often come with steep participation barriers. Users may need to hold or stake large amounts of native tokens for extended periods just to qualify, and lotteries or randomized draws can make outcomes feel arbitrary or outright inaccessible.



MEXC flips the typical launchpad model on its head, favoring equity and accessibility over gatekeeping and exclusivity. Its Launchpad prioritizes frequency, fairness, and ease of use. New token events are held regularly, compared to the monthly cadence seen on other platforms. This not only keeps engagement high but also increases opportunities for retail traders to find projects that match their interests.



Where others rely on lottery systems or tiered allocation models that favor large holders, MEXC offers proportional distribution. This levels the playing field, giving smaller investors a real chance to participate meaningfully. The platform also skips the complex requirements and lock-in periods that characterize many competitor launchpads, instead making qualification as simple as completing a few accessible tasks.



Perhaps the most compelling edge, however, lies in MEXC's discount subsidy model. By offering significant markdowns, even on major assets like Bitcoin, the exchange is actively transferring value back to users rather than extracting it. Not just a gimmick, it's a structural advantage that directly impacts user outcomes.



This makes MEXC a rare outlier. One that puts user benefit at the center of its strategy.



At the heart of MEXC's approach is a radical idea: give more back to users.



The current Launchpad paradigm is broken by design. Project teams, whales, and exchanges tend to capture most of the upside, leaving retail investors with leftovers. And that's if they're lucky. This has led to growing disillusionment and a ‚Äúwhy bother‚Äù attitude among many traders.



MEXC's model reframes the relationship. The platform gives up part of its margin (via discounting) to attract and reward real users. This approach does more than just boost signups, as it helps re-establish trust in the token launch process.



If involution is a race to the bottom, MEXC is trying to opt out of the race entirely.



It's not just theory. Early results are already validating the model:





In just two weeks, four Launchpad events brought in eight-figure total fundraising, showing strong demand from both projects and users.



The term ‚ÄúLaunchpad‚Äù has become synonymous with fatigue, gatekeeping, and missed opportunity. But MEXC's latest move suggests the model still has life‚Ä¶ If it evolves.



By restoring fairness, reducing complexity, and giving real value back to its users, MEXC isn't just launching tokens. It's relaunching the idea of what token access should look like in 2025 and beyond.



In a space often dominated by insiders and algorithms, this return to user-first thinking might be exactly what crypto needs.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has recently announced the development of a statutory code of practice relating to the use of AI and automated decision-making for regulated firms. Developed in collaboration with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the initiative aims to strike a balance between supporting good practice and enabling innovation, while also safeguarding privacy. We consider the impact of this announcement for regulated firms.

Despite previous joint efforts between the FCA and ICO to encourage responsible AI adoption, current guidance for firms remains scarce, leaving many uncertain about where they stand. What is in place is, arguably, not fit for purpose. At present, the only tangible support available is from the ICO, in the form of guidance and a toolkit to help assess risks presented by their own AI systems - resources that many consider inadequate given the pace and complexity of AI developments.

The ICO has also published an analysis on how data controllership should be allocated across the generative AI supply chains. In contrast, the FCA has so far issued only high-level statements and exploratory discussion papers, outlining firms' potential responsibilities when deploying such technologies, but offering no practical tools or implementation frameworks.

This lack of comprehensive guidance leaves firms in a difficult position, potentially criticised for not using AI where it could have prevented harm, yet equally exposed to liability if AI adoption results in loss. This regulatory ambiguity creates a no-win scenario the FCA now appears ready to address.

Following a roundtable held with industry leaders in May 2025, the FCA has announced that it will develop a statutory Code of Practice for firms developing or deploying AI and automated decision-making systems, a move aimed at setting clearer expectations and reducing regulatory uncertainty.

Alongside this, the FCA is ramping up its AI Lab initiative, which will help firms to develop, test, and evaluate AI technologies in a controlled and supervised setting. In June 2025, the FCA also launched a new collaboration, giving firms the green light to trial AI in real-world (live) environments, in an attempt to speed up innovation.

The FCA's proposals mark a shift from abstract principles to practical support for firms dealing with AI implementation and a Code of Practice will be welcome news to many. Whilst the extent of the Code remains unclear, it is a decisive step toward regulatory clarity on AI. Firms will soon have a clearer rulebook for how to deploy AI in a compliant way. Of course, firms should also keep in mind that the Code of Practice will also provide further protection for consumers.

The FCA's AI Lab gives firms the opportunity to test and refine AI tools in a controlled environment, helping to identify potential risks and ensure systems are robust before deployment at scale. This will allow for faster adoption of AI, with the added reassurance of regulatory oversight and early intervention if needed.

Together, these developments suggest a more constructive and engaged regulatory approach, aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring that consumer protection, accountability, and trust in AI remain front and centre.

AI is a complex beast, but something we all have to embrace. It is not surprising that uncertainty and lack of familiarity are (according to the FCA) the main factors causing industry hesitation. There are, of course, benefits to AI, but these must be balanced with the risks. For example, uncertainty and lack of familiarity could lead to an increase in claims.

As we have explained previously, if a professional blindly follows AI recommendations and / or findings, without scrutinising what is being said, they risk overreliance, putting them at risk of claims. There is also the chance that many professional indemnity policies do not explicitly cover AI and so professionals are exposing themselves to coverage arguments.

We anticipate the Code of Practice will be published later this year. In the meantime, firms should continue to make the most of the resources signposted by the FCA to ensure  they are following existing guidance, minimising room for criticism.

We await with interest to see just how far the FCA's code of practice will go, how it might help or hinder AI usage, and what the impact will be for firms using AI.

The Bank of Korea is considering the phased introduction of won-denominated stablecoins, starting with tightly regulated commercial banks. According to Reuters, Ryoo Sang-dai, the senior deputy governor, highlighted the potential impact of stablecoins on monetary policy and transaction settlement systems during a recent press conference.

Stablecoins, typically pegged to the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction among crypto traders for their ability to facilitate fund transfers between tokens. Ryoo emphasized the importance of a safety net to prevent financial market instability and ensure user protection as the Bank of Korea (BOK) navigates this new territory.

In line with President Lee Jae Myung's election promises, the Democratic Party is pushing for legislation to establish the necessary regulatory framework for won-based stablecoins, aiming to keep South Korea competitive in the digital currency arena.

Ryoo also addressed the central bank's focus on rising housing prices and household debt, noting their significance in the current easing cycle. The BOK recently lowered the policy rate, situating it within the neutral range.

Furthermore, the BOK plans to collaborate with major commercial banks for a second pilot test of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) as policy directions become clearer. The first pilot, conducted with the Bank for International Settlements, is set to conclude soon.

Amid ongoing digitalization trends, South Korean authorities are accelerating market reforms to further open the currency market to foreign investors. This follows a year of extended trading hours and increased overseas participation.

 VMS Group is looking to invest up to $10 million with Re7 Capital strategies, as it hopes to diversify into more liquid investments, according to managing partner Elton Cheung. 

A Hong Kong-based multi-family office that manages money for some of the city's wealthiest families is reportedly venturing into the crypto industry for the first time. 

The firm, which has $4 billion in assets under management, is looking to invest up to $10 million in Re7 Capital strategies, Bloomberg reported on Monday. However, the size of the allocation has not been finalized yet.

‚ÄúThe decision is part of recent moves by VMS to diversify into more liquid investments,‚Äù VMS Group managing partner Elton Cheung told Bloomberg. 

Cheung went on to state that while the firm has made substantial gains in private equity and other long-term investments, it is harder for the firm to exit from such investments, as more and more companies are opting to stay private for longer periods of time.

VMS Group cited increasing demand and the regulatory environment turning favorable as the reasons behind the move.

‚ÄúWe thought this was the right time because of growing demand and because we see clearer legislative and government support from various jurisdictions, as well as large institutional support and endorsement,‚Äù Cheung said.

Notably, VMS Group is choosing to invest indirectly via Re7 Capital instead of directly investing in digital assets themselves. Re7 Capital is a digital assets investment firm that focuses on generating yield via DeFi and other crypto strategies.

Cointelegraph reached out to VMS Group but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

Hong Kong has recently taken regulatory steps to foster crypto innovation in the region.

Earlier this month, the Hong Kong government was reportedly using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol to explore opportunities for its central bank digital currency initiative.

On June 4, Hong Kong regulators allowed professional investors to trade crypto derivatives as part of their plan to expand product offerings to such investors.

In May, Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed a bill that will allow companies to issue stablecoins backed by fiat currencies by the end of the year.

Hong Kong-based firms have already started adding crypto to their treasuries.

Last week, MemeStrategy, an investment firm managed by 9GAG, became the first publicly traded company in the region to invest in Solana. The firm bought more than 2,400 SOL tokens for $368,000.

Meanwhile, in May, heat-and-eat meal seller DDC Enterprise bought 21 BTC as part of its broader strategy to accumulate 5,000 Bitcoin over the next three years.

Today the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the central bank to central banks, released a chapter of its Annual report, ‚ÄúThe next-generation monetary and financial system,‚Äù outlining its vision for a tokenized economy. The BIS sees tokenized deposits dominating retail payments with wholesale central bank digital currencies (wCBDC) enabling interbank settlement, but argues stablecoins lack the fundamental features of sound money.

The BIS identifies three critical flaws in stablecoins: they lack singleness, elasticity and integrity. Singleness refers to universal acceptance without question, requiring token holders to know they can always exchange $1 for a dollar rather than 99 cents or less. The BIS says this is only possible through central bank money settling bank transactions.

Elasticity means central banks and commercial banks can grant credit to expand the money supply. ‚ÄúWhere you have very complex interlocking payment obligations, if you had to wait for the incoming payments before you have sufficient liquidity to execute your own outgoing payment, that would be a recipe for gridlock,‚Äù explained Hyun Song Shin, the Head of the Monetary and Economic Department at the BIS during a media briefing. 

‚ÄúThat feature cannot be satisfied with stablecoins because stablecoins need the backing reserves upfront. So unless you actually have the balancesalready in your wallet, you cannot execute that payment,‚Äù said Mr Shin. ‚ÄúSo I think for large value payments that elasticity is going to be absolutely key.‚Äù (Italics is our emphasis.)

The integrity problem stems from stablecoins being ‚Äúdigital bearer instruments on borderless public blockchains‚Äù that have become ‚Äúthe go-to choice for illicit use to bypass integrity safeguards,‚Äù according to the report.

Beyond these fundamental issues, the BIS warns stablecoins threaten monetary sovereignty through dollarization and could destabilize government debt markets when issuers sell reserves en masse during crises.

Instead of stablecoins, the BIS promotes its Unified Ledger concept where central banks and commercial banks transact on a single network with tokenized deposits from commercial banks serving customers. The latest paper acknowledges a single ledger isn't always practical, especially with multiple central banks involved, so it envisions interconnected subnets or blockchain layers.

Project Agor√° exemplifies this approach, bringing together seven central banks and 43 private institutions to explore tokenizing correspondent banking for more efficient cross border payments. However, the project remains exploratory and is just moving from concept to prototype.

‚ÄúThere is tremendous impetus that's coming from our private sector partners,‚Äù Mr Shin said about the project's momentum.

Multi central bank initiatives face governance and data sovereignty challenges, with each central bank wanting final authority over its currency. Project Jura between Switzerland and France required two notaries, one for each central bank, to approve franc to euro exchanges.

Stepping back, with the current wave of technical innovations, including blockchain and AI, the establishment of the BIS Innovation Hubs in 2019 to prepare central banks was an important move. The launch was just months after Facebook unveiled its Libra stablecoin plans.

Today stablecoins are having a moment and timing is everything with innovation. For all the dozens of experiments with tokenized deposits, many outside  the BIS, only a few standalone offerings have reached the market. Even fewer operate on open permissionless blockchains, which the BIS views with skepticism. Despite all the hard work from the BIS, stablecoins appear to be targeting an open goal for certain mainstream use cases.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Tech in the Iran-Israel conflict: internet blackout, crypto burning and home camera spying","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/23/iran-israel-internet-blackout-crypto-home-camera-spying","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:31:00 GMT","

Iran, clearly fearful of an online Israeli incursion, imposed a near-total internet blackout early last week

The war between Israel and Iran, though largely a fight of fighter planes, drones and bombs, is erupting in the digital realm as well. Both countries have long histories with digital warfare. The particular focus of the current conflict, Iran's nuclear program, was the target of one of the first cyberweapons meant to cause physical destruction, the sophisticated worm Stuxnet.

Iran, clearly fearful of an online Israeli incursion, imposed a near-total internet blackout early last week. My colleague Johana Bhuiyan reports:

Cybersecurity company Cloudflare assessed that internet traffic levels in Iran ‚Äúare now ~97% below where they were at the same time a week ago‚Äù. Severed internet connectivity has led to a troubling lack of access to information for everyday Iranians as their country descends into conflict.

The reduction in internet speeds comes after an anti-Iranian government hacking group with potential ties to Israel claimed that it hacked Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's government, said on Twitter/X that officials in Tehran had restricted internet access to ward off additional cyberattacks.

On Wednesday, Iran's fears came to fruition. My colleague Dan Milmo reports:

An Israel-linked hacking group has claimed responsibility for a $90m (¬£67m) heist on an Iranian cryptocurrency exchange.

The group known as Gonjeshke Darande, Farsi for Predatory Sparrow, said on Wednesday it had hacked the Nobitex exchange, a day after claiming it had destroyed data at Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah.

Elliptic, a consultancy specialising in crypto-related crime, said it had so far identified more than $90m in cryptocurrency sent from Nobitex crypto wallets to hacker addresses. The hackers appear to have in effect ‚Äúburned‚Äù those funds, rendering them inaccessible by storing them in ‚Äúvanity addresses‚Äù for which they do not have the cryptographic keys, Elliptic said.

Iran has attempted to retaliate, but as with the wider war, it seems that Israeli attacks have been more successful and damaging. Israeli officials warned the country's residents that Iran is hijacking home security cameras that are connected to the internet to gather real-time intelligence on the ground, Bloomberg reports. Security professionals say hackers for Hamas and Russia have done the same. Home cameras may be a new front in the waging of war, but disrupting them does not seem as powerful as disrupting a central bank, as Israel has done.

Late Friday, Iran seemed to lift the internet blackout for some citizens, the New York Times reported, though even those who could access limited online services believed their connections were temporary.

PornHub, widely estimated to be the most-visited site for pornographic content in the world, returned to France on Friday after a three-week blackout.

The site's owner, Aylo, had rescinded access to the site protest of a new French law demanding adult websites verify users' ages with a credit card or identification document. PornHub drew a line in the sand on the issue and revoked access for a market of nearly 70 million rather than implement an age gate.

Since then, a French court has suspended the law while it considers compliance with the European Union's constitution, and so Pornhub is back online. But the quarrel between Paris and PornHub is the latest front in the debate over online age verification, which is heating to a boil across the globe.

The issue sits at the intersection of two driving forces of internet regulation that often conflict: keeping children safe online and preserving both privacy and freedom of expression. It's an area where lawmakers have been uncharacteristically prone to action, even in the US, where tech regulation is often as hands off as can be.

More than 20 states now have age verification laws on the books. PornHub has made itself unavailable in 17 of them. Texas, the second-most populous state in the US with 31m people, is the highest-profile example. The state legislature there passed a law requiring an ID to visit PornHub in September 2023. In March of the following year, the site went dark in the state, greeting would-be visitors with a banner calling the law ‚Äúineffective, haphazard, and dangerous‚Äù. In Louisiana, which has imposed age verification laws, PornHub is still available, but it has seen traffic there decline by 80%, which it attributes to the barrier of the ID requirement. The US supreme court heard arguments in January over whether these laws infringe on the constitutional right to free speech.

Research into the laws into the US have found that they are not effective in their stated goal. Online search data showed that people in states with age verification laws sought out porn sites that did not comply with local laws so as to circumvent the age gates as well as virtual private networks to hide their locations from internet providers.

The other battlefields over age verification concern social media bans for underage users. Australia, which has passed a law banning under-16s from social media, has been testing different technologies with which to enforce its prohibition but found them lacking.

The UK is the next frontier in the fight. The UK's system for verifying ages to keep pornography away from children, a provision of the Online Safety Act, will take effect in July. Will London be the next Paris or the next Texas?

Last week, Donald Trump debuted a mobile phone branded with his family name ‚Äì ‚ÄúT1‚Äù etched into the gold case alongside an American flag ‚Äì with a listed price of $500 and a pledge that it would be ‚Äúproudly designed and built in the United States‚Äù. Specifically in Alabama, California and Florida. Its monthly service plan will cost $47.45.

The Trump phone will struggle to live up to those promises. Its makers have to abide by the same market forces as other phonemakers. Both cheap labor and electronics expertise reside in China. They do not in the US. There's a reason Apple's phones are labeled ‚ÄúDesigned in California‚Äù ‚Äì to take advantage of the cach√© and appeal of the US without suffering its labor costs.

Looking ahead, experts predict that Trump's own tariffs could cause the price of smartphones to spike by double or even triple digits. The electronics supply chain in the US is nowhere near developed enough to assemble a phone entirely domestically. Analysts at investment bank UBS warned in April that the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB of storage could rise by 79% from $1,199 to about $2,150, based on a total tariff of 145%. Apple itself seemed to concur with those assessments when it flew some $2bn worth of iPhones into the US before the tariffs on China went into effect.

There is already an example of a phone assembled ‚Äì but not entirely made ‚Äì in the US, the Liberty Phone. It costs nearly four times what Trump promises his will, nearly $2000. The Liberty Phone sources its motherboard from the US but still requires screens, batteries and cameras manufactured overseas, according to a Wall Street Journal interview with the CEO of Purism, which manufactures the device. Its operating system can only run basic apps such as a calculator and a web browser because it runs on PureOS, software of the company's own making, per the Journal.

The specs on the Liberty Phone are worse than Trump's T1, though the price is higher, making the president's device even less likely to appear on the market as announced. Some of the promised technical capabilities of the T1 would best those of the top-of-the-line iPhones, which cost nearly double what Trump has promised. The Verge put together a good list of which Chinese companies might manufacture the phone for Trump to white label.

Eric Trump, who is co-leading the venture with his brother Donald Jr, has acknowledged that the first batch of T1 phones will not be made in the US. ‚ÄúEventually, all the phones can be built in the United States of America,‚Äù Eric Trump said last week. We'll see.

Online poker is evolving. What was once run on centralised platforms is now shifting toward blockchain poker platforms that offer greater transparency, faster payouts, and stronger fairness guarantees. These new systems, driven by crypto poker sites and decentralised technologies, are redefining how the game is played and managed. What's emerging isn't a fad, it's a fix.

Online poker platforms have long operated as black boxes. Players had little visibility into how the random number generators worked, whether cards were shuffled fairly, or if their funds were truly secure. Centralised operators controlled everything: the software, the servers, and the wallets. It created a system based on trust, with few ways to verify. This is where blockchain poker platforms step in.

By using blockchain gaming architecture, these platforms move core functions to public, verifiable code. Players no longer have to take a site's word for it. They can check outcomes, transactions, and contracts themselves. It's not trust, it's math.

In decentralised poker systems, every action is logged on a distributed ledger. That means the deck shuffle, the hand result, and the payout are recorded immutably. Players can independently verify fairness through on-chain data. A major innovation is the use of smart contracts in poker gameplay. These contracts automatically execute outcomes based on predefined rules, without interference from operators. Once the contract is deployed, no one can alter it mid-game. That removes human error and bad actors from the equation.

Another key advantage? Instant payouts through crypto payments. Instead of waiting hours or days for withdrawals, players receive their winnings directly into their crypto wallets in seconds. No delays. No middlemen. And with support for popular cryptocurrencies like USDT, ETH, and even Bitcoin, these poker platforms with cryptocurrency bypass traditional financial systems altogether.

Joining a decentralised poker game usually starts with connecting a Web3 wallet like MetaMask. There's no registration, no email verification, and no need to deposit funds into a custodial account. The funds stay in the player's wallet until used in a smart contract for gameplay. The poker table itself is governed by a set of immutable rules coded into the contract. Players interact directly with the smart contract to place bets, receive cards, and collect winnings. This level of automation and openness is new to the poker world, and it's reshaping expectations.

It also brings one of the most important benefits of blockchain poker platforms: provably fair gaming. Using cryptographic randomness, players can confirm that the outcomes are not manipulated. The math checks out every time.

In contrast to traditional poker platforms, blockchain-powered poker offers decentralised governance. There's no need for a central authority to oversee hands, enforce rules, or manage payments. Everything is handled by code. This eliminates the single point of failure. If a traditional site goes down or freezes funds, players have little recourse. On blockchain poker platforms, the infrastructure is distributed and resilient.

The shift to decentralised poker also introduces a new layer of player control. In many cases, these platforms evolve into DAOs, Decentralised Autonomous Organizations, where users vote on updates, rule changes, and fee structures. It's poker, but not as we've known it.

Some of the early leaders in this space are building reputations for innovation. Virtue Poker, for instance, was built on Ethereum and uses peer-to-peer smart contract gameplay. CoinPoker, a crypto-native site, has operated for years with blockchain-based fairness and crypto wallet integration.

Behind the scenes, the shift toward blockchain-powered gameplay has created a need for adaptable technical frameworks. Industry contributors have started documenting and deploying backend systems capable of supporting decentralised poker logic, smart contract execution, and wallet-based interaction models. Resources like this overview on poker game development architecture outline how these systems can be structured for transparency, scalability, and modular upgrades in blockchain gaming environments.

New entrants like ZedRun Poker DAO are experimenting with full decentralisation, offering a glimpse of where Web3 poker might be headed. Each of these platforms focuses on blockchain gaming principles: open-source logic, decentralised infrastructure, and community-driven decision-making. Their goal is not to replicate traditional poker; it's to improve it fundamentally.

The shift to crypto poker doesn't eliminate all risk. Smart contracts can be buggy or exploited. Users who lose wallet keys lose access to their funds. And the absence of traditional KYC processes raises regulatory questions in several regions.

Still, many crypto poker sites operate legally under licenses from crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Cura√ßao, Antigua, or parts of Europe. These licenses often recognise the differences between centralised gambling operations and blockchain-powered gaming platforms. As the legal landscape adapts, developers are increasingly focused on trustworthiness, building secure, auditable, and user-responsible ecosystems.

A growing number of poker players, especially in the DeFi and crypto communities, prefer blockchain poker platforms for three core reasons: control, fairness, and speed. These players value the self-custody model, where their funds remain in their wallets at all times. They appreciate the lack of arbitrary freezes, restrictions, or manual withdrawals. And they are drawn to the concept of provably fair gaming, where outcomes are based on cryptography, not promises.

As these technologies evolve, even genre-specific variants like Texas Hold'em poker are being rebuilt using smart contracts and blockchain rails. It's a reflection of how deeply these innovations are taking root across every layer of the poker industry.

Despite its benefits, blockchain poker faces real-world adoption challenges. First, the user experience still has friction. Setting up wallets, understanding smart contracts, and paying gas fees can confuse new players. Platforms must improve onboarding if they want mass adoption.

Second, liquidity remains a bottleneck. Many decentralised platforms lack the volume and game selection of larger, centralised poker networks. Finally, decentralised poker will need to navigate ongoing regulatory ambiguity. Governments are still catching up with the pace of Web3 innovation, and that brings uncertainty.

But as platforms improve UX, adopt Layer 2 scaling, and find compliant ways to integrate fiat on-ramps, these hurdles are slowly being addressed.

The next wave may not be fully decentralised or fully centralised, but somewhere in between. Hybrid crypto poker platforms are already emerging, combining sleek user interfaces with blockchain-based game logic. This allows for mainstream usability without sacrificing transparency or fairness.

Meanwhile, player-governed poker ecosystems are taking shape. DAOs are letting players vote on everything from rake fees to new features. These models suggest that poker might not just be decentralised, but it could also become democratically managed. That's a shift no rakeback program could ever compete with.

Blockchain poker platforms are not a gimmick. They're a real response to real problems. They use smart contracts, crypto payments, and open code to fix fairness, automate payments, and remove the need to blindly trust platforms. The transition won't happen overnight. But as traditional systems continue to face issues of trust, control, and compliance, the poker world is beginning to look beyond the table and toward the chain.

The game is still the same. But the rules? They're getting an upgrade.

Mastercard (MA) is doubling down on stablecoins with a series of partnerships and product expansions aimed at embedding regulated digital dollars into the everyday payments network.

The payments giant said on Tuesday it will integrate several stablecoins including PayPal's PYUSD, the Paxos-led Global Dollar (USDG) and Fiserv's recently unveiled FIUSD into its global network, which already includes support for Circle's USDC. It is also introducing stablecoin transactions for cross-border payments through Mastercard Move.

The company also said it's also working with financial technology provider Fiserv (FI) to bring FIUSD support to its card products, on- and offramps and merchant settlements, and will let consumers spend both fiat and stablecoin balances under a single interface with Mastercard One Credential.

The initiatives are the latest examples of global banks and payment firms racing to embrace stablecoins, a type of digital currency with prices anchored to an external asset such as fiat currencies, into their offerings. It's a $260 billion, and rapidly growing, asset class and promises programmable transactions and faster, cheaper payments than through traditional banking channels. Institutional adoption is accelerating after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act to regulate the stablecoin sector. 

""We expect that consumers and businesses will continue to use fiat currency with their Mastercard cards for most use cases,"" Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard, said in a blog post. ""But regulated stablecoins are undoubtedly part of the evolution of digital payments.""

These moves mean financial institutions and businesses could soon mint, redeem and settle transactions using select stablecoins, while consumers may use them in the same way they would use traditional currencies for transfers and payments, including at the firm's 150 million merchant locations.

The stablecoin integrations join existing digital asset offerings, which span card programs with crypto firms that allow users to spend their crypto holdings to merchant settlements and tokenized bank deposits.

Future plans include enabling programmable payments via Mastercard's Multi-Token Network.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell offered little change in stance from his recent remarks, reiterating that the economy is in a good spot, giving the central bank the room to be patient before considering easing monetary policy.

""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" said Powell in prepared remarks for his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress.

Today's testimony is of particular note given talks this week from Fed Governors Chris Waller and Michelle Bowman. Both said they would be supportive of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting. To date, Powell has given no indication that he is considering such a move.

The break with Powell ‚Äî by itself, not necessarily major news ‚Äî comes as President Trump continues to make clear his displeasure with the Fed chairman's reluctance to ease monetary policy.

Rate cuts odds for July continue to be fairly slim at just 18.6%, according to CME FedWatch. Moving to September, the odds of one or more rate cuts jump to more than 80%.

Powell was asked more than once about issues affecting the crypto industry, though it wasn't a significant area of questioning on Tuesday. When asked about the shifting crypto interests in U.S. banking, he said he sees ""a very significant change in the tone"" that suggests a future increase in digital assets activity based on ""evolving thinking and the evolving status of the crypto industry."" While his agency had been accused by the industry of encouraging banks to steer clear of crypto because of the industry's riskiness, he said that the Fed's view ""is that banks get to decide who their customers are.""Banks are also free to conduct crypto activities, as long as they do so in a way that is protective of safety and soundness,"" he told the lawmakers. 

Powell also expressed support for the progress of crypto legislation in Congress. ""I think it's a great thing that that bills are moving,"" he said. ""We need it. We need a stablecoin framework.""



UPDATE (June 24, 2025, 17:13 UTC): Adds Powell comments on crypto issues.

ProCap BTC, a cryptocurrency financial services firm founded by investor Anthony Pompliano, wasted no time putting new money to work.

Less than 24 hours after revealing a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. (CCCM) and a separate $775 million capital raise, the firm snapped up 3,724 bitcoin BTC$105,764.07 at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per coin.

The purchase kicks off a treasury program that could swell to $1 billion in bitcoin once the SPAC transaction closes and the combined company, to be called ProCap Financial, lists on Nasdaq.

It comes after the company revealed it raised $550 million through a preferred equity offering and an additional $225 million in convertible notes. If the company was already publicly traded, it would rank as the 14th biggest BTC holder among listed companies, just below Semler Scientific, according to Bitcointreasuries.com.

PropCap BTC has argued that bitcoin is now the new ‚Äúhurdle rate‚Äù for capital deployment. ‚ÄúIf you can't beat it, you have to buy it,‚Äù it wrote in a press release.

The firm plans on leveraging its bitcoin in yield-generating strategies.

Multiple analysts have repeatedly pointed to $120,000 as bitcoin's BTC$105,764.07 price target this year. Recent developments have strengthened that bullish case, driven by four key factors: the spot price, central bank policy, energy market trend, and technical setup.

Let's take a look at those in detail.

Recently, a crypto trader said that the best marketing for any asset is its price, highlighting an idea which is similar to legendary trader George Soros' theory of reflexivity. Soros explained that market perceptions and prices create a feedback loop ‚Äì higher prices attract more buyers, which in turn drive prices higher, often far beyond what fundamentals suggest.

In this context, bitcoin's resilience, marked by prices holding largely above $100,000 through the Iran-Israel conflict and the U.S. airstrike on Iran, is its strongest appeal.

The steadfastness indicates underlying strength, which could reassure holders while attracting new buyers, potentially fueling the next leg higher in prices. Moreover, brief dips below $100,000 seen in the past 48 hours saw investors step in with bids, revealing the ""buy the dip mentality.""

""We are seeing exchange outflows, so it is likely that people, regardless of being retail or institutions, are buying the dip. Generally, when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tend to be heavy short-term dips, which later rebound depending on the severity and how the situation is communicated. So far, I'd say we are seeing the situation play out similarly here,"" Nicolai Soendergaard, research analyst at Nansen, told CoinDesk in an email Monday.

Meanwhile, data tracked by Glassnode shows weak hands began selling on June 10, while conviction buyers resorted to bargain hunting.

""Since June 10, BTC investors classified as Loss Sellers rose 29% (from $74K to $95.6K), showing growing pressure on weak hands. But Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn't collapsing. Some are cutting losses - others are actively lowering their cost basis,"" Glassnode said on X.

Liquidity easing, represented by Fed rate cuts and other measures, typically bodes well for stocks and cryptocurrencies. Some Fed officials are warming up to the idea of a potential rate cut in July, which contradicts Chairman Jerome Powell's data-dependent stance.

""Trump seems to have found his doves,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst and Managing Editor, Adam Button wrote on Monday after Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, a hawk, said the central bank should cut rates in July.

Hawks are those who prefer tighter monetary policy and higher rates to temper inflation. Doves are policymakers preferring lower rates to support growth.

Bowman said that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer and could be smaller than initially expected, adding that she would support lowering the interest rate next month, assuming inflation pressures remain contained.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller voiced a similar opinion Friday, favoring a rate cut in July.

""Now, maybe it's just a coincidence that two former hawks who are also Republicans are suddenly doves, but it's starting to look like a MAGA takeover of the Fed. And if there's one thing [President Donald] Trump has been consistent about through his entire career (and it might only be one single thing), it's that he likes low interest rates,"" Button wrote.

Chairman Powell's semiannual monetary policy testimony to the U.S. Congress is due on Tuesday. Powell is likely to reiterate the Fed's independence and data-dependent stance while potentially being grilled by Republicans for keeping rates elevated.

Never before has the crowd been so wrong on crude oil. On Sunday, the consensus was that the U.S. military strikes on Iran and Tehran's potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz would send oil prices skywards.

But on Monday, oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic crashed. The slide is good news for central banks fearing the second-order effects of the oil price spike seen late last week, and those expecting rate cuts. 

The second-order effects typically include increased transportation expenses, higher prices for goods reliant on oil-derived products, and potential wages, all leading to an overall increase in inflation.

""So much for the fear of second order effects of Oil that Central Bankers proclaim. Crude oil down 6.5% on the day and 15.41% YoY..that's deflation,"" James E. Thorne, chief market strategist at Wellington Atlus, said on X.

Momentum indicators ‚Äì key moving averages ‚Äì are once again aligned bullishly.

The 100-day simple moving average (SMA) has just crossed above the 200-day SMA, weeks after the 50- and 200-day SMAs produced a bullish golden crossover.

The result is that the three widely-tracked averages are stacked one above the other in a classic upward-sloping bullish momentum formation. A similar configuration emerged in November last year and remained intact throughout the entire rally from $70,000 to $100,000.

 Digital Asset raised $135 million from Goldman Sachs, Citadel and others to scale its Canton Network and drive tokenization of real-world assets in finance. 

Institutional blockchain infrastructure provider Digital Asset raised $135 million from investors including Goldman Sachs and Citadel.

According to a Tuesday announcement, Digital Asset raised $135 million in a strategic funding round led by DRW Venture Capital and Tradeweb Markets, with participation from financial heavyweights including Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, BNP Paribas and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Crypto-focused backers included Paxos, Polychain Capital and Circle Ventures.

Digital Asset said the funding is intended to accelerate the adoption of institutional and decentralized finance on its Canton Network.

Canton Network is a permissionless layer-1 blockchain that offers configurable privacy and institutional-grade compliance. With the new capital, Digital Asset hopes to expand the integration of ‚Äúbillions‚Äù of real-world assets (RWAs) into the network.

Digital Assets had not answered Cointelegraph's request for comment by publication.

Digital Asset and a group of firms, including Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and Deloitte, announced the Canton Network in May 2023. In September 2024, Digital Asset and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) completed their US Treasury Collateral Network pilot project on the Canton Network.

In early October 2024, Digital Asset completed another large pilot project with clearing and settlement service Euroclear, the World Gold Council and global law firm Clifford Chance. As part of this initiative, gold and bonds ‚Äî Eurobonds and gilts ‚Äî were tokenized on the Canton Network.

As of mid-March 2024, the Canton Network had seen institutional investors execute over 350 simulated transactions via distributed ledger technology in areas such as tokenized assets, fund registry, digital cash, repo, securities lending and margin management. The tests involved 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, three exchanges and Paxos. Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset, said:

RWAs surged in the first half of 2025 amid increasing regulatory clarity. The total RWA market increased by over 260% during the first half of 2025, surpassing $23 billion in total valuation.

The RWA industry is a hot spot of development. Earlier this month, cryptocurrency payment platform Alchemy Pay expanded into RWAs through a new partnership with tokenization firm Backed, allowing access to tokenized US investment products.

Also, this month, US investment manager Guggenheim expanded its digital commercial paper offering through a partnership with Ripple. As a result, the firm's fixed-income product will be available on the XRP Ledger.

 Turkey's Finance Ministry plans new rules requiring crypto platforms to collect source and purpose data, with limits on stablecoin transfers. 

Turkey is preparing to impose stricter regulations on crypto transactions to combat money laundering and financial crime, according to information obtained by the state-run Anadolu Agency (AA).

Under the proposed measures, crypto platforms will be required to collect detailed information on the origin and purpose of every transfer. Users will be required to provide a transaction description of at least 20 characters for each transfer, AA said in a Tuesday report.

In addition to transaction descriptions, platforms will be required to apply holding periods on crypto withdrawals when the Travel Rule does not apply. These include a 48-hour delay for most withdrawals and a 72-hour delay for the first withdrawal from any account.

The regulations are part of a broader crackdown by the Ministry of Treasury and Finance, which is accelerating its oversight of crypto asset service providers (CASPs).

According to the report, the ministry will also introduce daily and monthly limits on stablecoin transfers to prevent the rapid outflow of illicit funds, especially from crimes like illegal betting and fraud. Users will be limited to $3,000 per day and $50,000 per month.

Platforms that fully comply with Travel Rule obligations, including the collection of full sender and recipient identity details, will be permitted to apply these limits at double the threshold.

Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet ≈ûim≈üek told AA that the goal is to curb criminal misuse without stifling legitimate activity. ‚ÄúLeft-wing space for legitimate crypto asset activities will be maintained,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIn addition to administrative sanctions, various legal and financial sanctions, including denial of license or cancellation, may be imposed on platforms that do not comply with the new regulations,‚Äù ≈ûim≈üek said.

Notably, transfers related to liquidity provision, market making and arbitrage (where users can prove the source of funds) will be exempt from the limits provided they are monitored under the responsibility of the relevant platform.

The recent proposed rules mark one of Turkey's most comprehensive steps to align its crypto regulations with international standards, including frameworks such as the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework.

In March, Turkey's Capital Markets Board (CMB) introduced licensing and operational rules for CASPs. The framework grants the CMB full authority over crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and custodians, aligning national oversight with global regulatory standards.

The rules set strict requirements for establishing CASPs in Turkey, including criteria for executive backgrounds, shareholder structures and minimum capital thresholds. Crypto exchanges must hold at least $4.1 million in capital, while custodians need $13.7 million.

 Japan's FSA proposed classifying crypto as financial products, potentially allowing ETFs and a flat 20% capital gains tax. 

Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) proposed a sweeping reclassification of cryptocurrencies that would clear a path for the launch of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and introduce a flat 20% tax on digital asset income.

The proposal, introduced on Tuesday, suggests recognizing crypto as ‚Äúfinancial products‚Äù under the scope of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), the same regulatory framework that governs securities and traditional financial products.

The proposed reclassification could also shift Japan's current progressive tax system, which taxes crypto gains at rates up to 55%, to a uniform 20%, mirroring the treatment of stocks. That change could make crypto investing more attractive to both retail and institutional players.

The proposed shift is part of the Japanese government's broader ‚ÄúNew Capitalism‚Äù strategy, which seeks to position the country as an investment-led economy.

Related: What Japan's fiscal debt crisis means for global crypto markets

The move comes amid increasing interest in crypto as a legitimate investment asset. According to the FSA, more than 12 million domestic crypto accounts were active as of January 2025, with assets held on platforms exceeding 5 trillion Japanese yen (about $34 billion).

In the proposal, the FAS also revealed that crypto ownership now surpasses participation in some traditional financial products, such as FX and corporate bonds, particularly among tech-savvy retail investors.

The proposal also responds to the surge in institutional engagement worldwide. The FSA cited data showing over 1,200 financial institutions, including US pension funds and Goldman Sachs, now hold US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Japanese regulators aim to support similar developments domestically, especially as global fund flows into crypto continue to expand.

In April, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMBC), TIS Inc., Ava Labs and Fireblocks signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore the commercialization of stablecoins in Japan. The collaboration will focus on issuing stablecoins pegged to both the US dollar and Japanese yen.

The group also plans to examine the use of stablecoins for settling tokenized real-world assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate.

In March, Japan issued its first license allowing a company to deal with stablecoins to SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of the local financial conglomerate SBI, which said it was preparing to support Circle's USDC (USDC).

The Game Theory Hidden in the Mind of Sherlock Holmes

In the early 20th century, a mathematician and economist sought the optimal strategy for Holmes to escape Moriarty's pursuit

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

CSA-Printstock/Getty Images

Looking at my bookshelf, I'm stricken with guilt: the collected Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle have been sitting untouched for years. Unfortunately, I never got past the fantastic television adaptation starring Benedict Cumberbatch to read the source material. But happily for Holmes, the British detective has a following the world over.

In fact, stories about the ingenious sleuth and his brilliant nemesis, Professor James Moriarty, so appealed to mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern that they played a role in the creation of game theory in the early 20th century. This mathematical discipline explores the strategies for solving various decision-making problems. Take the classic ‚Äúcake problem,‚Äù which posits that the fairest way for two people to split a cake such that each gets as much as possible requires one person to try to cut the cake into two equal pieces and the other to select a slice. Morgenstern and von Neumann did not devise this solution (it has been known since ancient times), but it is a good illustration of how game theorists devise optimal strategies.

The pair were particularly taken by a scenario described by Doyle in his short story ‚ÄúThe Final Problem,‚Äù in which Moriarty pursues Holmes to a platform at Victoria station in London. There Moriarty sees Holmes jump onto a train to Dover. Moriarty can no longer board the train. He therefore hires a single motorized railroad carriage in pursuit. Holmes's train does not go straight to Dover, however, but stops at Canterbury on the way. So Moriarty has to make a decision: Should he stop in Canterbury, in the hope that Holmes will get off the train there, or travel all the way to Dover? Holmes, too, must weigh his choices. From Dover, he can flee to the European mainland. He knows that Moriarty may expect that outcome and wait for him there, though, so maybe Holmes should get off the train at Canterbury. But what if that is exactly what Moriarty wants Holmes to think?

This scenario intrigued Morgenstern and von Neumann, who ultimately came to the conclusion in their 1944 foundational book that ‚ÄúSherlock Holmes is as good as 48% dead when his train pulls out from Victoria Station.‚Äù But how could they put such a precise figure on it? And how should Holmes act to escape his adversary? All this can be answered with the help of game theory.

The first thing to consider is that the clever Holmes and Moriarty are each likely to guess what the other is thinking. (‚ÄúIf he thinks that I think that he thinks....‚Äù) These considerations could easily land Holmes in an endless logic loop with no way out.

Holmes should therefore assume that Moriarty will foresee his decision in either case and limit the damage accordingly. In other words, the detective ought to optimize his decision with the most pessimistic assumptions in mind. This strategy was published by von Neumann as early as 1928 and was used to demonstrate that a player's profit can be maximized if one assumes that one's opponent intends to deal the greatest possible damage.

With no clear winning strategy‚Äîunlike in the cake problem‚Äîonly chance can help. Consider games such as rock-paper-scissors: as soon as one player picks a pattern, the opponent can exploit it to win. The best strategy is therefore to select scissors, rock and paper equally, with a probability of one third each. On average, both parties should then win and lose equally often, minimizing their damage.

The case of Holmes and Moriarty is a bit more complex. To understand this point, it helps to go through the various possible scenarios individually and weight them using numbers, as von Neumann and Morgenstern did. The two mathematicians decided to use values between ‚Äì100 and 100, with a high value symbolizing a particularly rewarding situation for a given person. The exact numerical values (known as payoffs) chosen for each situation are subjective, but this subjective weighting can then be used to make an optimal decision from an objective point of view.

Morgenstern and von Neumann determined that four different situations could ultimately occur. First, Moriarty and Holmes could both travel to Dover, where Moriarty would assassinate the detective. For Moriarty, this is optimal, so it corresponds to a payoff of 100. For Holmes, on the other hand, it is a disastrous ‚Äì100 outcome.

Second, Moriarty could get off the train at Canterbury while Holmes travels to Dover. This is bad news for Moriarty because Holmes could flee to the European continent, making it even harder to catch him. This situation is therefore weighted at ‚Äì50 for Moriarty. For Holmes, on the other hand, it is a positive outcome, so von Neumann and Morgenstern give it a value of 50.

In the third scenario, Moriarty travels to Dover, but Holmes has already disembarked at Canterbury. This is bad for Moriarty but at least better than the case described above. The situation can therefore be weighted 0 for him; the same applies to Holmes, who is still stuck in England.

In the final case, both Moriarty and Holmes disembark in Canterbury. This would be optimal for Moriarty, a clear 100, and would mean death for Holmes, whose payoff is ‚Äì100.

Each person aims to maximize their payoff. With no clear optimum decision, however, Holmes and Moriarty must rely on chance. Here things get more interesting. For example, they could each flip a coin to decide whether they get off at Canterbury or Dover. If Moriarty stops at Canterbury, the expected value of Holmes's payoff is: 0.5 √ó 50 ‚Äì 0.5 √ó 100 = ‚Äì25. If, on the other hand, Holmes gets off the train at Canterbury, the expected value for Holmes is ‚Äì0.5 √ó 100 + 0.5 √ó 0 = ‚Äì50. In total, Holmes's expected payoff is therefore ‚Äì0.5 √ó 25 ‚Äì 0.5 √ó 50 = ‚Äì37.5. Moriarty's payoffs have the same magnitude but the opposite sign.

Even worse: In a scenario when their decision hinges on a coin flip, Holmes will die with a probability of 50 percent. That's because Moriarty will murder the detective if both men get off at the same place, which has a probability of 0.5 in each scenario. This results in a probability of death of 0.5 √ó 0.5 + 0.5 √ó 0.5 = 50 percent.

Holmes has statistically better odds if he follows a different probability distribution‚Äîif, for instance, he flips a coin that will land on heads or tails unequally. Let's assume that Holmes chooses Dover with a probability of p and that Moriarty does so with a probability of q (correspondingly, the two players travel to Canterbury with a probability of 1 ‚Äì p and 1 ‚Äì q, respectively). If Moriarty travels to Dover, Holmes's expected payoff is: ‚Äì100 √ó p + 0 x (1 ‚Äì p) = ‚Äì100p. If, on the other hand, Moriarty gets off at Canterbury, Holmes's payoff is: 50 √ó p ‚Äì 100 x (1 ‚Äì p) = 150p ‚Äì 100.

In the first case (if Moriarty travels to Dover), Holmes's payoff decreases as p increases; in the second, it increases. To prepare for the worst situation, Holmes should therefore choose the p for which the payoffs are the same‚Äîregardless of Moriarty's decision. To do this, both expected values must be made equal: 150p ‚Äì 100 = ‚Äì100p. If you solve the equation for p, you get the value 0.4. This means that Holmes should travel to Dover with a probability of 40 percent and leave the train at Canterbury with a probability of 60 percent.

Incidentally, the same reasoning applies to Moriarty, only in reverse. If you carry out the calculation in the same way, you end up with q = 0.6; this means that Moriarty should travel to Dover with a 60 percent probability. Holmes's overall chance of survival in this scenario is therefore: (probability that Holmes is in Dover) √ó (probability that Moriarty is in Canterbury) + (probability that Holmes is in Canterbury) √ó (probability that Moriarty is in Dover) = 52 percent, slightly higher than if both had flipped a coin.

In this way, von Neumann and Morgenstern cracked the dilemma Holmes faced, at least from a mathematical point of view. But what happens in the short story?

Holmes and Moriarty have neither a rigged coin nor a random number generator with them. Nevertheless, they follow the laws of game theory. Holmes gets off the train in Canterbury and watches as Moriarty happily travels toward Dover in his single carriage, unaware that Holmes has evaded him.

The fact that Doyle opted for this version is more remarkable when you consider that game theory didn't exist yet, and he couldn't have known this was an optimal solution. It may have been coincidence‚Äîor he may have had good instincts. Either way, I'm reminded to take another look at his writing sometime soon.

To Make Better Choices, Understand How Your Brain Processes Values

The brain weighs factors based on their importance to oneself and one's social world as part of a complex calculation that shapes behavior

By Daisy Yuhas

Much has been made of the power of habit. We're encouraged to make healthy choices our default and to understand the way that the brain sets certain tasks, such as our morning commute, on autopilot to improve our efficiency.

But what about our more intentional, conscious day-to-day choices? The decisions we ponder‚Äîover seconds or lengthy deliberation‚Äîrely in part on the value system, which weighs in on the subjective evaluations we make, tipping the scales toward one choice over another. ‚ÄúWhen we understand how the value system works, we can recognize many possible paths to our goals,‚Äù says Emily Falk, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania and author of What We Value.

As the book explores, many people feel frustrated when they find themselves making choices that run counter to their big-picture goals‚Äîthings like exercising more, visiting older relatives or cutting back screen time. Falk introduces readers to the brain systems that calculate our priorities in the moment and the strategies for weighting those decisions toward what matters most to each person. In the process, she offers a compassionate framework for recognizing how we make choices and why change can be so challenging.

Scientific American spoke with Falk about how the brain sifts through options and how reflecting on our priorities can help align our behaviors with long-term aims.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

So how does the brain assign value?

When we're making a decision, the brain first identifies the different things that we might be choosing between.Then the brain's valuation system takes input from many other systems, including the ones that help us process emotions, think about ourselves, and help us understand other people's thoughts and feelings.

It integrates that information and assigns a subjective value to each option. Then we choose the one that we expect will be most rewarding. Finally, after we make the choice, the brain keeps track of how things went to see whether something we thought would be rewarding was as good as we predicted.

Ultimately, that valuation system provides a final common pathway in arriving at our subjective evaluations across very different things‚Äîwhether relationship partners, food choices or financial decisions.

As just one example of factors that influence these value calculations, in January my colleagues and I published findings that showed people are more likely to share news stories with others when they reflect on why that article is relevant to themselves and their social worlds. And we've seen, in this and in past research, how that desire to share news relates to activity in the brain's self-reference and social cognition systems.

How might understanding these systems change the way people think about their choices or behavior?

We know that one important input for the value system is self-relevance, or how much something feels psychologically meaningful or close to oneself. And we tend to confound self and value. Neuroscientific research shows a deep intertwining of these self and values systems.

Sometimes that is good in terms of maintaining a coherent sense of self and a positive sense of self. The problem is that we may hold on to notions of what we did and who we are beyond the point when they are useful.

As another example, people prefer rewards that are close in time or instantly gratifying. Understanding how the brain works also highlights how other kinds of psychological [closeness or] distance work in a similar way.

Scientists have studied how the medial prefrontal cortex, which is important to both the value and self-relevance systems, handles multiple kinds of psychological distance in a similar way. For instance, people are more motivated to choose something when you expect the rewards will come sooner or involve something geographically close or people who feel socially close. But you can make rewards feel psychologically closer. Scientists have done that by asking people to imagine otherwise distant scenarios in concrete ways. You can vividly imagine how your future self will spend money in retirement as an incentive to save now or envision the transformative consequences for a specific child of donating to UNICEF to increase your giving.

In your research, you've looked at another strategy, what psychologists call values affirmation, and found it can help people make better decisions for themselves in the long term. Can you explain more?

Lots of research shows that when we are reminded of the things that are most important to us‚Äî‚Äúcapital-V‚Äù values such as kindness or friendship and family‚Äîwe are more open to changing our behaviors.

For example, in studies that our team has run, sedentary people are more likely to become physically active after being asked to affirm their values by identifying the most important ones on a list and then envisioning themselves in various scenarios that tap into those values. So if you choose friends and family, we might ask you to imagine a time in the future when you connect with a family member, and they help you with a challenge. When we look at brain activity, we see that when thinking about what matters most, core parts of the value and self-relevance systems become active.

We also find people are less defensive and more open to change after reflecting on their most important values. So if we have people do this type of values affirmation before we give them messages intended to coach them toward healthier choices‚Äîsuch as reminders to exercise‚Äîwe see that the people who affirmed their values show more activity in the value and self-relevance systems in the brain than others who did not do that affirmation. And then when we follow our participants over the next month‚Äîsending out more value-reflection prompts and reminders to be active‚Äîthe ones who showed that greater brain activation were ultimately less sedentary.

Why would thinking about family and friends change someone's inclination to exercise?

In many value affirmation studies, the value does not have an obvious connection to the behavior. Instead the idea is that thinking about what really matters to you helps you zoom out and consider the big picture. Affirming your values‚Äîby writing about what you care about most, choosing values from a list or imagining situations that involve those values‚Äîcan ground you.

In addition, self-transcendent values, which connect you to something outside of yourself, such as friends and family or spirituality, are more effective than purely self-focused values at helping people make changes. People who connect with those self-transcendent values on a regular basis, and people who have a stronger sense of purpose, get health and well-being benefits that don't accrue when we focus on more self-focused values such as personal money, fame and power.

All of this suggests that people who keep their big-picture ideas and goals top of mind‚Äîfor example, through regular reminders of their big-picture values‚Äîgain some advantages when it comes to decision-making, right?

Yes. Feeling purposeful means having a clear picture of what you're trying to do and why. It can be like a North Star that helps us think about the path from where we are now to where we want to be.

But it isn't just that some people are purposeful and others are not. People's sense of purpose fluctuates, on a day-to-day basis, around whatever their baseline is. This is helpful to keep in mind because it highlights that we can do things that might change how purposeful we feel on a given day and what benefits we get as a result. For example, day-to-day choices and physical health relate to purpose. Exercise, sleep, mood, connecting with other people and sense of purpose relate to one another in a web of wellness. When we actively choose to prioritize one of these, we can get benefits in lots of other areas for free.

The urns, found in Brazil's Amazon Rainforest, aren't the product any known culture, according to experts.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

If a tree falls in the Amazon, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? While you were busy trying to answer that question, local villagers heard the tree fall and, upon checking out the commotion, found a collection of mysterious urns that had been buried underneath the toppled tree.

The urns pose plenty of still-unanswered questions about the people that once lived there and made the pots. Shortly after locals found the cache of mysterious containers, a team of archaeologists came to investigate and, upon cracking open the urns, discovered the remains of humans and animals, including turtles.

The discovery, made in a remote village in Brazil's Amazon Rainforest interior, included seven urns, two of which were larger than the rest. Archaeologists from the Mamirau√° Institute said in a translated statement the funerary urns contained a mix of pre-Hispanic human and animal skeletons, in addition to being made with a rare ceramic material. 

The human remains were intermingled with that of fish and turtles, likely part of a ritual burial practice. Coupled with the unusual ceramic techniques, archaeologist Ge√≥rgea Layla Holanda said the pots and remains could be from an unknown multicultural society that can reveal new clues about the way of life in the M√©dio Solim√µes region. 

The large urns were without lids, suggesting they were once sealed with organic material that has since decomposed. Located only 16 inches deep, Holanda said they were likely once buried ‚Äúbeneath old houses.‚Äù 

The ceramics were covered in green clay, a rare practice seen at a few other locations in the heavily forested M√©dio Solim√µes region. Along with the green clay, the team found red stripes added to the pots. Still, according to the release, there's no direct link between these pots and known ceramic traditions. 

Discovered at the Cochila Lake archaeological site, known for artificial islands constructed an unknown number of centuries ago, the area is a hotbed for ancient ingenuity. ‚ÄúThese artificial islands are raised archaeological structures on high floodplains, with material removed from other areas and mixed with ceramic fragments, intentionally positioned to give support,‚Äù archaeologist M√°rcio Amaral said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt's a very sophisticated indigenous engineering technique, which demonstrated significant land management and population density in the past.‚Äù 

Villagers from S√£o L√°zaro do Arumandubinha and other communities worked with the archaeologists to excavate the urns and move them on canoes to a laboratory where researchers hope to gain a deeper understanding of their origins. 

‚ÄúSome community members saw the pots when a tree fell and left the roots exposed, but they didn't give it much importance,‚Äù Walfredo Cerqueira, a liaison with the villagers, said in a statement, adding that when he saw the photos, he started the process of getting in touch with archaeologists. ‚ÄúFrom there, we started planning the trip to the site.‚Äù

To excavate the urns, archaeologists had to construct wooden structures just to get to the site in the river-heavy location. Once excavated, it took the urns up to 12 hours to travel via river canoe‚Äîand sometimes through tight streams and flooded areas‚Äîto the laboratory. ‚ÄúThe community showed a care and skill that often surpass the urban shippers,‚Äù Holanda said. ‚ÄúThanks to this meticulous work, the urns arrived intact.‚Äù 

The urns were wrapped in plastic film and bubble wrap before being placed in wooden supports. Ropes helped enable the lifting of the urns into the canoes. 

Finding a burial site questions the traditional view that the floodplain areas were only places of passage or sporadic occupation, instead indicating a continuous presence of people highly adapted to the environment.

Earth's innards are rumbling, and it's not indigestion.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Deep beneath Earth's surface are layers of soil, rock strata often embedded with fossils, gurgling magma, and‚Äîback up. Before your Journey to the Center of the Earth mission can get any further, you're going to have to get past flows of solid rock. 

The D‚Äù layer‚Äîlocated between layers of magma above and the liquid rock of the outer core below‚Äîhas been mystifying scientists for decades. This is in part because if you were to plunge down 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles), you would be jump-scared by seismic waves that accelerate when they hit the threshold of the D‚Äù layer. It used to be thought the reason for this was the mineral perovskite, found in the lower mantle, morphing into a form known as post-perovskite close to the D‚Äù layer. But that still wasn't enough to explain the phenomenon. 

Geoscientist Motohiko Murakami wanted to investigate what could possibly be going on to cause the strange seismic wave acceleration known as the D‚Äù discontinuity. Because trekking to the core-mantle boundary (CMB) where the D‚Äù layer lies is obviously not an option, he led a team of researchers from Switzerland and Japan in running lab tests and computer simulations to find out what post-perovskite had to do with he unusual increase in seismic waves.

Post-perovskite crystals are anisotropic, meaning their physical properties are different when measured in different directions. They have two different types of textures‚Äîone comes from transformation (the phase transition from the perovskite phase to post-perovskite), and the other is a result of deformation (when post-perovskite crystals turn to face in the same direction). Murakami and his team found out that it isn't just transformation that causes the rumbling. It actually happens with deformation.

‚ÄúThe deformation-induced texture forms when crystals undergo plastic deformation, causing their orientations to align in specific directions. It is mainly produced by dislocation slip or creep,‚Äù Murakami said in a study recently published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment. 

How post-perovskite crystals are aligned determines their hardness, and the speed at which seismic waves move through them depends on how hard they are. Materials called perovskites can be created from any substances capable of being arranged into the same cubic crystal structure. Perovskite is a calcium titanium oxide mineral (CaTiO3), while post-perovskite is a form of magnesium silicate (MgSiO3) achieved at extremely high pressures. Its crystal structure is orthorhombic, meaning that the right angles of the cubes have unequal axes.

For post-perovskite crystals to align with each other, the axes all have to be in the same position. Murakami used MgGeO3 to create crystals analogous to post-perovskite. Like perovskite, MgGeO3 crystals deform easily when pressure is applied, so how they behaved would reflect was is going on over a thousand miles underground. The crystals were heated by a laser, compressed, and heated again to synthesize post-perovskite. They were then exposed to high-pressure sound waves, and the wave velocity was measured once those waves passed through the crystals.

It turned out that sound waves can experience a substantial increase in velocity when passing through aligned post-perovskite crystals. Researchers also discovered that the cause of this alignment‚Äîwhich determines the hardness of the material, and therefore the speed of sound waves in the lab and seismic waves deep in Earth‚Äîis convection. As hotter material rises, cooler material sinks, as it does in convective storms like hurricanes. 

Murakami thinks that convection of materials in the mantle (such as plumes rising and slavs sinking) is behind the deformation in the D‚Äù layer. This is the first time any evidence‚Äîeven lab-based evidence‚Äîhas been found for Earth's innards moving. 

‚ÄúWhile previous theoretical work has suggested that anisotropy could explain the observed seismic discontinuities,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur results, obtained through in situ measurements of post-perovskite velocities under high pressure, represent the experimental verification of this hypothesis, bridging the gap between theory and observation.‚Äù

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","USC's new AI implant promises drug-free relief for chronic pain","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250623233327.htm","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:10:16 GMT","

Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that severely impacts quality of life, often leading to reliance on opioid medications with their severe side effects and addiction risks. According to the U.S. Pain Foundation, 51.6 million Americans live with chronic pain. For over 17 million sufferers, their chronic pain is high-impact - frequently limiting their life or work activities.

Current implantable electrical stimulators offer an alternative by stimulating the spinal cord to block pain signals from reaching the brain. But these devices come with drawbacks like high cost, invasive surgery, and the need for frequent battery replacements. Now, researchers from the Zhou Lab in USC Viterbi's Alfred E. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering, in collaboration with the Jun Chen Group at UCLA, have developed a revolutionary solution: a flexible ultrasound-induced wireless implantable (UIWI) stimulator secured to the spine and designed for personalized, self-adaptive chronic pain management.

This groundbreaking device, detailed in Nature Electronics, represents a significant leap forward in pain therapy. While current spinal cord stimulators can be unwieldy and are hard-wired to batteries, the new device is designed to bend and twist with movement and is powered by a wearable ultrasound transmitter without the need for a battery. It also harnesses machine learning algorithms to customize treatment for each patient. The work was led by Zohrab A. Kaprielian Fellow in Engineering Qifa Zhou, who is also a professor of ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.

Pain Relief on Demand: How the Implantable Stimulator Works

At the heart of this innovation is its wireless power supply, eliminating the need for bulky batteries and complex wired interfaces that often require repeated surgeries. The UIWI stimulator receives its energy from an external, wearable ultrasound transmitter (WUT). Ultrasound offers a safe, effective non-invasive method for deep-tissue penetration. The device converts mechanical waves into electrical signals through a phenomenon called the piezoelectric effect. The core of the UIWI stimulator is a miniaturized piezoelectric element made from lead zirconate titanate (PZT), a highly efficient material for converting incoming ultrasound energy into the electrical power needed for stimulation.

""What truly sets this device apart is its wireless, smart and self-adaptive capability for pain management,"" Zhou said. ""We believe it offers great potential to replace pharmacological schemes and conventional electrical stimulation approaches, aligning with clinical needs for pain mitigation.""

Ph.D. candidate in the Zhou Lab and lead author Yushun (Sean) Zeng said the wireless smart miniaturized stimulator had the ability to produce sufficient electrical stimulation intensity by using ultrasound energy, resulting in a more personalized, targeted and localized treatment.

""This energy-converting type is critical for deep stimulation, as ultrasound is a non-invasive and highly penetrating energy in clinical and medical areas,"" Zeng said. ""By leveraging wireless ultrasonic energy transfer and closed-loop feedback system, this UIWI stimulator removes the necessity for bulky implanted batteries and allows for real-time, precisely adjustable pain modulation.""

""From a clinical standpoint, incorporating deep learning-based pain assessment enables dynamic interpretation and response to fluctuating pain states, which is essential for accommodating patient-specific variability."" added Zhou Lab Ph.D. candidate Chen Gong, also a lead author on the paper.

The device works by:

Detecting pain: The system continuously monitors brain recordings, specifically electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which reflect a patient's pain levels. Harnessing AI to assess pain levels: A sophisticated machine learning model, based on a neural network called ResNet-18, analyzes these brain signals and classifies pain into three distinct levels: slight pain, moderate pain, and extreme pain. This AI model boasts a 94.8% overall accuracy in distinguishing between these pain states. Adapting treatment as needed: Once a pain level is identified, the wearable ultrasound transmitter automatically adjusts the acoustic energy it transmits. The UIWI stimulator can then sense the propagated energy and convert it into electrical intensity, stimulating the spinal cord. This creates a closed-loop system that provides real-time, personalized pain management. The UIWI stimulator itself is flexible, bendable, and twistable, allowing for optimal placement on the spinal cord. The electrical stimulation it provides to the spinal cord works by rebalancing the signals that transmit and inhibit pain, effectively suppressing the sensation of pain.

Demonstrated Success in the Lab The Zhou Lab team tested the UIWI stimulator in rodent models, with results demonstrating its effectiveness for pain management.

Researchers successfully relieved chronic neuropathic pain caused by both mechanical stimuli (like a pin prick) and acute thermal stimuli (infrared heat).

Lab tests showed that treatment from the UIWI stimulator led to significant reductions in pain indicators. In one experiment to evaluate whether an animal associates an environment with pain relief, rodents showed a clear preference for the chamber where the pain management system was activated, further confirming the device's effectiveness.

The Future of Personalized Pain Relief

The successful development and testing of the UIWI stimulator mark a pivotal moment in the quest for advanced pain management. The flexible design of the implant and its integration with sophisticated AI algorithms offer a dynamic and personalized treatment approach that can adapt to the fluctuating and highly individual nature of chronic pain.

Looking ahead, Zhou and his collaborators are hoping for even more advanced applications of the device. Zhou said that future designs could miniaturize the components further, enabling less invasive device implantation -- for instance, with a syringe. The wearable ultrasound transmitter could also evolve into an untethered, miniaturized device or even a wearable ultrasound array patch, potentially combining imaging capabilities with energy delivery for real-time monitoring and targeted stimulation. Future iterations could also be controlled by smartphone software, offering even more robust personalized pain management.

Zhou said the aim of the device was to transform chronic pain management, moving beyond the limitations of current solutions to offer a truly personalized, intelligent, and effective pathway to pain relief.

Deep-sea mining in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean could harm ocean life including whales and dolphins, new research shows.

The Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) of the Eastern Pacific is a vast area of deep ocean and seamounts.

A Canadian firm - The Metals Company - is planning to explore parts of the CCZ for polymetallic nodules.

In two new studies, researchers found whales and dolphins - including an endangered sperm whale - in the CCZ, and raise concerns about impacts on a wide range of marine species.

""We know remarkably little about these ecosystems, which are hundreds of miles offshore and include very deep waters,"" said Dr Kirsten Young, from the University of Exeter.

""We do know many species here are long-lived and slow-growing, especially on the seabed.

""It's very hard to predict how seabed mining might affect these species and wider ecosystems, and these risks must urgently be assessed.""

Dr Young said noise from mining would travel great distances underwater - possibly hundreds of kilometres through a SOFAR channel.

One of the research papers reviews noise sensitivity among species known to live in the CCZ, and finds that only 35% of taxonomic classes there have been studied for noise impacts.

Soniferous fish, which rely on acoustic communication, are particularly vulnerable to noise.

Chronic exposure to mining noise might have cascading ecological consequences, disrupting key behaviours, the researchers say.

The second study is a survey of whales and dolphins, conducted from the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise.

Over 13 days of visual and acoustic monitoring, there were 74 acoustic detections and six sightings.

These included a sperm whale, Risso's dolphins, common dolphins and 70 dolphin groups that could not be identified to species level.

Dr Young said: ""If deep seabed mining becomes a reality, whales and dolphins will be exposed to multiple sources of noise throughout the water column.

""Many species are highly sensitive to certain frequencies - chronic ocean noise can mask social and foraging communications and whales could be displaced from critical habitats.

""The behavior and impact of sediment plumes created by mining is also poorly understood but could affect food webs.""

Louisa Casson of Greenpeace International said: ""The confirmed presence of cetaceans, including threatened sperm whales, in areas that The Metals Company is targeting for deep sea mining is yet another clear warning that this dangerous industry must never be allowed to begin commercial operations.""

The review paper, published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, is entitled: ""Noise from deep-sea mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean will impact a broad range of marine taxa.""

The whale and dolphin paper, published in Frontiers in Marine Science, is entitled: ""Threatened cetaceans in a potential deep seabed mining region, Clarion Clipperton Zone, Eastern Pacific.""

Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have developed a gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease that could help protect the brain from damage and preserve cognitive function. Unlike existing treatments for Alzheimer's that target unhealthy protein deposits in the brain, the new approach could help address the root cause of Alzheimer's disease by influencing the behavior of brain cells themselves.

Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people around the world and occurs when abnormal proteins build up in the brain, leading to the death of brain cells and declines in cognitive function and memory. While current treatments can manage symptoms of Alzheimer's, the new gene therapy aims to halt or even reverse disease progression.

Studying mice, the researchers found that delivering the treatment at the symptomatic stage of the disease preserved hippocampal-dependent memory, a critical aspect of cognitive function that is often impaired in Alzheimer's patients. Compared to healthy mice of the same age, the treated mice also had a similar pattern of gene expression, suggesting that the treatment has the potential to alter the behavior of diseased cells to restore them to a healthier state.

While further studies will be required to translate these findings into human clinical trials, the gene therapy offers a unique and promising approach to mitigating cognitive decline and promoting brain health.

The study, published in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, was led by senior author Brian Head, Ph.D., professor of anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs research career scientist, and co-senior author Shanshan Wang, M.D. Ph.D., an assistant professor of anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine. The gene therapy technology was licensed by UC San Diego to Eikonoklastes Therapeutics in 2021. Eikonoklastes was granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA for the use of the patented gene therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental health condition that negatively affects the mood of a person and causes a loss of interest in activities that were previously associated with happiness. In addition to Ôªøcognitive impairments and forgetfulness, MDD can significantly affect Ôªøsocial and occupational areas of functioning. Studies investigating the pathophysiology of MDD indicate that several immune factors and cells -- such as brain glial cells -- play a key role in driving neuroinflammation, ultimately contributing to the development of MDD.Ôªø

Microglial cells, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), regulate inflammatory responses by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines -- chemical signaling molecules. While the neuroinflammatory functions of microglial cells are well-documented, the exact role of astrocytes (a specialized type of glial cell) in neural growth and development has remained unclear until recently. To shine light on the Ôªørole of astrocytes in neuroinflammation and in the pathophysiology of MDD, a team of researchers, led by Dr. ÔªøGaurav Singhal Ôªøfrom the Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, USA, conducted an in-depth review of literature. Their findings will be published in ÔªøNeuroprotection.

Explaining the motivation behind the present study, Dr. Singhal says, ""ÔªøMDD is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and affects more than 280 million people across all age groups and regions. ÔªøMoreover, the economic burden of MDD is substantial, with annual costs in the United States alone exceeding $326 billion. Gaining insights into Ôªøthe role of astrocytes in neuroinflammation can aid the development of therapeutic approaches to treat depression and other psychiatric disorders.""

The research team began by conducting a comprehensive literature search using widely used online repositories such as PubMed and Google Scholar. They evaluated 226 research papers relevant to astrocytes, neuroinflammation, and depression. To ensure the high quality of their study, they followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

ÔªøIn their analysis, the researchers found that astrocytes were key to maintaining the structural integrity of synaptic junctions between neurons. The release of neurotrophic factors such as Ôªøbrain-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 by astrocytes were critical for the promotion of neurite growth and synapse formation. Besides stabilizing the tripartite synapse comprising of neuron-astrocyte-neuron, astrocytes further facilitated the effective communication between neurons via regulation of the ionic environment. Notably, changes in astrocyte morphology and function were associated with poor synaptic connectivity, contributing to the development of depressive symptoms.

Furthermore, they discovered a critical mechanism involving activated microglia and astrocytes that resulted in sustained neuroinflammation in MDD. The first step of the mechanism was the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like Ôªøtumor necrosis factor-Œ± and Ôªøinterleukin-1 from activated microglia cells. These signals subsequently induced the secretion of additional inflammatory chemicals from astrocytes, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation.

Elaborating on the molecular Ôªøcrosstalk between microglia and astrocytes during MDD, Dr. Singhal explains, ""Increased intracellular calcium levels within astrocytes can induce the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which, in turn, triggers a delayed calcium response in microglial cells. Following multiple cycles of Ôªøastrocyte-released ATP-based activation, Ôªø Ôªømicroglial cells eventually undergo apoptosis or programed cell death.""

ÔªøAdditionally, preclinical studies involving murine models showed that astrocytic lactate dehydrogenase A enzyme, responsible for lactate production, is important for maintaining neuronal excitability. A process known as histone lactylation -- where lactate molecules are added to histone proteins in DNA -- was found to alter gene expression, thereby contributing to astrocyte-driven neuroinflammation.

Taken together, this study highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying astrocytic dysfunction, wherein astrocytes switch from a neuroprotective role to one that promotes neuroinflammation by increasing the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines.

Primates, birds, and elephants are all known to make tools, but examples of tool use among marine animals are much more limited. Reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on June 23, a team of whale experts has found widespread tool manufacture and usage in an endangered population of resident killer whales living in the Salish Sea -- part of the Pacific Ocean between British Columbia and Washington. The whales fashion tools from kelp and use them for grooming purposes.

""We found that southern resident killer whales regularly use lengths of bull kelp during social interactions, apparently as a tool to groom one another,"" says Michael Weiss (@CetaceanMike) of the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, WA. ""To find that the whales were not just using but also manufacturing tools, and that these objects were being used in a way never before reported in marine mammals, was incredibly exciting.""

Weiss and his team discovered this unexpected whale activity while conducting aerial observations of southern resident killer whales, which are a critically endangered whale population with fewer than 80 individuals left found in the Pacific Northwest. The team has been monitoring the whales since 2018 to learn more about their foraging and social behavior.

""While there are other killer whales around the world, the southern residents represent a genetically, ecologically, and culturally distinct population,"" says Weiss.

Through the high-resolution footage collected by their aircraft, the researchers found that the whales created tools by breaking off the ends of bull kelp stalks. They then pressed pieces of kelp against a partner and rolled the kelp between their bodies for long periods of time.

The researchers observed this behavior in whales across all social groups, both sexes, and all age classes. They found that whales were more likely to groom closely related whales or similarly aged partners. They also saw some evidence that whales with more molting or dead skin were more likely to engage in grooming, suggesting it may have a hygienic function.

""What I find most remarkable is that despite this apparently being a common behavior -- we see it most days we fly our drone over these whales -- it hadn't yet been discovered in this population despite nearly 50 years of dedicated observation,"" says Weiss. ""To me, this demonstrates not just the power of new observation methods but also how much we still have to learn about these animals.""

It remains unclear whether this grooming behavior is entirely unique to this population or more widespread among other whale populations and species. Regardless, the discovery opens new avenues for understanding tool use in marine mammals and demonstrates that tools can be used in a wide array of contexts, say the researchers.

""This finding highlights yet another way these whales' society and culture is unique and the importance of recovering the southern resident killer whale population,"" says Weiss.

New research has cast doubts over suggestions an incestuous social elite ruled over the ancient people of Ireland more than 5,000 years ago.

Researchers examined the evidence from burials of individuals at the Newgrange prehistoric monument in Ireland -- a large circular mound containing a chamber where cremated and unburnt human remains were placed, the discovery of which led to speculation that those buried there must have been from an elite class or a royal family.

In 2020, the DNA analysis of a bone skull fragment found in the chamber, however, suggested that at least one of the individuals buried there was the result of a relationship between two siblings or a parent and child, and was also distantly related to others buried in the chamber.

It is believed that only particular individuals were buried in the chamber and therefore they must have held a 'special' position in society. The assumption was that if an individual born of incest was placed in the chamber, that this practice must have been 'accepted' by society, possibly because it was 'common' among a ruling elite.

A research team, including the University of York and University College Dublin, however, have now shown that there is no corroborating evidence in nearby settlements, dietary practices, or trade, that an elite existed either economically or socially.

Researchers now believe the society at the time was more equal, based on the fact that they appeared to share and exchange resources, as well as live in similar dwellings.

Professor Penny Bickle from the University of York's Department of Archaeology, said: ""The evidence all points to a much more collective ethos. There are not wide disparities in diet, houses are relatively flimsy, and all similar to each other.

""There are no large settlement systems or trade mechanisms, and we also don't see production of craft on the scale that we see in other ancient societies such as in Ancient Egypt, where incest was thought to be practiced by the ruling elite.

""We can only begin to understand these monuments and tombs if we examine the social lives or the communities that built and use them, and when we start to do this, this idea of a 'social elite' or a form of royalty starts to appear less likely.""

Older than Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza, Newgrange is believed to have been built by a farming community that prospered in the Boyne Valley, County Meath, some 5,000 years ago. Newgrange was rediscovered in AD 1699 and its interior had been heavily disturbed prior to its modern excavation in the 1960s, and so researchers question whether this was even the original burial place of the skull fragment, referred to as NG10, dated to 3340 -- 3020 BC.

The genetic clustering in passage tombs, such as at Newgrange, typically reflects very distant biological relationships -- like second cousins or great-great-great-grandparents -- rather than close familial ties. To establish if the tombs were reserved for an elite, researchers say they would expect much closer genetic ties than they have seen at Newgrange.

It is more likely that these tombs were places that reflect family, work, and other social relationships, rather than the mark of an elite family group.

Associate Professor Jessica Smyth, from University College Dublin, said: ""People were definitely being selected for burial in passage tombs -- the whole community does not end up in these monuments. However, we don't know the reasons behind this selection, and why they were thought to be special.

""Unlike today, bodies don't tend to be buried 'whole' or 'intact' in this time period. Before they end up in megalithic monuments, bodies are broken down, sometimes cremated and even circulated around their communities.""

As so many of the dead found in these passage tombs were broken down and mixed with cremated remains, and possibly moved around to different places in the landscape, it is not clear the people who placed NG10 fragment in Newgrange knew who they were in life or who the parents of this individual were, casting further doubt on how 'special' the individual might have been.

Professor Penny Bickle said: ""It is by no means clear that the monument was the first burial site of NG10 and the tomb grew in stages, so tracing who this individual was is a very difficult task indeed. As it stands the incestuous origins of NG10 is a one-off compared to all of the DNA data we have for Neolithic Ireland.

""There are still many questions to solve here, but building this picture means looking at the monument together with the society that was built up around it, and from this, we get a step closer to understanding a community that was much more inclusive and equal than previously thought.""

The research is published in the journal Antiquity.

Now, writing in Chem, Muto, Yamaguchi, and co-workers report a one-pot multicomponent strategy that enables the in situ generation of oQDMs and their direct conversion into complex polycyclic compounds. This method relies on a palladium-catalysed convergent approach between three simple components: 2-vinylbromoarenes, diazo compounds and nucleophilic dienophiles (pictured).

The reaction proceeds through a palladium‚Äìcarbene intermediate, which enables a benzyl‚Äìpalladium coupling and elimination step to generate the oQDM species. The in situ obtained oQDM serves as a powerful diene and undergoes an immediate intramolecular Diels‚àíAlder reaction. This cascade provides access to a variety of benzo-fused polycyclic compounds without the need to isolate or handle unstable intermediates.

Ambitious international commitments have been made to preserve biodiversity, with the goal of preventing extinctions and maintaining ecosystem resilience, yet the efficacy of large-scale protection for preventing near-term extinctions remains unclear. Here, we used a trait-based approach to show that global actions‚Äîsuch as the immediate abatement of all threats across at least half of species ranges for ~10,000 bird species‚Äîwill only prevent half of the projected species extinctions and functional diversity loss attributable to current and future threats in the next 100‚Äâyears. Nonetheless, targeted recovery programmes prioritizing the protection of the 100 most functionally unique threatened birds could avoid 68% of projected functional diversity loss. Actions targeting ‚Äòhabitat loss and degradation' will prevent the greatest number of species extinctions and proportion of functional diversity loss relative to other drivers of extinction, whereas control of ‚Äòhunting and collection' and ‚Äòdisturbance and accidental mortality' would save fewer species but disproportionately boost functional richness. These findings show that conservation of avian diversity requires action partitioned across all drivers of decline and highlight the importance of understanding and mitigating the ecological impacts of species extinctions that are predicted to occur even under optimistic levels of conservation action.

Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, with implications for ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services1,2. Human activity has led to widespread decline in the extent and structural condition of ecosystems and changes in community trait composition3. High functional diversity‚Äîthe diversity of traits that describe an organism's ecological niche‚Äîhas been associated with greater ecosystem functioning4,5, more reliable ecosystem service delivery6 and greater ecosystem resilience7,8. Therefore, changes in community composition could undermine the persistence of natural communities. Owing to the potential importance of functional diversity in supporting ecosystem function and resilience9, identifying effective measures for conserving functional diversity alongside species richness is paramount10.

Ambitious policies and substantial conservation resources have been dedicated to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by reducing the impact of threats11. Programmes designed to alleviate threats at a large scale, a strategy referred to as threat abatement12, are essential for the long-term persistence of species; however, it remains unclear to what extent they can avert imminent extinctions and functional diversity loss. Previous studies have rarely extended past isolated analyses of single threats and their impacts on species richness or broader syntheses of the coverage of conservation targets13,14. The main alternative to threat abatement strategies is direct management interventions such as breeding programmes and translocations. These measures can be effective15,16, particularly for rare species or those that are vulnerable to human pressures17. However, targeted recovery programmes, including ex-situ conservation and in-situ measures to boost species survival and success, are often prohibitively expensive18, limiting their application as a global conservation strategy17. Therefore, conserving bird diversity can probably only be achieved with a combination of large-scale protection through threat abatement coupled with targeted species recovery programmes15,19. However, the extent to which abatement can reduce the need for intensive management to boost species population and reproductive success remains unclear.

Here, we used a trait-based approach to evaluate how much biodiversity and associated ecological function could be protected in the near term, defined as the next 100‚Äâyears, under different global conservation strategies. We assessed the probable success of strategies focusing on the abatement of current and future drivers of extinction and estimated whether shortfalls in efficacy can be countered through targeted species recovery programmes. We used a phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (PGLMM) to predict species extinction risk based on threats listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), accounting for non-independence geographically and across the avian tree of life. We quantified the importance of conserving unique species, which provide a disproportionate contribution to the global diversity of form and function in birds.

We projected expected bird extinctions for the next 100‚Äâyears based on IUCN Red List threat data20. We fitted a PGLMM implemented in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that predicted species assignment to Red List category with 86.8% accuracy (Supplementary Analyses), using data on threat scope and severity and including random effects describing the spatial and phylogenetic relationships among species. We then stochastically projected species extinctions based on expected probabilities of extinction for each Red List category (see Methods).

In the baseline extinction scenario, we assumed that human activity and natural threats would continue to impact bird populations as currently listed. In this scenario, we predicted that 5.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.2% (mean‚Äâ¬±‚Äâs.d.) of the 9,873 extant birds studied would go extinct in the next 100‚Äâyears (517‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ19 species) (Fig. 1); more than three times the recorded number of bird extinctions since 1500. This figure falls within the range of previously predicted bird extinctions, ranging from 226‚Äì589 species extinctions in the next 500 years21 to 669‚Äì738 species extinctions in the next 100 years22. Extinctions on this scale are expected to fundamentally alter the global bird assemblage, potentially reducing functional diversity23,24.

 a, Loss in species richness and functional richness under three scenarios: baseline extinction, partial abatement of all drivers of extinction and complete abatement of all drivers of extinction. Black points show mean loss across 1,000 iterations for each scenario, with variation in those points shown by their distribution (violin plots) and the individual values (grey dots). b, Diversity loss avoided under driver-specific complete abatement of six major drivers of extinction (circles represent the mean; error bars, 0.5‚Äâs.d.). Note that in some iterations, loss avoided could be negative, as more diversity was lost with driver-specific abatement than under the baseline scenario. The dotted diagonal line shows mean functional richness loss per species richness loss under complete abatement of all threats. Drivers above this line show greater avoidance of functional richness loss per species richness loss avoided relative to the mean across all drivers of extinction. Hunting, hunting and collection; climate, climate change and severe weather; invasive, invasive species, genes and disease; disturbance, disturbance and accidental mortality. Analyses based on 9,873 species (of which 2,087 species currently listed as Near Threatened or in threatened categories were modelled and could have reduced extinction risk in the abatement scenarios). A total of 1,000 iterations were run for each extinction scenario.

To quantify projected change in functional diversity in the world's avifauna (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ9,873), we used published data on 11 continuous morphological traits that collectively capture bird ecological niches through their well-established association with diet, dispersal and habitat25,26,27. These traits were summarized using the first three axes produced by phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA), which explained 87.2% of variance in the dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1), providing an overview of global avian functional diversity (Extended Data Fig. 2; see Methods). We estimated functional diversity using probabilistic hypervolumes28, which can be applied to multidimensional data and have been shown to be less sensitive to extreme trait values than other methods, such as convex hulls29. We quantified the volume of trait space occupied by the current global avian assemblage (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ9,873) as well as under future extinction scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 3). Under the baseline extinction scenario, functional diversity was projected to decrease by 3.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.4% in the next 100‚Äâyears relative to present-day functional diversity. This is probably a conservative estimate that only reflects loss in three-dimensional functional space and ignores internal erosion of the space23,30. Projected functional diversity loss varied between 2.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.9% and 3.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.4% when measured with two dimensions and four dimensions, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Threat abatement could prevent species extinctions and reduce functional diversity loss. However, it is unclear to what extent imminent biodiversity loss can be avoided, and what scale of action is required to prevent species extinctions and functional diversity loss altogether. Using our PGLMM model, we predicted how extinction risk would change under three management scenarios that reflect varying levels of threat abatement (see Methods and Fig. 2). Complete abatement involved removal of all direct drivers of extinction across the entirety of all species ranges; partial abatement involved removal of all direct drivers of extinction across at least half of all species ranges (threat spatial scopes downgraded to ‚ÄòMinority‚Äâ<‚Äâ50%'); and minimal abatement involved the removal of all direct drivers of extinction across at least 10% of all species ranges (threat spatial scopes downgraded to ‚ÄòMajority 50‚Äì90%').

 a, IUCN Red List data20 on threat scope and severity were used to assign projected population decline over a 10-year period or three generations, according to previous publications83,43. Data on projected population decline for all species and all threats were used in an MCMCglmm to predict IUCN extinction risk category, using phylogenetic and spatial variables as random effects. NT, Near Threatened; VU, Vulnerable; EN, Endangered; CR, Critically Endangered. b, Four extinction scenarios were used: baseline, in which current, future and likely-to-return threats remained as listed by the IUCN20; complete abatement, in which threats were removed across the entirety of the species range; partial abatement, in which threats were removed from at least 50% of the species range; and minimal abatement, in which threats were removed from at least 10% of the species range.

Under the complete abatement scenario, half of the biodiversity loss predicted under the baseline scenario could be prevented (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). However, an average loss of 2.6‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.2% of species richness (254‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ19 species) and 1.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.3% of functional richness remained. Given that our model did not include Least Concern species (for which threat data are scarce), it could not predict assignment to the Least Concern category. However, in reality, threat abatement could result in full recovery to Least Concern. To evaluate the impact of this on projected diversity loss, we tested the effect of assuming a low extinction probability of 0.0001 for the Near Threatened category, equal to the expected for the Least Concern category (1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí6 extinctions per species per year). We obtained similar estimates (241‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ18 species extinctions; 1.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.3% functional diversity loss; Supplementary Analyses), showing that lack of assignment of species to the Least Concern category under abatement scenarios did not notably affect our results.

Some extinctions were not preventable even with complete abatement; therefore, they were not attributable to current and future drivers of extinction. These extinctions could reflect particularly vulnerable species that have high extinction risk despite being affected by few threats, as well as species that were severely affected by past threats that can no longer be managed or abated. The model captured variation in species vulnerability to extinction that was not described by threats through spatial and phylogenetic random effects. The relevance of spatial and phylogenetic variables was supported by the fact that background extinction rates and extinctions owing to stochastic events varied by taxonomic group31 and across space32.

Deviations from expected extinction risk captured by spatial and phylogenetic variables could reflect fast or slow life history33, variation in overlap with areas of high human influence34 and isolation and connectivity35. These factors are expected to be important for explaining variation in both extinction risk and species recovery36,37,38 and often exhibit high degrees of spatial or phylogenetic correlation39,40,41. For example, island endemics are particularly sensitive to extinction because of their small and isolated ranges35, which may be captured through spatial random effects, and evolution of traits associated with increased extinction risk, such as flightlessness, which may be captured by phylogenetic random effects35. The Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor) is a Critically Endangered species that was predicted to be at risk of extinction even under complete abatement. Like many island species, it has a very small remaining population (60‚Äì70 individuals)42, and our analysis suggests that it is likely to go extinct without complementary measures such as habitat restoration or ex-situ conservation.

Our finding that even large-scale and ambitious actions leading to the removal of all present, future and likely-to-return threats will fail to prevent almost half of projected species extinctions challenges some of the key assumptions of global metrics used to track conservation progress. For example, the Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric43 is based on IUCN Red List data on threat scope and severity but assumes that complete threat abatement will allow the vast majority of species to be downgraded to Least Concern, an assumption that our findings did not support. Although those authors43 acknowledge that some species may require restoration to be downgraded to Least Concern, our results suggested that many species will require conservation measures in addition to threat abatement. Even when species are not affected by current or future threats, they may still be threatened with extinction. Although we did not explicitly test the reasons for ongoing declines, they could occur because of continued population decline (particularly in populations which are no longer self-sustaining), high vulnerability to stochastic events because of small population or range size, or reduced fitness as a result of severe population decline in the past44.

Partial abatement was somewhat effective at reducing avian diversity loss, preventing about one-quarter of projected losses (26‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4% of projected species extinctions and 26‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ13% of projected functional diversity loss; Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). Species that are experiencing severe declines but are affected by few threats showed the greatest reduction in extinction risk under partial abatement. The green-faced parrot finch (Erythrura viridifacies) and the Saint Vincent parrot (Amazona guildingii) responded particularly well to partial abatement, with a reduction in extinction risk that was almost as great as the reduction in extinction risk under complete abatement. Although partial abatement prevented some losses, there was still a 3.9% decrease in species richness (385‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ18 species) and a 2.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.3% decrease in functional richness. Of the diversity loss that was attributable to the drivers of extinction (diversity loss under complete abatement), approximately half was prevented through partial abatement (50‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7% of species extinctions and 49‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ26% of functional diversity loss). The minimal abatement scenario prevented only a small proportion of biodiversity loss (Extended Data Table 1). Using different traits to quantify functional diversity did not affect our conclusions (Supplementary Analyses), as we obtained similar results when we used pPCs constructed from three-dimensional scans of beak morphology45 and when the first pPC (largely describing variation in body size) was removed.

Protecting species from the drivers of extinction does not provide a comprehensive solution to biodiversity loss in the near future without additional measures such as targeted species recovery programmes, habitat restoration and prioritization of protection in important areas46. This finding is consistent with previous studies assessing biodiversity impacts of future conservation and mitigation scenarios. One study47 found that although it was possible to bend the curve of biodiversity loss with an integrated strategy, protected area management and expansion to avert the impact of habitat loss and degradation were insufficient to avoid more than 50% of projected biodiversity loss on average in biodiversity-rich regions. Similarly, another study48 predicted that in a 2015‚Äì2050 scenario of strong land use and climate change mitigation globally, rates of biodiversity loss would decrease but biodiversity would continue to decline. Threat reduction is an essential component of tackling the biodiversity crisis and is necessary to ensure that species with healthy, stable populations do not go into decline in the future15. However, it is not enough. The abatement scenarios explored here represented significant management efforts with optimistic assumptions about their impact and uptake. We assumed that the drivers of extinction, and the species declines caused by these drivers, could be halted immediately and that all drivers of extinction could be alleviated, including climate change, which arguably may be difficult to mitigate with site-based protection. Even in these ambitious and optimistic scenarios, we predicted that over half of the projected species extinctions and loss of functional diversity in the next 100‚Äâyears would occur anyway.

Projected loss of functional diversity was not evenly distributed across functional space (Figs. 3 and 4). Areas of trait space with high pPC1 values (generally larger birds) were predicted to show the greatest proportional losses under the baseline extinction scenario. Complete abatement was predicted to reduce loss across functional space (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 4) but was less effective in a region of high pPC1 and pPC2 values, predominantly occupied by large aquatic predators (Extended Data Fig. 5).

 pPC1 is a descriptor of body size, pPC2 is associated with wing morphology and pPC3 is associated with beak and tail morphology (for trait loadings, see Supplementary Table 3). a,b, Predicted proportional decline in functional trait space occupation in the next 100‚Äâyears under the baseline extinction scenario with respect to pPC1 and pPC2 (a) and pPC3 and pPC2 (b). c,d, Averted proportional decline under the complete abatement scenario for pPC1 and pPC2 (c) and pPC2 and pPC3 (d).

Species' traits shape their vulnerability to human activity, but different areas of trait space are affected by different threats49,50. As such, abatement of drivers of extinction could have differential outcomes for functional diversity. To test this concept, we focused on six drivers of extinction (Supplementary Dataset 1) and quantified the ‚Äòmaximum avoidable contribution' from each driver, describing the species and functional diversity loss avoided when the impact of current and future threats within each driver of extinction were completely removed, relative to diversity loss in the baseline scenario (see Methods). ‚ÄòHabitat loss and degradation' had the highest maximum avoidable contribution, as driver-specific complete abatement was projected to avoid 1.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.2% species richness loss (141‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ24 species extinctions) and 0.9‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.5% functional diversity loss (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 2). Driver-specific complete abatement of ‚Äòhunting and collection' was projected to avoid 0.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.5% functional diversity loss (Fig. 1), almost half that of ‚Äòhabitat loss and degradation' despite requiring action for 591 species rather than 1,658 species. Other drivers of extinction had smaller maximum avoidable contributions (Fig. 1). The relative magnitude of maximum avoidable contributions among drivers was comparable when simulating driver-specific partial abatement and driver-specific minimal abatement rather than driver-specific complete abatement.

Although assessments of individual drivers on avian functional diversity exist13,14,51, assessments of multiple drivers simultaneously are rare and are important for quantifying the relative impact of different drivers of extinction on avian functional diversity. We found that driver-specific complete abatement of ‚Äòhunting and collection' and ‚Äòdisturbance and accidental mortality' was projected to result in disproportionately high avoidance of functional diversity loss for the number of species extinctions avoided (Extended Data Fig. 6). As abatement of different drivers of extinction had different value for the preservation of functional diversity, we argue that it is necessary to consider functional diversity in conservation planning and prioritization.

To assess which species traits were vulnerable to drivers of extinction, we used a mixed-effects multi-response regression model of reduction in extinction risk under driver-specific complete abatement scenarios against values of three pPCs (see Methods). Reduction in extinction risk was quantified as the number of iterations in which species extinction was avoided in driver-specific complete abatement scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. A significant positive relationship was detected when abatement of a given driver of extinction reduced extinction risk in species with high values of a given pPC, and a significant negative relationship occurred when abatement of a given driver of extinction reduced extinction risk in species with low values of a given pPC (Fig. 4).

We found that the abatement of different drivers of extinction would benefit distinct morphologies. Birds with large body size (pPC1) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk when abating ‚Äòhunting and collection' or ‚Äòclimate change and severe weather' (Fig. 4; PMCMC‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01 for both). Although extinction risk bias towards species with large body size is widely reported52,53, we found that this was not the case for all threats, as there was no evidence of bias with respect to pPC1 for other drivers of extinction49.

The bias in extinction avoidance with respect to wing morphology (pPC2) was variable across drivers of extinction. Birds with broader wings (those with low pPC2 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk under abatement of ‚Äòhabitat loss and degradation' (PMCMC‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). By contrast, birds with slender wings (high pPC2 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk under abatement of ‚Äòhunting and collection' (PMCMC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.08; values under 0.1 are treated as significant to give a one-tailed significance test of overlap with zero rather than the default two-tailed test). Our finding that extinction avoidance was more likely for species with broad wings (low values of pPC2) when abating habitat loss and degradation is consistent with recent studies that show that birds with a low hand-wing index (described by pPC2) are more sensitive to fragmentation54 and deforestation55.

The bias in extinction avoidance with respect to tail and beak morphology (pPC3) was also variable across drivers of extinction. Species with long tails and short beaks (low pPC3 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk following abatement of both ‚Äòhunting and collection' and ‚Äòinvasive species, and disease' (PMCMC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.96 and PMCMC‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05, respectively (hunting and collection was not significant when insignificant variables were removed)), whereas species with short tails and long beaks (high pPC3 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk following abatement of ‚Äòclimate change and severe weather' (PMCMC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.08). Reduced extinction risk following abatement of climate change and severe weather was associated with traits involved in thermoregulation56,57,58,59. Birds with large body size (pPC1) but also large beaks (pPC3) were more likely to avoid extinction when climate change and severe weather was abated. As a bird's beak also influences its trophic niche60, failing to mitigate species decline caused by climate change could have knock-on effects for trophic interactions. Variable extinction avoidance across functional trait space suggests that prioritizing threat abatement based on the magnitude of projected biodiversity loss alone is inappropriate. Reducing the impact of multiple drivers of extinction is necessary to ensure that diverse functional morphologies are conserved.

Even with ambitious action, large-scale threat abatement will not prevent all species extinctions and functional richness loss in the next 100‚Äâyears. As such, targeted species recovery programmes will be needed, which we defined as in-situ and ex-situ measures to boost species survival and reproductive success that do not involve threat reduction. Here, we explored one possible approach, quantifying the benefits of preventing a small number of species extinctions targeted to reduce the loss of global functional richness. Using a metric of functional uniqueness that describes the probability of functional richness loss as a result of species extinction (Extended Data Fig. 7), we identified the most unique threatened species among the 9,873 bird species studied. Preventing the extinction of the most unique species (we tested scenarios protecting between 40 and 200 species; Fig. 5) was effective at reducing projected functional diversity loss. We found that preventing the extinction of the top 100 most unique threatened species avoided 68‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5% of projected functional diversity loss under the baseline scenario compared to the 26‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ13% avoided by partial abatement of all threats for all species. By preventing the extinction of 100 species (1% of species), 2.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.32% of functional diversity could be conserved if the most functionally unique threatened species were prioritized. This approach would require the avoidance of 37‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ25 projected extinctions in the next 100‚Äâyears. A previous publication17 reported that 21‚Äì32 bird species have been saved from extinction by conservation efforts since 1993, suggesting that this could be an achievable goal (although ten extinctions occurred despite management).

 Functional diversity loss avoided (as a percentage of projected functional diversity loss under the baseline scenario) from 1,000 iterations. Black points show mean loss avoided; violin plots show the distribution; grey points show individual values of loss avoided under each iteration. The number of unique threatened species that were prevented from going extinct (‚Äòprotected') varied between 40 and 200 unique threatened species at intervals of 20 species.

The most functionally unique birds spanned taxonomic and ecological groups, from the Sulu hornbill (Anthracoceros montani) of the southernmost Philippine islands61 to the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila) that patrols the Atlantic Ocean. Some were wide-ranging, like the southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora), and others are thought to only survive in one location, like Stresemann's bristlefront (Merulaxis stresemanni). Unique species included scavengers, such as the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), nectarivores, such as the yellow-bellied sunbird-asity (Neodrepanis hypoxantha), vertivores, such as the Madagascar serpent-eagle (Eutriorchis astur) and frugivores, such as the bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis). A full list of the top 200 most unique threatened birds is given in Supplementary Dataset 2.

Previous studies have found that functionally unique species are more likely to be threatened with extinction than less functionally unique species30,62. We provide evidence that conservation strategies for birds should prioritize functionally unique species, as has been proposed for other taxonomic groups63,64. In addition to their inherent value, functionally unique species are more likely to be used by humans for food, material and medicine; therefore, preventing the extinction of functionally unique species could be important for the delivery of ecosystem services65. Effective targeted recovery programmes that explicitly consider species uniqueness hold great potential for conserving global functional diversity as a complementary strategy to threat abatement.

Both large-scale protection from the drivers of extinction and targeted species recovery programmes will be needed to prevent avian extinctions and functional diversity loss in the next 100‚Äâyears. Although not effective at preventing all biodiversity loss, threat abatement is essential for ensuring that species that currently have healthy, stable populations do not fall into decline15. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that conservation policy should not focus solely on large-scale protection from the drivers of extinction, given that even in ambitious scenarios, only half of the projected species extinctions and functional diversity loss attributable to these drivers of extinction could be avoided.

Reducing the impact of different drivers of extinction protected distinct areas of functional trait space. Abatement of ‚Äòhabitat loss and degradation' made the greatest overall contribution to avoided species extinctions and functional diversity loss, but management of ‚Äòhunting and collection' and ‚Äòdisturbance and accidental mortality' prevented greater functional diversity loss proportional to the number of species projected to become extinct. Given that different areas of functional trait space were impacted by different drivers, consideration and abatement of all drivers of extinction is necessary to conserve functional diversity.

When completely or partially abating the drivers of extinction, functional richness loss was correlated with species extinctions, so reducing species extinctions is projected to reduce functional diversity loss. However, targeted species recovery programmes that focus on functionally unique species hold great potential for the conservation of functional diversity, while requiring conservation of relatively few species. By conserving the top 100 most unique threatened species, it may be possible to prevent more than two-thirds of the projected functional diversity loss through avoiding ~37 species extinctions. Although prioritization of recovery programmes offers great potential for protecting functional diversity, the ethical questions about prioritizing some species over others and the risks of overlooking ecosystem functions and services provided by other species, whether known or unknown, must be considered. If human activity continues to affect biodiversity as it is today, we project that in the next 100‚Äâyears, we will lose more than three times the number of bird species as have been lost since 1500. It is, therefore, urgent that we decide which dimensions of biodiversity we wish to protect, consolidate their measurement and include them in every stage of conservation planning, monitoring and impact assessment.

We used data on species morphological and geographical traits, threats and phylogenetic relationships to conduct this study. Trait data for 11,003 extant bird species66 were obtained from AVONET26. Under BirdLife taxonomy, only 8% of species in AVONET have imputed data for one or more traits, and <5% of species have imputed data for more than one trait. For all study species, data on threats were obtained in June 2022 from the IUCN Red List20 using the function rl_threats in the package rredlist67 in R68. Bird species are reassessed every 4‚Äâyears, causing a slight possible delay between species decline or recovery and reported change in extinction risk category69. Taxonomic discrepancies between AVONET and IUCN (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ141 species) were reconciled using the function rl_synonym. One-to-one matches were found for all species; therefore, these taxonomic differences did not impact the results.

A maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree was constructed from the first 1,000 trees in a previous publication70 based on the Hackett backbone70,71. The authors70 included 9,993 species in their analysis; we refer to the species nomenclature and taxonomic treatments adopted in this study as ‚ÄòBirdTree taxonomy'. To enable analysis of functional diversity loss while accounting for phylogenetic covariance between species, differences between the BirdLife66 and BirdTree70 taxonomies were reconciled using the crosswalk provided with AVONET26 (Supplementary Analyses). This gave 9,879 selected synonym matches between BirdLife and BirdTree (89.9% of BirdLife synonyms and 98.9% of BirdTree synonyms). Repeating analyses with all BirdLife synonyms and non-pPCA had a small impact on the percentage of projected species extinctions and functional diversity loss but did not affect our conclusions (Supplementary Fig. 6). Five species treated as Extinct in the Wild and one species listed as Extinct by IUCN20 but not listed as extinct in the AVONET crosswalk (Zosterops conspicillatus) were removed from the analysis, giving a total of 9,873 species.

Functional diversity quantifies the diversity of functional traits within an assemblage, defined as the measurable characteristics of an organism that influence its ecological niche72,73. We used 11 continuous morphological traits extracted from AVONET26, including body mass and linear measurements of beak, wing, tail and tarsus. These traits collectively capture bird ecological niches through their association with diet, dispersal and habitat25,26,27. Using continuous morphological traits enables more fine-grained discrimination between species sharing the same ecological groups, thus providing more in-depth information about ecological variation between species than categorical traits60. As life history traits are more useful for explaining variation in species response to human activity rather than the ecological impacts of decline26, they were not included in functional diversity estimations. Trait data were log10 transformed and scaled to unit variance.

We used pPCA to reduce dimensionality. PCA produces axes that are mathematically uncorrelated but may be phylogenetically correlated if species trait data are non-independent owing to shared evolutionary history74,75. pPCA accounts for phylogenetic correlation between axes by removing phylogenetic covariance and calculating major axes of non-phylogenetic residual variation75. pPCA was carried out using the phyl.pca function in phytools76 based on covariance and using lambda to obtain the correlation structure, which was optimized using restricted maximum likelihood. The first three pPCs described over 80% of the variance in the dataset (87.2%). Adding more pPCs described comparatively less variation (see scree plots, Extended Data Fig. 1). We therefore used the first three pPCs to summarize variation in the dataset. Using the first two or four pPCs instead, or using alternative ordination methods, did not affect our conclusions (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 9).

We calculated global functional richness for the whole assemblage (9,873 species) using trait probability densities28. Firstly, a multivariate Gaussian probability distribution was fitted for each species (Extended Data Fig. 3), in which means were provided by pPC values derived from functional trait data26 and standard deviations were estimated using a bandwidth selector (Hpi.diag function from package ks77). Next, we took the sum of species probability distributions to obtain the community trait probability density (Extended Data Fig. 3). This was implemented through the TPDsMean and TPDc functions in package TPD78, with 50 divisions for each pPC. We calculated functional richness using the REND function in package TPD.

To predict how threat reduction affected projected avian diversity loss, we constructed a model of species extinction risk (IUCN Red List category20) with threats as explanatory variables and accounting for spatial and phylogenetic covariance (referred to as ‚Äòthe extinction risk model'). The extinction risk model allowed us to quantify the independent contribution of each threat to extinction risk, while considering that many species were affected by multiple threats (1,978 species out of 2,104 Near Threatened and threatened species with threats listed) and comparatively few were affected by only one (126 out of 2,104 Near Threatened and threatened species with threats listed). Overlooking non-independence between threats can result in misleading findings about the relationship between threats and extinction risk as well as patterns of bias in the impacts of these drivers across species assemblages79. Species vulnerability to extinction, and threat prevalence (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1), may be affected by where species live or their evolutionary history, so species data are not independent of one another80. We included phylogeny and spatial variables as random effects to account for non-independence among species owing to non-random baseline extinction rates80, as well as other factors influencing extinction risk and recovery, such as small population size32, that are not caused by population decline resulting from listed past, ongoing or future threats.

The extinction risk model was fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo multivariate generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm), predicting extinction risk for species that were listed by the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered. Threats have been described for 99% of species in these categories. MCMCglmms were fitted using the R package MCMCglmm81. We used 39 pseudo-continuous fixed effects, describing the expected percentage population decline over a 10-year period or three generations (from threat scope and severity data; see details below and Extended Data Table 3) caused by each threat under the second-level classification described by the IUCN82 (for example, ‚Äò1.1 Housing & Urban Areas' and ‚Äò1.2 Commercial and Industrial Areas'). Threats that affected ten or fewer species were grouped with other threats (Supplementary Dataset 1).

Threats were assigned an expected population decline (over a 10-year period or three generations) based on their scope (percentage of species range affected by a threat) and severity, following previous publications43,83 (Extended Data Table 3). If multiple threats were listed for the same threat category under the second-order classification listed by the IUCN82, the maximum expected population decline was used. For example, Acrocephalus familiaris is experiencing slow, continuous declines owing to the invasive species Schistocerca nitens across most of its range, but it is also experiencing rapid declines caused by Oryctolagus cuniculus across the whole of its range. For ‚Äò8.1 Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases', A. familiaris was assigned an expected population decline of 24%, associated with rapid declines across the whole of its range (Extended Data Table 3). We took the maximum expected population decline for second-order threats where multiple third-order threats were listed, as not all second-order threats had information on third-order threats, and without further information, it was difficult to estimate the expected population decline from multiple third-order threats. Only 16% of species‚Äìthreat combinations had more than one third-order threat listed, and when running the extinction risk model using the sum of expected population decline rather than the maximum, we found that this had minimal impacts on projected species extinctions. Threats expected to cause no decline or negligible declines across a majority or minority of a species' range had an expected population decline of zero and were effectively discarded.

Across all species, 11.58% of threat data were missing scope or severity values. Missing scope and severity data were imputed with missForest imputation (implemented through the R package missForest84) from threat type, scope, severity and timing, and incorporating phylogenetic data through eigenvectors85. Removing a similar proportion of values from complete data on threat timing, scope and severity to test imputation accuracy gave a mean accuracy of 82.5% (Supplementary Analyses). A total of 48 rows were also missing data on timing (needed for creating extinction scenarios; see ‚ÄòExtinction scenarios' section of the Methods), and these data were imputed in the same way as scope and severity.

Phylogeny, minimum latitude, maximum latitude and centroid longitude were included in the model as random effects (Supplementary Analyses and Supplementary Fig. 1), where centroid longitude describes the longitude of the midpoint of species ranges. Spatial variables were obtained from AVONET and had been calculated from species' breeding and resident ranges, including areas where the species was coded as extant and either native or reintroduced26. Centroid latitude was not informative in explaining variation in extinction risk86 (Supplementary Fig. 1) and therefore was not included as a random effect. In total, 17 species with incomplete spatial information were excluded from the extinction risk model. Species with missing spatial information were either Possibly Extinct, had no known breeding or resident range, or their range data had been redacted to protect them from trafficking risk26. A total of 22 species had no threat data listed and were not included in the extinction risk model. The final model was fitted for the remaining threatened and Near Threatened species (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ2,087).

For fixed effects, Cauchy-scaled Gelman priors were used (with an expected value of zero), as is recommended for ordinal regressions87. For phylogenetic random effects, we used a chi-squared prior (expected covariance of 1, degree of belief of 1,000, mean vector of 1 and covariance matrix of 1), as this best approximates a uniform distribution, giving an uninformative prior81,88,89. For spatial random effects, we used parameter-expanded priors (expected covariance of 1, degree of belief of 1, mean vector of 0 and covariance matrix of 625), as they are often less informative than the default inverse-Wishart prior90. As it is not possible to estimate the residual variance with an ordinal response variable (extinction risk), the residual variance was fixed to 1 following previous work90. The model was insensitive to alternative prior specification (Supplementary Figs. 10‚Äì14). MCMC chains were run for 103,000 iterations, with a burn-in of 3,000 iterations and sampling every 100 iterations. Model convergence was assessed by parameter traces produced through the plot function in package MCMCglmm81. Non-significant fixed effects were removed iteratively, removing the least significant fixed effect, rerunning the model and repeating until only significant fixed effects remained. Significance was assessed using the pseudo P‚Äâvalue (PMCMC), estimated by MCMCglmm81. The pseudo P‚Äâvalue is calculated as the probability that the posterior is greater or less than zero, whichever is smaller, multiplied by two91. A significance threshold of 0.1 was used, giving a one-tailed significance test that the posterior distribution overlaps with zero, rather than the default two-tailed test. The final model structure was:

where X1.2 is the expected percentage population decline (Extended Data Table 3) owing to IUCN second-order threat ‚Äò1.2 Commercial and Industrial Areas' and so on. X10.1 grouped threat impacts from X10.1, X10.2 and X10.3, as each threat affected fewer than ten species (see Supplementary Dataset 1 for threat codes, threat descriptions and model parameter estimates). We expected most threats to have a positive posterior mean, indicating that species affected by these threats had higher extinction risk; however, ‚Äò2.2 Wood and pulp plantations' and ‚Äò10 Geological events' (including X10.1, X10.2 and X10.3) had a small, negative posterior mean. Our model estimates the independent contribution of each threat to extinction risk; therefore, although it may appear that wood and pulp plantations and geological events are contributing to decline when combined with other threats, our model suggests that, in general, species threatened by wood and pulp plantations and geological events have slightly lower extinction risk.

Model accuracy was assessed as the proportion of species for which the category listed by the IUCN20 matched the category that most frequently (across iterations) had the highest probability.

We used the extinction risk model to predict the probability that species belonged to each Red List category; then, using the expected probability of extinction for each Red List category, simulated extinctions that are likely to occur in the next 100‚Äâyears. We used an approach explicitly incorporating uncertainty in model estimates and stochasticity in realized extinctions given extinction probabilities.

The extinction risk model returned 1,000 posterior estimates (1,000 iterations) of the probability that each species belonged to each extinction risk category (Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered). Posterior estimates were extracted from the model using the function predict2 from the postMCMCglmm package92. All Least Concern species and 39 Near Threatened or threatened species that were missing spatial or threat data (species not included in the extinction risk model) were assigned a probability of 1 of belonging to their Red List category as currently listed by the IUCN. Species classified as Data Deficient (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ41) were conservatively assigned to the Least Concern category. For many classes, Data Deficient species are likely to be at higher risk of extinction than data-sufficient species93; however, this is not the case for birds94. Given that Data Deficient species make up a very small percentage of total species (0.4%), uncertainty over their extinction risk was expected to have a negligible impact on projected diversity loss.

An overall probability of extinction was then calculated for each species (equation 1):

where \({{ex}}_{p,s}\) is the probability of extinction in the next 100‚Äâyears for species s according to the posterior estimation p; ex100c is the assigned probability of extinction in the next 100‚Äâyears of a species in IUCN extinction risk category c; and \({{cat}}_{p,c,s}\) is the probability that species s belonged to IUCN extinction risk category c according to posterior estimation p or, for species not included in the extinction risk model, a probability of 1 for their Red List category as currently listed by the IUCN and a probability of 0 for all other Red List categories. Values of ex100c were based on previous work24,29,95 and set to 0.999 for Critically Endangered, 0.667 for Endangered, 0.1 for Vulnerable, 0.01 for Near Threatened and 0.0001 for Least Concern.

Estimates of \({{ex}}_{p,s}\) were converted to a binary outcome of extinct or extant using the R function sample, in which the probability of being assigned extinct was \({{ex}}_{p,s}\). For each scenario, we report the mean and standard deviation in the number of extinctions across 1,000 iterations as a percentage of the total number of species included in the study (9,873 species). Functional diversity loss was estimated by removing species projected to go extinct, calculating functional diversity across species predicted to be extant and comparing to the functional diversity of the full assemblage (9,873 species).

We estimated projected loss in species and functional diversity in the next 100‚Äâyears under a baseline extinction scenario and three threat reduction scenarios: complete abatement, partial abatement and minimal abatement. Under the baseline scenario, we used the extinction risk model to predict the probability that species belonged to Red List categories, assuming that the impact of all threats remained as currently listed by IUCN20, following the method for predicting extinctions outlined above. Under the complete abatement scenario, predictions were obtained after setting the expected population decline to zero for all threats with a timing of ‚ÄòOngoing', ‚ÄòPast, Likely to Return' and ‚ÄòFuture'. The expected population decline of threats with a timing of ‚ÄòPast, Unlikely to Return' was retained as they cannot be prevented but could still contribute to extinction risk through extinction lags (although predictions were similar if expected population decline for these threats was set to zero; Supplementary Table 6). Under the partial abatement scenario, threat impacts were altered to simulate removal of threats across at least 50% of species ranges by reassigning expected population declines for threats with a scope of ‚ÄòWhole (>90%)' or ‚ÄòMajority (50‚Äì90%)' to the decline expected for a scope of ‚ÄòMinority (<50%)' (Extended Data Table 3). Under the minimal abatement scenario, threat impacts were altered to simulate the removal of threats across at least 10% of species ranges by reassigning expected population declines of threats with a scope of ‚ÄòWhole (>90%)' to expected decline for a scope of ‚ÄòMajority (50‚Äì90%)'. Least Concern species were not included in the extinction risk model, given that this is the lowest risk category and, by definition, could not show a reduction in extinction risk under abatement scenarios.

We used Cohen's D to quantify the effect size of the difference in means of diversity loss under each threat reduction scenario, divided by their pooled standard error. We do not report P‚Äâvalues, as the sample size (number of iterations) could be increased easily, reducing standard error and giving significance even with very small differences in means, leading to type 1 errors.

To determine the bird morphologies with the greatest extinction risk, we plotted the loss in density of trait space occupation under the baseline scenario using trait probability densities. We constructed a community probability distribution by taking the sum of species probability distributions, in which each species probability distribution was given a weight between 0 and 1,000, and describing the number of iterations in which they did not go extinct under the baseline scenario. The resulting community probability distribution was rescaled to show absolute rather than relative change in the density of occupation of trait space. For each cell, we compared the density of occupation of the whole assemblage to the density of occupation in iterations of the baseline extinction scenario. The loss in density was calculated as a percentage of the density of trait space occupation in the full assemblage for which all species had a value of 1,000, indicating no extinction (Extended Data Fig. 4). Areas of trait space with high loss in density (approaching 100%) were predicted to have a high risk of extinction.

To determine the bird morphologies with the greatest reduction in extinction risk under complete abatement of all threats (protection in Extended Data Fig. 4), we plotted the density of trait space occupation under the complete abatement scenario using trait probability densities, whereby all species were given a weight according to the number of iterations in which extinction was avoided in the complete abatement relative to the baseline scenarios. We also plotted the loss in density of trait space occupation that was not avoided, as a proportion of density loss under complete abatement. For plotting loss in density under the baseline scenario, loss in density averted under the complete abatement scenario and loss in density not averted under the complete abatement scenario, pPCs were divided into 100 bins to provide high plot resolution. To facilitate visualization, this process was carried out in two dimensions (two pPCs at a time).

We aimed to assess the independent contribution of six major drivers of extinction to projected avian diversity loss. Threats in the extinction risk model were grouped into six ‚Äòdrivers of extinction': ‚Äòhabitat loss and degradation', ‚Äòhunting and collection', ‚Äòclimate change and severe weather', ‚Äòdisturbance and accidental mortality', ‚Äòinvasive species and disease' and ‚Äòpollution' (see Supplementary Dataset 1). Geological events and threats described as ‚Äòother' were grouped into an ‚ÄòOther' category. Although these other threats were included in the model of extinction risk and their impact was accounted for when assessing the impact of all drivers of extinction together, we did not assess their impact individually.

We projected species and functional diversity loss under driver-specific complete abatement scenarios in which the impact of threats in a given driver of extinction with a timing of ‚ÄòOngoing', ‚ÄòPast, Likely to Return' and ‚ÄòFuture' were removed by setting their expected population decline to zero. The ‚Äòmaximum avoidable contribution' was calculated as the difference in predicted species and functional diversity loss between the baseline scenario and the driver-specific complete abatement scenario.

We used Cohen's D to quantify the effect size of the difference in means of diversity loss under the baseline and driver-specific complete abatement scenarios, divided by their pooled standard error. As before, P‚Äâvalues were not reported.

To determine the severity of functional richness loss under a given driver of extinction in relation to the number of species projected to become extinct, we used a linear mixed-effects model to describe the functional richness loss avoided, using the number of species extinctions avoided and the driver of extinction (categorical) as explanatory variables. Model iteration was used as a random effect to account for non-independence in calculated differences in functional diversity loss and species extinctions from baseline to threat reduction scenarios. The dredge function from the MuMin package96 was used to identify the best model from all combinations of explanatory variables and an interaction between species extinctions and driver of extinction. The best model included the number of species extinctions avoided and the driver of extinction but not the interaction between species extinctions avoided and the driver of extinction.

We aimed to find whether abatement of different drivers of extinction could avoid extinction in different regions of trait space. We constructed a multi-response MCMCglmm with the three pPC values for each species as response variables (including all 9,873 species studied) and the number of iterations in which extinction was avoided under driver-specific complete abatement for each driver of extinction as explanatory variables, accounting for phylogenetic covariance. Pollution was not included, as a driver-specific complete abatement of pollution had a negligible impact on functional richness loss. The residual structure was allowed to vary for each response variable. Random effect priors were provided as a diagonal matrix, with an expected covariance between response variables of zero and expected variance within response variables of 1. The degree of belief parameter for the random effect prior was 2 (ref. 97). The expected value of fixed effects and the theta-scale parameter were zero, with a covariance matrix in which the expected covariance between fixed effects was zero and the expected variance within fixed effects was 1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ1010. Posterior distributions were plotted, and a significance threshold of 5% overlap with zero was used (PMCMC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.1).

To identify the potential value of preventing the extinction of the most functionally unique threatened species, we calculated functional uniqueness for all species (Extended Data Fig. 7). For each species, we calculated the proportion of the density of the community probability distribution that was occupied by the species probability distribution for each grid cell in which the species probability density was greater than zero. We calculated the mean proportion for each species across grid cells in which the species probability distribution was greater than zero, giving greater weight to cells in which the species distribution had greater probability (higher density). The maximum uniqueness possible was 1, indicating that a particular species' probability distribution had no overlap with the probability distribution of any other species included in the analysis. Uniqueness tended towards a lower limit of zero, indicating that the species probability distribution had high overlap with many other species probability distributions, and many other species occupied the same area of trait space.

We then identified the most unique and threatened (listed as Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered) species as potential targets for action. We compared functional richness loss in the baseline scenario with functional richness loss when extinctions of the most unique threatened species were prevented. We explored the consequences of avoiding extinction for the top 40‚Äì200 most unique threatened species (in intervals of 20 species). A total of 1,000 posterior estimates were obtained for each extinction scenario.

Red dotted line indicates elbow after which adding additional phylogenetic principal components would explain little additional variance (n=9873 species).

Shown on 2-dimensional plane with respect to a, pPC1 and pPC2, and b, pPC2 and pPC3 with trait loadings (also see Supplementary Table 3). BD = beak depth, BLC = beak length (culmen), BLN = beak length (nares), BW =beak width, HWI = hand-wing index, KD = Kipp's distance, LL = tarsus length, M = body mass, S = first secondary length, TL = tail length, WL = wing length (n=9873 species).

Panel b left to right: Apteryx (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Pelecanus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Ramphastidae (FJDegrange, CC0 1.0), Spheniscus humboldti (Juan Carlos Jer√≠, CC0 1.0), Mellisuga helenae (Steven Traver, CC0 1.0), Buceros (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Apus apus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Struthio camelus (Darren Naish and T. Michael Keesey, CC BY 3.0), Phasianus colchicus (Mattia Menchetti, CC0 1.0), Menura (T. Michael Keesey, CC0 1.0).

When species removal is biased with respect to species traits (principal component values) functional richness loss is greater. Shown in one dimension for simplicity, functional richness was calculated in three-dimensional trait space composed of the first three phylogenetic principal components.

Loss in density of morphospace was calculated using the baseline extinction scenario, and averted loss in density of morphospace was calculated using the complete abatement scenario.

Plotted for a) pPC1 and pPC2, and b) pPC2 and pPC3. Grey shows areas where no functional diversity loss was projected, or where no functional diversity loss was avoided under complete abatement (only three pixels in panel a and two pixels in panel b). Analyses based on 9873 species (of which 2087 species currently listed as Near Threatened or in threatened categories were modelled and could have reduced extinction risk in the abatement scenarios). 1000 iterations were run for each extinction scenario. All silhouettes from Phylopic. Panel a left to right: Apteryx (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Mellisuga helenae (Steven Traver, CC0 1.0), Troglodytes hiemalis (Andy Wilson, CC0 1.0), Pteroptochos castaneus (Ferran Sayol, CCO 1.0), Atlantisia rogersi (there was no silhouette of Atlantsia rogersi so a silhouette of Gallirallus australis was used instead, T. Michael Keesey and HuttyMcphoo, CC BY-SA 3.0), Pelecanoides urinatrix (Louis Ranjard, CC BY 3.0), Spheniscus humboldti (Juan Carlos Jer√≠, CC0 1.0), Larus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Diomedeidae (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Struthio camelus (Darren Naish and T. Michael Keesey, CC BY 3.0), Buceros (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Leptoptilos javanicus (T. Michael Keesey and Vaibhavcho, CC BY-SA 3.0). Panel b left to right: Apteryx (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Pelecanus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Ramphastidae (Federico Degrange, CC0 1.0), Spheniscus humboldti (Juan Carlos Jer√≠, CC0 1.0), Mellisuga helenae (Steven Traver, CC0 1.0), Buceros (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Apus apus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Phasianus colchicus (Mattia Menchetti, CC0 1.0), Menura (T. Michael Keesey, CC0 1.0), Struthio camelus (Darren Naish and T. Michael Keesey, CC BY 3.0).

a, Number of species extinctions avoided under driver-specific complete abatement against functional richness loss avoided (% of functional richness of full assemblage) as described by a linear mixed effects model including number of species extinctions avoided and driver of extinction as fixed effects, and iteration number as a random effect. b, Intercepts of linear mixed effect model of number of species extinctions avoided against functional richness loss for each driver of extinction showing the proportional impact of each direct driver of extinction given the number of species extinctions. Habitat = habitat loss and degradation, Hunting = hunting and collection, Climate= climate change and severe weather, Invasive = invasive species and disease, Disturbance = disturbance and accidental mortality. Pollution was not included as it made a negligible contribution to functional richness loss (see Extended Data Table 3) (n = 5000, 1000 iterations for each extinction scenario).

Functional uniqueness describes the proportion of the community probability distribution that was composed of the species probability distribution. Proportions were summed across cells in which the species probability distribution was greater than 0, with a weight proportional to the probability of species occurrence in that cell, indicated by the height of the species probability distribution.

Neurodegenerative diseases activate innate and adaptive immune responses that can either slow or accelerate disease progression. Here, we sought to define beneficial immune pressures that emerge during tauopathy development in mice and humans. Using mice that express mutant human tau in neurons, we observed that microglia slowed tauopathy development by controlling the spread of phosphorylated tau (pTau) in the central nervous system and blood. However, over time microglia converted into distressed antigen-presenting cells, acquired neuronal transcripts and were targeted by resident, clonally expanded CD8+ T cells. These cells did not express traditional effector molecules, such as IFNŒ≥, TNF or granzymes a/b/c, but instead deposited granzyme K (GZMK) onto microglia and were regulated by immune checkpoint proteins (TIGIT, PD-1), as blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 enhanced disease progression. GZMK+CD8+ T cells also targeted microglia in pTau-rich human brain lesions resulting from age, Alzheimer's disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Deletion of CD8+ T cells in mice promoted the emergence of distressed microglia containing neuronal transcripts, markedly enhanced pTau spread and accelerated neurological decline. These data demonstrate that GZMK+CD8+ T cells are a signature of tauopathy development and could potentially be harnessed to slow disease progression.

Since taking over as the top US health official in February, Robert F. Kennedy Jr has overseen radical changes that have alarmed many public-health experts. The agency he leads announced that it would cut its workforce by 20,000, and cancelled billions of dollars in federal funding for research and public health. Earlier this month, Kennedy replaced all the members of an influential vaccine advisory committee with hand-picked ones, including some who have expressed scepticism about vaccines. His mission, he says, is to ‚ÄòMake America Healthy Again'. ‚ÄúWe are the sickest nation in the world,‚Äù he said in March, ‚Äúand we have the highest rate of chronic disease.‚Äù

Who is on RFK Jr's new vaccine panel ‚Äî and what will they do?

Who is on RFK Jr's new vaccine panel ‚Äî and what will they do?

His diagnosis holds some truth, say public-health specialists and analysts. Relative to other similarly wealthy nations, the United States has the shortest life expectancy despite spending the most on health care. It ‚Äúhas the highest rates of preventable and treatable deaths‚Äù, says Reginald Williams, a health-policy specialist at the Commonwealth Fund, a think tank in New York City that publishes regular comparisons of health-care systems around the world. And researchers agree that high rates of chronic disease, including heart disease and obesity, are key contributors to Americans' higher death rates, as Kennedy emphasizes.

But researchers say that Kennedy ‚Äî widely known as RFK Jr ‚Äî has mostly ignored other leading causes of death and ill health, including car accidents, drug overdoses and gun violence. In these areas, the United States ‚Äúis a really clear outlier‚Äù, says Colin Angus, who studies health policy at the University of Sheffield, UK. ‚ÄúBut, you know, I don't see RFK talking about those things.‚Äù Kennedy has also promoted medical misinformation and conspiracy theories ‚Äî particularly with regards to the safety of vaccines.

With Kennedy's plans for US health beginning to come into focus, Nature has dug into the data to explore how unhealthy America is, how it got there and why many researchers say that some of Kennedy's proposed solutions are misguided.

To gauge US health, life expectancy ‚Äî the average number of years a person is expected to live ‚Äî is a good place to start. Many analyses show that the United States has lower life expectancy than most similar nations. A comparison by KFF, a non-profit health-policy research organization based in San Francisco, California, shows that US life expectancy at birth in 2023 was 78.4 years. This is 4.1 years shorter than the average of 11 comparably large wealthy countries, including Australia, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom (see ‚ÄòLow expectations'). ‚ÄúThe US is just like nothing else. It's shocking,‚Äù says Angus.

Source: Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker

People in the United States also spend fewer of their years in good shape. Healthy life expectancy ‚Äî the average number of years lived in good health ‚Äî was 64.4 years in 2021. This ranks below that of almost all other high-income countries, according to data from the Global Burden of Disease study1, a massive epidemiological project to measure health loss.

The gap wasn't always so wide. Life expectancy in the United States was closer to the average for its peers around 1980 and gradually improved, according to KFF's analyses. The gains were driven partly by a drop in smoking and increased use of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins, which cut deaths from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, says Thomas Bollyky, who directs the global-health programme at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank headquartered in New York City.

Although that trend continued in most peer nations, improvements in life expectancy gradually slowed in the United States, plateauing around 2010. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily widened the gap, because of higher excess mortality in the United States compared with its peers. So what's going on?

To find out, KFF researchers looked at death data across age groups. The biggest difference in death rates has been in people aged 15‚Äì49 (see ‚ÄòEarly deaths'). Among these younger people, the death rate has been falling much more slowly in the United States than in peer countries ‚Äî and it spiked drastically owing to COVID-19. ‚ÄúMore people die younger,‚Äù says Lynne Cotter, a senior health-policy researcher at KFF. And because young deaths erase more years of life than do older ones, they drag down overall life expectancy.

How much does chronic disease contribute to the high US death rate? A lot. Overall, chronic conditions ‚Äî heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory disease ‚Äî take up four out of five spots on the country's list of biggest killers. Cotter attributes about one-third of excess premature deaths in people under the age of 70 to cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and kidney disease. ‚ÄúChronic conditions certainly make up a large portion,‚Äù she says. KFF estimates that Americans are about twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease before reaching 70 as are people in similar countries.

One of the biggest drivers of those deadly conditions is obesity, say researchers. As of 2022, about 42% of adults were considered obese in the United States, compared with 27% in the United Kingdom and 5.5% in Japan. Obesity increases the risks of developing diabetes, heart disease, cancer and many other conditions. ‚ÄúThe US has, particularly around diet, obesity and overweight, adopted unhealthier lifestyles at a higher rate than our country peers,‚Äù Bollyky says.

In a May report2, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission, which Kennedy leads, blamed childhood chronic disease mainly on ultra-processed foods, excessive screen time, lack of physical activity, exposure to chemicals and overprescription of medications. A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which Kennedy leads, did not directly address the criticisms and questions raised by sources in this article. They said that the MAHA report focuses on ‚Äúa disturbing reality unfolding across the nation ‚Äî the scale of the chronic disease epidemic and the institutional failures that allowed it to grow unchecked for decades‚Äù, and that the agency will next publish a report outlining policy recommendations. Americans ‚Äúelected President Trump and put Kennedy in office ‚Äî to Make America Healthy Again ‚Äî and that's exactly what we're doing‚Äù, they said.

Research supports Kennedy's argument that ultra-processed foods might be partly to blame for poor health. Their consumption has been linked to increased risks of obesity and some other chronic diseases, and is relatively high in the United States. Such foods comprise an estimated 58% of US daily energy intake ‚Äî similar to that in the United Kingdom, but greater than the 48% in Canada and 31% in France3.

Williams says that the problems caused by chronic disease are compounded by poor health care. Compared with a group of similar high-income countries, the United States is the only one that lacks universal health-insurance coverage. ‚ÄúWe have still 26 million people that remain uninsured,‚Äù Williams says. Lack of health insurance, high costs and other barriers prevent people from getting diagnoses and treatment early on. ‚ÄúAnd then when they do seek care, they're at a place where their disease or needs are much higher.‚Äù

By contrast, death rates from cancer in the under 70s have remained similar in the United States and other countries, probably because of widespread cancer screening and proactive cancer care, say public-health specialists. ‚ÄúCancer has moved from basically a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease,‚Äù says Williams. ‚ÄúSo we need to have that same level of engagement around obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular care.‚Äù

The other big contributors to lower life expectancy in the United States ‚Äî and what really sets the country apart, researchers say ‚Äî are high death rates from substance misuse, car accidents, suicide and homicide (see ‚ÄòVaried causes'). These tend to kill people of working age.

Deaths from substance misuse are explained mainly by overdoses of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl ‚Äî part of the US opioid crisis. Many Americans are killed in traffic accidents, partly because they tend to spend proportionately more time driving, and in bigger cars, than people in many other nations. ‚ÄúWe're a very car-centric society,‚Äù says Mary Pat Campbell, a life-insurance specialist who works at the investment-management firm Conning in Hartford, Connecticut, and blogs about mortality data. ‚ÄúWe don't have a lot of good mass-transit alternatives.‚Äù

Gun deaths account for about 80% of US murders and 55% of suicides. This led physician Vivek Murthy to call gun violence a public-health crisis in 2024, when he was US surgeon-general, and to highlight that it was the leading cause of death in children and adolescents. (The HHS removed this advisory from its website in March, according to news reports.) More gun deaths are suicides than homicides, says Campbell. ‚ÄúIt gets very bleak thinking about some of these things,‚Äù she says.

It gets bleaker. All told, the death rates in working-age people mean that one 5-year-old out of every 20 ‚Äî or roughly one in every school class ‚Äî will die before the age of 45, according to Angus's calculations. The comparable figure is one in 50 in the United Kingdom and one in 100 in Switzerland.

Although the life expectancy for the United States suggests that the country is relatively unhealthy, the average masks a more complex picture. Closer examination reveals that the figure varies drastically across the country.

A promising approach to attain long-distance coherent spin propagation is accessing topological spin-polarized edge states in graphene. Achieving this without external magnetic fields necessitates engineering graphene band structure, obtainable through proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures. In particular, proximity-induced staggered potentials and spin-orbit coupling are expected to form a topological bulk gap in graphene with gapless helical edge states that are robust against disorder. In this work, we detect the spin-polarized helical edge transport in graphene at zero external magnetic field, allowed by the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet, CrPS4. We show the coexistence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) states and magnetism in graphene, where the induced spin-orbit and exchange couplings also give rise to a large anomalous Hall (AH) effect. The detection of the QSH states at zero external magnetic field, together with the AH signal that persists up to room temperature, opens the route for practical applications of magnetic graphene in quantum spintronic circuitries.

Decades of research in graphene have unveiled its remarkable charge and spin-related properties, such as distinctive quantum Hall (QH) charge transport and long-distance spin propagation1,2. Yet, harnessing topologically protected spin transport for the development of practical quantum spintronic devices necessitates targeted modifications to the graphene band structure. This band structure engineering has been recently achieved non-invasively by bringing graphene in the proximity of other two-dimensional (2D) materials3, leading to spin Hall4,5, Rashba-Edelstein6,7,8, anomalous Hall (AH)9, and spin-dependent Seebeck10 effects in graphene. The realization of these phenomena in proximitized graphene is due to induced spin-orbit and/or exchange interactions that result in spin-splitting of the graphene band structure11,12,13. These spin-related effects, however, have been experimentally addressed in proximitized graphene majorly by diffusive charge/spin transport, where the spin relaxation length is limited by spin and momentum scattering mechanisms. On the contrary, if the transport occurs through topological spin-polarized edge states, their topological protection allows for long-distance quantum coherent spin propagation.

Spin-polarized chiral and helical QH edge states have been detected in graphene through the Zeeman splitting of the bands by applying large magnetic fields14,15,16, which is conceived to be practically challenging for applications. Thus, numerous theoretical and experimental reports so far focus on resolving spin-polarized edge states in graphene without the need for any external magnetic field, possible through the emergence of quantum spin Hall (QSH) or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in a modified graphene band structure17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. These spin-polarized gapless edge states can form within the bulk gap of graphene, attainable by inducing staggered potentials, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and/or magnetic exchange interactions17,18,19. Depending on the respective magnitude of the spin-orbit vs. exchange interactions, these edge states can be chiral or helical20, allowing for topologically protected spin transport that is expected to be robust against disorder18.

Despite several recent experimental efforts in addressing the topological transport in various graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures29,30,31,32,33,34, direct experimental evidence for the detection of the QAH and QSH effects in proximitized graphene is still missing. One major obstacle has been the presence of dominant interfacial charge transfer35,36 that may hinder the exploration of the proximity effects. In this work, however, the suppression of the interfacial charge transfer in graphene-CrPS4 heterostructures allows us to study the transport in the presence of magnetic exchange and spin-orbit interactions, evidenced by the detection of a large AH signal up to room temperature. Remarkably, we experimentally realize the presence of helical states at zero external magnetic field, indicating the emergence of the QSH effect despite the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the induced magnetism20,37. The unprecedented zero-magnetic-field detection of the QSH state in this graphene-based magnetic heterostructure, coexisting with the AH effect, makes this system intriguing for the development of quantum spintronic circuitries.

We bring graphene in the van der Waals proximity of the interlayer antiferromagnet, CrPS4 (CPS), which is an air-stable semiconductor with a bandgap of  ~1.3‚ÄâeV38 and a N√©el temperature TN ‚âà 38 K39. Figure 1a (top panel) illustrates a top view of the CPS crystal structure with the dashed lines indicating the crystallographic directions along which the crystals preferentially cleave, as shown in the optical micrograph of an exfoliated flake. As a result, the CPS flakes acquire a corner angle of 67.5¬∞, the bisector of which is along the magnetic a-axis38 (see also supplementary information (SI), Figure S2). The presence of this characteristic angle assists with the identification of the CPS crystallographic orientation and guides the alignment of the graphene Hall bar with one of the CPS magnetic axes (see Figure 1a, lower panel). In accordance with previous reports39, CPS has an anisotropic magnetic behavior which is evaluated using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) at various temperatures (T), shown in Fig. 1b and c (see Methods for more details on CPS). The SQUID measurements at the small-range Bz (panel b) for T‚Äâ<‚Äâ40‚ÄâK show the expected spin-flop transition when the magnetization of the layers rotates from canted out-of-plane towards the in-plane b-axis, while holding their respective antiparallel alignment (lower inset in Fig. 1b). Increasing Bz above the spin-flop transition field (Bsf ~ 0.8‚ÄâT at 2 K) results in canting of the magnetic moments towards the c-axis, starting with  ~6¬∞ canting (upper inset in panel b) until full saturation (90¬∞) at Bz ‚âà 8‚ÄâT, as shown in Fig. 1c.

The optical micrograph (scale bar: 10‚ÄâŒºm) shows a 38 nm thick CPS flake covered with an hBN/graphene Hall-bar (see SI, Figure S1). b, c SQUID magnetometry of a CPS bulk crystal at various temperatures (T) for small (b) and large (c) range of magnetic field Bz, applied perpendicular to the (a ‚àí b) plane. The Bz cycling shows a minimal hysteresis in CPS bulk magnetization. Insets: side-view schematics of CPS layers magnetic ordering at indicated Bz ranges. d Optical micrograph of device A fabricated with an hBN/graphene/CPS heterostructure on a SiO2/Si substrate with Ti-Pd electrodes. Scale bar: 10‚ÄâŒºm. The hBN and SiO2 layers, used as top- and back-gate dielectrics, are 73 and 285‚Äânm thick, respectively. e Transverse resistance Rxy = Vxy/I measured vs. Bz in the graphene Hall-bar at T = 1.8‚ÄâK with I‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5‚ÄâŒºA, at back-gate and top-gate voltages of Vbg‚Äâ=‚Äâ50‚ÄâV and Vtg = 0‚ÄâV. The non-linearity of Rxy at Bz < 1‚ÄâT is due to non-linear CPS magnetization behaviour in that Bz range (see Figure S4). Inset: subtraction of the trace and retrace measurements (ŒîRxy), showing the Rxy modulation due to spin-flop transition. The asymmetry in the ŒîRxy vs. Bz arises from non-symmetric magnetization behavior of the outmost CPS layer through the spin-flop transition, likely caused by neighboring magnetic domains in the CPS flake. f Non-linear component of Rxy associated with the AH effect (RAH), measured at T‚Äâ=‚Äâ300‚ÄâK, Vbg‚Äâ=‚Äâ50‚ÄâV and Vtg‚Äâ=‚Äâ0‚ÄâV. RAH is acquired by subtraction of a linear background (related to the ordinary Hall effect) from Rxy anti-symmetrized vs. Bz (also see SI Figure S3). For the linear fit, the Rxy data in the range of 8‚ÄâT < Bz ‚â§ 9‚ÄâT is considered, assuming saturation of the magnetization in that range. Inset: Temperature-dependence of RAH at Vtg = 0‚ÄâV. The RAH is estimated as the lower bound, averaged over the RAH for Bz > 6T (see SI, section 4).

We evaluate the possibility of inducing the CPS magnetic properties in graphene by transport measurements. We report on four devices (A-D), each fabricated with a monolayer graphene Hall-bar on a multilayer CPS flake, fully covered with hBN that is used as a dielectric for top-gating (Fig. 1d). In devices A, B, and C, the graphene channel is aligned with the CPS magnetic a-axis. We apply current along the graphene channel (with I + and I ‚àí electrodes shown in panel d) while measuring the longitudinal and transverse voltages (Vxx and Vxy). In Fig. 1e, we show the modulation of the transverse resistance Rxy‚Äâ = ‚ÄâVxy/I as a function of Bz, at Vtg‚Äâ=‚Äâ0‚ÄâV. In addition to the slight non-linear behaviour at ‚à£Bz‚à£ < 1‚ÄâT (also see Figure S4), we observe switches in Rxy at  ~ ¬± 0.8‚ÄâT, which is the magnetic field at which the spin-flop transition occurs in CPS (Bsf). This is a direct indication that the magnetic behavior of the CPS influences the charge transport in graphene, which is detected here by the AH effect.

The trace and retrace measurements of Rxy in Fig. 1e show no hysteresis vs. Bz, except for Bz close to Bsf. This hysteresis is absent in the SQUID measurements of the bulk crystal, implying the sensitivity of the AH effect to the behaviour of the magnetization of the outer-most layer of the CPS (MCPS). Under applied Bz, the behavior of MCPS is expected to be ruled by its antiferromagnetic coupling with respect to the other CPS layers, and yet, the lack of a neighboring CPS layer on top can cause the MCPS to lag behind the magnetization dynamics of the bulk of CPS, leading to the observed hysteresis. By decreasing Bz, MCPS undergoes a spin-flop transition at  ~0.5 T, by which Rxy in the retrace retrieves its initial value as in the trace measurement. The difference of Rxy in the trace and retrace measurements is about 80‚ÄâŒ© (shown in the inset of Fig. 1e), which is the AH effect signal generated by the spin-flop transition of the MCPS.

The AH resistance (RAH) is dependent on the projection of the magnetization MCPS along the c-axis. From the comparison of the magnetization values measured by SQUID at Bz ~ 0.8 and 8 T (in Fig. 1c), one can tell that through the spin-flop transition, the MCPS cants towards the c-axis only by 6 degrees, which has led to RAH ‚âà 80‚ÄâŒ©. Considering that and the linear relation between the RAH and z-component of MCPS, RAH should be about 700 Œ© when MCPS is fully saturated out-of-plane, consistent with the value we measure at large Bz (see SI, Figure S5). Further evaluation of the AH effect at various temperatures is shown in Fig. 1f (inset), indicating a considerable decay vs. T. Yet, there is a finite value of RAH of about 150‚ÄâŒ© that persists up to 300‚ÄâK. Note that at elevated temperatures CPS is a paramagnet, thus a finite magnetic field is required to induce magnetism in graphene. The detected RAH in this heterostructure is larger than that achieved so far in proximitized graphene9,10,40,41. The observation of such a sizable RAH is a signature of the co-presence of strong induced spin-orbit and exchange interactions42 in the proximitized graphene up to room temperature, which is consistent with the recently reported enhancement of the Curie temperature at the graphene-CPS interface43. The detection of the unprecedentedly large AH effect in this system is also expected from the strong hybridization between the graphene and CPS bands, shown by our density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see SI, Section 14).

Having established the proximity-induced magnetism in the graphene channel, we explore the QH regime of transport in this system. By cooling down the device, signatures of QH transport become evident at finite Bz, as shown in Fig. 2. Panel a shows the modulation of the longitudinal resistivity (œÅxx) vs. Bz, i.e., the Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations (SdHOs). The back-gate voltage (Vbg) is set to 50‚ÄâV to shift the Dirac point such that the electron-like Landau levels (LLs) are reachable by the top-gating. We evaluate the back-gate vs. top-gate dependence of the LLs in Figure S7, indicating only a shift of the LLs by electrostatic doping without any significant change in the Landau fan diagram with Vbg (SI, Figure S8). Moreover, there is a negligible shift of the Dirac peak vs. Bz (SI, Figure S9) and there is a minimal hysteresis for the Vtg-dependence of œÅxx, which decreases with raising temperature (SI, Figure S10). These observations are in contrast with recent reports on graphene in the proximity of CrX336 or CrOCl35, where gate-dependent interfacial charge transfer influences the transport in graphene.

Dashed lines are the fits to the data using \(\Delta {\sigma }_{{{\rm{xx}}}}=T/\sinh (2{\pi }^{2}{k}_{{{\rm{B}}}}T{m}_{{{\rm{c}}}}/\hslash e{B}_{{{\rm{z}}}})\). Inset: cyclotron mass, mc, extracted from all the hole-like LLs, plotted as the ratio with respect to the electron rest mass (m0) vs. carrier density (n). The red curve is a fit to the extracted mc/m0 vs. n, considering a linear dispersion relation, resulting in Fermi velocity, vF ‚âà 1.196 √ó 106 m/s. The black curve is the theoretically expected behavior for pristine graphene with vF‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ106 m/s. The effective n in the graphene channel is extracted from Hall measurements (for Bz ‚â• 8‚ÄâT), and separately from the dependence of Bz vs. Vtg for each LL. These two approaches give rise to similar extracted values for n (see SI, Section 8). c Landau fan diagram: the red dots are the maxima of the œÅxx vs. Vtg extracted from panel a for gate voltages slightly away from the charge neutrality point (‚à£Vtg ‚àí Vcnp‚à£ > 5‚ÄâV), with the red dashed lines as linear fits.

From the QH transport, we obtain the cyclotron mass mc and the Fermi velocity vF of the electrons in the magnetized graphene. Having the temperature-dependence of the modulations of the longitudinal conductivity ŒîœÉxx (see SI, Figure S11b), mc is extracted by fitting ŒîœÉxx to the standard expression \(T/\sinh (2{\pi }^{2}{k}_{{{\rm{B}}}}T{m}_{{{\rm{c}}}}/\hslash e{B}_{{{\rm{z}}}})\), with kB the Boltzmann constant44,45, shown for the first few hole-like LLs in Fig. 2b. The ratio of the cyclotron mass vs. the rest mass of the electrons (mc/m0) extracted from the SdHOs at 8‚ÄâT < ‚à£Bz‚à£‚â§9‚ÄâT for different carrier density (n) is shown in the inset. The extracted mc/m0 ratio and the vF determined from the fit vs. n show consistency with that expected for the case of pristine graphene with vF = 1.1 √ó 106‚Äâm/s (indicated by the black solid line in the inset)44,45.

However, the Landau fan diagram in graphene-CPS (Fig. 2a) differs from that of pristine graphene, showing shifts of the LLs in Vtg and minimal broadening of the zeroth LL (zLL) vs. Bz. A slight non-linearity of the first Landau fans is present close to zero energy which could be related to a small non-linear dependence of n vs. Vtg close to the charge neutrality point (Vcnp). This nonlinearity is likely related to a small contribution of CPS localized midgap states in the total capacitance at low density of states in graphene, particularly at large positive Vtg when the Fermi energy EF is expected to get closer to the conduction band edge in the CPS. In Fig. 2c, we show the maxima of œÅxx vs. Vtg for ‚à£Vtg ‚àí Vcnp‚à£ > 5‚ÄâV, together with the linear fits, clearly showing the linear behavior of the Landau fans. That also rules out the dominant contribution of interfacial charge transfer that would cause nonlinearities in Landau fans due to its dependence on magnetic ordering35,36. Figure 2c further indicates that the Landau fans do not converge at one point at Vcnp, implying finite shifts of the LLs in Vtg. We can correlate the shift of the LLs to the opening of the bulk gap at the charge neutrality point in the graphene channel due to the induced staggered potential. The shift is pronounced in the Vtg-dependence since the presence of the CPS midgap states within the graphene bulk gap and LL gaps slows down the tuning of the EF close to the Vcnp (further details in SI, Section 9). It is also worth noting that the zLL shows minimal broadening and a negligible increase in resistance vs. Bz, in contrast to that reported in pristine graphene14. This observation is suggestive of the presence of edge states at the zLL gap that shunt the transport at Vcnp. The slow modulation of the EF by Vtg within the zLL energy gap in this system can assist with resolving the edge states within the gap.

On another note, we highlight that the spin-splitting of the LLs with NLL‚Äâ‚â†‚Äâ0 is not resolved within the broadening of the SdHOs in the Landau fan diagram of Fig. 2a. We attribute this to the presence of disorder in this system (with low charge carrier mobility), hindering the resolution of the spin-split bands at higher energies. In fact, the absence of the spin-split Landau fan diagram indicates that the induced magnetism is not large in this heterostructure, and thus the observation of the strong AH effect should be mainly due to a sizable SOC induced in the graphene channel. The larger induced SOC, as compared with the exchange interaction, is expected to result in the emergence of helical (and not chiral) states in this heterostructure20. In fact, depending on the relative strengths of Rashba SOC, Kane-Mele SOC, and magnetic exchange interactions, the system can transition between the QSH and QAH regimes20.

For addressing the topological edge states in the graphene bulk gap, we focus on the transport close to zero energy. Helical states are spin-polarized electron- and hole-like bands within the bulk gap of the proximitized graphene18 that counter-propagate at the edges of the graphene channel, as shown in the schematics of Fig. 3a. Figure 3b shows the gate-dependence of the graphene resistivity (œÅxx, left axis) and resistance (Rxx, right axis) close to the charge neutrality point, for small applied magnetic fields (Bz ‚â§ 0.5‚ÄâT). The œÅxx shows oscillations that develop into the SdHOs in the Landau fan diagram of Fig. 2a at higher Bz. The Vtg dependence of œÅxx at Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0‚ÄâT (in Fig. 3b) has a wide peak at the charge neutrality point. When such four-terminal longitudinal measurements are evaluated in terms of conductance (G‚Äâ=‚Äâ1/Rxx‚Äâ=‚ÄâI/Vxx), as shown in Fig. 3c for different voltage probe pairs, it becomes evident that the broadened resistance peak at Vcnp at 0 T is a plateau of conductance at 2‚Äâe2/h. This quantized conductance at zero energy is evidence for the presence of counter-propagating spin-polarized helical states, as depicted in Fig. 3a.

a A schematic of the device and a four-terminal measurement geometry are shown with the propagation direction of the helical states at the edge of the graphene channel. b Vtg-dependence of the graphene resistivity, œÅxx, (left axis), and resistance, Rxx (right axis), at Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0 to 0.5 T. The measurements are performed using the first voltage pair as in Fig. 2a. The plots are offset (except for Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0‚ÄâT) for a clearer visualization of the SdHOs. The red dashed line is to highlight the value of the Rxx‚Äâ‚âà‚Äâ13‚ÄâkŒ© at the charge neutrality point. c Conductance (G = I/Vxx) vs. Vtg close to the charge neutrality point at Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0‚ÄâT, measured in the four-terminal configurations shown in the schematics of the device in the inset (the graphene channel length and width are 6 and 2‚ÄâŒºm, respectively). d Optical micrograph and schematics of device C that has two separate graphene channels with a different aspect ratio compared with that of devices A and B (the dimensions of the graphene channels are indicated in the schematics). The white dashed line in the optical image indicates the position where the graphene channel is cut to form two electrically isolated regions with 3 and 5 electrodes. e Two-, three- and four-terminal conductance in device C, measured at various configurations shown in the schematics of the device in the insets. Note that the VCNP in device C is around 4‚Äì6‚ÄâV. All measurements are performed at Bz = 0‚ÄâT at T‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.3‚ÄâK. The dashed lines indicate the theoretically expected values for conductance considering helical states, color-coded with respect to the measurement geometry indicated in the inset.

To further explore the helical nature of the edge transport at Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0‚ÄâT, we investigate the effect of floating voltage probes on the conductance values at the Vcnp measured in various geometries. Helical charge transport occurs on both edges of the graphene channel with each edge hosting one spin-polarized state46. In this case, the voltage probes present along the edges alter the conductance between the source and the drain, since the charges do not maintain their spin when entering the probes. Thus, according to the Landauer-B√ºttiker formalism47 (SI, Section 13), the two-terminal conductance G2T in the presence of two counter-propagating (helical) edge states is given by the relation:

where NL and NR are the number of floating probes between the source and drain, along the left and right edges of the conductor. Similarly, the four-terminal conductance G4T is given by

where NI is the number of floating probes in between the source and drain along the edge which hosts the voltage probes, and NV is the number of floating electrodes in between the voltage probes48. For the measurement of Fig. 3c, NL‚Äâ=‚ÄâNR‚Äâ=‚ÄâNI‚Äâ=‚Äâ6, and NV‚Äâ=‚Äâ0, thus, G4T‚Äâ=‚Äâ2‚Äâe2/h, which is the value measured at Bz = 0‚ÄâT at the zLL conductance plateau. Considering the equations above, we evaluate the transport in various two-, three- and four-terminal measurement geometries, shown for device A in the SI, Figure S20, and for device C in Fig. 3e. The graphene channel in device C has been cut by an atomic force microscope tip, shaped into the Hall bar geometry with an aspect ratio different from that of device A and B, to rule out any coincidental geometrical factors in the measured conductance. Device C consists of two electrically disconnected regions with three and five electrodes connected to the channel (Fig. 3d). In panel e, the expected G values considering the helical edge states, following equations 1 and 2, are shown by the dashed lines that are color-coded with respect to each measurement geometry. We observe that, despite the distinct G measured at Vtg ‚â† Vcnp, the conductance values at Vcnp in each geometry closely match the theoretical values expected in the presence of QSH effect, confirming that the helical states dominate the charge transport at Vcnp in the magnetized graphene in the absence of an external magnetic field.

Under finite Bz, the conductance at the charge neutrality point in device A just slightly deviates from the quantized value of 2e2/h, as shown in Fig. 4a. Persistence of helical states at finite Bz depends on the evolution of the zLLs and can be disturbed by bands crossing at certain Bz49. In this case, the temperature dependence of the QH transport can provide further insight into the nature of the zLL gap50. In Fig. 4b, we show the gate-dependence of the graphene resistance at Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ9‚ÄâT up to room temperature. We observe that the resistance at the zLL increases by increasing T. This metallic T-dependence is consistent with the presence of the gapless helical states at the zLL up to large Bz. In the inset of panel b, the T ‚àí dependence of Rxx at zero energy is compared for Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0 and 9‚ÄâT. The slight decay of Rxx vs. T at Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0 can be related to the scattering of the spin-polarized edge states at higher T due to random fluctuations of the magnetic moments (which is eliminated at large Bz). Thus, at Bz‚Äâ=‚Äâ0 the contribution of the bulk transport becomes more dominant at higher T and the resistance drops as a result of the thermal broadening of the Dirac peak.

a Vtg-dependence of the conductance close to the Vcnp, measured at 0 < ‚à£Bz‚à£ < 9‚ÄâT in a four-terminal geometry with V5 and V6 voltage probes in device A. b Gate-dependence of the graphene resistivity (left axis) and resistance (right axis) at Bz = 9‚ÄâT, measured at various T. Inset: Temperature-dependence of the maxima of the four-terminal resistance at Vtg = Vcnp, shown for Bz = 0, 9‚ÄâT.

These observations introduce graphene-CPS heterostructure as a promising platform to exploit unconventional quantum phenomena for practical applications, as it hosts quantum coherent spin-polarized edge states without the need for any external magnetic field. The emergence of the QSH edge states is due to a strong hybridization at the graphene-CPS interface that induces spin-orbit and exchange interactions in graphene, further confirmed by the observation of a large AH effect. The coexistence of the AH and QSH effects in this system experimentally confirms the possibility of the formation of QSH states despite the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The observation of helical states in graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures without an external magnetic field, in addition to the persistence of AH signal up to room temperature, opens the route for the direct applications of magnetic graphene in 2D topological spintronic devices.

CrPS4 crystals are grown following a solid-state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts of Cr (99.99%, Alfa-Aesar), P (>99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and S (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) are sealed inside an evacuated quartz tube (pressure 5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí5‚Äâmbar, length: 50‚Äâcm, internal diameter: 14 mm) and placed in a three-zone furnace. A temperature gradient of 750/650/700 ¬∞C is kept for 21 days followed by a quench into water. The obtained crystals are analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The refinement of the X-ray pattern (ICSD 25059) reveals a monoclinic C face center crystal system with C121 space group and a unit cell determined by Œ±‚Äâ=‚ÄâŒ≥‚Äâ=‚Äâ90¬∞ and Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ91.99(1)¬∞ and a‚Äâ=‚Äâ10.841(9)√Ö, b‚Äâ=‚Äâ7.247(6)√Ö and c‚Äâ=‚Äâ6.100(5)√Ö. The amount of elements is Cr:23.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.5%, P:14.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.4% and S:61.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.5%, in good agreement with the expected ones (Cr:24.6%, P: 14.7% and S: 60.7%). The obtained results are in accordance with the ones previously reported in the literature39. Note that the CPS flakes used in heterostructures with graphene in this work are from the same batch of crystal which is characterized by the SQUID magnetometry in Fig. 1b, c.

The charge transport measurements are performed using a DC current source, and voltages are measured using Keithley 2100 multimeters. DC voltage source is used for the gates. The measurements are performed using a variable temperature insert at He atmosphere (attoDry2100 system).

The von Hippel‚ÄìLindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL) is an E3 ligase substrate receptor that binds proline-hydroxylated hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1Œ±, leading to its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. By using protein arrays, we identified a small molecule that binds the HIF1Œ±-binding pocket on pVHL and functions as a molecular glue degrader of the neosubstrate cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1) by recruiting it into the VHL‚ÄìCullin‚ÄìRING E3 ligase complex and leading to its selective degradation. The CDO1-binding region involved in VHL recruitment was characterized through a combination of mutagenesis and protein‚Äìprotein docking coupled with molecular-dynamics-based solvation analysis. The X-ray structure of the ternary complexes of VHL, CDO1 and degrader molecules confirms the binding region prediction and provides atomic insights into key molecular glue interactions.

Avoiding severe global warming requires large-scale removals of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Forest regeneration offers cost-effective carbon removals, but annual rates vary substantially by location and forest age. Here we generate grid-level (~1-km2) growth curves for aboveground live carbon in naturally regrowing forests by combining 109,708 field estimates with 66 environmental covariates. Across the globe and the first 100 years of growth, maximum carbon removal rates varied 200-fold, with the greatest rates estimated in ~20- to 40-year-old forests. Despite a focus on new forests for natural climate solutions, protecting existing young secondary forests can provide up to 8-fold more carbon removal per hectare than new regrowth. These maps could help to target the optimal ages and locations where a key carbon removal strategy could be applied, and improve estimates of how secondary forests contribute to global carbon cycling.

With climate change intensifying globally1 and a narrowing window in which to act2, meeting the 1.5‚Äâ¬∞C warming target requires steep emissions cuts alongside large-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) removals3. Natural climate solutions can provide cost-effective, scalable carbon removals4,5, with forest cover restoration as a particularly prominent strategy6,7,8. However, carbon removal rates can vary substantially by location and as forests age, meaning newly regenerating forests may not provide substantial carbon removal for years9. Thus, understanding this variation is critical for leveraging forest restoration for effective climate mitigation, and can guide policymakers and project developers as they integrate carbon removal strategies with other key objectives‚Äîsuch as biodiversity conservation, livelihood support and socio-economic priorities.

Despite a common emphasis on tree planting10, resources are insufficient to plant trees at the required scale3,11. Instead, greater focus is needed on natural forest regeneration10,12, regrowth on cleared lands after disturbance8, which can be highly effective at capturing carbon and restoring biodiversity and other ecosystem services8,13,14,15.

Existing estimates of potential carbon removal by natural forest regrowth fail to capture sufficient variation across space and stand age. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default removal rates distinguish only two secondary forest age classes: young (‚â§20 years) and old (21‚Äì100 years)16,17, at the level of continent and ecozone. Cook-Patton et al.8 improved the spatial resolution with a global 1-km2-resolution map for young (‚â§30 years) forests, but did not address how removals change as forests mature. Another recent effort18 showed removal rates declining through time, but only at the level of global forest types (for example, broadleaf deciduous forests). Recent remote sensing-based approaches integrate time since disturbance with biomass maps to estimate biomass accumulation as forests age19,20, but are constrained by <40 years of satellite data, which limits estimates in older stands, and rely on coarse space-for-time substitutions19. Consequently, current research limits our ability to spatially and temporally assess the medium- and long-term climate mitigation potential of allowing naturally regenerating forests to mature.

To better understand atmospheric CO2 removal by natural forest regeneration, we mapped live aboveground carbon (AGC) density through time in stands aged 1‚Äì100 years using eight times more field data than prior efforts (109,708 versus 13,112 plots)8. We grouped these data into 5-year age classes and combined each subset with 66 global environmental covariates‚Äîcovering climate, soil properties, radiation, topography and biome (Extended Data Table 2)‚Äîto train random forest models and produce global age-specific predictions of AGC density (Extended Data Fig. 1). The covariate layers represent static or average conditions over the past 50 years; we excluded satellite-derived variables tied to discrete points in time. We then fitted a Chapman‚ÄìRichards (CR) function (Methods and equation (1)) to each grid cell, deriving the CR parameters A (theoretical maximum carbon density, MgC ha‚àí1), k (growth rate) and b (scaling factor; Extended Data Fig. 2). Combining these with a default for m (Methods) yields growth curves at ~1-km2 resolution, reflecting average growth conditions and background levels of mortality. We chose the CR function for its capacity to model typical nonlinear forest growth21. While our curves extend to 100 years, they are not intended to predict carbon removals under future climate conditions. Rather, they address policy-relevant horizons to ~2050, aligning with many national, international and corporate net zero targets, and provide insights into potential carbon removal from naturally regenerating forests with known ages.

With these curves, we (1) quantify spatial and temporal variation in AGC density (MgC ha‚àí1) and removal rates (MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1); (2) identify locations and stand ages with peak removal rates; and (3) assess the potential contribution of natural forest regeneration to climate mitigation. We validate our results with standard cross-validation protocols and compare our results to both remote sensing-derived curves and to IPCC defaults. While it is well established that tree carbon storage increases and removal rates change nonlinearly as forests age, our spatially explicit estimates identify where and when maximum removals probably occur. This work offers more precise temporal and spatial estimates of carbon removal rates than previously available, enabling more targeted optimization. Furthermore, these outputs can be combined with maps of stand age or time since disturbance to determine a forest's current position on its carbon removal trajectory over the next few decades.

For each grid cell and forest age, we estimated annual carbon removal rates based on yearly changes in aboveground biomass. Rates typically start low, increase and then decline in older forests (Fig. 1a). To assess temporal variation, we calculated the difference (range) between each cell's maximum and minimum annual removal rate over 100 years of regrowth. Globally, this range spans 0.006‚Äì4.61 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1 (mean ¬± s.d.; 0.51‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.42 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1). The Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub biome shows the smallest range (0.19‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.23 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1), indicating relatively stable rates through time, whereas tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests exhibit the greatest range (0.98‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.45 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1).

Both panels show outputs from our model, with each point in b representing the modelled result for each individual ecoregion denoted with symbology for biome affiliation. Data are aggregated by biomes and ecoregions22 for visualization, but see Fig. 2 and Data availability for grid-level results.

We also examined the maximum carbon removal rate per grid (Figs. 1b and 2a) and found that it varies more than 200-fold across the globe (0.02‚Äì4.73 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1, mean 0.85‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.54), typically peaking in 30‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12-year-old stands (Figs. 1b and 2b). The Mediterranean forests, woodland, and scrub biome22 has the lowest mean maximum rates (0.40‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.33 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1, at 48‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ19 years), while the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest biome reaches the highest (1.57‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.49 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1, at 23‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7 years). Most forested ecoregions22 (84%) attain maximum removal rates between 20 and 40 years (Fig. 1b) with some divergence. Central Polynesian tropical moist forests peak at 4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4 years, while eastern Australian mulga shrublands peak at 74‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7 years. Overall, tropical moist forest ecoregions reach peak removals earliest (23‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7 years), followed by temperate broadleaf (25‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ7 years) and savanna ecoregions later (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 3). Within tropical moist forests, regional differences in peak ages occur, which may reflect limited training data (lowering confidence) or could be indicative of actual ecological dynamics. Comparing maximum removal rates with their timing highlights where and how quickly substantial removals can be realized. Tropical/subtropical moist broadleaf forests and some temperate forests achieve high rates early, whereas boreal, Mediterranean and tropical/subtropical savanna ecoregions reach lower peaks later.

Only forested biomes22 are shown. Maps created using QGIS version 3.34 with country boundaries from Natural Earth.

Capturing spatio-temporal variation in carbon removal rates improves estimates of natural forest regeneration's mitigation potential within policy-relevant timeframes. For instance, if regeneration starts in 2025 across 800 Mha of identified reforestable area6, up to 20.3 billion MgC could be removed by 2050. Delaying until 2030 or 2035 reduces the potential to 15.9 or 11.6 billion MgC (22 and 43% lower, respectively). The disproportionate loses relative to their time delays emphasize the importance of swift action in initiating natural regeneration23.

If the priority is maximizing per-hectare carbon removals from 2025 to 2050, existing secondary forests generally outperform new regeneration (Fig. 2c). The optimal 25-year window for each grid cell (19‚Äì43 years on average) could remove 20.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ13.1 MgC ha‚àí1 on average, compared with 18.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12.4 MgC ha‚àí1 over the first 25 years of new regeneration. Although the average increase is 10%, some locations show gains of up to 820% during their optimal window compared with the first 25 years. Only 1.3% of grid cells achieve maximum removal rates during the earliest stages of regeneration.

We reserved 10,836 field estimates (~10%) for validation, independent from model training. Across all age classes, the model produced a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.62 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.41. Error varied by age (Extended Data Fig. 4), with the 95-year class showing the lowest RMSE (0.30 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1) and the 90-year class the highest R2 (0.58). The 5- and 10-year classes had the highest RMSE (1.93 MgC ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1) and lowest R2 (0.22). Greater error in younger forests may stem from how starting carbon density was accounted for in the field data, as many stands begin with residual biomass, which probably varies by pre-regeneration land use, disturbance intensity or measurement protocols. The RMSE and R2 generally stabilized beyond 20 years (Extended Data Fig. 4).

We also compared our curves with independent regional estimates (Amazon, Congo Basin and Borneo) derived from remote sensing and time-since-disturbance methods19,20. Between the ages of 10 and 50 years, where growth rates typically peak (Fig. 3), our results aligned well. Discrepancies at younger ages may arise because Heinrich et al.19,20 forced their curves to zero, whereas we let our model estimate the intercept to prevent rate over-estimation in the youngest stands (Fig. 3). Beyond 50 years, differences may reflect (1) the finite length of the Landsat archive (~40 years)24; (2) biomass saturation in satellite-derived estimates25; or (3) coarse spatial aggregation in remote sensing approaches. Our modelled rates also broadly match benchmark data for the Brazilian Amazon26, which find ~80 MgC ha‚àí1 in 40-year-old stands. In comparison, our Amazon curves generally range between 50 and 100 MgC ha‚àí1 (Fig. 3a).

a‚Äìc, We used the same spatial boundaries as in Heinrich et al.19,20, randomly sampled 1,000 grid cells from our dataset within each region (shown in green with black line indicating regional mean) and compared them with the remote sensing-derived curves (in orange). The dashed portion of the orange line indicates where the remote sensing curves have been extrapolated beyond available remote sensing imagery. We show results for three regions: Amazon forests (a), Congo Basin (b) and Borneo (c).

Compared with IPCC defaults17, our modelled rates are 26% lower in forests aged 20 years and under, and 18% higher in forests aged 21‚Äì100 years (Fig. 4). These differences vary by ecozone: in young forests, our rates vary from 44% lower (North America rainforest ecozone) to 81% higher (South America temperate mountain system ecozone), while in older forests, they range from 20% lower (North America mountain systems ecosystem ecozone) to 196% higher (South America subtropical mountain system ecozone). IPCC defaults fail to capture the 1.2- to 15.8-fold variation within ecozones, and they do not account for the rapid acceleration in young stands or slowing in older ones (Fig. 5). These findings underscore the need for regularly updated, high-resolution estimates rooted in the latest field data capture variable growth dynamics across space and time.

a,b, Average predicted carbon removal rate per ecozone (yellow circles) compared with IPCC defaults (black circles) for older secondary forest (21‚Äì100 years; a) and young secondary forest (‚â§20 years; b). Yellow circles and coloured bars show the average carbon removal rate within the ecozone and range of grid cell values (5th‚Äì95th percentiles), respectively. Ecozone and continental forest types are indicated along the x axis. NA, North America; SA, South America.

a‚Äìd, Rates of carbon removal by forest stands for four ecozones. Average rate through stand ages (solid green line) and the overall range across grid cells (5th‚Äì95th percentile; shaded area) are compared with IPCC default rates for young (‚â§20 years; orange dashed line) and old (>20 years; red dashed line) secondary forests. These ecozones show distinct patterns: IPCC defaults for young forests are higher (a); IPCC defaults align with model means but miss variability (b); IPCC defaults are generally higher (c); and IPCC defaults bracket our modelled values but miss substantial variability (d).

We produced global 1-km resolution AGC curves for 100 years of natural forest regeneration. Combined with maps of stand age and reforestable area, these curves enable estimates of carbon removals over policy-relevant timescales from any starting age. For instance, if 800 Mha of restorable forest area6 began regenerating in 2025, they could remove up to 20.3 billion MgC by 2050. Delaying by 5 or 10 years cuts that potential by roughly a quarter or a half, respectively. Established young secondary forests can provide more immediate and often greater per-hectare removals‚Äîup to 8-fold by 2050 (Fig. 2c). Delays in restoration27, coupled with the lag before peak removal, further diminishes the mitigation potential of new regeneration.

Preventing warming beyond Paris Agreement targets requires deploying all feasible mitigation strategies. While reducing fossil fuel emissions remains paramount, maintaining and increasing forest sinks is also vital8,13. Young secondary forests warrant heightened attention as they can provide greater per-hectare carbon removals during critical climate and policy windows12,28,29, and their potential for removals is more assured than new regeneration, which may fail under unfavourable starting conditions. For instance, seed sources or dispersers may be absent, or rising temperatures may constrain germination30,31,32,33. Protecting at-risk secondary forests provides the climate mitigation benefits of both securing on-going peak removals and avoiding release of in situ carbon stocks34.

Climate mitigation through forest protection often focuses on intact and mature forests, given their high in situ carbon and biodiversity value35,36, which remains a crucial strategy37. Young forests, however, face escalating threats. Across Latin America, secondary forest loss is ten times more likely than persistence38. In the Brazilian Amazon, half of secondary forests are cleared within 8 years of establishment39, while in wet Costa Rican forests, the average age at clearance is 20 years40. Our estimates show that 8-year-old forest in the Brazilian Amazon would remove 36% more carbon from the atmosphere by 2030 than newly growing stands (7.7 versus 10.5 MgC ha‚àí1 from 2025 to 2030). Similarly, a 20-year-old wet Costa Rican forest would remove 65% more (7.9 versus 13.0 MgC ha‚àí1). Thus, prioritizing protection of at-risk young secondary forests for rapid carbon removal, alongside at-risk older stands with large carbon stocks, represents a crucial climate mitigation action.

However, there are limited mechanisms to protect young secondary forests. No carbon market methodologies currently credit protecting or improving management in very young secondary forests29. Rules require at least 10 years of cleared land prior to reforestation projects, while forest protection projects require forests to be at least 10 years old. Improved forest management projects only apply in places with logging operations, covering a fraction of secondary forests29.

For natural forest regeneration to be recognized as a climate mitigation action, several criteria must be met41,42. First, additionality‚Äîthe forest must be at risk of conversion or unlikely to grow under current conditions. This can be difficult to demonstrate for existing forests37, although newer dynamic baseline approaches enable comparing project areas to non-project areas to better estimate additionality. Second, durability, meaning the carbon must remain stored for decades to centuries41. Our model is built on empirical data inclusive of background mortality rates, because individual trees that die are excluded from the measurement of aboveground live carbon. This makes the estimate somewhat conservative in that it ignores carbon storage within dead pools. However, it does not account for potential increases in disturbance and mortality with future climate change43. Partial or stand-clearing disturbances would release some to all of the carbon back to the atmosphere, and these larger disturbances are not integrated into our growth curves.

Although we estimate up to 20.3 billion MgC could be removed by 2050 across 800 Mha, a full global potential assessment requires data on forest age, in situ carbon and future disturbance risk. Existing global forest age and biomass maps44,45 do not clearly distinguish regeneration from production forests46, nor predict future changes in forest cover47. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that on a per-hectare basis, protecting at-risk secondary forests over their peak removal window can deliver about 10% greater removal rates on average‚Äîand up to 820% more in some locations‚Äîcompared with initiating new regeneration (Fig. 2c). Alongside designating new areas of land for regeneration, these findings highlight the value of protecting existing secondary forests, and potentially implementing management that removes impediments to natural regeneration (for example, invasive liana removals).

Despite the insights gained, several caveats highlight avenues for deeper investigation. First, the socio-economic context of forest regeneration and the role of local communities must be recognized and prioritized48,49. Many secondary forests, as well as lands targeted for regeneration, are used by low-income, rural communities for livelihoods such as those based in shifting cultivation. Climate finance must account for detrimental effects on livelihoods, as natural climate solutions should not come at the expense of human rights and local development41. Engaging local communities and integrating their needs and knowledge into forest management is vital for achieving multiple sustainable and equitable outcomes. Trade-offs often arise among biodiversity, ecosystem service provisions and rural employment, and prioritization across multiple outcomes can highlight solutions that optimize the multiple benefits desired from restoration of forest cover and forest protection50,51.

Second, although our data include savanna and grassland biomes, they show limited and slow carbon removal (Fig. 1), aligning with evidence that tree establishment in savannas offers limited mitigation potential52. Frequent fire disturbance may also prevent stands from reaching ages of rapid removal53. These biomes have distinct biodiversity and carbon cycling processes. Their management for climate mitigation may demand tailored and nuanced approaches apart from forest regeneration54,55. Hence, caution is warranted when considering forest-focused climate mitigation strategies in non-forested systems.

Third, our plot data are heavily biased towards northern temperate forests (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). Improving field data coverage in underrepresented regions would increase confidence in our predictions. Integrating field and remoting sensing data would help to both fill spatial gaps in the field data and temporal gaps in the remote sensing data.

Fourth, additional steps could enhance both the completeness and accuracy of our carbon removal estimates. We focused on AGC, but incorporating other pools (for example, soil carbon) would provide more comprehensive results. Our projections are based on average historical climate, with their application across longer time horizons limited. Future work should incorporate climate change impacts on removal rates and the durability of stored carbon56. We also did not assess the initial disturbance type of the plots, which may influence establishment, initial biomass and subsequent removal rates. Factors like site degradation19, fine-scale environmental variation (for example, slope, proximity to roads)57 and presence of seed dispersal33 further impact the likelihood of regeneration and pace of carbon removal. However, our data can be combined with maps of the likelihood of natural regeneration to further refine estimates of mitigation potential58. Finally, inconsistencies with how the stand ages were calculated and reported in the inventory data (for example, even- versus uneven-aged stands) may introduce noise into our results. Local analyses remain critical to refine these estimates for specific sites or projects.

Our model refines estimates of carbon removal rates of naturally regenerating secondary forests, highlighting where and when maximum sequestration rates occur. Protection and restoration of forest cover provide essential benefits to people, are recognized as critical mitigation actions by the IPCC3, and underpin many national and international targets59. By safeguarding intact forests for their existing carbon and biodiversity, maintaining secondary forests for immediate removals, and fostering new forests for future gains, we can strengthen the global forest carbon sink. When resources are constrained, prioritizing at-risk secondary forests offers faster and more substantial carbon benefits than establishing new stands. These findings can guide national and international policies and help ensure forest regeneration better mitigates climate change.

To create global maps of carbon removal rates in naturally regenerating forests, we merged field measurements of carbon stocks at known stand ages with an extensive set of environmental factors known to affect carbon densities and removal rates. We then predicted carbon densities in 5-year age intervals from 5 to 100 years using multiple random forest models at a spatial resolution of approximately 1‚Äâkm for the global terrestrial surface. Finally, we fitted a CR growth curve to each carbon density grid cell to create global maps of the CR curve parameters (Extended Data Fig. 1).

We assembled a global dataset of age-specific AGC estimates from field measurements in naturally regenerating forest areas, combining national and provincial forest inventory data with literature-extracted data.

We examined forest inventory data from Australia (2006‚Äì2017, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ58), Canada (1926‚Äì2018, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ52,737), the Netherlands (2001‚Äì2020, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ3,577), Sweden (2007‚Äì2017, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ26,805) and the USA (1999‚Äì2020, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ135,289). Selection criteria required plots to be in naturally regenerating stands with documented age, geolocation and aboveground biomass or carbon measurements expressible in Mg ha‚àí1. For inventory data from Quebec, aboveground biomass was calculated from tree-level data in 5,191 permanent sample plots with information about tree species, age and diameter at breast height. To convert from diameter at breast height to biomass, we used allometric equations from the Canadian national biomass equations60,61 and then aggregated tree-level data to the plot level. Finally, we noted that many forest inventory datasets adjusted plot geolocations by ~1‚Äâkm to adhere to security protocols; this aggregation aligned with our spatial resolution.

Our literature-derived data, sourced from a systematic review of 11,360 studies by Cook-Patton et al.8, supplemented the inventory data and expanded its geographic coverage. Following the methods in Cook-Patton et al.8, we reviewed 330 additional recent studies (that is, published between 19 April 2017 and 13 August 2021), maintaining the same selection criteria focused on empirical measures of AGC, stand age and geolocation for naturally regenerating forest plots.

To ensure consistency and accuracy, we standardized data across sources, excluding duplicates, erroneous locations (for example, locations within water bodies), stands younger than one year and outliers (AGC‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3 s.d. from the mean for each age). The refined dataset comprised 172,585 AGC measurements, temporally and spatially aggregated into 20 age class bins, corresponding to 5-year intervals centred on 5, 10, 15,‚Ä¶90, 95, 100 years. For each age class, we computed the mean AGC within ~1-km grid cells, using cell centroids for geolocation, culminating in 109,708 estimates of AGC (Extended Data Fig. 5).

We estimated AGC densities in naturally regenerating forests aged up to 100 years, by using a spatial predictive model combining the global dataset of field-based estimates with 66 environmental covariates, as developed by Cook-Patton et al.8. The covariates encompassed a range of factors including climate, soil nutrients, chemical and physical properties, radiation, topography and nitrogen deposition, in addition to a categorical biome variable (Extended Data Table 2), and reflected long-term average conditions since 1970. The covariates were standardized on a WGS84 grid at 30 arcsec (~1‚Äâkm2 at the Equator.) We downsampled higher-resolution data using mean aggregation and applied direct sampling without interpolation for upsampling lower-resolution data.

Following the approach in Cook-Patton et al.8, we employed random forest models using all environmental variables. We reserved approximately 10% of our data for validation (10,836 points), and excluded these from the model training process that utilized the remaining 98,872 points. The validation data were selected randomly within each age class. However, to reduce effects of spatial autocorrelation, points were not used for validation if they were within 10‚Äâkm of any training data. The underlying field data, all from naturally regenerating forests, spanned 50 countries, with a strong concentration in temperate regions such as Canada, the USA and Europe (Extended Data Fig. 5), with a slight concentration in older age classes (~60‚Äì80 years; Extended Data Fig. 6). Despite some geographic gaps, particularly in tropical forest biomes (Extended Data Table 1), our dataset marked a substantial enhancement from previous efforts8, with improved geographic coverage in Canada, Europe, China, Russia and South America.

We constructed a unique model to estimate AGC density for each forest age class rather than a single model for across all age classes. To tune the model parameters, we applied three-fold cross-validation. Data for each age class were segmented into three equal parts: two were combined for training and the third served as a validation set. We assessed model performance through three rounds of validation, each time rotating the validation subset, and selecting hyper-parameters based on the lowest average RMSE from the tree iterations.

We implemented a Monte Carlo approach to develop an ensemble model for our initial AGC density model predictions and uncertainty for each age class. We developed the ensemble model by bootstrapping 100 independent samples (randomly selected 80% of the training data with replacement) for each age class. We then trained individual random forest models on each of the 100 samples using the optimized set of hyper-parameters, resulting in 100 predictions of AGC density for each grid cell for each age class. From these estimates, we quantified cell-level model uncertainty by calculating the standard deviation and error ratio among the ensemble predictions for each age class (see Data availability). The modelling process to this point, including machine learning operations, was conducted in Google Earth Engine62.

Our random forest models generated global maps of carbon densities for forest age classes. We then fitted the CR growth function through the 5-year estimates of AGC density at each cell. We did this for two reasons. First, carbon density in each age class is dependent on carbon density in proceeding age classes. Second, because our plot data are not consistently distributed across space and age classes, the initial model outputs sometimes show erratic or declining carbon densities between sequential age classes, as highlighted in Extended Data Fig. 7. A CR growth function thus helps to smooth out age-based variation and more accurately mirror the natural progression of forest maturation.

The CR function, a staple in forest growth modelling63, provides a versatile framework capable of encapsulating either sigmoidal or logarithmic growth trajectories. It is expressed through the formula:

where y denotes the accumulated carbon at time t; A represents the asymptotic carbon accumulation limit; b impacts the initial carbon density; m is a shape-controlling parameter; k signifies the growth rate; and e is the base of the natural logarithm. For this study, we set m at 0.67 (ref. 21). We optimized and produced 1-km-resolution maps of A, b and k based on our dataset. While many approaches assume initial carbon density to be 0 at stand initiation16,19, we optimized this parameter. Our model often predicted at least some AGC density at stand initiation (that is, b‚Äâ<‚Äâ1.0; Extended Data Fig. 2c), except at some northern latitudes where stand-clearing disturbances (for example, wildfire and clearcut harvest) are common64. This reduced error may reflect realistic conditions where some residual biomass remains at stand initiation and leads to more conservative estimates of carbon removal rates at the youngest stand ages.

We utilized the nonlinear least squares method in R from the base STATS package to optimize the A, b and k parameters of the CR model for each cell, using the AGC density estimates from our random forest models. The optimization leveraged 100 AGC density estimates per cell per age class from the random forest ensemble. We exported global data for each age class from Google Earth Engine in 5¬∞ tiles, resulting in twenty 100-band images per tile. We also exported potential maximum carbon density values, calculated as the maximum of our estimates or those from Walker et al.65, as starting values for A in the optimization.

In R, we loaded all images for a tile and converted them into a single vector of cell values, along with vectors of corresponding age values and potential maximum density. For each cell, relevant values were extracted, and the nonlinear least squares optimization was performed. Starting values were set for each parameter (A‚Äîmaximum potential from ref. 65, k‚Äî0.5 and b‚Äî0.75). A was allowed to vary up to 10% of the starting value, k between 0.01 and 0.1, and b between 0.2 and 1. If non-convergence occurred for a grid cell, updated estimates were set as new starting values, and the optimization was repeated, up to four times, ensuring convergence for all cells. The resulting parameters and standard errors were stored and converted back to raster datasets with the same resolution and grid as the original data.

We employed parallel processing capabilities in R using the doParallel (v. 1.0.17) package, which enabled simultaneous processing of individual tiles across available computer cores, substantially improving computation time.

This approach enabled us to generate refined global maps with ~1-km resolution. Fitting CR curves through the 5-year carbon density estimates at each grid cell smoothed out the fluctuations and resulted in detailed maps of the CR curve parameters: the asymptote (A; Extended Data Fig. 2a) represented the maximum potential carbon density (MgC ha‚àí1), the growth rate coefficient (k; Extended Data Fig. 2b) and the initial carbon density coefficient (b; Extended Data Fig. 2c) at time zero. Globally, maximum potential carbon density (A) ranged from 27 to 187 MgC ha‚àí1 (5th‚Äì95th percentile), with the greatest values generally in carbon-dense, moist tropical forests and lowest in boreal forests (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Higher k values led to steeper CR curves, and we found that the highest k values concentrated in northern latitudes and moist tropical forests, whereas savannas have lower k values, suggesting that it takes longer to achieve the maximum carbon removal in these drier ecosystems (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Combining the cell-level parameter with an assumed default for the remaining parameter (m) made it possible to construct grid-level growth curves that predict changes in AGC storage (MgC ha‚àí1) through time.

From our growth curves we extracted the total AGC density corresponding to the locations and age classes for each point from our reserved validation dataset (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ10,836). With these data we calculated the RMSE and R2. We calculated these for all results pooled as well as each age class independently.

We compared the growth curves generated by our model with those derived independently through remote sensing19,20. These studies combined estimates of time since disturbance (that is, forest age) with biomass maps across three large geographical regions: the Congo Basin, Amazon Basin and Borneo forests. Within the spatial extents as used by Heinrich et al.19 for each region, we extracted the growth curves for 1,000 random points as well as the mean growth curve across all cells. We plotted these curves along with the regional curves for each region as developed by Heinrich et al.19.

We compared our predicted rates with the latest IPCC default rates for both young (‚â§20-year-old) and old (21‚Äì100-year-old) secondary forests. For each cell, we estimated the rate of carbon removal for young and old forests, by averaging the annual removal rates for each of each of the age classes. We then aggregated these, calculating the minimum, maximum and mean, across each ecozone‚Äìcontinent combination (Fig. 4). Note that the IPCC defaults were calculated by dividing predicted carbon density (MgC ha‚àí1) by stand age16. This led to inflated estimates of carbon removal if the stand contained residual biomass. Thus, we did not mimic these methods, but instead used our more conservative estimates based on changes in AGC.

The sequential steps used to generate grid-level growth curves, from assembling field data and environmental covariates to training random forest models and fitting Chapman‚ÄìRichards functions for each forest age class.

(a) The curve asymptote, parameter ‚ÄòA', represents the maximum potential carbon density, (b) parameter ‚Äòk' is the growth rate coefficient and represents the maximum growth rate over the stand age, and (c) parameter ‚Äòb', the y-axis intersect, indicates initial carbon density at time zero. Increasing A shifts the maximum height of the curve (see panel a inset). Decreasing k flattens the curve (see panel b inset) and increasing b to 1 brings initial carbon density towards zero (see panel c inset). Stand age combined with A, k, b and a fifth parameter (‚Äòm', which we fixed at 2/3) will construct grid-level growth curves. Only forested biomes22 are shown. Maps created using QGIS version 3.34 with country boundaries from Natural Earth.

Each box plot shows the median (solid horizontal line), the 25th to 75th percentiles (box edges), and whiskers extending to 1.5 times the interquartile range. Individual outlier points beyond that range represent ecoregions with unusually high or low ages. The distribution is derived from the mean values of all ecoregions within each biome.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) by age class, showing how model performance varies across different stand ages. Lower RMSE and higher R2 indicate better predictive accuracy for that age class.

Field data were concentrated in northern regions, but scarcer in the tropics. Darkest red shade shows countries with the greatest number of field plots, and the darkest blue shade indicates countries with the least number of field plots (and white for no data). Countries shown with the red versus the blue scale had at least 500 field plots or less than 500 field plots, respectively. See Extended Data Table 1 for plot coverage by ecological zone. Map created using QGIS version 3.34 with country boundaries from Natural Earth.

Field data were fairly evenly distributed across age classes, but with the lowest number of plots at very early stand ages and the greatest distribution of plots in middle to older forest stands.

The age-related trend in rate of AGC accumulation is from a grid in a temperate coniferous forest in the Pacific Northwest, USA, but resembles patterns observed in many other locations. The brown bars indicate the range of carbon density estimates per 5-year age class that resulted across 100 different random forest model runs. The blue curve indicates the best-fit Chapman-Richards (CR) curve through the carbon density estimates to smooth out variation in carbon density from age class to age class.

Everyone wants to filter out blue light. Whether through your glasses, laptop, or smartphone, companies have hopped on the bandwagon to integrate blue light blockers to cut the wavelength from reaching your eyes. The claim is to help improve sleep and reduce eyestrain, even though studies have yet to find these blockers effective.

TCL is one such company. It has been manufacturing phones and tablets with its ‚ÄúNxtpaper‚Äù LCD technology for a few years, and the third generation in the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G smartphone is good enough to block 61 percent more blue light than a normal tablet to ‚Äúprotect your eyes and reduce eye fatigue.‚Äù I've used this $250 Android phone for more than a week, and I don't think the claims hold up, but I've still come to enjoy the matte paperlike screen. Don't buy it for the blue-light blocking promises; buy it because the matte screen looks and feels nice.

The 60 XE's main attraction is the Nxtpaper matte LCD. It has a pleasing paperlike texture and isn't reflective. Colors are a smidge more muted than phones with OLED screens, and text and app icons can appear a little fuzzy‚ÄîI only really noticed this when comparing it side by side with another handset.

The phone's back has a similar matte texture, though with a marble pattern for a luxe look, complete with a glossy, round camera module. A friend said it looked ‚Äúfancy,"" though I find it teeters on tacky. I don't mind the marble pattern, but the camera module isn't symmetrical and feels a little out of place. Still, it doesn't look like any other $250 smartphone. That's a plus.

Back to the Nxtpaper display, though. On the right edge of the phone is the Nxtpaper switch, and flicking it up lets you choose from three display modes: Color Paper Mode, Ink Paper Mode, and Max Ink Mode. I'll get to what these modes do, but I want to point out that the switch feels cheap and has a slight rattle. Switching modes also takes a beat‚Äîit plays a little tune and animation each time, and I can't find a way to disable this. (You can at least set it so that it enters a specific mode when you flip the switch instead of having to choose every time.)

Standard mode

Ink Paper Mode

Color Paper Mode desaturates and softens the colors, almost like a color E Ink ebook reader. Ink Paper Mode strips away all color and goes black and white, and the color temperature of the screen is less blue. This is still an LCD, but to my eyes, it's better than Android phones that try to use E Ink. You get a similar paperlike reading experience and a matte screen, but unlike the Minimal Phone or the Boox Palma 2, it's not frustrating or slow. The 120-Hz screen refresh rate and decent onboard CPU make it perform like a normal phone.

I've enjoyed switching to either of these modes when I'm reading, whether through Chrome, Google News, or even doomscrolling through Bluesky. I usually turn it off and use the standard mode when swiping through Instagram Reels, though nothing's stopping you from watching videos in these modes if you prefer the desaturated look.

Max Ink Mode is much more extreme. It limits background app processes and power consumption while turning your phone screen black and white. You also get a special homescreen‚Äîfour fixed apps that you can't change at the bottom (Phone, Messages, Contacts, Settings), and then you can add eight apps of your choosing. You'll get notifications from these apps, and them alone. This mode is designed to be used for large bouts of reading, say in the Kindle app, and if that's what you end up doing, it greatly extends battery life to several days. Again, a mode like this makes way more sense than buying a Boox Palma 2, because it gets very close to the experience of an E Ink screen, without the annoyingly slow refresh experience.

But there is one big problem with TCL's Nxtpaper tech: it's hard to see in direct sunlight. Don't get me wrong, it's not that you can't use the phone outdoors. In shady areas or even on cloudy days, I didn't have much trouble reading the screen. But with the sun directly overhead, it's nearly impossible to read. The company says this has been addressed with its Nxtpaper 4.0 generation, but that's a hardware change, so you'll only see it in new TCL phones and tablets with Nxtpaper 4.0 technology.

The good news is that the 60 XE is a solid budget Android phone. The MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor and 8 GB of RAM deliver decent performance, though you'll see some stutters here and there and occasional choppy animations. My benchmark scores put it slightly ahead of the $200 Moto G 2025, but my real-world experience was much more positive as the 60 XE is nowhere as stuttery as the Moto, likely due to the increased RAM.

The 5,010-mAh battery feels like it should last longer‚ÄîI routinely hit around 30 to 25 percent by bedtime with average use, though you can extend it with Max Ink Mode. There's no wireless charging, but this phone has all the accouterments you'd want, from a microSD card slot for expandable storage and NFC for contactless payments to a headphone jack. The phone feels a little slippery and top-heavy, so I recommend finding a case to be safe, though I've dropped it a handful of times and luckily don't see any scratches on the glass screen.

It'll work with every major US carrier and is exclusively sold unlocked on Amazon, a nice break from many other TCL phones that are locked to a carrier in the US. Speaking of, I didn't have any issues with the 5G connectivity, but I did get some comments about call quality. I didn't have trouble hearing others, though I wish the call volume could get louder, but a few people struggled to hear me via the phone's speaker mode. I tested this with some friends, who didn't have any issues, so it's hard to say if it's a network problem or the caller's hardware.

That leaves the camera, which isn't terrible for a $250 phone. Quality heavily depends on the lighting, and even indoors during daylight, you'll probably want to turn on Night mode to avoid a blurry photo. The 50-MP main can struggle with high-contrast scenes, and colors don't look super accurate, but the results are passable. No problems scanning QR codes, at the very least.

The biggest drawback is software updates. This phone runs Android 15, and TCL is only promising one Android upgrade to Android 16 at some point in the future. No more Android features after that, though it'll get a total of two years of security updates. It's not significantly worse than other phones at this price, but Motorola now offers two Android upgrades for its Moto G phones. TCL should do better.

I'd buy a CMF Phone 2 Pro ($279) over the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G, as it looks better, has stronger performance, and nicer cameras. But the pleasing matte screen has this calming quality that I've come to enjoy over the past week, and I like the ability to switch to even less saturation or monochrome if I'm reading a lot. If you've eyed something like the Boox Palma 2 for some time, I think you'll have a much nicer experience with this TCL.

It may well be able to wade through deep water, have crawl-assist mode for sketchy terrain, and even perform 360-degree swivel-on-the-spot tank turns, but sales of the seemingly much-anticipated electric Mercedes G-Class SUV have been poor. Actually, that's an understatement. They've been woeful.

And it's not the only e-flop from a legacy automaker: Just last week Ferrari announced that it is delaying its second EV model (the first will arrive in October) until at least 2028 because of weak demand. Porsche has cut back its plans for EVs amid soft sales of its electric Macan SUV and Taycan models. Indeed, depreciation on the Taycan is so eye-watering that some Porsche dealers have supposedly refused to take their own brand's performance EV from owners looking to offload or upgrade.

And after the February closure of its Belgian factory, Audi's Q8 E-tron has been discontinued. The shuttering of the Brussels plant, says Audi, was due to a ‚Äúglobal decline in customer orders in the electric luxury class segment.‚Äù Yet, at the same time, global sales of EVs are going gangbusters‚Äîso what gives?

Audi's Q8 E-tron has been discontinued following a ‚Äúglobal decline in customer orders in the electric luxury class segment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe transition to EVs is not just a case of putting a battery in a vehicle,‚Äù says Peter Wells, a business professor and director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, UK. ‚ÄúLarge premium EVs require very large batteries to match anything like the performance of typical ICE versions, and this increases their price.‚Äù

Indeed, the all-electric G-Wagen will set you back a staggering $162,000. The full EV Range Rover coming later this year is expected to cost even more, supposedly retailing for upwards of $180,000. ‚ÄúFor years, brands like Porsche, Audi, and others have been able to expand output and model ranges while continuing to command premium prices in the market. Those days are now over,‚Äù says Wells.

Mercedes sold just 1,450 G-Class G580 off-roaders in Europe through to April of this year, German newspaper Handelsblatt recently revealed, noting that this was considerably below the cheaper combustion variants, which totaled 9,700 sales. The G-Class‚Äîformerly the G-Wagen, or Gel√§ndewagen, German for ‚Äúcross-country vehicle‚Äù and originally developed for the German army‚Äîis a 45-year-old design, massively updated in 2022, but still ruggedly boxy when most EVs are aero and svelte. However, thanks to potential tariffs of up to 50 percent on imported cars from Europe, Mercedes likely won't be able to rely on the US to make up for its poor European sales for the electrified G-Wagen.

Handelsblatt cited an unnamed company insider saying the G580 has been a ‚Äúcomplete flop‚Äù since its launch in April last year. This is not the official line. ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz is prepared for all market scenarios,‚Äù says an email from company PR officer Markus Nast. ‚ÄúInto the 2030s, we can flexibly offer vehicles with both a fully electric drivetrain or an electrified high-tech combustion engine. Our customers decide what suits them best.‚Äù

But it seems those customers are mostly choosing cheaper ICE versions rather than the e-makeovers. Why settle for the faux G-Roar‚Äîa soundbar-actuated facsimile of a V8 engine piped into and around the electric G-Wagen‚Äîwhen you can have the genuine grumble, and at less cost? The extra $14,000 is an awful lot to pay for an all-terrain EV that on the outside appears almost the same as the $148,000 gas variant.

The ICE version of the G-Wagen might not have a button-activated 720-degree on-the-spot spin‚Äîa road-chewing donuting feature first introduced by Rivian yet soon dropped‚Äîbut the gas guzzler has a 500-mile range while the G580 can only manage 239 miles, a likely deal breaker for those who want to travel long distances for their off-asphalt adventures (even though electric powertrains have much to offer 4x4 action, with instant torque, better traction, less maintenance and a lower center of gravity.)

Porsche has cut back its plans for EVs amid soft sales of the electric Macan SUV and Taycan.

Of course, this is likely not a whole heap of customers. Most G-Wagens‚ÄîICE and electric‚Äîlive in the city, owned as military-chic status symbols. Those truly into the niche world of long-range backcountry EVs can save $60,000 by shunning the 570-horsepower G580 with almost no towing capacity for a $105,000, 850-hp Rivian R1S with a 410-mile range and plenty of oomph left over for pulling stuff.

‚ÄúPremium EVs [from legacy automakers] are not quite as amazing as they should be,‚Äù says Wells, and their introduction‚Äîin what could be characterized as the Cybertruck crunch‚Äîhas often come at the cost of ‚Äúneglecting the development of smaller EVs with mass appeal.‚Äù

On this front, legacy automakers are losing out to China, at least in those countries where Chinese EVs are sold. Which is most places except the US.

According to a new report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), global EV sales will surpass 20 million in 2025, accounting for more than a quarter of cars sold worldwide. In the first three months of 2025, electric car sales worldwide were up 35 percent over the previous year. And, adds the IEA, market share is on course to exceed 40 percent by 2030 as EVs‚Äîsmaller, cheaper ones, mainly‚Äîbecome increasingly affordable in more markets.

Almost half of all car sales in China last year were electric. Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America have also become new centers of growth, with total EV sales across these regions surging by more than 60 percent in 2024, according to the IEA. Meanwhile, EV sales grew by about 10 percent year-on-year in the US.

‚ÄúOur data shows that, despite significant uncertainties, electric cars remain on a strong growth trajectory globally,‚Äù says IEA executive director Fatih Birol. ‚ÄúSales continue to set new records, with major implications for the international auto industry. This year, we expect more than one in four cars sold worldwide to be electric, with growth accelerating in many emerging economies. By the end of this decade, it is set to be more than two in five.‚Äù

China, which accounts for more than 70 percent of global EV production, shipped nearly 1.25 million electric cars to other countries last year. The ending of EV subsidies in the EU has impacted European sales. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, the EU's EV market share in 2024 fell to 13.6 percent, down 1 percent from the prior year.

Volkswagen's luxury marques, including Porsche, Bentley, and Lamborghini, are reassessing their EV strategies. Porsche has scaled back plans for an all-electric lineup following a 49 percent decline in Taycan sales. Bentley has pushed back the launch of its first EV from this year to next, and extended its gas-engine phase-out deadline to 2035. Lamborghini has delayed its Lanzador EV until 2029 at the earliest.

Wait a few months and you might well be able to pick up a G580 for considerably less than its $162,000 list price. You can currently bag a three-year-old Porsche Taycan, with its 416 miles of range, for less than half what it cost new. Currently, there are 930 used Taycans for sale in the US on Auto Trader, with prices ranging from just $44,000 when a base model costs at least $100,000 new. A Taycan with just 11,000 miles on the clock can be had for $47,000.

US and European car makers‚Äîlegacy and startups‚Äîmay wish there was high demand for premium-priced prestige EVs (Jaguar is staking its future business on this), but for some years now the market has been crying out, instead, for cheaper, entry-level models. The favored method by the modern auto industry of filling flagships with their best wares then letting these slowly trickle down to lower-tier cars is not realistic right now, says Dale Harrow, chair and director of the Intelligent Mobility Design Center at London's Royal College of Art.

‚ÄúThe same tech is basically in all electric vehicles,‚Äù says Harrow. ‚ÄúSo, for the first time, there's no real guarantee that spending a lot more money is going to buy a better product. Look at the vehicles coming in from BYD.‚Äù

Instead, Harrow feels automakers must wean themselves off flagship-first dependancy, ape Ford's classic Model T strategy, and concentrate on building EVs accessible to the masses through a combination of affordability, simplicity, and mass production. And guess who has already worked this out? Yep, China‚Äîwhere nearly 40 percent of all electric models are priced under $25,000.

It is this strategy, rather than gimmicky tank-turns, that will drive real adoption and encourage the spread of viable charging networks. After all, it was the ubiquity of the Model T that played a pivotal role in the development of gas stations‚Äîand there's absolutely no reason why that same trick can't be turned for the electric age.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Google Wants to Get Better at Spotting Wildfires From Space","https://www.wired.com/story/google-earth-fire-alliance-spotting-wildfires-from-space/","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Google wants to launch a battalion of satellites into orbit around the Earth to monitor fires on the ground in real time, then collect all that photographic data and use AI to better identify fires in their critical early stages.

FireSat is a partnership between Google, the nonprofit Earth Fire Alliance, and the satellite builder Muon Space. The collaborative effort was announced in 2024 with the goal of launching satellites specifically designed to spot wildfires. The first satellite of the proposed 50-plus strong constellation launched in March 2025.

The group hopes to get the full constellation up there by 2029. Then, the satellites will be able to orbit the Earth, snapping images of every fire-prone place on the globe. The photos would be captured about 20 minutes apart, enough to catch a small fire before it grows too big, or to observe the progress of an active blaze.The information about a fire's location could then be beamed to data analysts and machine intelligence systems on the ground more quickly than ever.

‚ÄúWe want to make sure that we can learn fast to be able to detect and track fires,‚Äù Brian Collins, the executive director of the Earth Fire Alliance, says. ‚ÄúWe want to transform the way the world and the United States looks at fire.‚Äù

This group's effort isn't the only mission to put fire-tracking satellites into orbit right now. The Canadian WildfireSat program is a government-funded effort to launch its own fire-specific satellites dedicated to monitoring blazes across the country. In the 2025 fire season so far, nearly 9 million acres have already burned in the fires active in Canada. But the launch of Canada's fire satellites is still a ways off, slated for launch in 2029. Google wants to get into space more quickly‚Äîand use its AI chops to speed up the process of figuring out when fires start.

Satellites already in orbit have been snapping pics of wildfires for years. Google has incorporated data collected by NOAA weather satellites to show wildfire boundaries and evacuation zones in Maps. But detecting fires from space‚Äîespecially small ones or fires that are just starting‚Äîcan be tricky. Satellites currently in orbit tend to detect heat with microbolometer sensors, thermal imaging chips that, unlike other thermal cameras, don't require cooling. The problem with that, says Christopher Van Arsdale, a researcher at Google, is that microbolometer images can have a narrow field of view and come back with grainier, lower-resolution images. That can make detecting fires in their earlier stages hard, because lots of heat signatures on the ground‚Äîhot roofs or even light reflected off water surfaces‚Äîcan look very similar to wildfires to a thermal camera.

‚ÄúIf you look at a noisy picture, everything kind of looks like a tiny fire,‚Äù Van Arsdale says. ‚ÄúSo you have to really know what you're looking at for that to be useful. You need these very high-fidelity pictures in order to actually do a good job with detection.‚Äù

Google and Muon's fire satellites are outfitted with image-capture equipment that works to solve this problem. They will take photos of the same spot using two different types of cameras‚Äîone more standard camera that covers visible and short wave infrared and one cryo-cooled thermal camera that takes shots in higher resolution than a traditional microbolometer. Then those images are sent to data centers where Google's computer vision and machine intelligence prowess comes into play.

‚ÄúThe whole job of the constellation after it collects the data is really to funnel it to a data center where we can take the imagery and analyze it to understand if what we're looking at is likely a fire or a false positive,‚Äù Van Arsdale says. ‚ÄúFundamentally, the main problem with all of these systems for early detection is separating out false positives.‚Äù

By cross-referencing the different photo types and collecting millions of pixels of imagery over time, Google is hoping its AI system will be able to reliably see the forest fire for the trees. The platform can leverage all the imagery from the satellites, collate the different image types, then analyze and compare that information to historical data to look for trends that typically signal the beginnings of a fire.

A SpaceX rocket blasts the first of the FireSat missions into space.

There is one FireSat satellite in orbit currently circling the globe. It captures images and tests what it will take to reliably snap pics of the planet in short enough intervals to track the movements of a wildfire. Google says it plans to show off images captured by the satellite sometime this summer.

The FireSat operation plans to launch three more satellites in early 2026, and eventually work up to its final number of 52 satellites over the course of the next few years. At full capacity, the satellites should be able to detect a fire as small as ten square meters and then collect updates on the spread every 20 minutes or so. The goal is that the window between updates is short enough to give them the types of information first responders can actually put to good use.

‚ÄúWith fire in particular, times are compressed so much that you have to apply technology to make a decision within the timeframe that you can impact the outcome of what's happening,‚Äù Collins says.

Krystal Azelton, a senior director at the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for sustainable space policies, says that while satellites and AI tech may provide better data, it's crucial that the data makes it into the right hands.

‚ÄúThe trend towards AI to assist with all of this is obviously going to produce better results, but it's not going to produce consistent results necessarily.‚Äù Azelton says. ‚ÄúThis is a really big positive because one of my biggest concerns about any kind of environmental monitoring from space is whoever's providing the data, how do you get the data into the end user?‚Äù Azelton says. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of tech solutions out there, but how do you get them into the hands of people actually using it?

Van Arsdale says the goal of the FireSat team is to make its tracking data as accessible as possible, and it's committed to working directly with firefighting agencies to do so.

‚ÄúThere's this sort of fog of war associated with fires, where you don't know where they are when they start,‚Äù Van Arsdale says about trying to pitch the idea of this vast swath of data collection to firefighting officials. ‚ÄúWe're just going to give you a picture of everything that's going on that you could possibly care about.‚Äù

While more information is usually better in disaster situations, it isn't clear if this kind of satellite detection will be all that much faster than what currently exists. Camera networks like those deployed by AlertWildfire have been the first to spot fires all across the West Coast, including the deadly Palisades Fire in Los Angeles this past January. There's also the fact that while FireSat cameras may be able to pick up a fire the moment it starts, just having that information doesn't mean firefighters will be able to mobilize and get to the blaze in time.

Daniel Swain, a climate scientist who runs the blog Weather West and has long tracked wildfires, says that while satellite-enabled updates may not solve all the realities of response time, it would be useful for sharing information with people in immediate danger and keeping people informed as the fire spreads.

‚ÄúIt doesn't really solve the core underlying problems, but it's probably a beneficial thing to do,‚Äù Swain says. ‚ÄúIt does help to know exactly where a fire is as soon as possible. It unfortunately doesn't give us much of an edge under the most extreme conditions.‚Äù

These FireSat efforts also come at a time of increased investment in the tech aimed at fighting wildfires. Namely, an uptick in private companies hoping to help build new firefighting solutions‚Äîand profit off that tech. In June, President Trump signed an executive order for a ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù approach to fighting wildfires, which called for prioritizing the efforts of fire tech companies while also combining federal disaster agencies and instructing federal agencies to ‚Äúdeclassify historical satellite data to improve wildfire prediction and revise or eliminate rules that impede wildfire detection, prevention, and response.‚Äù

That focus, along with the sweeping cuts to federal disaster programs like FEMA and the US Forest Service means that with fewer public resources to tackle the problem, private industry is moving to close those gaps.

Swain cautions that while lots of this tech might be helpful, relying on private companies to solve widespread societal problems like disaster response comes with problems.

‚ÄúEven if you assume the best possible motive,‚Äù Swain says. ‚ÄúThat this is truly in the public interest and that private companies are able to effectuate that, there's then the question of, OK, are we actually going to have access to this data in the long run, or is this going to be the equivalent of a 30-day free trial?‚Äù

He points out that internet-of-things companies have gone out of business and left customers with products that no longer work, and that Google itself has a long history of killing off services.

‚ÄúIt's the classic tech industry challenge of continuity,‚Äù Swain says. ‚ÄúWe've seen this happen.‚Äù

Azelton believes there will always be a need for ‚Äúa baseline of government, truly and fully public data that's out there, that's accessible to anybody and everybody that can and should be supplemented by commercial data and partnerships like this, and that they need to be designed in a way that they can be in the hands of everyone who needs them.‚Äù

It's a feat that Google seems keen on facilitating, even if it isn't immediately profitable for the company. It's also easy to see this as a sort of mea culpa for Google, a company that has made a number of climate commitments, despite the fact that, like all purveyors of generative AI technology, it consumes lots and lots of energy. (In 2024, Google's emissions bumped up by 50 percent because of its generative AI efforts.) Humanity's ever increasing consumption of energy has worsened climate change, which has in turn played a part in worsening wildfires.

‚ÄúIf Google admits, you know, what we do harms the planet, but we're trying to find ways of stewarding as well, and these are the ways in which we're trying to be regenerative and restorative,‚Äú says Moriba K. Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. ‚ÄúAt least having a more honest conversation about it I think would be refreshing.‚Äù

In late May, Google highlighted the FireSat program very briefly at the end of its I/O developer conference. It was a real tonal shift, a blink-and-you-miss-it moment of environmental angst and self-congratulation after a two-hour deluge of breathless AI-fueled futurism. Maybe launching enough satellites to keep track of all the damage is an effort to atone for the vast energy AI uses. Maybe it will even work.

Update, June 24 at 1 pm: A previous version of this story inaccurately reported the duration between each satellite imagery capture. The shots are taken about 20 minutes apart.

Earlier this year, Eric Antonow was in a coffee shop with his family when he felt the familiar, twitchy urge to reach for his phone. He patted his pockets for relief‚Äîthe cool, thin slab was still there. He joked to his family that, like an addict jonesing for a hit, he would one day need a medical-grade solution to detox from his phone. Opioid addicts had methadone. iPhone addicts would need ‚Ä¶ methaphones.

‚ÄúIt was a joke, but I got two laughs from my two teenagers, which is gold,‚Äù Antonow says. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòI'm going to commit to the bit.'‚Äù

Antonow, a former marketing executive at Google and Facebook, has been committing to bits for half a decade, making what he calls ‚Äúmindless toys.‚Äù His online shop features projects like a ‚Äúlistening switch‚Äù to indicate when one is paying attention, and a vinyl for silent meditation, with 20 minutes of recorded silence on each side (record player not required).

So within days of his latest joke, he had enlisted ChatGPT to mock up an image of a gadget in the shape of a phone, without all of the contents: a translucent rectangle that one could look at, or through. From that original generative sketch emerged a more realized design: a 6-inch slab of clear acrylic with rounded corners, like the iPhone, and green edges that resembled glass. Antonow placed an order for samples, and started an Indiegogo campaign for the Methaphone: to ‚Äúleave your phone without the cravings or withdrawal.‚Äù

The first Methaphones were sold for $25 through a crowdfunding campaign.

The dilemma of the smartphone is that we all want to use our phones less, but few of us actually do. Apple and Google offered a few life preservers in 2018, in the form of self-regulation tools like screen time limits, but most of that went out the window during the pandemic years when screens became a window into the outside world. Now, a person hoping to reclaim their attention is trapped between two unappealing choices: downgrade to a minimalist ‚Äúdumb phone,‚Äù or surrender to the dopamine drip-feed of infinite content. Either way, the phone wins.

In response, a cottage industry has emerged to offer detachment tools. There are apps with symbolic names, like Freedom and Focus, that block distracting content. Startups like Brick and Unpluq offer physical NFC ‚Äúkeys‚Äù to lock and unlock addictive apps. (Unpluq's cofounder, Jorn Rigter, says people use the device equally to block social apps, like Instagram, and work apps, like Slack, which have become just as sticky.) There's Yondr, a lockable pouch to prevent phone use in courtrooms and concert halls. And there's a growing lineup of ‚Äúdumb phones,‚Äù some at premium, postmodern prices.

You can buy stickers that look like app icons.

Unlike those solutions, the Methaphone doesn't do much of anything. It's more of a statement: ceci n'est pas un phone. But in a culture of technological excess, the project has resonated widely, like Ozempic in an epidemic of screen obesity.

In May, when the first batch of Methaphones arrived, Antonow sent them to a dozen friends to get their reactions. One recipient was Catherine Goetze, who quickly posted a video about the Methaphone to her 400,000 followers on TikTok. In the video, Goetze is standing in line at a San Francisco boba shop, hunched over just like everyone else‚Äîbut instead of scrolling her phone, she's scrolling ‚Ä¶ a slab of clear acrylic. Commenters went wild with speculation. Was it a Nokia prototype? A Black Mirror trailer? Within five days, the video had more than 53 million views.

After Goetze's video, Antonow says the Methaphone ‚Äúmassively sold out.‚Äù (He had initially ordered a run of 100 units, sold as a limited release, for $25.) While he plans to restock, he says the future of the Methaphone is less about individual purchases than larger-scale experiments‚Äîsay, a restaurant that offers a Methaphone on the menu so that people can dine without distractions. Phones are more than just portals to other people, they're portals to another dimension. ‚ÄúSo the counterbalance also needs to be more important than just, ‚ÄòOh, I need to remember not to use my phone at the table,'‚Äù he says.

Anna Lembke, an addiction researcher at the Stanford's School of Medicine and the author of Dopamine Nation, agrees. ‚ÄúOur phones have really become like pacifiers,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe keep them close to our bodies, we touch them countless times a day.‚Äù A tool like the Methaphone, she suggests, could help short-circuit the habit loop: You still go through the motions, but without the payoff. She compares it to a smoker using a zero-nicotine vape: ‚ÄúThe ritual remains, but the hit is gone.‚Äù (She adds that this is not, in fact, how methadone works.)

Antonow isn't the first to parody phone addiction. The NoPhone, launched in 2014, is a plastic brick that bills itself as ‚Äúa fake phone for people addicted to real phones.‚Äù It now comes in three flavors: Original (no screen, no battery, no charger, $20), Selfie (with a mirror, $23), and Air (an empty bag, yours for $9).

Antonow has recently taken his own design further: He now sells the Methaphone with an optional sticker pack featuring ‚Äúanalog apps,‚Äù like Walk, Read, See Friends, and Daydream. Each one turns the blank screen into a low-tech reminder that life exists outside the rectangle.

Antonow sent me a Methaphone of my own. It arrived in a paper sleeve along with illustrations for use: to doomscroll in bed, to avert boredom while drinking alone, even floating in a pool. (Naturally, it's waterproof.) Antonow encouraged me to treat it like a set of rosary beads‚Äîsomething to touch instead of my phone, whenever the impulse struck.

One morning, I brought it with me to a coffee shop. When I felt the familiar itch to pull out my phone, I reached for the Methaphone instead. I let my thumb graze its surface mindlessly and waited for someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîto ask what I was doing. No one did. Everyone else was glued to their own screens, too deep in their digital loops to pay me any attention. I looked through the clear screen of the Methaphone and surveyed the world I had long been ignoring. Then I slipped it back into my pocket for good.

The best electrolyte powders can vary from person to person and situation to situation. If you're running a marathon in a hot, humid climate, you might want to reach for an electrolyte drink mix with a higher sodium content than, say, a severely dehydrated hungover person just trying to get their headache to go away (in which case, a lower sodium content will be fine). We spoke with experts and tasted powders galore to narrow down your hydration options, like our top pick, Liquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier ($23).

Overall, you want to find something with a good balance of electrolytes, sugar, and carbohydrates. And make sure you're drinking water on a daily basis‚Äîno magic powder is going to help if you're just plain thirsty.

Be sure to check out our related buying guides! We've got recommendations for the Best Protein Powders, Best Greens Powders, and Best Fitness Trackers.

Liquid I.V.

Amazon (Regular, 16 Servings)

Amazon (Sugar-Free, 14 Servings)

Amazon (Immune Support, 14 Servings)

Amazon (Kids, 16 Servings)

Liquid I.V. has been a staple in my household for years. I love using it at music festivals‚Äîit helps my ragged throat feel better, my dry nostrils feel better, and my pounding head feel better. And when I inevitably run out of ice on day three, it helps my water taste better, too. I have yet to try a flavor that I actively disliked. They're sweet but not too sweet, and the packets are easy to open. This powder has a solid mix of ingredients in concentrations that aren't too high, making it a reliable option to reach for in day-to-day life.

Skratch Labs

Amazon (20 Servings)

Sktratch Labs (20 Servings)

This hydration mix may as well be candy. But it's delicious in a very juicy way. It's way higher both calorie-, carb-, and sugar-wise than other hydration powders on this list. But it doesn't bother my stomach despite those higher ingredient concentrations, and it's easy to drink a lot of, whereas some other powders are a bit of a slog once you get the first few gulps down. It's high in carbohydrates, which translated to a boost in energy while working out that I noticed after just a few minutes, and it's also a bit higher in sugar content than some others I tried. This is a good powder for athletes that are quickly running through their body's stores.

SaltStick

Amazon (60 Servings)

If you need electrolytes fast or you simply don't want to guzzle down a bottle of water, these electrolyte tablets are what you're looking for. SaltStick electrolyte chews taste really good. They're sweet, salty, and candylike, immediately making you produce a bunch of saliva. (Which is good, since the company recommends letting the chews melt in your mouth for optimal electrolyte absorption.) They're available in large pill bottles as well as small five-serving packets, making them ideal for when you truly need electrolytes on the go. The balanced sodium and carbohydrate content makes these a good option for when you're working out intensely and need to re-up your electrolytes every 30 minutes.

Electrolit

Amazon (8 Servings)

Electrolit has nursed me through many a hangover, and I like every flavor I've tried. I wish it didn't have artificial coloring, but otherwise it's great (and editor Kat Merck agrees with that sentiment, having tried it as well). The packets are on the larger side, and a $12 box has only eight of them. But darn if I don't like it anyway. It does have a balanced mix of sodium, carbohydrates, and sugars, making it a good option for rehydration outside of intensive exercise. I find that the pleasant flavor and higher sodium and carb content help my hangovers go away quickly in comparison to just drinking plain water (or something with higher sodium content, which can taste a bit abrasive when my head is spinning).

Celsius

Amazon (14 Servings)

Walmart (14 Servings)

Celsius is known for its (frankly delicious) energy drinks, but the manufacturer makes caffeine-free hydration packets too. The packets were frustrating to open sometimes, but upon mixing with 16.9 ounces of water, they're tasty. This formula is distinctly saltier than others I tried. It's sugar-free, and I appreciate the low price. It does contain artificial sweeteners, and it's on the lower end of the sodium and carbohydrate scale. It'll give your water a little bit of a boost, but if you want to really replenish lost electrolytes, something else might be a better option.

Bodyarmor

Amazon (15 Servings)

Bodyarmor has a few different caffeinated flavors, with 95 milligrams of caffeine per serving. There are caffeine-free options, too. The resulting color is basically neon, and the flavors are concentrated enough that I found them most palatable when mixed with nearly 30 ounces of water. They're also quite salty‚Äîthis powder made me thirsty long after it was gone, which could be a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it. I don't love the mix of ingredients‚Äîit has a high sodium and potassium content, but it's very low in carbohydrates, so pair this drink with a snack if you can.

Thorne

Amazon (30 Servings)

Thorne (30 Servings)

Thorne Daily Electrolytes are darn easy to drink. They're super sweet, thanks to the inclusion of stevia, but the flavors are pleasant and dissipate quickly. My favorite was the watermelon flavor, which I could happily guzzle all day long. I found the sweetness to be refreshing rather than overly sticky, and the colors were pleasant too. The manufacturer recommends using at least 12 ounces of water per stick, but it tasted the best to me if I dissolved it in around 18 to 20 ounces. I also liked that the calories were negligible‚ÄîI don't have to worry about meeting my deficit as much as I do with some other packets.

Shaklee

Shaklee (20 Servings)

I quite liked the light blood-orange flavor I tested of these caffeine-free electrolyte packets, as well as the fact there are no artificial colors or off-tasting chemical notes. (There's also a raspberry melon flavor, but I can't vouch for that one.) They're 20 calories each, sweetened with cane sugar, and have added potassium nitrate and beet powder for cognitive function. The science is actually decent on this, but subjectively, the jury is still out. I drank a packet while writing this and some other guide updates, and while I did feel sufficiently hydrated, I don't think I'll be winning a Pulitzer anytime soon. One packet is enough for 8 ounces of water, though more often than not I used 16 ounces and could still taste enough of the flavor. In fact, the only thing I don't like about these is that Shaklee is an multilevel marketer. One of the oldest, in fact‚Äîaround since the 1950s. If that doesn't bother you, you can buy directly online without a rep, and your purchase is FSA and HSA eligible. ‚ÄîKat Merck

DryWater

DryWater (15 Servings)

My favorite part about DryWater's electrolyte powders is how nuanced the flavors are. They're not overly sweet or flavorful‚Äîthey're still a bit sweet, but they taste more like enhanced water and less like an entirely different beverage altogether. They're quite fruity, but in a ‚Äúreal fruit‚Äù way‚Äîprobably because they're made with real fruit. If you want assisted hydration without the zip and tang of typical sports beverages, this is what you're looking for. It doesn't have a remarkable carbohydrate or sugar content, but there are added vitamins and minerals that make this fine to drink on a daily basis if you just want a bit of a hydration boost when you're not exercising intensely.

Klar

Klar (28 Servings)

Sure, Klar's got electrolytes, adaptogens, and additives like B-vitamins and ginseng, but this is a powdered energy drink, plain and simple. One packet mixes with 16 ounces of water and contains 150 mg of caffeine‚Äî more than the average cup of coffee and more than twice Bodyarmor's packet‚Äîand you will definitely feel it. The taste won't win any awards, as it's sweetened with stevia, and that's definitely the predominant flavor of all the varieties (blood orange, cactus pear, pineapple ginger, ‚Äútidal wave‚Äù), but if you're used to energy drinks, this is a cheaper, more multifaceted way to get your fix at just under $2 per packet. ‚ÄîKat Merck

Electrolyte Powders 101: What to Look For and How to Choose

TL;DR Don't choose something with ultra-high amounts of sodium, carbohydrates, or sugar unless you need to based on your exercise levels or a sweat test.

Amy Brownstein, a registered dietitian nutritionist at MyNetDiary, says electrolytes are minerals that exist naturally in your body. These include magnesium, calcium, chloride, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous. Electrolyte powders usually contain these, as well as sugars and carbohydrates which can help a little bit with the absorption of the electrolytes.

Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist, says humans usually lose sodium when working out or spending time in hot temperatures and also that carbohydrates are important to help replenish and preserve muscle glycogen stores to prevent fatigue, especially if you'll be active for more than 30 minutes. Basically, if you're working out a lot and not replenishing lost carbs, you'll feel fatigued much faster‚Äîand that's especially true for intense workouts or long sporting events, in which case she recommends re-upping carbohydrates every 30 to 45 minutes. Sugars like glucose serve similar purposes, helping to replenish muscle glycogen as well.

If you're just looking for supplements for day to day life or to soothe your hungover brain, you don't need as much sodium or carbohydrates. Brownstein says to choose a powder within the context of your daily habits and diet; Most people already consume the recommended 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, so if you're not depleting sodium stores with intense exercise, you probably don't need a powder with a high sodium content. The same can be said for sugar.

Ultimately, the best way to figure out exactly what you need is by getting a sweat test done to analyze the contents of your sweat. But short of doing that, your best bet is to choose a powder that lives somewhere in the middle of ingredient concentration‚Äîunless you're sweating a ton, working out in high heat, or training in high altitudes. Brownstein adds that if you notice white, chalky residue on your skin or clothes after working out, you might need to up your sodium intake.

When it comes to synthetic dyes, Balls says that it comes down mostly to personal choice. Luckily, if you want to avoid these ingredients, many of our recommendations omit them.

To avoid stomach upset, Balls mentions that you might want to look for powders that are lower in magnesium (which can have a laxative effect in high amounts). She also mentions that calcium and iron can interfere with the absorption of one another, so choose a powder that has balanced, lower amounts of those two supplements. Brownstein mentions that high sugar and sodium content can upset some peoples' stomachs, too, and that you should read the labels to make sure you're not over-supplementing (or over-caffeinating). If something contains 100 percent of your daily recommended zinc content, for example, you want to make sure you're not also taking a multivitamin with the same amount of zinc.

Per Heather Gosnell, a pediatrician, sodium is the key ingredient for effective rehydration. She also says a little sugar and carbohydrates help your body absorb water but to avoid high-sugar drinks.

Balls says to look for a powder that includes the key electrolytes lost: sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. She says, if possible, to avoid drinks with artificial sweeteners.

Hallie Zwibel, director of the Center for Sports Medicine at New York Institute of Technology, adds that ‚Äúin addition to causing upset stomach and reduced fluid absorption, repeatedly consuming high sugar foods and beverages can lead to diabetes, as well as potential weight gain.‚Äù He also said, ‚ÄúWhile electrolyte packets can help replenish essential minerals lost through sweat, they should not replace daily water intake.‚Äù

Is It Better to Just Drink Plain Water?

Brownstein says that checking the color of your urine is a solid indicator of how hydrated you are. (Very light to pale yellow is normal; amber to dark yellow is potentially dehydrated; completely colorless is potentially over-hydrated.)

Gosnell says for most people, water and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables provide all the hydration and electrolytes you need. She adds, ‚ÄúElectrolyte drinks are helpful after intense exercise or heat exposure but avoid high-sugar options. For everyday hydration, simple water and healthy foods are best.‚Äù

Balls adds that if you're sweating a lot or are physically active for more than 30 minutes, plain water won't be as beneficial to promote optimal hydration status. She also reminds us that a balanced diet can help with lost electrolytes‚Äîas can drinking dairy or soy milk, or just using plain old table salt to replenish lost sodium.

And to keep things simple, Heather Jaeger, head of nutrition at MyFitnessPal, says she recommends the ‚Äú3H‚Äù method to know when to reach for a hydration powder: ""If you're active for an hour or more, exercising in hot conditions, or working hard enough to sweat, that's when electrolytes can really support rehydration and recovery.‚Äù

Are Electrolyte Powders Safe for Everybody?

You should always talk with your doctor before changing your diet or taking a new supplement.

Gosnell says that hydration solutions and powders are safe for most healthy adults when used as directed, but for children and those with medical conditions, consult a doctor first. She adds, ‚ÄúIf you have health concerns or severe dehydration, seek medical advice before using electrolyte drinks.‚Äù Brownstein adds that, over time, unnecessarily high sodium concentrations can contribute to high blood pressure and can potentially contribute to other problems, so avoid ultra-high sodium concentrations unless you're exercising intensively.

How We Tested and What's Up Next

I drank each powder, dissolved in water following the packaging instructions. I tested these powders over the course of a few weeks in my day-to-day life, including while working out and while hungover. I looked for adequate nutrition (per my conversations with dietitians), convenient packaging, and good taste.

We're testing hydration and electrolyte powders from Only Hydration, LMNT, Gatorade, DripDrop, and Nuun Sport.

Human sexuality is on a spectrum, and when it comes to fulfilling sexual desires of all kinds, there should be a sex toy for everyone. That's the best part about sex tech‚Äîthere's always something interesting popping up on the market. Groove Thing is the latest, launching as a Kickstarter today, and the company markets it as the ‚Äúworld's first internal music player.‚Äù

It blends high-fidelity audio of your favorite songs with internal vibrations. As a sex toy reviewer and former college radio DJ, I was immediately game. The company sent me a prototype version to test ahead of the Kickstarter launch‚Äîthis isn't a full review because it's a preproduction unit, and WIRED doesn't like to make definitive statements on crowd-funded products until the company starts shipping to customers. Groove Thing is a new company, and like all Kickstarter launches, there's a risk it can't deliver. That said, this internal music player is in a class of its own.

Groove Thing

Groove Thing

When I opened the package, I immediately understood why Groove Thing's PR team kept calling it the ‚ÄúUgly Box,‚Äù because the hardware was ugly, crude, and unrefined. Sex tech has come such a long way, and people expect their toys, whether they're vibrators, dildo, or butt plugs, to be aesthetically pleasing. But this is a prototype, so I'll give it a pass. The company assures me the final version will look better and slightly different from what I received.

There's the main speaker with a dial on the side, as well as a round puck and two small speakers on top. There are also two internal attachments: one for vaginal use and the other for anal use. These attachments adhere to the puck and are then inserted into the body. Neither of these internal pieces was made of body-safe plastic (the final product will be), so Groove Thing included a big bag of condoms and lube packets so I could safely test the system. I didn't care for the shape of the butt plug, so I stuck to the G-spot stimulator. From the looks of the bulbous head, I knew it was the best fit for me, in comfort and stimulation.

Per the instructions, I plugged the Groove Thing into the wall (yes, you need to be decently close to an outlet), paired it to my phone via Bluetooth, and inserted the condom-wrapped G-spot vibrator into me. The attachment connects to the speaker, too, which means fussing with a cable.

As the instructions suggested, I tried the introductory playlist. With Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, and Dua Lipa, I knew it wouldn't do much for me. But what I discovered during that brief foray into commercial pop was that music with bass was essential to really experiencing what the creators of the Groove Thing had intended.

As the instructions for the Groove Thing emphasize over and over, this isn't a device designed to get you off or even necessarily give you an orgasm. Instead, the focus is on listening to your favorite songs while enjoying the ride or, more specifically, the sensations from feeling the bass and percussion of that music inside you. For me, those songs came from post-rock bands like Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. However, as much as I can listen to those bands on repeat for hours, I can't say that feeling the bass inside me was particularly enjoyable.

While I did explore a handful of songs and experimented with different volumes to feel varying intensities inside me, done via the dial on the Groove Thing, it didn't take long for me to lose interest. You just lay there while the vaginal (or anal) attachment bounces against your G-spot (or P-spot) to the beat of whatever song is on. The motor is also quite noisy, which I found distracting. This could be ironed out with the finished product.

While it's not something for me, I can see how this type of sex toy, which emphasizes musical pleasure, could be enticing for others. I have a mildly unhealthy obsession with music, but there's a difference between that and wanting to feel your favorite song in your vagina or butt. I've never considered it, and now that I've experienced it, I don't care much for it. It doesn't help that the final MSRP is expected to be $275. That's a lot of dough for a product that doesn't even get you off.

If music and sex are intimately intertwined for you, the Groove Thing might pique your interest. But let's make one thing clear‚Äîthis is hardly the first internal music player. Plenty of others exist, like Ohmibod's Freestyle G music vibrator, Lovehoney's Juno Music-Activated Vibrating Butt Plug, or the Lovense Vulse. Groove Thing will say its vibrations are more dynamic, and maybe that's true, but not enough for me to keep the tunes going.

Federal judge William Alsup ruled that it was legal for Anthropic to train its AI models on published books without the authors' permission. This marks the first time that the courts have given credence to AI companies' claim that fair use doctrine can absolve AI companies from fault when they use copyrighted materials to train large language models (LLMs).

This decision comes as a blow to authors, artists, and publishers who have brought dozens of lawsuits against companies like OpenAI, Meta, Midjourney, Google, and more. While the ruling is not a guarantee that other judges will follow Judge Alsup's lead, it lays the foundation for courts to side with tech companies over creatives.

These lawsuits often depend on how a judge interprets fair use doctrine, a notoriously finicky carve-out of copyright law that hasn't been updated since 1976 ‚Äî a time before the internet, let alone the concept of generative AI training sets.

Fair use rulings take into account what the work is being used for (parody and education can be viable), whether it's being reproduced for commercial gain (you can write ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù fan fiction, but you can't sell it), and how transformative a derivative work is from the original.

Companies like Meta have made similar fair use arguments in defense of training on copyrighted works, though before this week's decision, it was less clear how the courts would sway.

In this particular case, Bartz v. Anthropic, the group of plaintiff authors also brought into question the manner in which Anthropic attained and stored their works. According to the lawsuit, Anthropic sought to create a ‚Äúcentral library‚Äù of ‚Äúall the books in the world‚Äù to keep ‚Äúforever.‚Äù But millions of these copyrighted books were downloaded for free from pirate sites, which is unambiguously illegal.

While the judge granted that Anthropic's training of these materials was a fair use, the court will hold a trial about the nature of the ‚Äúcentral library.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will have a trial on the pirated copies used to create Anthropic's central library and the resulting damages,‚Äù Judge Alsup wrote in the decision. ‚ÄúThat Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages.‚Äù

Google DeepMind on Tuesday released a new language model called Gemini Robotics On-Device that can run tasks locally on robots without requiring an internet connection. 

Building on the company's previous Gemini Robotics model that was released in March, Gemini Robotics On-Device can control a robot's movements. Developers can control and fine-tune the model to suit various needs using natural language prompts.

In benchmarks, Google claims the model performs at a level close to the cloud-based Gemini Robotics model. The company says it outperforms other on-device models in general benchmarks, though it didn't name those models.

In a demo, the company showed robots running this local model doing things like unzipping bags and folding clothes. Google says that while the model was trained for ALOHA robots, it later adapted it to work on a bi-arm Franka FR3 robot and the Apollo humanoid robot by Apptronik.

Google claims the bi-arm Franka FR3 was successful in tackling scenarios and objects it hadn't ‚Äúseen‚Äù before, like doing assembly on an industrial belt.

Google DeepMind is also releasing a Gemini Robotics SDK. The company said developers can show robots 50 to 100 demonstrations of tasks to train them on new tasks using these models on the MuJoCo physics simulator. 

Other AI model developers are also dipping their toes in robotics. Nvidia is building a platform to create foundation models for humanoids; Hugging Face is not only developing open models and datasets for robotics, it is actually working on robots too; and Mirae Asset-backed Korean startup RLWRLD is working on creating foundational models for robots.

Amazon announced on Tuesday that it is expanding its Same-Day and Next-Day delivery services to over 4,000 small cities and towns across rural U.S. This expansion will bring its fast Prime delivery service to millions of customers in places such as Asbury, Iowa; Fort Seneca, Ohio; Lewes, Delaware; North Padre Island, Texas; and Sharptown, Maryland.

The e-commerce giant plans to invest more than $4 billion to triple the size of its delivery network by 2026. Amazon has recognized a growing demand for faster delivery from rural customers, who often have limited options when shopping online.

By increasing its investment in Same-Day and Next-Day delivery, the company aims to create more jobs in rural communities, with an estimated 170 positions at delivery stations, along with additional driving opportunities.

Amazon also reported that the number of items delivered the same day or the next day in the U.S. has increased by over 30% compared to the same period last year. In 2024 alone, the company delivered more than 9 billion items using the faster delivery services.

This announcement comes as Amazon prepares for its Prime Day event, which will last 96 hours from July 8 to July 11.

Waymo robotaxis can now be hailed in Atlanta via Uber. The two companies, which already offer the ‚ÄúWaymo on Uber‚Äù service in Austin, said on Tuesday the commercial service will initially cover about 65 square miles in Atlanta.

The launch, if successful, is poised to propel the businesses of both companies. Uber, which has locked in partnerships with 18 autonomous vehicles companies, said it has an annual run-rate of 1.5 million mobility and delivery AV trips on its network. Meanwhile, Waymo said it provides 250,000 paid robotaxi rides every week across Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco.

The addition of Atlanta to that list should push those numbers up.

Waymo's fleet in Atlanta is in the ‚Äúdozens‚Äù and will eventually be expanded over time, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. The companies have previously said the fleet shared between Atlanta and Austin will grow to the hundreds.

The ‚ÄúWaymo on Uber‚Äù service is a hybrid of sorts where robotaxis and human-driven vehicles intermingle. Uber users can set their preferences in the app to increase the chances of being matched with a Waymo. 

That structure differs from the other markets where Waymo operates. In those cities, riders use the Waymo One app to hail robotaxis.

When an Uber user is notified they've been matched with a Waymo, they can choose to accept or switch to a human-driven ride. Once the robotaxi arrives, riders will use the Uber app to unlock the vehicle, open the trunk, and start the trip.

Robotaxi rides will cost the same as an UberX, Uber Comfort, or Uber Comfort Electric driven by a human, the companies said.

The ‚ÄúWaymo on Uber‚Äù service splits the responsibilities of owning and operating a fleet of driverless vehicles. Uber handles the charging, maintenance and cleaning of the autonomous vehicles, as well as managing access to the robotaxis via its app. Meanwhile, Waymo monitors the tech and the autonomous operations, including roadside assistance and certain aspects of rider support.

Last September, Uber and Waymo announced plans to offer a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025 as part of an expanded partnership. In March, the companies started offering the ‚ÄúWaymo on Uber‚Äù robotaxi service in Austin. Waymo has more than 100 robotaxis in its commercial fleet in Austin, according to the company.

When Eventual founders Sammy Sidhu and Jay Chia were working as software engineers at Lyft's autonomous vehicle program, they witnessed a brewing data infrastructure problem ‚Äî and one that would only become larger with the rise of AI.

Self-driving cars produce a ton of unstructured data from 3D scans and photos to text and audio. There wasn't a tool for Lyft engineers that could understand and process all of those different types of data at the same time ‚Äî and all in one place. This left engineers to piece together open source tools in a lengthy process with reliability issues.

‚ÄúWe had all these brilliant PhDs, brilliant folks across the industry, working on autonomous vehicles but they're spending like 80% of their time working on infrastructure rather than building their core application,‚Äù Sidhu, who is Eventual's CEO, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. ‚ÄúAnd most of these problems that they were facing were around data infrastructure.‚Äù

Sidhu and Chia helped build an internal multimodal data processing tool for Lyft. When Sidhu set out to apply to other jobs, he found interviewers kept asking him about potentially building the same data solution for their companies, and the idea behind Eventual was born.

Eventual built a Python-native open source data processing engine, known as Daft, that is designed to work quickly across different modals from text to audio and video, and more. Sidhu said the goal is to make Daft as transformational to unstructured data infrastructure as SQL was to tabular datasets in the past.

The company was founded in early 2022, nearly a year before ChatGPT was released, and before many people were aware of this data infrastructure gap. They launched the first open source version of Daft in 2022 and are gearing up to launch an enterprise product in the third quarter.

‚ÄúThe explosion of ChatGPT, what we saw is just a lot of other folks who are then building AI applications with different types of modalities,‚Äù Sidhu said. ‚ÄúThen everyone started kind of like using things like images and documents and videos in their applications. And that's kind of where we saw, usage just increased dramatically.‚Äù

While the original idea behind building Daft stemmed from the autonomous vehicle space, there are numerous other industries that process multimodal data, including robotics, retail tech, and healthcare. The company now counts Amazon, CloudKitchens and Together AI, among others, as customers.

Eventual recently raised two rounds of funding within eight months. The first was a $7.5 million seed round led by CRV. More recently, the company raised a $20 million Series A round led by Felicis with participation from Microsoft's M12 and Citi.

This latest round will go toward bulking up Eventual's open source offering as well as creating a commercial product that will allow its customers to build AI applications off of this processed data.

Astasia Myers, a general partner at Felicis, told TechCrunch that she found Eventual through a market mapping exercise that involved looking for data infrastructure that would be able to support the growing number of multimodal AI models.

Myers said that Eventual stood out for being a first mover in the space ‚Äî which will likely get more crowded ‚Äî and based on the fact that the founders had dealt with this data processing problem firsthand. She added that Eventual is also solving a growing problem.

The multimodal AI industry is predicted to grow at a 35% compound annual growth rate between 2023 and 2028, according to management consulting firm MarketsandMarkets.

‚ÄúAnnual data generation is up 1,000x over the past 20 years and 90% of the world's data was generated in the past two years, and according to IDC, the vast majority of data is unstructured,‚Äù Myers said. ‚ÄúDaft fits into this huge macro trend of generative AI being built around text, image, video, and voice. You need a multimodal-native data processing engine.‚Äù

Plastic has a recycling problem. Only about 9% of plastic gets recycled, and a majority of that waste comes from single use items like plastic grocery bags. It's partly a design problem ‚Äî they're made to be discarded. But it's also a technology problem because recycling such films isn't easy, and the results usually aren't great.

Novoloop says it has developed a way to take those troublesome plastics and turn them into something other companies actually want to buy. 

The California-based startup recently completed a test run of its demonstration plant that continuously upcycles waste plastic. The plant is capable of cranking out thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) up to 70 metric tons per year that can be used in everything from sneakers to car seats. Demand has been strong enough that the company is preparing plans for a bigger facility.

‚ÄúWe're sold out. Literally every time we make something, we're sold out,‚Äù Miranda Wang, co-founder and CEO of Novoloop, told TechCrunch. 

On the heels of its demo production run, Novoloop has raised a $21 million Series B to finalize the design of its first commercial scale plant and begin construction, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The new round was led by Taranis, an investment fund owned by oil-and-gas company Perenco, with participation from Valo Ventures and Shop Limited.

The company doesn't have a location picked out for its commercial scale plant, but it's looking to build alongside an existing chemical plant that might have extra land and utilities available. The other company might own and operate the facility, with Novoloop supplying the process and marketing know-how.

‚ÄúSometimes it's hard for them to come across growth opportunities,‚Äù Wang said. ‚ÄúThis is a way for them to access that growth opportunity while not having to learn a totally different market that they have to sell things into because we're taking care of marketing and sales and the technology.‚Äù

Novoloop previously raised a $21 million Series A, which helped the company refine its process to the point where running shoe manufacturer On used its upcycled material for the tread of its Cloudprime sneaker.

The startup's upcycled material, which it calls Lifecycled TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), is made by breaking down polyethylene plastic into its basic building blocks, called monomers. From there, it synthesizes new polymers that are more valuable than the initial polyethylene. The resulting material is more expensive than virgin, but ‚Äúwithin range,‚Äù Wang said.

Wang added that Novoloop's experience with TPU has led the company to another business line, mechanically recycling TPU scraps from factory floors and adding ‚Äúperformance enhancers‚Äù to make it perform more like virgin material.

When it came time to build the demonstration plant, Novoloop priced out a facility in the U.S. But it quickly settled on India, where Aether Industries hadn't just built a pilot plant but ‚Äúa plant of pilots,‚Äù Wang said. ‚ÄúThey have a plant of just a whole bunch of pilots.‚Äù

Aether's experience with small-scale chemical manufacturing plants ‚Äî coupled with its ability to reuse equipment from dismantled pilots ‚Äî means that building and operating Novoloop's plant would cost ten times less than simply building the small facility in the U.S.

‚ÄúThat is an environment we don't have here,‚Äù Wang said.

When all you have is a hammer...

Let's say that we have 15k unique tokens (going by modern open models). Let's also say that we have an embedding dimensionality of 1k. This implies that we have a maximum 1k degrees of freedom (or rank) on our output. The model is able to pick any single of the 15k tokens as the top token, but the expressivity of the _probability distribution_ is inherently limited to 1k unique linear components.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Can we fix AI's evaluation crisis?","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1119187/fix-ai-evaluation-crisis/","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 08:50:30 GMT","

Researchers are trying to come up with new, better ways to test AI.

As a tech reporter I often get asked questions like ‚ÄúIs DeepSeek actually better than ChatGPT?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs the Anthropic model any good?‚Äù If I don't feel like turning it into an hour-long seminar, I'll usually give the diplomatic answer: ‚ÄúThey're both solid in different ways.‚Äù

Most people asking aren't defining ‚Äúgood‚Äù in any precise way, and that's fair. It's human to want to make sense of something new and seemingly powerful. But that simple question‚ÄîIs this model good?‚Äîis really just the everyday version of a much more complicated technical problem.

So far, the way we've tried to answer that question is through benchmarks. These give models a fixed set of questions to answer and grade them on how many they get right. But just like exams like the SAT (an admissions test used by many US colleges), these benchmarks don't always reflect deeper abilities. Lately it feels as if a new AI model drops every week, and every time a company launches one, it comes with fresh scores showing it beating the capabilities of predecessors. On paper, everything appears to be getting better all the time.

In practice, it's not so simple. Just as grinding for the SAT might boost your score without improving your critical thinking, models can be trained to optimize for benchmark results without actually getting smarter, as Russell Brandon explained in his piece for us. As OpenAI and Tesla AI veteran Andrej Karpathy recently put it, we're living through an evaluation crisis‚Äîour scoreboard for AI no longer reflects what we really want to measure.Benchmarks have grown stale for a few key reasons. First, the industry has learned to ‚Äúteach to the test,‚Äù training AI models to score well rather than genuinely improve. Second, widespread data contamination means models may have already seen the benchmark questions, or even the answers, somewhere in their training data. And finally, many benchmarks are simply maxed out. On popular tests like SuperGLUE, models have already reached or surpassed 90% accuracy, making further gains feel more like statistical noise than meaningful improvement. At that point, the scores stop telling us anything useful. That's especially true in high-skill domains like coding, reasoning, and complex STEM problem-solving. 

To fix the way we test and measure models, AI is learning tricks from social science.

However, there are a growing number of teams around the world trying to address the AI evaluation crisis. 

One result is a new benchmark called LiveCodeBench Pro. It draws problems from international algorithmic olympiads‚Äîcompetitions for elite high school and university programmers where participants solve challenging problems without external tools. The top AI models currently manage only about 53% at first pass on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on the hardest ones. These are tasks where human experts routinely excel.

Zihan Zheng, a junior at NYU and a world finalist in competitive coding, led the project to develop LiveCodeBench Pro with a team of olympiad medalists. They've published both the benchmark and a detailed study showing that top-tier models like GPT-4o mini and Google's Gemini 2.5 perform at a level comparable to the top 10% of human competitors. Across the board, Zheng observed a pattern: AI excels at making plans and executing tasks, but it struggles with nuanced algorithmic reasoning. ‚ÄúIt shows that AI is still far from matching the best human coders,‚Äù he says.

LiveCodeBench Pro might define a new upper bar. But what about the floor? Earlier this month, a group of researchers from multiple universities argued that LLM agents should be evaluated primarily on the basis of their riskiness, not just how well they perform. In real-world, application-driven environments‚Äîespecially with AI agents‚Äîunreliability, hallucinations, and brittleness are ruinous. One wrong move could spell disaster when money or safety are on the line.There are other new attempts to address the problem. Some benchmarks, like ARC-AGI, now keep part of their data set private to prevent AI models from being optimized excessively for the test, a problem called ‚Äúoverfitting.‚Äù Meta's Yann LeCun has created LiveBench, a dynamic benchmark where questions evolve every six months. The goal is to evaluate models not just on knowledge but on adaptability.

Xbench, a Chinese benchmark project developed by HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China), is another one of these effort. I just wrote about it in a story. Xbench was initially built in 2022‚Äîright after ChatGPT's launch‚Äîas an internal tool to evaluate models for investment research. Over time, the team expanded the system and brought in external collaborators. It just made parts of its question set publicly available last week. 

Xbench is notable for its dual-track design, which tries to bridge the gap between lab-based tests and real-world utility. The first track evaluates technical reasoning skills by testing a model's STEM knowledge and ability to carry out Chinese-language research. The second track aims to assess practical usefulness‚Äîhow well a model performs on tasks in fields like recruitment and marketing. For instance, one task asks an agent to identify five qualified battery engineer candidates; another has it match brands with relevant influencers from a pool of more than 800 creators. 

The team behind Xbench has big ambitions. They plan to expand its testing capabilities into sectors like finance, law, and design, and they plan to update the test set quarterly to avoid stagnation. 

This is something that I often wonder about, because a model's hardcore reasoning ability doesn't necessarily translate into a fun, informative, and creative experience. Most queries from average users are probably not going to be rocket science. There isn't much research yet on how to effectively evaluate a model's creativity, but I'd love to know which model would be the best for creative writing or art projects.

Human preference testing has also emerged as an alternative to benchmarks. One increasingly popular platform is LMarena, which lets users submit questions and compare responses from different models side by side‚Äîand then pick which one they like best. Still, this method has its flaws. Users sometimes reward the answer that sounds more flattering or agreeable, even if it's wrong. That can incentivize ‚Äúsweet-talking‚Äù models and skew results in favor of pandering.

AI researchers are beginning to realize‚Äîand admit‚Äîthat the status quo of AI testing cannot continue. At the recent CVPR conference, NYU professor Saining Xie drew on historian James Carse's Finite and Infinite Games to critique the hypercompetitive culture of AI research. An infinite game, he noted, is open-ended‚Äîthe goal is to keep playing. But in AI, a dominant player often drops a big result, triggering a wave of follow-up papers chasing the same narrow topic. This race-to-publish culture puts enormous pressure on researchers and rewards speed over depth, short-term wins over long-term insight. ‚ÄúIf academia chooses to play a finite game,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúit will lose everything.‚Äù

I found his framing powerful‚Äîand maybe it applies to benchmarks, too. So, do we have a truly comprehensive scoreboard for how good a model is? Not really. Many dimensions‚Äîsocial, emotional, interdisciplinary‚Äîstill evade assessment. But the wave of new benchmarks hints at a shift. As the field evolves, a bit of skepticism is probably healthy.

Can the vast and sparsely populated African country translate its renewable power potential into national development?

On an afternoon in March in the middle of the world's oldest desert, Johannes Michels looks out at an array of solar panels, the size of 40 football fields, that stretches toward a ridge of jagged peaks between the ochre-colored sand and a cloudless blue sky. Inside a building to Michels's left sits a 12-megawatt electrolyzer‚Äîa machine resembling two giant AA batteries that is designed to split water into its two component parts, H‚ÇÇ and O. Behind him is the desert factory's key piece of proprietary tech: a rotating kiln in which the hydrogen gas from that water is mixed with iron ore to create a pure form of iron, the main ingredient in steel. 

Factories have used fossil fuels to process iron ore for three centuries, and the climate has paid a heavy price: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the steel industry today accounts for 8% of carbon dioxide emissions. Purifying the ore involves extracting iron that is bound to oxygen, and ‚Äúremoving the bond between the iron and oxygen requires a massive amount of energy,‚Äù says Michels, the 39-year-old CEO of HyIron, the startup behind the project. 

But it turns out there is a less carbon-¬≠intensive alternative: using hydrogen to extract the iron. Unlike coal or natural gas, which release carbon dioxide as a by-product, this process, Michels explains, releases water. And if the hydrogen itself is ‚Äúgreen‚Äù‚Äîmeaning it's made through renewable-¬≠powered electrolysis rather than the conventional technique of mixing natural gas and steam‚Äîthe climate impact of the entire process will be minimal.

Researchers, farmers, and global agricultural institutions are embracing long-neglected crops that promise better nutrition and more resilience to the changing climate.

HyIron, which began processing test batches of iron a month after my visit, is one of a handful of companies around the world that are betting green hydrogen can help the $1.8 trillion steel industry clean up its act. What sets it apart, above all, is its location. HyIron's kiln was designed and prototyped in Germany, but the production site is in Namibia, more than 5,000 miles to the south. This former German colony, which was ruled by South Africa from 1915 to 1990, has little industry itself and is an ocean or two away from the world's biggest importers of iron. What it does have is immense untapped potential for wind and solar power, which studies suggest could make it possible to produce hydrogen and its derivative products, like iron, ammonia, and low-carbon aviation fuel, as cheaply as is feasible anywhere. HyIron's site in the Namib Desert, 50 miles from the Atlantic coast, averages just 30 hours of overcast skies per year, Michels tells me. The energy potential here, he says, is ‚Äúincredible.‚Äù

Michels, who trained as an economist and started HyIron as a side project when his family-owned safari lodge went quiet during the covid pandemic, isn't the only Namibian with big plans for hydrogen. Since 2021, when the government identified the gas as a potentially ‚Äútransformative strategic industry,‚Äù it's become something of a national obsession. There are at least nine other projects planned or under construction, including one, in Namibia's south, that's among the largest proposed green hydrogen investments in the world. The Namibian government's Green Hydrogen and Derivatives Strategy, released in 2022, envisions the creation of three ‚Äúhydrogen valleys,‚Äù along the southern, central, and northern coasts, with a target production of 10 million to 12 million metric tons per year by 2050. That's equivalent to more than 10% of all hydrogen made annually today. As soon as 2030, the strategy document claims, the industry could create 80,000 jobs and raise GDP by 30% through a combination of tax revenue, royalties, and the knock-on effect of so many investments. 

If even a fraction of this production comes to pass, it will give Namibia's economy a major boost. But it is a gamble. Green hydrogen technology is still in its infancy, and long-term demand for its products remains uncertain. Pursuing a technology that isn't yet commercially established, some critics fear, could strain government resources and distract from more urgent priorities, including the persistence of hunger and a domestic power grid that reaches only half of Namibia's households. This is especially the case with the largest project under development, along the country's southern coast, which will require at least $10 billion to get off the ground, a figure nearly as big as Namibia's GDP today. That venture is contentious for environmental reasons, too: Under current plans, most of its infrastructure will be built inside a national park in a location Namibia's top environmental watchdog calls the ‚Äúmost sensitive ecosystem in southern Africa.‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven the small country that we are, we're risking quite a lot entering into this global race,‚Äù says Ronny Dempers, executive director of the Namibia Development Trust, which advocates for community-based management of natural resources. 

Adding to the uncertainty is the death last year of Namibian president Hage Geingob, the hydrogen strategy's chief political backer. The new president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who took office in March, hails from the same political party, but multiple people familiar with her thinking told me she's keener on developing oil and natural gas. 

Nonetheless, HyIron's launch has given Namibia's hydrogen ambitions a long-awaited jolt of momentum. 

The question now is whether Namibia's government, its trading partners, and hydrogen innovators like Michels can work together to build the industry in a way that satisfies the world's appetite for cleaner fuels‚Äîand also helps improve lives at home.

The idea of powering the world with hydrogen is hardly new. In his 1874 novel The Mysterious Island, Jules Verne wrote that water, ‚Äúdecomposed‚Äù into hydrogen and oxygen, could function as the ‚Äúcoal of the future.‚Äù Not only is hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe, but H2 gas, when burned, does not produce greenhouse gases and releases more energy per unit mass than any other nonradioactive fuel‚Äîroughly five times more than coal and three times more than gasoline or diesel. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen, pure hydrogen gas can't readily be captured from the atmosphere‚Äîbecause it's so light, it tends to escape into space. Instead, hydrogen must be sourced by splitting it off from other molecules. 

Until now, the process has been anything but green: Most hydrogen made today, primarily for use in petroleum refining, fertilizers, and petrochemicals, is created through a process called steam methane reforming, in which high-temperature steam reacts with methane (CH4), releasing large amounts of CO2 in the process. As a result, the IEA calls hydrogen today ‚Äúmore of a climate problem than a climate solution.‚Äù

Kenyan runners, like many others, are grappling with the impact of expensive, high-performance shoes.

Making hydrogen via electrolysis, as Verne described, was first achieved around 1800. But the process needs a lot of energy, and it wasn't until the late 2010s, with the costs of wind and solar power falling and governments taking concrete steps to help keep global warming to a minimum, that commercial interest in splitting water with renewables began to emerge. A road map published by the IEA in 2023, which outlines a path to reaching net-zero ¬≠emissions by midcentury, calls for dramatically expanded use of this ‚Äúgreen‚Äù hydrogen. A portion of it would replace conventional ‚Äúgray‚Äù hydrogen for existing uses. But the bulk would be for new applications, like iron and steel production, power generation, or long-haul transport‚Äîsome fueled by hydrogen itself and others by derivatives like ammonia (NH3), which is made by fusing hydrogen with nitrogen. 

Most rich countries have adopted policies that incentivize this shift. The European Union, for example, which has caps on fossil-fuel emissions in many sectors, mandates that 42% of hydrogen used by 2030 originate from renewable sources. 



For many African countries, this represents an opportunity. According to the IEA, the continent is home to 60% of the world's best potential sites for solar power, thanks to its levels of year-round sunshine and quantity of land suitable for solar farms. The Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance, a 10-country body formed in 2022, believes Africa can produce nearly a quarter of the hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives traded globally by 2050. 

A handful of North African countries, including Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania, have tentative plans to send hydrogen to Europe via pipelines‚Äîsome new, and some retrofitted from existing pipelines built to carry natural gas. Namibia's distance from Europe makes pipeline transport economically prohibitive. Shipping H2 gas, which takes up a lot of space even when stored in high-pressure tanks, wouldn't be cost-competitive either. So Namibia's plan is to use the hydrogen it makes to create iron, ammonia, and other products, which are dense enough to be transported by sea.

The country's biggest advantage is its especially strong wind and solar potential. Marco Raffinetti, CEO of Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, the firm developing the large-scale project in the south, believes that the company's site there is one of the top three spots for hydrogen production in the world. The key, he says, is strong winds that peak at times when solar output is low, which minimizes power fluctuations and thus reduces costs. Namibia has other selling points as well, including vast tracts of sparsely populated land, a stable political climate, and a government open to new economic opportunities. The country's GDP per capita, $4,168, ranks among the top 10 in Africa.

But Namibia is also the world's second most economically unequal society, in large part because of more than 40 years of rule under South African apartheid that included forced relocation. De facto segregation is still visible. Upmarket neighborhoods of the capital, Windhoek, home to a large share of the country's white minority, resemble parts of suburban Los Angeles, with modernist houses on quiet tree-lined streets stretching into the surrounding hills. But much of the city's population resides in an apartheid-era settlement known as Katutura, or ‚Äúthe place where we do not want to live.‚Äù Many of the homes here are corrugated-iron shacks without electricity or running water.

Namibia's poverty is also a consequence of more recent economic stagnation. According to the World Bank, GDP per capita fell by 30% between 2012 and 2023. Uranium, one of the country's largest exports, faced a decade-long slump as several countries reevaluated their use of nuclear power following the 2011 meltdown in Fukushima, Japan. Namibia's fishing sector was hit with a major corruption scandal in 2019 that left two high-ranking officials in prison. Then came covid, which stifled tourism, and the country's worst drought in a century, which left nearly half the population in need of aid; according to government figures, more than 1,100 people died of malnutrition between 2020 and 2024. Jobs are now scarcer than ever. As of 2023, according to the Namibia Statistics Agency, fewer than one in three people of working age were employed.

It is in this context that Geingob, the late president, turned to hydrogen. A veteran of the independence struggle, Geingob had been elected in 2014 by promising to deliver prosperity. Instead, according to Robin Sherbourne, an economist who's studied Namibia since the 1990s, growth continued to stagnate and support for his party began to wane. 

‚ÄúGreen hydrogen was starting to take off, and Namibia had all the basic ingredients,‚Äù Sherbourne tells me. ‚ÄúSo [Geingob] jumped at it. It gave him something to wave in front of the electorate and say, ‚ÄòLook, things are happening.'‚Äù

‚ÄúIt gave him something to wave in front of the electorate and say, ‚ÄòLook, things are happening.'‚Äù

Two and a half years after the release of the government's Green Hydrogen Strategy, the industry is gradually coming to life. HyIron's current setup, which cost ‚Ç¨30 million (currently $34 million) and was financed in part by a grant from the German government, is capable of producing 15,000 metric tons of iron per year, roughly enough for 10,000 midsize cars or one large high-rise ¬≠building. Michels hopes to scale that to 2 million metric tons by 2030, at an estimated cost of $2.7 billion. 

Inadequate funding, infrastructure issues, and fights over regulation mean the sector's future remains uncertain.

Another project, developed by the Belgian shipping company CMB.Tech and the Namibian firm Ohlthaver & List, is working to produce trial amounts of hydrogen. In a second phase, it will trial generation of ammonia, which is primarily used today in fertilizers but could eventually be a key fuel for ocean-faring vessels. Ultimately the idea is to spend $3 billion on commercial-¬≠scale ammonia production, aiming for 250,000 metric tons per year by the end of the decade, as well as a terminal at the port of Walvis Bay, where vessels rounding the southern tip of Africa will be able to bunker with the fuel.

The Hyphen project, by contrast, exists for now mainly on paper. Although the company signed a concession agreement with Namibia's government in 2023, it hasn't yet secured the financing it needs to move ahead with construction. But if the project does come to life, it will be one of the world's largest: Plans call for the installation of seven gigawatts of renewable power, more than 10 times Namibia's current generation capacity, to produce 2 million metric tons of ammonia annually by 2030. According to Raffinetti, Hyphen plans to ‚Äúoverbuild‚Äù the accompanying infrastructure so it could also be used in future projects in the planned southern hydrogen valley. Meeting Namibia's 2050 targets under the Green Hydrogen Strategy would require the equivalent of 30 Hyphen-size projects spread across the three corridors of production.

This planned footprint has already been the source of controversy. Hyphen's concession‚Äîthe land it has been granted access to‚Äîencompasses 18% of Tsau Khaeb National Park, a protected area about the size of Massachusetts that's home to flamingos, African penguins, and 31 species of plants found nowhere else on Earth, many of them water-storing succulents that blanket the desert in majestic pastel-colored flowers when it rains. 

Chris Brown, who leads the Namibia Chamber of Environment, a coalition of environmental NGOs, says the project would irreparably damage the ‚Äúintegrity and resilience‚Äù of the park. Raffinetti says Hyphen's equipment will take up a small fraction of its concession and will be built in a ‚Äúsurgical way‚Äù to avoid the most ecologically sensitive areas.

But environmentalists are not the only ones who've criticized the choice of location. An expanded port, built to facilitate ammonia exports, will sit immediately adjacent to a site that housed a labor and extermination camp during Namibia's 1904‚Äì1908 genocide, in which tens of thousands of Nama and Herero people were killed by German soldiers during a period of resistance to colonial rule. A 2024 report commissioned by Nama and Herero leaders argues that the extension of port infrastructure would ‚Äúdesecrate‚Äù the heritage of the area and those who died there. It doesn't help the optics that Hyphen's majority shareholder, the renewable power producer Enertrag, is a German company. 

Beyond these sensitivities, Namibia's broader hydrogen aspirations remain subject to many questions. While the country's desert climate is ideal for generating power, the other key input for green hydrogen‚Äîwater‚Äîis scarce. The central coastal region, where the HyIron and CMB.Tech projects (as well as several others in early-stage development) are based, already sources much of its water from a local seawater desalination plant that's powered only in part by renewables. Other facilities are planned here and in the south, but some worry that hydrogen projects could face water-related bottlenecks.

‚ÄúIf you want your green hydrogen projects to be implemented here, we want our household problems to be solved.‚Äù

Namibia's prospects also hinge on a global market for green fuels that's highly precarious. Over the past few years, the hydrogen sector has gone from a period of ‚Äúhype‚Äù to one of ‚Äúdisillusionment,‚Äù according to Martin Tengler, head of hydrogen research at BloombergNEF, which studies markets for new energy technologies. Absent incentives, Tengler is skeptical that green hydrogen will ever reach cost parity with gray hydrogen in most parts of the world. Certain industries, though, could embrace it even if it costs more. He notes that some higher-end automakers have already shown a willingness to pay a premium for green steel, even if it means a car's price goes up by 2 or 3%. (Benteler, a German metals processing firm that supplies the automotive market, has committed to purchasing test quantities of green iron from HyIron.)

Uncertainties also surround the future of ammonia. According to the IEA road map, ammonia made from green hydrogen could power 44% of global shipping by midcentury. But it, too, is likely to remain expensive relative to both conventional fuels and carbon-based alternatives like methanol and liquefied natural gas. 

Some in Namibia are especially worried about Hyphen, which has not yet signed any binding agreements with customers. In a bid to boost Hyphen's attractiveness to other financiers, the government assumed a 24% ownership stake in the venture. The money it's put in so far, roughly ‚Ç¨24 million ($27 million), is covered by a Dutch government grant. But Namibia's portion of construction would likely be financed through loans, exposing taxpayers to the project's risks. Detlof von Oertzen, an energy consultant who's been exploring Namibia's hydrogen potential since independence, believes this is reckless, especially given the country's pressing needs in food, health care, and education. ‚ÄúWe have a massive budget deficit,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúWe should not be binding resources to projects that might not end up leading anywhere.‚Äù

Like many Namibians I spoke to, von Oertzen thinks the government's targets for hydrogen production, and jobs associated with it, are wildly unrealistic. At the same time, he and other critics believe there are ways in which the industry can contribute to national development. Despite his misgivings about the government's support of Hyphen, he believes a desalination plant that the company plans to build could play an important role in combating local water shortages in Namibia's sparsely populated south and, in turn, help draw more industry and people. 

Using steel with lower emissions would add only 1% to the price of the average new vehicle.

Raffinetti tells me that his company is also exploring the possibility of transmitting excess electricity from peak periods to the grid for local use. That may not put a major dent in the country's electrification deficit, since the majority of Namibians who lack grid power live in the distant rural north. Still, some would like to see the government make more explicit demands from foreign investors to address local gaps. William Minnie, youth spokesperson for the Landless People's Movement, an opposition party, believes it comes down to better negotiation. ‚ÄúIf you want your green hydrogen projects to be implemented here,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwe want our household problems to be solved.‚Äù

Some see Nandi-Ndaitwah's arrival in office as a chance to forge a more pragmatic way forward. One goal outlined by her party during last year's election campaign is ‚Äúto increase rural electrification and ensure availability of affordable electricity.‚Äù 

At a ceremonial launch of HyIron's plant in April, Nandi-Ndaitwah praised the project for opening a ‚Äúnew chapter in Namibia's industrial history.‚Äù At the same time, she's also pledged to move toward the extraction of oil and gas. Since 2022, firms exploring in the deep waters off Namibia's coast have announced significant discoveries of those resources. The reserves might be too expensive to develop, and they don't exactly position the country as a steward of the energy transition. Some observers, though, believe embracing fossil fuels could be a way to hedge against the uncertainty surrounding green hydrogen while lowering the costs of developing both. ‚ÄúIf you take a combined approach, there's a lot of infrastructure that can be shared between the two industries,‚Äù says Ekkehard Friedrich, a Windhoek-based investment advisor. 

For all the questions about hydrogen that linger, there's also a strong sense of anticipation. After my tour of HyIron, I drove for an hour, much of it along a desolate gravel road, to explore the nearest town. A faded desert settlement, Arandis was originally built to house employees of R√∂ssing, an open-pit uranium mine that was once the largest in the world. There I met Joel Ochurub, 20, the son of a mine worker who's studying to be a machinist. Jobs in Namibia, he told me, are ‚Äúvery scarce‚Äù; hydrogen might not create opportunities for everyone, he said, but the more industry Namibia can lure, the better. ‚ÄúWhen you see posts about green hydrogen on Instagram, there are so many likes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople are excited.‚Äù

Microsoft wants everything to be an Xbox, but the problem with its ongoing ambition to rebrand every gaming-capable device as a pseudo gaming console is so few devices look like an Xbox. The next step on Microsoft's wacky, winding road to regaining hardware supremacy is a $400 bundle that includes a Meta Quest headset with a unique colorway, an Xbox controller, and a few months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for game streaming. If you were looking to dip your toe into VR, the $300 Quest 3S is still your best option, and the bundle adds enough to make it worth the extra Benjamin. Just know that the Quest 3S' displays don't offer everything you truly want for a big picture VR gaming experience.

Meta first hinted at a Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition in 2023, around the time it offered users a native Xbox app for Meta Quest to enable easier game streaming. The $400 Xbox Edition Quest 3S doesn't let you play any of your Xbox games natively. All it truly provides is access to Microsoft's streaming service, an extra Xbox controller, and the ergonomic Elite Strap that may help you game for longer without suffering a potential bout of neck strain.

Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition

The Xbox edition bundle is a great deal, plus the headset looks better in black. You just won't have the best displays for game streaming.

Pros

Cons

Microsoft and Meta opting for the Quest 3S rather than the Quest 3 makes the bundle cheaper, but it's less effective for game streaming. I've become very intimate with the Quest 3S since it hit the scene last year, and it's what I usually suggest to anybody who wants to try VR without breaking the bank. However, the $500 Quest 3 has a wider, 110-degree horizontal FOV (field of view) compared to the 3S at 96 degrees. The more expensive headset also uses better-looking pancake lenses compared to the older and lesser-quality Fresnel lenses on what's normally a $300 headset. While they both have the same internal specs and performance, there's a clear visual quality difference between both VR headsets. If you were planning to buy a VR device mainly to do game streaming on a giant, virtual display, I would normally suggest you go for the one that will help your games look their best.

The Quest 3S lenses are equivalent to what was on the Quest 2, and the resulting image quality is slightly more grainy than what you get on a Quest 3. The Fresnel lenses combined with limited FOV can result in blurred images around the periphery of the display. This can make some text on notes in a game like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nearly indecipherable unless you're directly looking at that memento directly in front of you and from close up. It's not unplayable, but it could make some games potentially annoying.

While Game Pass is easily one of the best game streaming services available, the Quest 3S makes streaming pitfalls a little harder to navigate. Chief among them is lag. Games on Quest stream at 1,920√ó1,080 resolution, and Xbox Cloud Gaming suggests you have at least 20 Mbps internet speeds and a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. Anything less, and you'll experience input lag and blurred visuals. On the Quest 3S screens, any loss of visual clarity is so glaring that normally beautiful titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 appear like a pixelated mosaic. Speaking of Clair Obscur, you need very stable gameplay to hit those tight dodge or parry timings. I'm already terrible at hitting a parry, so suffering a team wipe because of lag is worse than agonizing.

If you don't own a controller that pairs well with Quest 3S, the Xbox Edition has a fair amount of value for what you get. The Elite Strap‚Äîwhich offers better comfort than the default headband‚Äînormally retails for $70. The controller's suggested retail price sits at around $65. Three months of Game Pass Ultimate would set you back another $60. Overall, you save $95 compared to buying everything separately, though you'll need to spend $20 per month later to maintain access to game streaming. If you were buying outside the bundle, you could get a $400 Quest 3S with 256GB of storage compared to 128GB. If you plan to use your headset for game streaming‚Äîwhether through Xbox or Steam Link to hit up PCVR titles‚Äîyou won't have many issues with running out of storage. Most games on the Meta Store don't take up much space either, so you should feel safe sticking with the smaller storage option.

Beyond a good deal, what you really want from this special edition are the Xbox colors. Black and green are far more striking than the bland white of the last several Meta Quest headsets. The neon accents help sell it as a ‚Äúgamer device,‚Äù enough that it shouldn't stick out standing shoulder to shoulder with your typical Razer PC gaming gear. The stock-standard Xbox controller is an oldie but goodie, and the green accents added to the joysticks lend it a little extra flair without being too overt.

Outside of Apple with its $3,500 Vision Pro, Meta is one of the few players still interested in doing large-scale, cheap VR/XR headsets. In the same vein, Game Pass is still one of the best deals in gaming, though it has become more expensive as of late. Now that hardware like the Xbox Series X and individual games cost more, streaming is starting to appear more enticing. Even then, Microsoft has promised a whole ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of new hardware devices that includes an Xbox-branded handheld PC made by Asus. In that case, Microsoft is reengineering its Windows operating system to provide a more console-like experience. That can't be the case with a Meta Quest that uses the company's own Horizon OS. Until we see where Microsoft next takes us on its grand gaming journey, we'll probably see even more devices that look a little more like an Xbox.

We're on the eve of a new Marvel show, and the House of Mouse has started allowing press who've seen all six episodes of Ironheart to share how they think. While the early verdicts swing pretty wildly between positive and mild shrugs at best, there's also a lot of hints that the series' back half includes a pretty wild climax.

While there does seem to be a wide range of opinions, it seems like most of whether or not Ironheart lands with people clicks with its flow, with many critics pointing to the pacing as a sticking issue for the series (perhaps the reason why Disney and Marvel have decided to split its release into two chunks of three episodes, rather than weekly). Even among the negative critiques however, there's plenty of praise for the main stars in Dominique Thorne, Alden Ehrenreich, and Anthony Ramos‚Äìand an a pretty consistent note that, no matter how the rest of the series pans out, the finale goes to some intriguing places.

Check out some social reactions below, starting with some positive insights from io9's very own Justin Carter and Germain Lussier!

Most interesting thing about Ironheart is how uninterested it is about asking if Riri has a mantle to live up to. It's the right choice and tbh, I watched wishing this thread continued across other projects. 

Anthony Ramos is fine, interesting, surprisingly optimistic ending.

‚Äî Justin Carter (@GigawattConduit) June 24, 2025



#Ironheart is one of my favorite Marvel shows. It blends so much of what we love about the MCU so seamlessly with fantastic characters, performances, and style. Goes places I didn't expect, links in wild ways, but always keeps its dynamic, flawed, lead character front and center. pic.twitter.com/udIcCXAEt5

‚Äî Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) June 24, 2025



#Ironheart have some fun moments but it's never interesting enough nor it manages to stick the landing.

Bland characters and a super uninteresting plot that doesn't knows where it wants to go. A disappointment overall.  pic.twitter.com/pzereKvpb5

‚Äî The Hollywood Handle (@HollywoodHandle) June 24, 2025



The first three episodes of #Ironheart are out tomorrow, and your resident Marvel cynic is here to say: it's quite good! It's a shame the series has been in flux, because Disney+ has something great on their hands. Dominique Thorne is pure dynamite. Alden Ehrenreich is‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/JNGzBEAw64

‚Äî Maggie Lovitt (@maggieofthetown) June 24, 2025



#Ironheart is really fun at times but feels (in my humble opinion) like it's desperately in need of a soul. The magic vs. machine theme is conceptually intriguing but feels like it's lacking here. I'm ambilavent because I didn't hate any part but I didn't love anything either pic.twitter.com/W6HC8DYIMA

‚Äî Hope Sloop (@Hopesloop) June 24, 2025



IRONHEART warmed my heart. Dominique Thorne brings Riri Williams to life with layers that make her so much more. She's still our incredibly smart girl from Chicago but there is a lot of depth to Riri's story and the show has a truly emotional arc and an iconic vibe to it. pic.twitter.com/8SWLGuUXqn

‚Äî Rachel Leishman (@RachelLeishman) June 24, 2025



I've seen all six episodes of #Ironheart, and it's not good. It becomes obvious very quickly why Marvel decided to dump this on D+ 3 eps at a time. Can't fault the cast, but none of them are given much to work with. Some of the action scenes are passable and the finale is by far‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/UxTD7SvDCu

‚Äî Mark Cassidy (@RorMachine) June 24, 2025



I watched all six episodes of #Ironheart and it deserves your attention. It's better than most recent Marvel Studios theatrical releases and is one of the rare good MCU TV shows. Dominique Thorne is a star, peak production values, no idea what it's leading to but I'd like more.üßµ pic.twitter.com/tjgfsiDjtg

‚Äî Rob Keyes (@rob_keyes) June 24, 2025



#Ironheart is a bit of a mess‚Äîbut it means well. Dominique Thorne is great, grounding the story with real emotion as Riri builds something new from grief. Rushed pacing and inconsistent narrative weigh it down, leaving a series that reaches for greatness but never quite takes off pic.twitter.com/IxRcg68R28

#Ironheart doesn't break any new ground with its story (and the less said about The Hood's crew, the better). However, it's an enjoyable ride buoyed by stellar performances from Dominique Thorne, Alden Ehrenreich, Anthony Ramos, and Lyric Ross. DON'T MISS THE FINALE! üëÄ pic.twitter.com/otgDMsqP0d

Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, might also double as a brain booster. Research out today describes a link between semaglutide use and a reduced risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes.

Scientists at Case Western Reserve University conducted the study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. They found that diabetes patients taking semaglutide have a significantly lower risk of dementia than those taking other diabetes medications. The findings should prompt further study into this connection, including clinical trials, the researchers say.

How Ozempic Works‚Äîand What's Still a Mystery

GLP-1 drugs were first approved to help control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. Newer GLP-1 agents, such as semaglutide, have also proven to be substantially more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. Studies are also showing that the health benefits of GLP-1s can extend beyond just weight loss. Study researcher Rong Xu and her team have been looking into some of these potential added benefits. Their past studies have suggested that semaglutide can help temper cravings for nicotine or opioids, for instance.

There is currently no known cure for dementia, as Xu notes. But up to half of all dementia cases might be preventable, and scientists have identified over a dozen modifiable risk factors that contribute to dementia risk, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease‚Äîall conditions that GLP-1s like semaglutide are known to address. GLP-1s also seem to generally reduce inflammation, yet another contributing factor to dementia.

Given all that, ‚Äúsemaglutide has emerged as a promising candidate‚Äù for a preventative treatment that can tackle multiple drivers of dementia risk, Xu told Gizmodo.

The researchers had already found a link between semaglutide use and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. The team, wanting to test its hypothesis with other related dementias, analyzed the medical records of around 1.7 million patients with type 2 diabetes.

Over a three-year span, they found that people on semaglutide had a noticeably lower risk (around 40% to 50% lower) of developing any Alzheimer's disease-related dementia than those taking any of seven other diabetes medications, including insulin and metformin. This pattern could be seen among men, women, younger and older patients, and in people with or without obesity. On closer inspection, however, a reduced risk associated with semaglutide was only found with vascular dementia (the second-most common form of dementia), and not with Lewy body dementia or frontotemporal dementia.

‚ÄúAs we and others have previously shown benefit for semaglutide and other GLP-1RA medications in [Alzheimer's disease], our results support the GLP-1 receptor as a target for dementia prevention,‚Äù they wrote in their paper.

People on Ozempic Are Drinking Way Less

These findings aren't definitive, however, and can only show a correlation between semaglutide and lower dementia risk. That said, there's been a lot of evidence‚Äîmuch of it encouraging‚Äîto warrant clinical trials that could truly show a causal effect, the researchers say. Indeed, Novo Nordisk, the developers of Ozempic and Wegovy, are currently conducting two large-scale trials testing semaglutide for Alzheimer's (both are expected to finish as early as this year). Xu and her team also next plan to study whether tirzepatide and other emerging, potentially more effective GLP-1 drugs can provide an even greater buffer against dementia.

Portable power stations have surged in popularity in recent years, becoming essential gear for a range of situations‚Äîwhether you're facing winter power outages or heading outdoors for summer adventures like camping. In contrast to standard power banks, this device offers enough juice to run small appliances like mini fridges as well as more energy-intensive electronic devices.

The Bluetti power station, especially in this deal, takes it a notch higher by offering a 100W solar panel, and makes it a great investment if you're considering going green with off-grid power. Currently, Amazon is offering the Bluetti EB3A power station with 100W solar panel included at a record low price of $299, down from $599. Having the solar panel added is a big plus which allows you to harness the energy of the sun and charge your devices no matter where you are.

See at Amazon

The Bluetti EB3A is a compact portable power station that includes a compact 268Wh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery to provide safe, stable, and reliable power. It has two 600W AC outlets with a surge capacity of 1200W, thus it can be used with a wide range of devices from laptops and phones to appliances and even delicate devices like desktop computers.

One of the highlights of the EB3A is that it supports ultra-fast charging. Where other competitors require utilizing their large power bricks to charge, the EB3A can be charged at 350W using a single cable. You are also able to combine solar and AC charging to reach 80% state of charge in 30 minutes. The onboard MPPT controller can accept up to 200W of solar input so you can upgrade with additional solar equipment in the future if desired. Using the 100W solar panel included, you can charge the EB3A from 0% to 80% using solar power in about 2.6 hours.

Bluetti EB3A is also a reliable uninterruptible power supply that can seamlessly shift to battery power in the event of grid failure: This is valuable in protecting sensitive electronics from data loss or destruction in unplanned outages. The power station is also equipped with many output ports such as USB-A, USB-C, and DC which are able to support most devices you might want to charge.

What's more, its small and lightweight size make it easy to carry whether to a camp or picnic or just for power backup at home.

For just $299, this is a smart investment for anyone who must stay charged up.

Noctua's next-generation NF-A12x25 G2 120mm fans are finally available for purchase. The latest high-performance fans are available on Amazon for $34.90 each or $64.90 for a twin pack. A follow-up to the original NF-A12x25 fans, which launched back in 2018, the second-generation model made its first appearance at this year's Computex trade expo as part of a collaboration with Asus. The two companies jointly launched the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition GPU, which featured three NF-A12x25 G2 fans.

Noctua NF-A12x25 G2: Available at Amazon for $34.90The second-gen NF-A12x25 120mm fans from Noctua are currently available for purchase on Amazon.



The new NF-A12x25 G2 is essentially a smaller version of the NF-A14x25 G2 140mm fans, which debuted last year. Noctua continues to use its patented Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) for the fan construction, which is said to offer high tensile strength and low thermal expansion characteristics compared to traditional thermoplastics. Apart from the redesigned fan blades, the fan hub has also been optimized with a special pattern allowing the G2 to offer better airflow performance compared to the original NF-A12x25.

The fan is available in three versions: a standard PWM model with speeds of up to 1800 RPM, an ultra-quiet LS-PWM model that tops out at 1100 RPM, and an Sx2-PP set that includes two fans. The two fans in the set are intentionally offset by 50 RPM, a design choice that is said to improve push-pull performance and help reduce acoustic interference when multiple fans operate side by side.

According to the company, the new NF-A12x25 G2 fans can be used in a range of scenarios, including general case ventilation and more demanding tasks, such as cooling heatsinks or water cooling radiators. In internal testing, Noctua reports that the G2 model performed 3.5¬∞C better than the original NF-A12x25 at a 200W heat load on a 120x49 mm radiator, with both fans operating at similar noise levels. When tested with the NH-U12A heatsink under the same thermal load, the G2 offered a modest improvement of about 1¬∞C under identical acoustic conditions.

Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 PWM Sx2-PP: Available at Amazon for $64.90

The Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 120mm fans can be purchased as set of two which saves $4.90. The set is currently available on Amazon. 

In case airflow scenarios, the G2 fan is said to deliver around 9% more airflow than its predecessor at the same pressure drop. Additionally, the updated model can operate approximately 1.5 to 3.5dB quieter in certain conditions while maintaining comparable thermal performance, particularly when used on radiators.

These new fans come with a variety of accessories including pre-installed anti-vibration pads, an anti-vibration gasket for a tighter seal on radiators, mounting screws, anti-vibration rubber mounts, a PWM Y-splitter cable, a PWM extension cable, and a low-noise adapter cable. Noctua will also offer a six-year warranty on its new NF-A12x25 G2. The company has plans to launch an all-black ‚ÄòChromax' version of the fan, which is expected to happen next year.

Sony's alleged monopolistic practices have cost Dutch consumers around ‚Ç¨435 million ($505 million) since 2013, according to campaigner research.

Dutch PlayStation gamers are up in arms about what they call the unfair 'Sony tax.' Their collective anger has been mobilized today in a class action suit against Sony, alleging monopolistic practices. In brief, legal representatives of the 'Fair PlayStation' campaign say that ‚Äúconsumers pay an average of 47% more for these digital versions than for exactly the same game on a physical disc‚Äù (machine translation used), as Sony leverages its monopoly on digital sales.

Research undertaken by the Dutch collective indicates that Sony has been ‚Äúexploiting its dominant position in the console market for at least ten years,‚Äù with things made much worse by barring other app stores from the platform. It concludes that ‚Äúat least 1.7 million Dutch PlayStation owners pay too much for digital games and in-game content.‚Äù In total, Dutch consumers have thus had to shell out ‚Ç¨435 million ($505 million) more than they should have done since 2013, according to campaigners.

Wherever you live, though, new PlayStation 5 releases are expensive, and typically arrive at $69.99 in the U.S., for example. While Sony can easily control game pricing in its digital store, competing sellers of physical game media releases will often race to cut the margins they enjoy per game to aim for the volume market. This kind of healthy competition is being eroded by the introduction and promotion of the digital-only versions of consoles.



Lucia Melcherts, chair of Stichting Massaschade & Consument, speaking as a representative of the 'Fair PlayStation' campaign, points out that many gamers have spent very large sums on buying games for the PlayStation. She reckons that Sony is taking away the magic as it ‚Äúunilaterally imposes new conditions and demands more money without offering anything in return.‚Äù That sounds like Sony is boiling the frog. The water got a little hotter in April, with Sony hiking prices of a wide range of its products as recently as April.

The way that Sony could implement such price hikes illustrates the boldness of its alleged monopolistic behavior in 2025. Melcherts asserts that the purported 'Sony tax' has come about as the firm ‚Äúcan now afford to make decisions without having to worry much about what competitors, developers, or consumers are doing.‚Äù This contrasts with how the digital-only console revolution was sold. With digital distribution reducing costs for the entertainment business, cheaper content was often implied. However, that doesn't work with walled-garden systems that block competing digital stores.

In summary, the 'Fair PlayStation' campaign alleged that Sony is making double the margin on its digital sales, is enjoying the position of a monopolist with 80% of the Dutch console market, and maintains artificial walls around its on-console store. Sony's restrictive practices aren't good for developers and publishers, either.

The first legal hearing is scheduled for later in 2025. Ultimately, the consumer action group hopes that the Dutch courts will uphold their claims and force Sony to open the sale of digital PlayStation content for other providers.

Katherine  Wandersee

 June 24, 2025  

Cardiac glycosides derived from the foxglove plant have been used in cardiology for two centuries, but digoxin and digitoxin have gradually fallen out of favor and are now considered controversial in heart failure treatment.

The early rationale for the use of glycosides in heart failure stemmed from the 1997 DIG trial comparing digoxin to placebo ‚Äî both in combination with standard therapy ‚Äî in 6800 patients with heart failure. People with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) who used the drug were less likely to require hospitalization, but the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality did not differ between the two groups.

‚ÄúDigoxin/digitoxin received a class 1 recommendation in earlier heart failure guidelines, but this has since been downgraded to a weaker class 2b,‚Äù in light of therapeutic advances, Gregg Fonarow, MD, told Medscape Medical News.

Heart failure medications have evolved substantially in the quarter-century since the DIG trial, said Fonarow, who directs the Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center and is the co-director of UCLA's Preventative Cardiology Program. Two new trials are reexamining digitoxin and digoxin to see if they offer any benefit over and above the ‚Äúfantastic 4‚Äù of heart failure pharmacotherapy: Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and SGLT2 inhibitors.

At this year's Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (HFA-ESC) 2025 in Belgrade, Serbia, investigators reported early data from the DIGIT-HF trial, which is comparing digitoxin or placebo in combination with guideline-directed therapy in 1212 patients with symptomatic HFrEF.

‚ÄúWe started DIGIT-HF to demonstrate whether digitoxin at low serum concentrations improves outcomes on top of a modern guideline-directed medical therapy and to show that the use of digitoxin is safe,‚Äù lead investigator Udo Bavendiek, MD, told Medscape Medical News. ‚ÄúThe latter is of particular importance because cardiac glycosides are needed for effective frequency control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HFrEF when beta-blocker treatment alone is not enough for effective rate control.‚Äù

Results should arrive later this year, but Bavendiek, of Hannover Medical School in Hannover, Germany, said the study population is more complex relative to the subjects in pivotal trials of other contemporary therapies for heart failure.

DIGIT-HF patients had a ‚Äúpronounced HF symptomatic burden,‚Äù Bavendiek and his co-authors wrote in the European Journal of Heart Failure, but also were receiving ‚Äúsuperior implementation of contemporary HF treatment,‚Äù including guideline-directed medications: 40% were receiving ARNI, 70% MRA, 64% had a cardioverter-defibrillator, and 25% had received cardiac resynchronization therapy.

If digitoxin shows a benefit in this severely ill population already on optimized therapy, this finding would be of great interest, Bavendiek told Medscape Medical News. So far, use of digitoxin appears safe in this population, with no new safety signals observed. The investigators opted for digitoxin because its hepatic excretion is preferred in patients with impaired kidney function, as opposed to digoxin, which is excreted via the kidneys.

Another ongoing trial with the potential to inform the use of glycosides is the DECISION study of more than 1000 patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction below 50%. Unlike DIGIT-HF, the DECISION trial uses low-dose digoxin, said lead investigator Dirk Jan van Veldhuisen, MD, of University Medical Center Groningen in Groningen, the Netherlands. This decision was based on sub-analyses of the DIG trial suggesting serum concentrations of digoxin > 1.2 ng/mL were associated with increased mortality, while more favorable outcomes were seen with lower concentrations. In DECISION, the target serum concentration is 0.5-0.9‚Äâng/mL The DECISION investigators also enrolled more women to develop a better understanding of the use of digoxin in this population.

The most recent American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of heart failure state glycoside agents can be considered for patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy or who cannot tolerate such treatment, with the aim of reducing hospitalizations for heart failure, said Fonarow, who serves as a spokesman for the society.

Outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation might be of particular interest, Fonarow said. ‚ÄúDIGIT-HF trial randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation. As such, this trial will provide important information on the role of this therapy in patients with HFrEF and atrial fibrillation,‚Äù he said.

However, many patients in DIGIT-HF were not receiving all of the ‚Äúfantastic four‚Äù therapies at baseline, he added. ‚ÄúFor these reasons, the DIGIT-HF trial may not be definitive enough to influence guideline recommendations without confirmation from additional clinical trials.‚Äù

Fonarow reported consulting for Abbott, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cytokinetics, Eli Lilly and Company, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Merck, Novartis, and Pfizer. Bavendiek reported receiving travel support and honoraria from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis, Pfizer, and Vital, and institutional research support from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of death from cancer in the United States (US) and the most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide. CRC refers to cancer in the colon or rectum, the two parts that make up the large intestine. In the US, deaths from CRC in people under 55 have been increasing since the mid-2000s, highlighting the need for effective treatments. 

New data published in The Journal of Immunology, reveal that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy improved overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with CRC. CIK cell therapy uses the patient's immune cells to target and destroy cancer cells. Patients who received CIK cell therapy with chemotherapy or surgery showed improved outcomes regardless of whether they had early or advanced stages. 

""For advanced colorectal cancer, the prognosis has been rather pessimistic, and patients at stages II-III face a relatively high risk of recurrence and metastasis following surgery, with limited treatment options for these patients. CIK cell therapy could enhance the survival of patients with CRC compared to traditional therapies,"" said Dr. Yi Zhang, Director of the Biotherapy Center at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, who led the study. 

Despite the positive outcomes of CIK cell therapy, some patients do not respond to the treatment. Researchers analyzed blood samples from patients to determine whether any biomarkers could predict who would respond well to CIK cell therapy. They found that CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels in a patient's blood could indicate whether they would benefit from CIK cell therapy. CEA is expressed in some CRC patients who undergo surgery and is considered an indicator of poor prognosis and disease recurrence. These results could pave the way for a simple blood test administered before treatment, which could improve patient survival. 

The long-term effects of CIK cell therapy for CRC patients had not been understood until now. The promising results of our study will hopefully facilitate the widespread adoption of cell therapies for treating malignant tumors, including CRC.""

Dr. Yi Zhang, Director of the Biotherapy Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University

This retrospective study followed two groups of patients after they received treatment. The CIK group that received CIK cell therapy with chemotherapy or surgery and the control group that received chemotherapy and/or surgery. Patients were enrolled in the study from 2008 to 2014 and were followed through January 2020. Researchers monitored both the time between the first treatment and when a patient's disease worsened (progression-free survival) and the time between the first treatment and death (overall survival). Comparing the results of progression-free survival and overall survival within the CIK group, researchers investigated different biomarkers in patients' blood that may be most relevant to predicting survival. 

The researchers plan to continue this work by investigating the effects of combining CIK therapy with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in the treatment of CRC and by conducting prospective clinical studies to establish CIK cell therapy as a treatment for CRC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Experimental drug promotes weight loss by heating fat instead of suppressing appetite","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250624/Experimental-drug-promotes-weight-loss-by-heating-fat-instead-of-suppressing-appetite.aspx","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:41:00 GMT","

An article published in the journal Nature Metabolism presents an experimental drug that stimulates adipose tissue cells to produce heat through a process known as thermogenesis, thereby promoting weight loss. In animal tests, the compound prevented fat accumulation in response to a high-fat diet, treated existing obesity, and reversed associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance. Preliminary results from clinical research indicate that the substance is safe and may have beneficial metabolic effects on humans.

We observed weight loss and improved blood sugar levels in obese volunteers who participated in the phase 1 clinical trial. But this result isn't conclusive because it was a small group, and the objective was to assess whether the compound is safe and well tolerated. We intend to start phase 2 of the study later this year, which is designed to test its effectiveness in treating obesity.""

Carlos Escande, researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Montevideo, Uruguay, and coordinator of the study

The experimental drug, currently called SANA (short for ""salicylate-based nitroalkene""), is a derivative of salicylate, a chemical compound with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties found naturally in plants and used to make drugs such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). According to Escande, his group initially sought to develop an anti-inflammatory drug. To this end, they tested several chemical modifications to the salicylate molecule.

""We wanted the precursor used to be as safe as possible. Salicylate is the drug that's been known the longest, and many people consume its derivatives daily. However, we observed that instead of protecting against inflammation, the molecule we synthesized protects against diet-induced obesity,"" says the researcher.

Two different models were used to test this effect in animals. In the first model, SANA was administered to mice alongside a high-fat diet, which prevented any weight gain. Meanwhile, the animals in the control group gained between 40% and 50% of their body weight over eight weeks. In the second model, treatment began after the animals were obese. After three weeks, the mice had lost 20% of their body mass. There was also a reduction in blood sugar, improved insulin sensitivity, and a decrease in fat accumulated in the liver (a condition known as hepatic steatosis for which there is still no effective pharmacological treatment).

The next step was to investigate the mechanism of action of the substance. Nine Brazilian researchers collaborated on this task: Marcelo Mori, Pedro Vieira and Larissa Menezes dos Reis from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP); William Festuccia and Luiz Os√≥rio Leiria from the University of S√£o Paulo (USP); and Juliana Camacho-Pereira, Marina Santo Chichierchio, Gabriele Barbosa, and Leonardo de Souza from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). This stage was supported by FAPESP through three projects (20/04159-8, 21/08354-2 and 22/11234-1).

The experiments showed that SANA specifically targets adipose tissue, activating thermogenesis through an unconventional mechanism. It can therefore be considered the first in a new class of anti-obesity drugs. It does not affect the central nervous or digestive systems or appetite.

As the authors explain, thermogenesis is typically mediated by a protein called UCP1, which is found within mitochondria (the organelles that generate energy for cells). UCP1 is activated in certain situations, such as exposure to cold. It then interferes with the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular fuel. This causes the energy generated by cellular respiration to dissipate as heat. However, this is not the case with SANA. The new drug causes adipocytes to use creatine, a compound formed by three amino acids (arginine, glycine, and methionine), as an energy source to produce heat without involving the UCP1 protein.

""We conducted tests with UCP1-deficient mice [genetically modified to not express the protein] and proved that SANA activates thermogenesis in these animals, even in the absence of UCP1 and under thermoneutral conditions, that is, without exposure to cold,"" says William Festuccia, a professor at the Biomedical Sciences Institute at USP.

According to the researcher, the observed impact on body temperature is small and does not pose a significant health risk. ""Older thermogenic agents, such as dinitrophenol, have an effect on the mitochondria of the entire body, causing a large increase in temperature and overloading the cardiovascular system, which needs to increase blood pressure for blood to reach the periphery and dissipate heat. But in the case of SANA, there's only action on the mitochondria of adipose tissue,"" he explains.

In experiments coordinated by Marcelo Mori at the Institute of Biology at UNICAMP, it was confirmed that SANA acts on enzymes involved in the so-called ""creatine futile cycle,"" a thermogenic mechanism in which the amino acid compound is repeatedly converted into phosphocreatine and back into creatine, consuming ATP and releasing energy as heat.

""The fact that it's a small molecule and acts through a totally different mechanism allows SANA to be combined with other substances already used in the treatment of obesity, such as GLP-1 analogs [semaglutide and similar],"" says Mori. ""When we reduce food intake, our body tends to slow down its metabolism. To avoid this plateau effect, it'd be interesting to combine a molecule that inhibits appetite with another that promotes caloric expenditure.""

Mori adds that although GLP-1 analogs are effective in combating obesity and controlling blood sugar, they also tend to promote lean mass loss, which is particularly problematic for the elderly. ""That's why it's important to have alternatives,"" he concludes.

New research reveals that ‚Äòmore' is not always better. Excess micronutrients in early pregnancy may increase the risks of gestational diabetes, urging a rethink on routine supplement use.

Study: Association between blood essential metal elements in early pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus. Image credit: StoryTime Studio/Shutterstock.com

Pregnant women must maintain balanced levels of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg) during early pregnancy to potentially reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A recent Frontiers in Nutrition study investigated the association between early pregnancy trace element levels, particularly Fe, Mg, copper (Cu), Zn, and calcium (Ca), and GDM onset.

GDM is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women who have previously had normal glucose metabolism. This condition presents multiple complications during the gestation period. A recent study indicated a surge in the global prevalence of GDM, which could be attributed to higher obesity among women of childbearing age.

GDM has both short-term and long-term effects on the mother and the offspring, including an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, premature delivery, macrosomia, and dystocia. Since the etiology of GDM is unclear, clinicians experience difficulties clinically diagnosing and treating these patients.

Genetic predispositions, social factors, and unhealthy lifestyles are common risk factors for GDM. In addition to gut microbial dysbiosis, an imbalance in essential metal element levels, including Fe, Ca, Zn, Cu, and Mg, could also increase the risk of GDM.

Essential metal elements are recommended as dietary supplements to promote pregnant women's normal physiological and metabolic functions. However, deficiency or excess of these elements could trigger inflammation and oxidative stress, affecting glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. These events may significantly increase the risk of GDM. Previous studies suggest that pancreatic Œ≤-cells are damaged through alterations in Cu homeostasis, which is associated with the onset of GDM. Furthermore, decreased Mg and Ca levels during specific pregnancy periods have been linked to impaired fasting glucose levels.

Although many studies have indicated a link between essential metal elements and GDM, there have been significant inconsistencies in study findings due to varied methodologies and limited sample sizes. Hence, further research is required to explain the precise relationship between essential metal element levels and GDM. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the synergistic effects of many essential metal elements on GDM.

The current study hypothesized that levels of essential metal elements during early pregnancy are associated with the onset of GDM. To test this hypothesis, five different metal elements were assessed in the blood of pregnant women in their first trimester, and individual effects linked to GDM were studied. It must be noted that during early pregnancy, women are typically exposed to higher levels of multiple essential metal elements through additional supplements and diet.

A total of 9,112 pregnant women who met the eligibility criteria were selected for this study. All eligible candidates were between 18 and 45 years of age with a singleton pregnancy. At baseline, an initial pregnancy examination was conducted, and relevant data, such as age, pre-pregnancy height and weight, last menstrual period, maternity history, and medical history of the pregnant women, were collected. During the second and third trimesters, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed in outpatient settings.

Participants were assigned to four groups based on the quartile of five essential metal elements. The risk of GDM at other quantile levels before and after adjusting for covariates was estimated, with the first quantile level as the reference. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to study the dose-response relationship.

The posterior inclusion probability (PIP) indicated the relative importance of each essential metal element. Weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) and quantile g-computation regression (QGC) models helped perform mixed exposure analysis. Essential metal concentrations were measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometry from whole blood samples.

The participants' average age was 30, and their body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy was approximately 20.79 kg/m¬≤. In this study cohort, 18.62% of pregnant women were diagnosed with GDM. Higher age, gravidity, parity, and pre-pregnancy BMI were identified as important factors that cause GDM development.

Compared to the non-GDM group, blood analysis revealed that pregnant women who developed GDM had higher levels of essential metal elements, particularly Fe, Cu, and Mg. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association between GDM and Fe and Mg, and a negative correlation between Fe and Ca.

After adjusting for BMI, age, parity, and gestational week, the regression model indicated positive correlations between Fe and Mg levels and the risk of GDM. No significant relationship was found between Cu or Ca and GDM.

Analysis by quartiles of essential metal elements revealed that higher quartile levels of Mg, Fe, and Zn were associated with increased risks of GDM. After adjustments, Zn was the only element that correlated positively with GDM risk. RCS analysis revealed a linear positive relationship between Mg (1.42 mmol/L), Fe (7.68 mmol/L), and Zn (87.75 Œºmol/L) levels and GDM risks. The highest PIP values of Fe indicated that it has the maximum influence on the combined action among all metal elements. No significant additive or multiplicative interactions between the metal elements were found.

The current study confirmed the association between essential metal elements and GDM risks. A higher concentration of Fe, Mg, and Zn in the first trimester of pregnancy correlated with an increased risk of developing GDM. The concentration of blood Fe levels could potentially be used as a biomarker for GDM risk.

However, the study was observational in nature and cannot establish causality.

The current study highlights the importance of consuming essential metal elements appropriately to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Given the complex dose-response relationships, both deficiency and excess may pose risks.

The study authors note that the World Health Organization (WHO) does not currently recommend routine supplementation of Zn and Mg, and Fe supplementation should be carefully considered, particularly for women without Fe deficiency anemia.

More research is required to better understand the collective impact of essential metal elements on GDM development.

New research reveals that what men eat, especially a Mediterranean diet or ultra-processed foods, can make a real difference to sperm quality and fertility potential.

Role of Mediterranean Diet and Ultra-Processed Foods on Sperm Parameters: Data from a Cross-Sectional Study. Image Credit: Maly Designer / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers in Italy evaluated the role of the Mediterranean diet (MD) and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) on sperm parameters.

Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after one year of regular, unprotected sex. It affects 15% to 25% of couples, or around 186 million individuals worldwide. Besides, male infertility is often multifactorial, involving genetic factors, lifestyle habits, environmental factors, and medical conditions. Lifestyle factors could negatively affect sperm parameters and overall reproductive health. Adherence to healthy diets, including MD, is associated with improved seminal parameters.

However, the associations between male fertility and UPFs are less well-defined. The optimal intake of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, particularly from food sources, plays a vital role in spermatogenesis. The MD adequately provides these oligo-nutrients. However, UPFs are industrially produced and contain ingredients not found in natural foods (e.g., additives, refined sugars). As such, UPFs lack essential vitamins, fiber, and minerals. UPFs also disproportionately derive calories from carbohydrates (mean 17.4% of total calories), compared to proteins (3.8%) or lipids (8.1%). Increasing literature also links UPF consumption to elevated risks of non-communicable diseases and cancer.

Importantly, while adherence to the MD has been linked to better semen parameters and reproductive capacity, high UPF intake may negatively affect sperm quality.

In the present study, researchers examined the role of MD and UPFs on sperm parameters. Participants were males aged 18‚Äì60 attending an Italian Hospital for semen analysis between September 2022 and April 2024. Semen was collected three to seven days after sexual abstinence; semen pH and volume, sperm concentration, cell viability and morphology, and total sperm count were evaluated.

Further, plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and testosterone were measured. The MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire evaluated MD adherence. UPF intake was assessed using the 24-hour Food Recall Questionnaire. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine differences between continuous variables, whereas Fisher's exact or chi-squared test was used for discrete variables.

Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlations between variables. Further, multivariate analyses compared semen parameters strongly associated with UPF intake and MEDAS scores. Logistic regression was performed to assess the associations between ordinal and continuous variables and sperm count ‚â• 39 million per ejaculate, and to estimate the corresponding odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The study also excluded individuals with conditions or behaviors known to affect fertility, such as those taking certain medications, those with chronic illnesses, or those engaging in high levels of physical activity (more than 3 hours per week).

Representative scheme summarizing the possible mechanistic influences of dietary patterns on spermatogenesis. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) likely has a direct positive effect on the different cell populations of the seminiferous tubules due to its composition rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and oligo-elements. In parallel, MD may positively influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by enhancing testis sensitivity to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or by reducing negative feedback at the central level. Ultra-processed food intake negatively influences testis function, both because it is inversely related to MD adherence and due to the reduced content of protective factors. Green and red arrows indicate, respectively, positive and negative effects.

The study included 358 males, with a mean age of 34.6 and body mass index (BMI) of 24.4 kg/m¬≤. The mean MEDAS score of the sample suggested average MD adherence. MEDAS scores had a significant positive correlation with seminal parameters and a negative correlation with percentage of calories from UPFs (%Kal-UP) and serum LH and FSH levels.

Conversely, %Kal-UP was negatively correlated with all seminal parameters. The MEDAS score and %Kal-UP were not associated with BMI or age, and the correlations between MEDAS or %Kal-UP and semen parameters remained significant after controlling for BMI and age, indicating that these associations are independent of these confounders. Sperm parameters were significantly different across categories of MD adherence, with mean values of total sperm count, progressive motility, sperm viability, and sperm concentration increasing with MD adherence. Meanwhile, FSH levels were lower in individuals with moderate or high MD adherence compared to those with low adherence.

Testosterone and SHBG levels did not differ significantly across MD adherence categories. Since discrete categories of UPFs were unavailable, an unbiased stratification was performed by increasing quartiles of %Kal-UP (Q1‚ÄìQ4). There was a significant decrease in mean values of total sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive motility, and percentage of sperm with typical morphology from Q1 to Q4.

Notably, individuals in the low MD adherence category and those in Q4 of %Kal-UP exhibited significantly lower values of sperm parameters compared to those in the high adherence category and Q1 of %Kal-UP. Furthermore, participants were stratified into two categories based on FSH levels: normal (<8 IU/mL) and high (>8 IU/mL) for the multivariate analysis.

Among participants with normal FSH levels, the mean values of total sperm count, sperm concentration, percentage of immotile cells, and percentage of progressive motile cells showed a significant decline with increasing quartiles of %Kal-UP. By contrast, individuals with high FSH levels showed no effects on these parameters by %Kal-UP quartiles.

A significant increase in total sperm count and concentration was noted with higher MD adherence, but only in individuals with normal FSH levels. Moderate and high MD adherence categories were associated with a significantly lower risk of low sperm count. On the other hand, Q3 and Q4 of %Kal-UP were associated with a significantly higher risk of total sperm count < 39 million per ejaculate. However, when high FSH levels (‚â•8 IU/mL, indicative of primary testicular impairment) were included in the analysis, FSH emerged as the dominant predictor of reduced sperm count, and dietary associations became less pronounced.

The authors note that the cross-sectional and observational nature of the study prevents any causal inference. Additionally, UPF intake was estimated from a single 24-hour recall, which can introduce error, and hormonal data were available only for a subset of participants. As a result, findings should be interpreted with caution and validated by further research.

In summary, the study demonstrated significant correlations between MD adherence and UPF intake and seminal parameters. The findings underscored an interplay between plasma FSH levels, MD adherence, UPF intake, and seminal parameters. With high FSH levels, reflecting primary testicular impairment, the dietary pattern had mild or null associations with seminal parameters.

Likewise, UPF intake had fewer associations with sperm parameters. In contrast, with normal FSH, suggestive of preserved testicular function, greater MD adherence was associated with a better seminal profile, while UPF intake showed an opposite association. These findings support the role of dietary interventions as potential modifiable risk factors for managing male infertility, particularly in men with preserved testicular function.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Pregnancy complications linked to higher long-term stroke risk in women","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250623/Pregnancy-complications-linked-to-higher-long-term-stroke-risk-in-women.aspx","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 02:33:00 GMT","

Women who experience complications during pregnancy face a higher risk of stroke in the following decades according to research published in the European Heart Journal today (Tuesday).

The study, which included data on more than two million women over more than 40 years, found an increased risk for women who had diabetes or high blood pressure while pregnant, a preterm delivery or a baby with a low birth weight.

Researchers say these common pregnancy complications could act as an early signal for cardiovascular problems in the future, meaning women could receive help early in life to lower their risk of stroke.

A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, starving brain cells of oxygen and leading to possible cognitive and physical disabilities.

The study was led by Professor Casey Crump from the Department of Family & Community Medicine at UTHealth Houston, USA. He said: ""We know that pregnancy is a 'natural stress test' that may reveal higher cardiovascular disease risks long before cardiovascular disease actually develops.

""Up to one-third of all pregnancies are affected by one of these complications. However, the long-term cardiovascular risks for these women remain poorly understood and so are often not considered in their routine clinical care.""

The researchers used data from a Swedish national cohort of all 2,201,393 singleton pregnancies between 1973 and 2015. Around 30% of the women (667,774) experienced at least one of the following complications: preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks), a baby born small for their gestational age (among the smallest 10%), high blood pressure during pregnancy including preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure) and pregnancy diabetes (high blood sugar).

Researchers also gathered data on which women went on to experience a stroke in the following years up to 2018 and compared rates of strokes between women who had pregnancy complications and women who did not.

The risk of stroke was almost doubled for women who had high blood pressure (not preeclampsia) or high blood sugar during pregnancy. For women who had a preterm delivery, the risk of stroke was around 40% higher, for women with preeclampsia, the risk was around 36% higher, and for women whose babies were born small for their gestational age, the risk was around 26% higher. Risks were even greater in women who experienced two or more of these complications.

The increased risks were generally highest in the first 10 years after delivery but continued throughout the women's lives even 30 to 46 years after pregnancy. However, for women who had pregnancy diabetes, the increased risk became even higher over time.

The researchers also compared the risk of stroke between sisters in the cohort, who share similar genetic and environmental risk factors for stroke, but they found that this did not fully account for the link between complications during pregnancy and the risk of stroke.

To our knowledge, this study is the largest ever to examine multiple pregnancy complications in relation to long-term stroke risks in the same cohort of women. Also, it is the first to assess whether families might share factors that predispose both to adverse pregnancy outcomes and stroke, but shared familial factors did not appear to explain our findings.

These pregnancy complications share some common features, including placental abnormalities and inflammation, that may potentially affect the structure or function of small blood vessels. Those changes in the small blood vessels sometimes progress further after pregnancy, and this could be one factor in the women's higher risk of stroke.

Both women and their doctors should now recognise that pregnancy complications are an early signal for future stroke risk. This can help us identify high-risk women long before they suffer a stroke or other cardiovascular disease. Women who experience these complications need support to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. These interventions should be implemented as early as possible, followed by long-term monitoring to reduce their stroke risk across the life course.""

Professor Casey Crump, Department of Family & Community Medicine, UTHealth Houston

In an accompanying editorial Dr. Abbi Lane from the University of Michigan, USA, said: ""Stroke is a major cause of death and disability that may be preceded by distinct risk factors in women vs. men. Understanding earlier life, sex-specific stroke risk factors can help identify high-risk individuals who can be targeted for preventive intervention. The study presented in this issue of European Heart Journal by Crump and colleagues addressed this critical need by rigorously defining the associations between adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and stroke. APOs were not rare; 30% of women had experienced at least one APO. All APOs were significantly associated with stroke over 46 years of follow-up [‚Ä¶].

""Perhaps more attention should be paid to the psychological and emotional toll associated with APOs. [‚Ä¶] Not only does the complicated pregnancy/birth itself cause stress, but the psychological and/or medical sequelae of the APO can last for months or years. [‚Ä¶] Managing medical and neurodevelopmental disorders can lead to months or years of emotional, logistical, and financial strain for parents.

""Effects of psychosocial stress may manifest to eventual stroke via two potentially overlapping pathways: direct physiological effects and poor coping behaviours. There are direct physiological

responses to stress that are also early events in the development of overt stroke risk factors. [‚Ä¶] High stress is linked to unfavourable effects on lifestyle and coping behaviours, including

smoking, worse medication adherence, poor diet, low physical activity, and higher body weight.

""Interrupting the cascade from APO to stroke might involve a multifaceted approach to control blood pressure and address modifiable lifestyle habits that influence physical and mental health soon after APOs.

""As APOs occur in ‚àº30% of parous people and stroke is ‚àº90% preventable, implementing a multicomponent, preventive intervention aimed at modifiable stroke risk factors soon after delivery seems like an obvious win.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Malaria protein plays dual role in immune evasion and activation","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250624/Malaria-protein-plays-dual-role-in-immune-evasion-and-activation.aspx","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 13:49:00 GMT","

Researchers from The University of Osaka find that a protein expressed on malaria-infected red blood cells both hides it from the immune system and activates cells to destroy it, making it a promising target for vaccine development.

Malaria is a life-threatening disease affecting people globally. It is spread by mosquitoes carrying Plasmodium parasites that infect and hide in red blood cells, making them difficult for the immune system to detect. Previous studies have shown that proteins expressed on the surface of malaria-infected red blood cells, known as repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) proteins, can bind to immune cell receptors to protect the parasite. However, some interactions with natural killer (NK) cells and their receptors remained unknown.

In a recent study published in Nature, researchers from The University of Osaka have identified RIFIN-binding KIRs that both suppress and activate NK activity, highlighting the dual function of these proteins in enabling parasite survival and host protection.

NK cells identify and eliminate abnormal or infected cells, which they do by recognizing molecules on the cell surface. These signals bind the receptors on NK cells, causing them to either suppress their activity or to destroy target cells. Some receptors, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), are found in pairs and have nearly identical target-binding domains, meaning that parasites and diseases could be 'sneaking past' the immune system and allowing malaria to thrive.

As inhibitory KIRs on NK cells are structurally similar to other inhibitory immune cell receptors that bind RIFINs, we wondered whether these KIR proteins would also interact with RIFINs on the surface of malaria-infected cells. If this were the case, it would allow us to identify a new method used by malaria to evade the immune system.""

Shiroh Iwanaga, corresponding author

To do this, the researchers first screened cells infected by certain strains of Plasmodium falciparum and found an interaction between KIR2DL1 - one type of an inhibitory KIR - and a RIFIN expressed in infected cells. Further testing and structural modeling showed that multiple RIFINs from related strains were able to interact with KIR2DL1, initiating signaling to inhibit NK cell activity.

""We found that RIFINs capable of binding this receptor were very common across different malaria strains from Southeast Asia and Africa, indicating that the ability to inhibit NK activity happens across the globe,"" explains Shiroh Iwanaga.

In a surprising twist and a global first, these RIFINs were also found to bind the activating KIR2DS1 receptor, which triggered NK cell activation to kill infected cells.

""Our findings suggest that RIFINs play two roles, both allowing the parasite to hide from the immune system as well as allowing the immune system to detect it,"" says Iwanaga. ""This dual role makes these KIR-binding RIFINs extremely promising targets for malaria treatment and prevention.""

Although there are several hundred million species of RIFINs, others with functions similar to those identified in this study are common among strains of malaria. This makes the RIFINs excellent targets for the development of new malaria treatments and vaccines to combat this deadly disease.

Endoscopies could be replaced by far less invasive capsule sponge tests for half of all patients with Barrett's esophagus, a known precursor to esophageal cancer, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital and Queen Mary University of London.

The capsule sponge test is easier to administer and could be carried out by nurses and at GP practices, reducing the burden on NHS resources.

Esophageal cancer is difficult to treat, with fewer than one in five patients surviving for five or more years following diagnosis, a figure that has barely changed over the past three decades. At the same time, the number of people diagnosed with the disease has increased four-fold since the 1970s.

One of the known risk factors for esophageal cancer is a condition known as Barrett's esophagus, characterised by changes in the shape and structure of cells in the lining of the food pipe (the esophagus). At first, these cells change to resemble those in the lining of the intestines, but over time they can change to a pre-cancerous state known as dysplasia.

Dysplasia may be low-grade or high-grade. Patients with low-grade dysplasia have around a one in 10 chance of developing esophageal cancer, but this risk doubles to one in five for high-grade dysplasia. Dysplasia can be treated without surgery, and treatment greatly reduces the risk of future cancer.

Barrett's esophagus is usually diagnosed after a patient reports symptoms such as persistent heartburn and receives an endoscopy, an invasive procedure that involves passing a camera down into the stomach. However, there are long waiting times for initial endoscopy investigations on the NHS.

Patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus will be monitored to look for dysplasia or early cancer, undergoing regular endoscopies ‚Äì often 10 or more over their lifetime. Catching the cancer early increases the chances of successful treatment and when the treatment can be performed down the endoscope as a day-case without requiring chemotherapy or an operation.

Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, Director of the Early Cancer Institute at the University of Cambridge and honorary consultant gastroenterologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital, who specializes in Barrett's esophagus, said: ""It's extremely important to monitor patients so that we can catch the dysplasia and prevent it developing to cancer ‚Äì and if someone is unfortunate enough to develop cancer, we can catch it early and treat it.

""But the chances of Barrett's progressing to cancer are low, and endoscopies are not very pleasant procedures. Added to that, endoscopies are not always a reliable way of spotting early cancers and can depend on the skill of the person doing the endoscopy and the equipment being used. What we need is an alternative surveillance method that's less invasive, easier to administer and more reliable.""

In recent years, Professor Fitzgerald and colleagues have developed the capsule sponge as an alternative to the endoscope. It involves the patient swallowing a pill connected to a thread. The pill dissolves in the stomach to release a sponge, which, when drawn back up, lightly scrapes off some of the cells in the esophagus.

Samples from the capsule test are stained with a chemical and examined under a microscope. Pathologists look for two key markers ‚Äì 'red flags' that suggest the cells are pre-cancerous. These are: abnormalities in a protein (known as p53) that helps to prevent tumours developing; and cells that appear abnormal or irregular when examined under a microscope ('atypia').

Most of the research to date on the capsule sponge has focussed on diagnosing Barrett's esophagus. But now, Professor Fitzgerald and her team have turned their attention to monitoring it more effectively with this device.

In research published today in The Lancet, Professor Fitzgerald and colleagues looked at whether it was possible to use the capsule sponge to stratify patients with Barrett's esophagus according to their risk and use this information to determine how they are monitored. Those at highest risk would be seen urgently to see if they need treatment and those at moderate risk would continue to receive endoscopies, but those at lowest risk could continue to be monitored without the need for another endoscopy.

The team recruited 910 patients from 13 hospitals across the UK, all of whom had been diagnosed previously with Barrett's esophagus, and who were undergoing surveillance.

The patients were administered the capsule test, and based on the result, were assigned to one of three groups: high risk, moderate risk, or low risk. All patients also received an endoscopy, and their capsule sponge results were compared with their endoscopy results.

Around 15% of patients were classed as high risk, meaning that they had abnormal p53 and/or atypia. 38% of these patients were found to be at a pre-cancerous stage. Patients with both markers were at the highest risk ‚Äì 85% of these patients were at a pre-cancerous stage.

Patients with neither of the two markers, but whose Barrett's esophagus was over a certain length and who met other risk factors related to age and sex, were classed as moderate risk.

Over half of the patients (54%) were classed as low risk. These were patients who had neither of the two markers and did not meet other risk factors related to age and sex. Endoscopy revealed that just two of these 495 patients ‚Äì 0.4% - had a high-grade dysplasia that needed follow-up (and there were no cancers).

Our findings suggest that the capsule sponge could help stratify patients with Barrett's esophagus by risk and that half of them will fall into the low-risk group. Given that the risk of these individuals progressing to dysplasia and then to esophageal cancer is so low, it should be safe to replace their usual endoscopy with the capsule sponge.""

Professor Peter Sasieni from the Cancer Research UK Cancer Prevention Trials Unit, Queen Mary University of London

First author Dr W. Keith Tan, Honorary Registrar in Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Addenbrooke's Hospital said: ""Our ability to identify patients at low versus high risk using the capsule sponge ‚Äì which may be as accurate as the current gold standard, endoscopy ‚Äì is a great step forward. The capsule sponge can be administered easily and quickly by nurses with only limited training required and will not need to take up precious endoscopy resources, which may be better for patients and more cost-effective for the NHS.""

Professor Fitzgerald, who is also a Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge added: ""We are very excited by these results, which could lead to a test that is much more accessible and less operator dependent to improve standards for monitoring for patients with Barrett's across the NHS and beyond.""

The study was supported by Cancer Research UK, Innovate UK, NHS England Cancer Alliance, and Medical Research Council, with infrastructure support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre.

Chief Executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell, said: ""Survival rates for esophageal cancer have remained unacceptably low for decades, with fewer than 20% of patients surviving for five or more years after diagnosis. Early detection is vital if we are to change this grim statistic.

""The Cancer Research UK‚Äìbacked capsule sponge represents one of the most promising breakthroughs in early detection we have seen to date. These new findings bring us closer to transforming the way we diagnose and ultimately treat this disease. If adopted widely, this innovative approach could spare significant numbers of people from discomfort and invasive endoscopies. By bringing this more accessible alternative into community care, we have the potential to save more lives.""

Duncan Cook, aged 57, a plumbing and heating engineer from Cambridge, participated in the research. For almost 20 years, Duncan has had regular endoscopies to monitor his Barrett's esophagus. He welcomed the results.

""I have a busy job and being able to have the sponge instead of an endoscopy would be much easier and save a lot of time.

""The first time I had the sponge, I was a bit nervous. It's quite a big pill to swallow, but it's much better than going for endoscopies. The sponge test is faster, you don't need sedation for it, and you don't need to find someone to come with you to drive you home after. I was able to have the test done and go right back to work after.""

The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, set to be built on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, will bring together clinical excellence from Addenbrooke's Hospital and world-leading researchers at the University of Cambridge, including Professor Fitzgerald's work, under one roof in a new NHS hospital. It will enable the development and discovery of more non-invasive devices like the capsule sponge, to detect cancer earlier, and save more lives.

HiMedia is dedicated to maintaining high safety, quality, and performance standards for in-vitro diagnostic products used in healthcare. This commitment significantly enhances the well-being of patients nationally and globally.

Since 2004, HiMedia Laboratories has adopted internationally recognized standards, specifically ISO 13485 Quality Management Systems, which meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for medical and in-vitro diagnostic devices.

HiMedia's certifications from WHO GMP, along with ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management Systems, ensure complete traceability of in-vitro diagnostic products throughout their lifecycle‚Äîfrom inception and development to realization and decommissioning.

In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (IVD products) are instruments and systems designed to diagnose, treat, or prevent medical conditions. They collect and analyze human biological samples, such as urine, feces, blood, saliva, body fluids, tissues, secretions, and swabs.

Samples can be obtained from the nose, throat, veins, or via a fingerstick.

It is essential to understand that IVD products are non-invasive. Nevertheless, they fall under the category of medical devices and are thus subject to the same regulatory controls. They are commonly referred to as IVD Kits, Reagents, or in-vitro diagnostic substances.

All in-vitro diagnostic kits/reagents are regulated in India under the Medical Devices Rules (2017) and Medical Devices Amendment (2020).

Manufacturing licenses are provided by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) under the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, and the Government of India.

Manufacturers of in-vitro diagnostics must meet the regulatory requirements of the destination country they want to penetrate and supply the products.

Although their purposes may be similar, they are regulated by their respective National authorities under the provisions of their acts/ regulations.

An intermediate legal entity and the authorized representative acts locally on behalf of a non-native supplier of IVD products.

Products are registered in different countries, fulfilling their medical device regulations. Himedia exports products in more than 150 countries.

If the results from IVD products are inaccurate, it can adversely affect patient health and present certain risks. To mitigate potential adverse events, IVD products are subject to regulation.

Risk levels associated with IVD products have been universally categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Low-risk, Moderate-risk, and High-risk, based on their potential impact on public health and the individual using the device.

IVDs are categorized based on the health risks they may pose, either to the public or to an individual, due to incorrect results.

Only SLA (State Licensing Authority) appoints Notified Bodies to carry out this activity. For Class A audit, FDA authorities or Notified Body on behalf of SLA may inspect plant for its approval.

For a non-European manufacturer, the European Authorized Representative is a liaison between the non-European manufacturer and the national competent authorities (Ministries of Health) who assist with medical device and IVD registrations, as required.



IVD are classified as Class A Non-sterile & Sterile, B, C, or D as per IVDR 2017/746 Risk-Based Classification Approach. Image Credit: Himedia Laboratories Private Limited

There will be no involvement of an Authorized representative for Class A sterile, B, C, or D risk class products. Devices are registered in EU and CE certificate is granted when the product has proven record of clinical safety and performance of the device.

Importers and manufacturers who have already filed the application to the Central Licensing Authority on or before 30 September 2023 can continue to import or manufacture the mentioned devices for a maximum of six months starting from the date of this order or until the Central Licensing Authority makes a decision on the applications, whichever comes first.

An extension period for IVD products other than Nonsterile Class A has been granted.

Gradual Roll out of EUDAMED, the new electronic database

There is no existing central safety database of in vitro diagnostic products in India accessible to the public. In contrast, the EU has the European Databank on Medical Devices (EUDAMED).

EUDAMED is the IT system developed by the European Commission to implement provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnosis medical devices.

EUDAMED is a new European system for medical devices that aims to assemble all aspects of registering, monitoring, and managing information about products among different industry actors.

EUDAMED comprises six modules: actor registration, unique device identification (UDI) and device registration, notified bodies and certificates, clinical investigations and performance studies, and vigilance and market surveillance.

Though timelines for product registrations are relaxed, IVD manufacturers and suppliers of IVD products to the EU are required to fulfil new rules.

EU Commission 2010/227 has enforced an electronic database, EUDAMED, wherein it is expected to:

Once up and running, EUDAMED will be able to act as a public registration system, a collaborative system, a notification system, and a dissemination system, and it will be interoperable with other existing and upcoming systems managed by the European Commission, EMA, and Member States.

Despite medical advances, infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses are still among the most common causes of death worldwide. What role could fructose play in such diseases? A research group led by Ina Bergheim from the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Vienna has now been able to prove for the first time that monocytes, important immune cells in the blood, react more strongly to bacterial toxins after fructose consumption - but not in a positive way. Specifically, the concentration of receptors for certain bacterial toxins increases, making the body more susceptible to inflammation. The study was recently published in the journal Redox Biology.

In two independent randomised studies with healthy adults, the researchers investigated how the consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages affects the immune response compared to beverages with glucose. In addition, they conducted experiments with isolated monocytes and cell culture models to investigate the molecular mechanisms.

The scientists were able to observe that the intake of fructose, in contrast to the intake of glucose, led to an increase in the concentration of Toll-like receptor 2 in monocytes. Toll-like receptor 2 regulates the immune response, among other things. The higher concentration was accompanied by an increased sensitivity of the monocytes to lipoteichoic acid, a bacterial toxin.

The concentration of receptors for such toxins in the body increased, which means that the inflammatory response increased.""

Ina Bergheim, study leader, University of Vienna

Specifically, pro-inflammatory messengers such as interleukin-6, interleukin-1Œ≤ and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were increasingly released.

""These findings make an important contribution to understanding how individual food components and fructose in particular can influence the immune system,"" says Bergheim. ""They indicate that even short-term, high fructose consumption in healthy people can influence the immune system and increase inflammation.""

Future studies should clarify the long-term effects of chronically increased fructose consumption on the immune system and susceptibility to infection, particularly in risk groups with, for example, type II diabetes mellitus or fatty liver disease, which is associated with metabolic dysfunction. ""Sugar, especially the fructose in sugary drinks and sweets, has long been suspected of increasing the risk of developing metabolic diseases - this needs to be investigated,"" says Bergheim.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Push to move OB-GYN exam out of Texas is piece of AGs' broader reproductive rights campaign","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250624/Push-to-move-OB-GYN-exam-out-of-Texas-is-piece-of-AGse28099-broader-reproductive-rights-campaign.aspx","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:15:00 GMT","

Democratic state attorneys general led by those from California, New York, and Massachusetts are pressuring medical professional groups to defend reproductive rights, including medication abortion, emergency abortions, and travel between states for health care in response to recent increases in the number of abortion bans.

The American Medical Association adopted a formal position June 9 recommending that medical certification exams be moved out of states with restrictive abortion policies or made virtual, after 20 attorneys general petitioned to protect physicians who fear legal repercussions because of their work. The petition focused on the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology's certification exams in Dallas, and the subsequent AMA recommendation was hailed as a win for Democrats trying to regain ground after the fall of Roe v. Wade.

""It seems incremental, but there are so many things that go into expanding and maintaining access to care,"" said Arneta Rogers, executive director of the Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice at the University of California-Berkeley's law school. ""We see AGs banding together, governors banding together, as advocates work on the ground. That feels somewhat more hopeful ‚Äî that people are thinking about a coordinated strategy.""

Since the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022, 16 states, including Texas, have implemented laws banning abortion almost entirely, and many of them impose criminal penalties on providers as well as options to sue doctors. More than 25 states restrict access to gender-affirming care for trans people, and six of them make it a felony to provide such care to youth.

That's raised concern among some physicians who fear being charged if they go to those states, even if their home state offers protection to provide reproductive and gender-affirming health care.

Pointing to the recent fining and indictment of a physician in New York who allegedly provided abortion pills to a woman in Texas and a teen in Louisiana, a coalition of physicians wrote in a letter to the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology that ‚Äúthe limits of shield laws are tenuous"" and that ""Texas laws can affect physicians practicing outside of the state as well.""

The campaign was launched by several Democratic attorneys general, including Rob Bonta of California, Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, and Letitia James of New York, who each have established a reproductive rights unit as a bulwark for their state following the Dobbs decision.

""Reproductive health care and gender-affirming care providers should not have to risk their safety or freedom just to advance in their medical careers,"" James said in a statement. ""Forcing providers to travel to states that have declared war on reproductive freedom and LGBTQ+ rights is as unnecessary as it is dangerous.""

In their petition, the attorneys general included a letter from Joseph Ottolenghi, medical director at Choices Women's Medical Center in New York City, who was denied his request to take the test remotely or outside of Texas. To be certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, physicians need to take the in-person exam at its testing facility in Dallas. The board completed construction of its new testing facility last year.

""As a New York practitioner, I have made every effort not to violate any other state's laws, but the outer contours of these draconian laws have not been tested or clarified by the courts,"" Ottolenghi wrote.

Rachel Rebouch√©, the dean of Temple University's law school and a reproductive law scholar, said ""putting the heft"" of the attorneys general behind this effort helps build awareness and a ""public reckoning"" on behalf of providers. Separately, some doctors have urged medical conferences to boycott states with abortion bans.

Anti-abortion groups, however, see the campaign as forcing providers to conform to abortion-rights views. Donna Harrison, an OB-GYN and the director of research at the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, described the petition as an ""attack not only on pro-life states but also on life-affirming medical professionals.""

Harrison said the ""OB-GYN community consists of physicians with values that are as diverse as our nation's state abortion laws,"" and that this diversity ""fosters a medical environment of debate and rigorous thought leading to advancements that ultimately serve our patients.""

The AMA's new policy urges specialty medical boards to host exams in states without restrictive abortion laws, offer the tests remotely, or provide exemptions for physicians. However, the decision to implement any changes to the administration of these exams is up to those boards. There is no deadline for a decision to be made.

The OB-GYN board did not respond to requests for comment, but after the public petition from the attorneys general criticizing it for refusing exam accommodations, the board said that in-person exams conducted at its national center in Dallas ""provide the most equitable, fair, secure, and standardized assessment.""

The OB-GYN board emphasized that Texas' laws apply to doctors licensed in Texas and to medical care within Texas, specifically. And it noted that its exam dates are kept under wraps, and that there have been ""no incidents of harm to candidates or examiners across thousands of in-person examinations.""

Democratic state prosecutors, however, warned in their petition that the ""web of confusing and punitive state-based restrictions creates a legal minefield for medical providers."" Texas is among the states that have banned doctors from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth, and it has reportedly made efforts to get records from medical facilities and professionals in other states who may have provided that type of care to Texans.

The Texas attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment.

States such as California and New York have laws to block doctors from being extradited under other states' laws and to prevent sharing evidence against them. But instances that require leveraging these laws could still mean lengthy legal proceedings.

""We live in a moment where we've seen actions by executive bodies that don't necessarily square with what we thought the rules provided,"" Rebouch√© said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New PET radiotracer offers clearer view of brain inflammation","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250624/New-PET-radiotracer-offers-clearer-view-of-brain-inflammation.aspx","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 04:19:00 GMT","

A newly developed PET radiotracer has shown the ability to produce high-quality images of real-time brain inflammation, according to research presented at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2025 Annual Meeting. By identifying activated immune cells in the brain, the tracer may pave the way for earlier diagnosis and more personalized treatment of a range of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and multiple sclerosis.

Neuroinflammation-an immune response triggered by infection, toxin buildup, or injury in the central nervous system-is a key driver in the progression of many neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Imaging neuroinflammation plays a critical role in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment.

Current clinical PET imaging for neuroinflammation primarily uses tracers that target TSPO, a downstream marker that is broadly expressed across multiple cell types. Our study presents ¬π‚Å∏F-PDE-1905, a novel PET tracer specifically developed to target phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B)-a crucial intracellular enzyme that regulates inflammatory signaling within microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system.""

Jiahui Chen, PhD, associate scientist in the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia

Researchers began by analyzing a genomics database to assess PDE4B expression in neuroinflammatory diseases using bioinformatics tools. They then developed a mouse model of neuroinflammation and performed dynamic PET imaging using the ¬π‚Å∏F-PDE-1905 alongside the TSPO-specific tracer ¬π‚Å∏F-D2-LW223. Follow-up analyses were conducted to evaluate protein expression and confirm its correlation with the PET imaging findings.

Bioinformatics analysis revealed elevated PDE4B levels in both Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis patients, as well as in corresponding mouse models. PET imaging showed significantly higher uptake of ¬π‚Å∏F-PDE-1905 in the brains of diseased mice compared to controls, indicating increased tracer activity in neuroinflammatory conditions. When compared to the TSPO-specific tracer ¬π‚Å∏F-D2-LW223, ¬π‚Å∏F-PDE-1905 demonstrated superior image quality and greater brain distribution, underscoring its promise for imaging neuroinflammation.

""By directly targeting PDE4B, ¬π‚Å∏F-PDE-1905 provides a more specific and upstream view of microglial activation-an early and critical factor in the progression of many neurological diseases,"" said Chen. ""For patients, this could mean earlier and more accurate diagnoses, better tracking of treatment effectiveness, and more personalized therapies based on direct measures of neuroinflammation. Ultimately, ¬π‚Å∏F-PDE-1905 has the potential to drive a major shift toward precision-guided care in neurodegenerative disorders.""

Published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, a University of Minnesota research team demonstrated that measuring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater continues to accurately predict COVID-19 infections in a community. 

Between January 2022 and August 2024, the research team examined the correlation between symptomatic COVID-19 in healthcare employees and levels of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - in wastewater. They found that SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater accurately predicted subsequent COVID-19 case counts the following week in the community.

We learned during 2020 that rising SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater provided a two week heads up of coming COVID visits to hospitals and clinics. This ongoing work demonstrates the continued importance of wastewater surveillance to public health planning for our state's hospitals and clinics.""

Timothy Shacker, MD, professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and an infectious disease physician with M Health Fairview

The University of Minnesota continues to monitor COVID-19, influenza, RSV, mpox and measles in the wastewater through its Wastewater Surveillance Study. The research team suggests that future work focuses on integrating wastewater surveillance with other epidemiological data sources to develop real-time decision-making frameworks that support public health responses to emerging outbreaks.

This work was supported through a contract with the Minnesota Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A new clinical trial found that taking a popular diabetes and weight-loss drug once weekly significantly improves blood sugar and leads to substantial weight loss in adults with Type 1 diabetes who use automated insulin delivery systems.

The results were published today in the journal NEJM Evidence.

Semaglutide is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor agonists. Sold under the trade names such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus, the drug was initially developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, helping to manage blood sugar levels.

The 26-week, double-blind study involved 72 participants across four medical centers, including Oregon Health & Science University. Researchers found that 36% of patients taking semaglutide met all three key health goals - improved blood glucose levels, reduced time spent in low blood sugar and at least 5% weight loss - compared to none in the placebo group.

Semaglutide helped more people reach their blood sugar and weight goals without decreasing blood sugar.""

Andrew Ahmann, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University's School of Medicine, and co-author on the study

Those on semaglutide lost an average of about 18.5 pounds over six months in the study and saw modest improvements in average blood sugar levels (A1C) and the amount of time blood sugar stays in a healthy range, without a higher risk of dangerous low blood sugar or serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis.

While semaglutide is already approved for Type 2 diabetes and obesity, its use in Type 1 diabetes remains investigational. This is the first randomized clinical trial to show that the medication may also be effective in Type 1 diabetes in patients already using automated insulin delivery.

Viral Shah, M.D., of the Indiana University School of Medicine, is senior author on the study. In addition to Shah and Ahmann, other co-authors include Halis Akturk, M.D. and Janet Snell-Bergeon, Ph.D., of University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Davida Kruger, D.N.P., M.D., of Henry Ford Health, Anuj Bhargava, M.D., of Iowa Diabetes Research, Giorgos Bakoyannis, Ph.D., of Indiana University School of Medicine, and Laura Pyle, Ph.D., of the University of Washington.

The research reported in this publication was supported by Breakthrough T1D, Clinicaltrials.gov number NCT05537233.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Diabetes drug semaglutide shows promise in reducing dementia risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250624/Diabetes-drug-semaglutide-shows-promise-in-reducing-dementia-risk.aspx","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:51:00 GMT","

Researchers at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine have found that semaglutide, a popular diabetes and weight-loss drug, may lower the risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Dementia, a condition that slowly makes it harder for people to remember things and think clearly, occurs when brain cells are damaged and their connections stop working properly. This damage, which worsens over time, can be caused by various modifiable factors, including obesity, T2D, cardiovascular diseases, traumatic brain injury and stroke.

According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 6 million people in the United States are diagnosed with dementia, and it causes more than 100,000 deaths each year. Encouragingly, research indicates that 45% of dementia cases could be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors.

The study, published today in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (DOI 10.1177/13872877251351329), suggests T2D patients taking semaglutide had a significantly lower risk of developing dementia compared to other antidiabetic medications. These results were more profound in women and older adults.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLP-1R) molecule that decreases hunger and helps regulate blood sugar in T2D, is also the active component in the diabetes and weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Semaglutide has shown a broad range of benefits, including reductions in cardiovascular diseases.

The research team-led by biomedical informatics professor Rong Xu-analyzed three years of electronic records of nearly 1.7 million T2D patients nationally. The researchers used a statistical approach that mimics a randomized clinical trial.

They found patients prescribed semaglutide had a significantly lower risk for Alzheimer's disease-related dementia, compared to those who had taken any of seven other anti-diabetic medications, including other types of GLP-1R-targeting medications.

""There is no cure or effective treatment for dementia, so this new study provides real-world evidence for its potential impact on preventing or slowing dementia development among at-high risk population,"" said Xu, who also directs the School of Medicine's Center for AI in Drug Discovery and is a member of the Cancer Genomics Epigenomics Program at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Although their findings potentially support the idea that semaglutide could prevent dementia, the study's limitations restrict the researchers from making firm causal conclusions, she said.

Our results indicate that research into semaglutide's use for dementia prevention will need to be further investigated through randomized clinical trials.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","24 Players Named for U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp to Run Concurrently with USWNT's Denver Leg of Upcoming FIFA Window","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/06/24-players-named-us-under-23-womens-national-team-training-camp-uswnt-denver-fifa-window","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:23:05 GMT","

ATLANTA (June 20, 2025) ‚Äì Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp in Commerce City, Colorado that will run from June 23-July 2. From June 23-June 26, the camp will run concurrently with the U.S. Women's National Team so U.S. head coach Emma Hayes and her staff can observe trainings. The U-23s will also attend the USA vs. Ireland match on June 26 at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park. The U-23s will stay in Denver to train after the USWNT leaves for Cincinnati and then Washington, D.C. to finish its slate of matches.

The U.S. U-23s are coming off a pair of games in late May and early June in Germany where it split matches with its German counterparts as each team won one game by a 2-1 score. Nine players on the roster for Colorado were in Germany, but four additional players who were with the U-23s last month ‚Äì goalkeeper Angelina Anderson, defenders Jordyn Bugg and Lilly Reale and midfielder Sam Meza -- will be with the senior USWNT in Colorado.

The U-23 programming in Colorado is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team.

‚ÄúPlayers from the Futures Camp in January and the two U-23 camps this year, in LA and Germany, are now getting senior team call-ups and that's what we want to see,‚Äù said Hayes. ‚ÄúIt doesn't mean that some of these players won't be in with the 23s down the line, or that some U-23 players who haven't been called up yet to the full team won't get their chances, but this is the kind of symbiosis we want between programs. We want to do what's best for the players to give them National Team exposures so they are as prepared as possible for '27, '28 and even '31.‚Äù

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. ‚Äì After six years, Olympian and prominent U.S. Women's National Team defender, Ally Hammel (Duxbury, Mass.), has officially announced her retirement. The 28-year-old competed in 80 international matches for Team USA.

The Duxbury, Mass. native started playing field hockey in the 7th grade when her mother, who played collegiately at the University of Connecticut, started a club in the South Shore area of Massachusetts. Hammel played other sports growing up, including soccer, lacrosse, and ice hockey, and found field hockey was the perfect cross between soccer and ice hockey. From when she was first introduced, she enjoyed playing and was always excited to show up to training.

Hammel attended Duxbury High School and Loomis Chaffee School, where she earned Patriot League All-Star honors in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and helped the team claim three league titles. She was a 2013 Boston Herald and Patriot Ledger All-Scholastic selection and named to the 2014 NFHCA All-American Third Team. She played for HTC Field Hockey club team.

In 2013, Hammel got involved in the Olympic Development Pathway when she first joined Futures (now Nexus).

Hammel played collegiately at Boston University (2015-2018), where she was the first player in program history to be a two-time NFHCA First Team All-American (2017, 2018), in addition to winning back-to-back NFHCA Northeast Region Player of the Year (2017, 2018) and Patriot League Defensive Player of the Year (2017, 2018). She was a unanimous selection to the All Patriot League First Team (2017, 2018), named the 2018 Patriot League Championship Most Outstanding Player, and named to the All-Tournament Team (2017, 2018).

From 2016 to 2019, Hammel participated in High Performance Centers in the north region and was selected to the U-21 or Development Junior National Camps and Young Women's National Championship all four years. In 2018 and 2019, she was named to the U.S. Women's National Development Team and went on a tour to Chile and Holland.

In May 2019, Hammel was named to the senior U.S. Women's National Team and on February 7, 2020, played in her first cap against Argentina in the FIH Hockey Pro League. She competed in three editions of the League through the 2023-24 season, only missing four of the team's 48 matches. An integral part of the United Eagles defense, she was the squad that earned fourth at the 2022 Pan American Cup and was a key individual in the relocation of the USWNT to Charlotte, N.C.

Although often part of the attacking penalty corner unit, Hammel also recorded handful of defensive saves ‚Äì especially in key moments. One of those came in the battle against Argentina in the 2023 Pan American Games final, where the close 1-2 contest earned them a silver medal and qualifier spot. The most notable was at the 2024 FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifier against Japan in a must-win game with a spot to Paris 2024 on the line, when she had solid post play to help USA secure the 2-1 win.

In June 2024, Hammel was named to the U.S. Olympic Women's National Team roster to represent USA at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Years of dedication and sacrifices paid off.

‚ÄúBeing part of Team USA is an experience that's tough to put into words,‚Äù commented Hammel. ‚ÄúCompeting for the United States against the world's top players and teams was an incredible honor. The countless hours of unseen effort and the challenging moments that made us question our commitment and what it truly meant to dedicate ourselves to our shared goal were all worth it the moment we pulled on that jersey. While there were certainly some challenging times, the highs made every low worthwhile. There's truly nothing else like it!‚Äù

Hammel notes a handful of memorable highlights throughout her career. Among them are earning her first international cap against Argentina, and getting the opportunity to play against several former Boston University teammates, including Gunsom (NZL) in the FIH Hockey Pro League, Valentina Cerde Eimbcke (CHI) at the 2022 Pan American Cup and Sofi Laurito (ITA) at the 2024 FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifier.

‚ÄúI would have to say winning a silver medal at the 2023 Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, and knowing we had a great opportunity in front of us to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,‚Äù added Hammel.

‚ÄúPlaying in an Olympic Qualifier in one of the most passionate hockey countries in the world (India) as well as hearing the final horn against Japan and realizing we did the unthinkable and qualified for the Paris ‚Äì it's unforgettable.‚Äù

For most athletes, being selected to represent their country on the Olympic stage is the pinnacle of sport. ‚ÄúSeeing my name on the selection roster to represent the United States of America at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games as well as stepping foot on the pitch, singing the National Anthem and becoming an Olympian ‚Äì it will forever be a moment ingrained in my career highlights.‚Äù

Hammel's final international competition was helping USA to a fourth-place finish at the 2025 FIH Hockey Nations Cup in Santiago, Chile. She retires having competed in 80 international senior matches.

Hammel has an extensive list of those she would like to thank who have impacted her career. First off, she wants to express her heartfelt gratitude to her parents, Jenn and Dave, her fianc√© Travis, her brothers Matt and Jon, and all her extended family and friends. She notes that their unwavering support is what was her anchor through the highs and low of professional sport.

‚ÄúI would like to express my sincere thanks to the coaches who have shaped my journey. From my club field hockey coaches, Deb Brickey and Darren Smallhorn, to my high school mentors, Pam Manley and Terry Vandewater, each of you laid the foundation for my growth. At Boston University, Sally Starr, Tracey Paul, and Sarah Shute pushed my ability and guided me to be the best version of myself both on and off the pitch. My Development Squad coaches - Jun Kentwell, Mark Atherton, Marc Hardy, and Roz Ellis - provided invaluable guidance and support at pivotal moments in my career.‚Äù

Hammel added, she would like to thank Longstreth Sporting Goods and Grays Hockey for sponsoring her throughout her time on the USWNT.

‚ÄúI am deeply grateful to the coaches and support staff who have been integral to my journey with the U.S. Women's National Team. A special thank you to Janneke Schopman who believed in my ability and gave me the opportunity to join the senior team. To David Williamson, Anthony Farry, Greg Drake, David Passmore, Javi Telechea, Tracey Fuchs, Maddie Hinch and Bert Remmerswaal - your guidance, encouragement, and belief in me have been invaluable. Each of you has played a significant role in my development, and you all hold a very special place in my heart‚Äù

Finally, Hammel would like to thank all her Team USA teammates. She expressed that all have impacted her career ‚Äì big and small ‚Äì and that she is grateful for the experiences shared, lessons learned, and growth made together. She is excited to see the future of the USWNT and looks toward the continued fight to represent the United States.

‚ÄúAlly has been a member of the squad and integral in our development over the past few years providing solidity to our defense through the Olympic qualification process and in Paris,‚Äù said David Passmore, USWNT Head Coach. ‚ÄúWhile pleased for Ally that she has made a decision she is happy with, she will be missed for her composure, calm head, and leadership in the Paris cycle having converted from a forward at college to a defender internationally. She led a young inexperienced group in New Zealand and Chile and has been integral in the young players settling into the squad and understanding our processes and tactics. On behalf of the whole team we wish Ally and her fianc√© Travis the very best for their future.‚Äù

Hammel has a USA Field Hockey Level 1 Coaching Certification. She coached at HTC Field Hockey from 2012 through 2020 and has been Coaching Director, Recruiting Coordinator and Head Coach at DELTA Field Hockey since the summer of 2023.

She was recently named the assistant coach at Penn State University, and she, Travis, and their dog, Harper, will be making the move to Happy Valley.

‚ÄúStepping away from playing the sport you love is always difficult, but I feel very grateful to have the opportunity to further my field hockey knowledge and give back to the community that has given me so much!

ATLANTA ‚Äî Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team training camp to be held from June 24 ‚Äì July 1 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.

The upcoming camp functions as part of the Federation's U.S. Way philosophy which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the full U.S. Women's National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

This roster is made up of players who were born in 2005 and were not part of the team that competed at the 2025 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship in Costa Rica. As players born in 2005 are too old for the next FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2026, this training camp serves as an opportunity for them to continue developing within U.S. WNT programs with hopes of moving along the pathway to U.S. U-23 WNT and beyond.

University of New Mexico assistant coach Karley Nelson will run the camp. Nelson was on the coaching staff for the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup Team that finished third in the tournament.

Seven players on this roster have played for the USA in a FIFA Youth Women's World Cup: Valentina Amaral, Mia Bhuta, Charlotte Kohler, Melina Rebimbas, Victoria Safradin, Sammy Smith and Taylor Suarez. Suarez also competed at the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Colombia.

Midfielder Amy Lopez, a Dallas, Texas native, is the only professional on the roster as she plays in Liga MX Femenil for Chivas de Guadalajara.

The squad features 17 players from the U-20 WNT's training camp in May, and 17 colleges are represented. Ohio State, TCU, and Virginia each have two players on the roster, and Stanford has four: Smith, Bhuta, midfielder Shae Harvey Kohler. Harvey also represented the USA at Concacaf World Cup Qualifiers for the U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team in 2022.

Goalkeepers (3): Valentina Amaral (Wake Forest; Oviedo, Fla.), Cecilia Cerone (Princeton; Dallas, Texas), Victoria Safradin (Virginia; Eastlake, Ohio)

Defenders (7): Hailey Baumann (Wisconsin; South Lyon, Mich.), Kennedy Bell (Maryland; Charlotte, N.C.), Ava Bramblett (Ohio State; Noblesville, Ind.), Bella Gaetino (UNC; Dexter, Mich.), Cameron Patton (TCU; Austin, Texas), Sammy Smith (Stanford; Boise, Idaho), Kaelyn Wolfe (Penn State; West Chester, Pa.)

Midfielders (8): Mia Bhuta (Stanford; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Ella Carter (Virginia; Leesburg, Va.), Shae Harvey (Stanford; Hermosa Beach, Calif.), Amy Lopez (Chivas de Guadalajara; Dallas, Texas), Isabella Najera (Michigan State; St. Charles, Ill.), Melina Rebimbas (Alabama; Warren, N.J.), Kiera Staude (Georgia; Atlanta, Ga.), Taylor Suarez (Florida State; Charlote, N.C.)

Forwards (6): Katie Collins (South Carolina; Gallatin, Tenn.), Isabella Diorio (TCU; Homer Glen, Ill.), Faith George (USC; Laguna Hills, Calif.), Charlotte Kohler (Stanford; Woodside, Calif.), Amanda Schlueter (Ohio State; Union, Ky.), Olivia Woodson (Auburn; Richmond, Va.)

Find out how to tune into the USWNT's double header against the Republic of Ireland this month, before taking on Canada in July.

The United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) returns to action on Thursday, 26 June.

To see out the month, they will take on the Republic of Ireland twice, before meeting familiar foes Canada at the start of July.

Emma Hayes's roster does not include any Europe-based players, who will be getting well-earned rest following gruelling seasons with their respective clubs. Defender Naomi Girma is the only exception, having only recently returned to action following injury woes.

It is another chance for the USWNT head coach to select less experienced players, with more potential debutants called up to the 25-woman squad.

‚ÄúWe want to continue to improve our understanding of how we want to play and widen the player pool, and those are some of the key goals of this three-game window,‚Äù Hayes said.

‚ÄúOn this roster, we have players with a varied amount of experience, and my priority is to deepen the exposures required for international soccer.

‚ÄúThese are three challenging matches and as always, we want to win, but also to make sure we are ready for the next steps.‚Äù

The US men's national team continue their quest for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup crown on Sunday when facing Group B runner-up Costa Rica in the quarterfinals.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's roster includes 15 MLS players, giving veterans and rising stars alike the opportunity to impress. The 2025 Gold Cup serves as the program's last tournament preparation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the US will co-host alongside Canada and Mexico.

The USMNT rebounded from a four-match winless streak heading into the tournament and have won three in a row in their quest for an eighth Gold Cup title. Only Mexico (nine) have won more.

While it wasn't all smooth sailing, the USMNT won three straight matches to top Group D. Following a 5-0 victory over Trinidad & Tobago, Pochettino's side grinded out a pair of one-goal wins against Saudi Arabia and Haiti.

Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang has scored twice, including the match-winner against Haiti. He's second on the team in goals scored behind Malik Tillman (three).

New York City FC goalkeeper Matt Freese has conceded just once, while right back Alex Freeman (Orlando City) has started every match. Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake) and Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps FC) continue to impress in midfield.

Costa Rica narrowly finished second in Group A ‚Äì a single goal separating them from first-place Mexico after the sides played to a 0-0 draw.

Miguel Herrera's side opened the tournament with a wild 4-3 victory over Suriname; a Manfred Ugalde penalty kick in second-half stoppage time was the difference. The Ticos then overcame the Dominican Republic, 2-1, with Ugalde again converting from the spot ‚Äì his third PK of the tournament ‚Äì and Josimar Alc√≥cer scoring the winner five minutes from full time.

New York City FC forward Alonso Mart√≠nez has also scored and started each match, while Ariel Lassiter (Portland Timbers) made one substitute appearance before reportedly fracturing his hand.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

ByMichael Lewis,

 Contributor. 

In the U.S. men's national team's seemingly endless search for a No. 9 - aka a striker - the Americans hope they have found one in Patrick Agyemang.

It's not just because he has scored five goals in nine appearances since making his international debut in January. It is also the way he performs on the pitch. He is hungry going forward and to score.

Agyemang, 24, doesn't wait for the ball to be passed to him at his feet in the penalty area. He tries to make things happen, whether he is using his speed, soccer IQ or physicality.

Case in point:

In the USA's 2-1 victory over Haiti in its Group D finale in the Concacaf Gold Cup on Sunday, June 22, Agyemang was denied by goalkeeper John Placide in the 24th minute.

In soccer, it is sometimes better to have amnesia and forget about the past and worry about the future.

In the 75th minute, Agyemang had another opportunity. He latched onto a long feed from left back John Tolkin on the left flank. He raced into the penalty area and pulled Placide out of the net. Instead of ramming the ball into the empty goal, he put just enough momentum on it to roll safely into the lower right corner for what proved to be the game-winner and his second goal of the tournament.

‚ÄúMe and John, we talked about that pass,‚Äù Agyemang told FOX Sports afterwards. ‚ÄúHe played the ball perfectly for me. Once I saw the keeper come on, compose yourself, take your time and around the goalkeeper, and once I got there, just finished.‚Äù

According to OptaJack, Agyemang has scored five goals in his first nine international appearances, tying him Jozy Altidore for the sixth-fewest games needed to score five times for the USMNT.

""Patrick is doing a fantastic job for the team,"" USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said at the post-game press conference. ""All that he gave to the team today and the previous games also, he's a fantastic striker. Still room to improve, but we are so happy with him.""

Agyemang (pronounced Aaw-jee-mawn) has a great feel-good backstory, taking a path that not many national team players have followed.

The son of Ghanaian parents, he began his college career at a Division III school - Eastern Connecticut State University. Most high-profile players will attend Division I schools right off the bat, climb through a club's academy or go to Europe at a relatively young age.

The 6-foot-4, 196-lb. striker recorded 30 goals and added 10 assists in his first two seasons at Eastern Connecticut, while earning D-III All-American honors. He also was named Little East Conference player of the year as a sophomore. Agyemang transferred to the University of Rhode Island (Division I) and connected for 19 goals and 12 assists in his final two seasons as he wound up on the MAC Hermann Award Watch List.

He was chosen by Charlotte FC as the 12th overall selection of the 2023 MLS SuperDraft. Not seeing much time with the first team (182 minutes total) as a rookie, Agyemang scored 10 goals in only a dozen matches for Crown Legacy FC (MLS NEXT Pro).

With some seasoning and a year of professional soccer under his left, Agyemang enjoyed a breakout sophomore season in 2024, pacing Charlotte FC with 10 goals. Not many MLS teams can say that their top goal-scorer is a U.S. citizen.

Agyemang's production caught the eye of Pochettino, who called him into January camp and for a pair of international friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica. He acquitted himself well, scoring once in each of those contests.

In his debut match against Venezuela on Jan. 18, Agyemang demonstrated how lethal he can be. A pass from Matko Miljevic was deflected into his path on the left flank.

‚ÄúOnce that ball breaks through, I'm like 1 v 1. My best position,‚Äù Agyemang said. ‚ÄúI love it. I see the keeper come on. I step into it. I love getting the shot off my left foot. And I knew I was confident to strike it through.""

And into the back of the net in the 39th minute.

‚ÄúI don't think many defenders like running with me, and I take advantage of it,"" he added.

Four days later on Jan. 22, Agyemang came off the bench to give the Americans some 90th-minute insurance in a 2-0 win over Costa Rica in Orlando, Fla. He became the 12th player to score in both of his first two USMNT caps, and the first since Ricardo Pepi in 2021.

Agyemang and his teammates will face the Costa Ricans again, this time in Minneapolis in the Concacaf Gold quarterfinals on Sunday, June 29. This encounter, however, won't just a friendly but in the quarterfinals of the Concacaf Gold Cup.

‚ÄúThe Gold Cup is a tough tournament,‚Äù Agyemang told FOX Sports. ‚ÄúI think with our squad we know our quality, and as long as we put the effort and the heart into it, we let our play show.‚Äù

Agyemang is far from perfect. He has struggled holding onto the ball and his passing isn't always spot on, which is important for someone with his height who also can be a target payer. So, he still has some work to do.

The bottom line, however, for a striker is the top line of the scoreboard, a in putting the ball into the back of the net.

The USMNT hasn't had two players who can put the ball away on a consistent basis since the Landon Donovan-Clint Dempsey era of more than a decade ago. They finished their national team careers with 57 goals apiece.

Strikers and forwards, especially on the USMNT, can come and go, and run hot and cold, whether it is through injury, form or a coach's preference. Their prime-time years usually run from 22 to 30, although there are exceptions of the age spectrum (see Lionel Messi, who turned 38 on Tuesday, June 24, and Cristiano Ronaldo, 40, as two prime examples).

As we have learned this year, strikers can live a fragile existence.

Here are just five recent examples of their rollercoaster life:

* Ricardo Pepi, 22, who has turned into a lethal presence for PSV Eindhoven (17 goals in 28 matches across all competitions. He was an obvious choice to play this summer but was sidelined with a serious knee injury in January. He hasn't played since.

* Folarin Balogun, 23, was selected to the Gold Cup roster, but had to be pulled due to an ankle injury. He missed two months with a dislocated shoulder while performing for Monaco in French Ligue 1.

* Josh Sargent, 25, who has filled the net for Norwich City in the English Championship (he tallied 15 goals this season), hasn't scored for the national team since a 4-0 win over Cuba in 2019. He didn't do much in the Concacaf Nations League in March and was left off the Gold Cup roster by head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

* Haji Wright, 27, who connected for a goal at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, has an Achilles injury and he was sent home during the tournament. His next game will be for Coventry City later this summer.

* Damion Downs, 20, also incurred an injury during the tournament and wasn't available as a substitute in the Haiti match. He competes for FC K√∂ln in the Budesliga.

Christian Pulisic, who is not playing in the Gold Cup, is a forward and the team's best attacking option. The A.C. Milan standout is much better suited as a player, not a target man, who can run at the opposition and set up teammates for assists or score goals himself.

Besides, the more options Pochettino or any national team has up front, the better.

To borrow a baseball phrase about pitching, you can never have enough dangerous forwards on your roster.

On June 24, 2025, it is difficult to predict whether Agyemang, or any other No. 9 will be on the USMNT roster for next year's World Cup.

It likely will come down to whether they are fit and in form, healthy and whether Pochettino feels like he is best suited for the team.

So far, so very good for the Charlotte FC forward.

If Patrick Agyemang can stay healthy, keep up his production for club and country and improve and hone his skills through the next year, we just might see him on the U.S. roster for the 2026 World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

The decision was largely down to a 4  1/2 month sabbatical that Donovan took from soccer ranging from the end of 2012 through March of 2013.   It was a decision that Donovan openly disagreed with and, on the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer, the former 4-time U.S. Men's Player of the Year was asked if him and Klinsmann ever attempted to resolve their differences over the disagreement.

‚ÄúAt the end of 2014 ‚Äì October 10th... 10/10, ironically - I had a sendoff game in Hartford with U.S. Soccer,‚Äù said Donovan.  ‚ÄúWhen I got there, J√ºrgen and I sat in a bar and we just talked.



""We said our piece and I didn't agree and, you know, he thought he was doing what was best for the team and whatever. And then he said at one point - this was really interesting - he's like, ‚Äòyou know, and I journaled everything that happened during all of this time. And I kept notes on everything that happened and I'm happy to show you.' And I was like, huh? It was really interesting.  The takeaway was, he knew what he was doing. It was very calculated. And he was making sure he took notes because he either had to justify it to somebody, or he felt like he, you know... you only take notes with things or keep recordings of things when you're kind of scared about what the outcome could be. So it was interesting.‚Äù

Adding to the tension following Klinsmann's decision in 2014 was a tweet posted by his son, Jonathan, who at the time was a goalkeeper on the USMNT's under-18 team which read ‚ÄúHAHAHAHAHAHAH DONOVAN HAHAHAHAA I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE UNTIL MY PHONE NOTIFIED ME'' followed by four laughing emojis and an additional ''HAHA.''  Donovan noted that J√ºrgen brought this up during their meeting.

‚ÄúI give [J√ºrgen] credit for sitting down.  He also, you know, apologized for his son being obnoxious during that time.  And then look, my choices were, on the field when I got subbed off - I think it was the 40th minute or so - I was still upset with him. I still, you know, I didn't want to give him any time, but you also don't want to make a bigger deal out of it. And so we had like one final handshake and that was that.‚Äù

Donovan's former USMNT teammate and current co-host on Unfiltered Soccer, Tim Howard, has been an outspoken critic of Klinsmann's time as U.S. Head Coach.  He took exception with Klinsmann's claim that he believed he was doing what was best for the team.

‚ÄúIn a decision where a legendary player who still has so much to offer that team going into a major tournament could never, ever be making a decision - let me quote him ‚Äì ‚Äòthat's best for the team,' without asking the senior players on that team for their opinion,‚Äù said Howard.  ‚ÄúSo, you can read between the lines, but you won't have to. The senior players on that team were never asked for their opinion. So, it's impossible, impossible as a manager to make a decision that's best for the team without gaining that knowledge before the decision.‚Äù

The 2014 U.S. team advanced out of the group stage of the World Cup before losing to Belgium, 2-1, in the round of 16.

When Christian Pulisic, currently considered this country's best soccer player, declined to play for the U.S. Men's National team in the current CONCACAF Gold Cup and then engaged in a long-distance wars of words both with current national team coach Mauricio Pochettino and with Landon Donovan ‚Äì who was American soccer's GOAT before Pulisic ‚Äì lots of people seemed to miss the point.

(And there was some severe irony hidden in that above paragraph. We'll get to that.)

No, Pulisic is not being a prima donna. He is part of the collateral damage from a worldwide soccer calendar that has become too lengthy and too demanding, with too little thought given to the health of the players who people actually pay to see.

It is bad enough in this country's domestic league, Major League Soccer. Beyond the 34-game regular-season schedule, teams participate in either the U.S. Open Cup tournament ‚Äì an event that predates MLS by several decades ‚Äì or the CONCACAF Champions Cup, to determine the sport's regional champion.

To make it worse, MLS invented the Leagues Cup tournament, a competition with Liga MX teams that serves mainly to provide programming for Apple TV+ in July and August and otherwise only clutters a schedule that begins in late February and doesn't end until mid-October. And the league's best-of-three first-round playoff format, along with at least one international window in the fall, only serves to further drag the postseason into early December.

In 2023, the year after LAFC won its only MLS Cup to date, it played 53 games in 250 days, from its MLS opener on March 4 through the MLS Cup final in Columbus on Dec. 9. That included CONCACAF Champions League, U.S. Open Cup, Leagues Cup and Campeones Cup games, in addition to the regular season and playoffs.

But MLS players are lucky. At least they get an offseason, even if it's only a little more than a month for the teams that make it to the championship round. For their counterparts elsewhere in the world, especially the stars who play for the high-profile teams that drive the sport's conversation ‚Äì and then report for national team duty ‚Äì there's essentially no such thing.

Consider Pulisic, whose day job is as AC Milan's star. From last June 24 through this past May 24, Pulisic played 60 games, and 4,428 minutes, in 335 days, according to figures compiled by Transfermarkt. That included 50 matches for AC Milan between Serie A, the UEFA Champions League and two in-season Italian tournaments, and 10 matches for the USMNT (three Copa America matches, three exhibition matches and four in Nations League). And he missed most of December with a torn calf muscle and was hampered in March by another minor injury.

But his is not an unusual workload in this sport. Between league schedules, Champions League and other in-season tournaments and national team commitments, the stars are always expected to be on duty. And for the big European clubs, any summer time off is cut short by exhibition tours ‚Äì often to the United States ‚Äì for marketing purposes and, yes, for profit.

Now insert the Club World Cup, which is FIFA president Gianni Infantino's baby and fits nicely with the organization's apparent belief that more games and more money supersede everything else.

What was once a yearly seven-team December tournament to determine a world club champion ‚Äì with the champions of Europe and South America drawing byes into the semifinals ‚Äì is now a 32-team, month-long, big-money event, modeled after the World Cup, scheduled every four years and cutting into what would otherwise be the rest of the world's offseason. FIFA established a $1 billion prize pool, and its attempt to recoup some of that money from gate receipts is running into a populace on these shores that, with a few exceptions, generally has been apathetic to this first-time event.

Complicating things here is that the CONCACAF Gold Cup is being played at the same time. Since the U.S. (along with co-hosts Mexico and Canada) qualifies automatically for next summer's World Cup, this tournament and the friendlies surrounding it represent the closest thing the USMNT will have to preparation for the big tournament.

But the roster Pochettino is fielding is far from this country's best. Pulisic isn't the only absentee; Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah have also declined to play because they need a break, Folarin Balogun and Sergi√±o Dest are battling injuries, and Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah are participating in the Club World Cup.

And it is interesting that Donovan criticized Pulisic for opting out, given that he himself took a self-described four-month ‚Äúsabbatical‚Äù from soccer, skipping some World Cup qualifiers, after helping the Galaxy to the 2013 MLS Cup. Then-national team coach J√ºrgen Klinsmann left Donovan off the USMNT roster for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, and late last year Klinsmann confirmed what we had all suspected at the time, that it was because Donovan had stepped away from the game for a while.

And the reason he did so? Mental and physical exhaustion.

FIFPRO, the global players' association, was sounding this alarm four years ago before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar ‚Äì which, incidentally, was played in December, in the middle of most of the world's club seasons.

The situation has only gotten worse. This season, which for the leagues who play a traditional August-to-May schedule ends with the Club World Cup finale on July 13, is already considered the longest ever. International superstars such as Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbapp√© and Jude Bellingham have voiced concerns, and as this season began other players raised the possibility of a future strike should the overload continue.

FIFPRO submitted a legal claim against FIFA a year ago, in conjunction with 26 European professional leagues, and among other points argued that ‚Äúthe new FIFA Club World Cup is seen by players and unions as representing a tipping point.‚Äù

At what point do players break down?

Manchester City's Haaland understated it last summer: ‚ÄúIt's difficult to be sharp if you play over 70 games a year.‚Äù Not only is it difficult to be sharp, it's challenging to just stay healthy.

But as long as the cash keeps flowing into the coffers, how do you get those in the executive suites to notice?

The 2025 Club World Cup is reaching the end of the group stage with clubs moving on to the Round of 16. On Monday, Paris Saint-Germain emerged from Group B along with Botafogo, as Atl√©tico Madrid did not score the necessary goals to reach the knockout round.

Then on Monday night, Lionel Messi and Inter Miami nearly fell apart completely against Palmeiras, but did enough to finish second in Group A.

PSG is on to the Round of 16 after shutting out the Sounders to win Group B. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored in the 35th minute to ensure that the Champions League winners wouldn't be blanked for the second consecutive match after losing 1-0 to Botafogo on Thursday. Achraf Hakimi added a score in the 66th minute, converting a Bradley Barcola pass threaded between defenders. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma did not have to make a save in the match. Seattle is the second MLS team eliminated from the tournament, joining LAFC. PSG will face Inter Miami in the knockout round on Sunday (12 p.m. ET, DAZN) in Atlanta.

Despite winning Monday's match, Atl√©tico Madrid will not advance to the Round of 16. The Rojiblancos needed to win by three goals or more to move on from Group B. Instead, those spots will be taken by Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain. The match's lone goal didn't come until the 87th minute when Antoine Griezmann scored off a cross through several defenders from Julian Alvarez. Both clubs missed scoring chances early on with Atl√©tico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak making.a stretching save to deny Jefferson Savarino in the 10th minute. Alvarez also missed a close shot wide left just before the half. Atl√©tico Madrid got the one goal despite outshooting Botafogo 23-7.

This match was a shootout in every sense of the word. But in the end, neither club made it into the next round. Al Ahly entered the locker room at halftime up 2-1, but then the two teams traded three straight goals in a three-minute span early in the second half in wild fashion ‚Äî which tied the match up 3-3. Then, after Al Ahly jumped ahead again in the 64th minute, Pep√™ tied it up again with a huge goal from outside the box in the 89th minute to force the draw.

It looked like Inter Miami was going to roll into the knockout stage as winners of Group A, thanks to two early goals Monday night. Tadeo Allende scored first in the 16th minute on a breakaway, and Luis Suarez followed suit in the second half with a solo goal of his own after weaving past two defenders. But in the final 10 minutes of the match, Palmeiras surged back. They snuck one in in the 80th minute, and then Maur√≠cio buried one in the back of the net in the 88th minute to even the match.

Though Miami made it into the Round of 16 regardless, the late collapse wasn't great ‚Äî and it set up a battle with European champions PSG in the next round, something they nearly avoided. Palmeiras, now the winners of Group A, will get fellow Brazilian club Botafogo on Saturday (12 p.m. ET, DAZN) in Philadelphia.

This belongs to Pep√™, who completed a wild match with his deep goal against Al Ahly.

Heimo Schirgi's first big job in soccer was as head of operations for UEFA, the largest and most influential of the global game's six geographic confederations. Part of that job involved planning and managing the UEFA Champions League, the largest and most influential club soccer competition in the world.

So when Schirgi moved into his current job as FIFA's chief operating officer for the World Cup, he brought with him the knowledge that the Champions League, for all its prestige and gravitas, also had one weakness: its field was limited to the 55 soccer-playing countries of Europe.

‚ÄúYou have all these club competitions on a confederation, continental level, right?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you don't have it on a global level. You never had clubs from South America competing against European clubs in a serious tournament with high stakes.

‚ÄúI'm personally interested how the rest of the world's clubs are going to fare. There's only one way to find out.‚Äù

 Soccer 

Thieb Delaporte-Richard says he wanted the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of Los Angeles and surrounding areas to be reflected in the official poster for the World Cup in L.A.

That one way is the FIFA Club World Cup, which kicked off in the U.S. 10 days ago. And while the tournament has many flaws, it has gone a long way toward answering Schirgi's curiosity. Europe, it seems, isn't so dominant after all.

Paris Saint-Germain, the reigning European champion, lost to Botafogo, currently eighth in Brazil's Serie A. Iconic English club Chelsea was beaten handily by Flamengo, another Brazilian team. Mexico's Monterrey played Inter Milan, the Champions League runner-up, to a draw. Real Madrid, Europe's most decorated club, tied Al Hilal, which finished second in the Saudi Pro League.

And Spanish power Atl√©tico Madrid, which made the round of 16 in the Champions League, didn't even make it out of the group stage.

Those results may still prove to be little more than a stumble on the way to an all-European final four. Or not. And that uncertainty, Schirgi insists, is why the Club World Cup was created.

 Soccer 

Paris Saint-Germain loses in an upset to Botafogo in a FIFA Club World Cup that so far has been hampered by low attendance and hot weather.

‚ÄúOur sport is a sport where underdogs have a genuine chance, right?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's not just the money game. We know that club soccer is at a very high level.‚Äù

The real winners through the tournament's first 34 games have been Latin American teams: Five of the six South American clubs entered Monday unbeaten, as did Mexico's Monterrey. And if there's been a big loser, it's arguably been Major League Soccer, which has shown it's not ready to play with the big boys.

Although the U.S. league made history when Inter Miami beat Porto 2-1 in a group-stage game, marking the first time an MLS club has beaten a European team in a competitive match, the league's other two entries ‚Äî LAFC and the Seattle Sounders ‚Äî combined for just two goals and were shut out three times in their first five games, all losses.

But if the first Club World Cup has proven to be surprisingly entertaining, even compelling, there have been a few hiccups. Attendance was hurt by several early weekday kickoffs and high admission prices, which forced FIFA to essentially start giving away tickets. The average announced attendance of 36,043 through the first 34 games was matched by nearly as many empty seats.

Just one game has sold out; six others drew fewer than 14,100 fans.

The weather has also proven difficult with several players complaining about the heat and humidity. It was so bad in Cincinnati last Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's substitutes watched the first half on TV in the dressing room. And it's only going to get worse. Temperatures are expected to top 100 degrees on Tuesday in New Jersey, where Porto plays Al Ahly, and an excessive heat warning has been issued in Philadelphia, where Chelsea and Esperance de Tunis meet.

High 90s temperatures are also forecast Tuesday for Nashville, Tenn., and Charlotte, N.C., where afternoon games are scheduled. That, however, will serve as a wake-up call for next summer's World Cup, which will be played in similar conditions.

Perhaps the most complex problem FIFA faces in attempting to make the Club World Cup a significant quadrennial event, however, is the crowded fixture schedule. The World Cup will expand from 64 to 104 games next summer. Recent years have seen tournaments such as the Nations League added to the international calendar while club competitions including the Champions League, Europa League and Club World Cup expanded.

Others, such as the Leagues Cup, were created out of whole cloth.

As a result some players have played more than 70 matches for club and country in the last year. The fixture schedule has become so packed that the only place left to accommodate a monthlong tournament such as  the Club World Cup was the traditional early summer break between one European season and the next.

FIFPRO, the global union representing soccer players, has cited scientific research in its call for a mandatory four-week break each year. FIFA, the Club World Cup organizer, responded by offering a $1 billion prize-money purse to get teams to play through that break.

 Sports 

Members of the Italian soccer team Juventus visited President Trump in the Oval Office. A team spokesperson later said the visit ‚Äòcarried no political agenda.'

‚ÄúWith the introduction of the new Champions League format and the new Club World Cup, which extends for over a month, the workload on teams and players has increased significantly,‚Äù said Giuseppe Marotta, chairman and chief executive officer of Inter Milan. ‚ÄúHowever these competitions also represent a huge opportunity in terms of visibility and revenue. For this reasons, they must be safeguarded.

‚ÄúAdjustments should instead be made to the rest of the calendar to lighten the overall load.‚Äù

Marotta suggests shortening league schedules, which means diminishing domestic competitions while giving more power to the likes of FIFA and UEFA. That could be a slippery slope, one that would make the world's game less local and more global.

But if the Club World Cup follows the trajectory of the Champions League, Schirgi thinks that's a trade worth making.

‚ÄúThe beginnings of the Champions League, it was not always this huge, great event,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of growth that needs to happen and a lot of education. We are super excited that we are part of history.‚Äù

FIFA Club World Cup

There was an awkward moment during a virtual meeting last September which involved representatives from FIFA and major European clubs.

As FIFA toiled to secure a broadcaster for its newly expanded Club World Cup ‚Äî this was before DAZN stepped in to save the day ‚Äî the meet had been convened to convince global TV networks of the value of the competition.

Representatives from Manchester City made a pitch, while executives from Bayern Munich and Juventus sent video messages to be played on the call.

Then Atletico Madrid chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin came on the line and asked FIFA for clarity as to how much money his club would make for taking part, referencing how their fierce rivals Real Madrid were expecting to bank vast sums. FIFA had long indicated to Real behind the scenes that more than ‚Ç¨100million ($116m; ¬£85m at current exchange rates) would be up for grabs for arguably the biggest club on the planet.

Others present for the virtual meeting were under the impression Gil Marin did not appear to realise broadcasters were present on the call when seeking answers from FIFA. When made aware of this, he quickly changed his tone to stress how much Atletico were looking forward to playing in the tournament in the United States and played up the merits of the tournament.

Atletico had always been very proud to be one of the two La Liga representatives at the revamped competition along with Real. Last November, a senior figure at the club ‚Äî speaking anonymously in order to talk freely ‚Äî told The Athletic how qualifying ahead of Barcelona showed Atleti's status as one of the European elite.

Both Gil Marin and Atletico president Enrique Cerezo attended last December's Club World Cup draw in Miami (unlike Cerezo's Real Madrid counterpart Florentino Perez). Atletico viewed the tournament as a huge chance to promote the club's brand in a lucrative and mostly untapped U.S. market, as do all the big European clubs taking part.

A further factor is the expectation that Gil Marin and Cerezo will sell their majority stake in Atletico within the next few years. The club are part-owned by U.S. investment manager Ares Management Corporation, which increased its share last summer. Impressing in a prestigious international tournament on American soil would make that majority stake even more valuable to interested buyers.

Atletico's marketing push included setting up a ‚ÄòCasa Atleti' venue in Los Angeles during the group stages. What the club called an ‚Äúinteractive pop-up venue celebrating all things Atletico de Madrid‚Äù featured a club shop, mini-museum with trophies and memorabilia, food courts, gaming areas and visits from club legends including Diego Costa, Tiago and Miranda of the 2014 La Liga-winning side.

Thank you to everyone who came to Casa Atleti for our Atleti Red & White Meet and Greet ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ç

‚Äî Atl√©tico de Madrid (@atletienglish) June 18, 2025



‚ÄúEveryone at Atletico is really excited at playing the first Club World Cup, and we all want to win it,‚Äù Cerezo said at Casa Atleti on June 14, the day of the team's first game in the competition.

‚ÄúThis is the most important tournament we will play in four years,‚Äù continued Cerezo, a film promoter by trade who has long links with Hollywood. ‚ÄúWe think we can take a really important step in the history of Atletico Madrid.‚Äù

Another sign of Atletico's ambition and creativity in taking advantage of their Club World Cup appearance was their new ‚Äúfirst ever Supporters' Club in outer space‚Äù ‚Äî an international ‚ÄòAtleti Red & White' membership scheme they could promote during the tournament. The supporters' club was given an official base in a star in the Ursa Major constellation, while NASA designer Tim Gagnon helped design a patch that members receive.

‚Äî Atl√©tico de Madrid (@atletienglish) June 3, 2025



Such astronomical hopes for the competition were hit as soon as Atletico landed in the U.S.

The team's base at the Hotel Conrad in downtown Los Angeles was within the ‚Äòcurfew area' declared during political protests against the U.S. government's immigration policy. That meant police sirens and helicopter noise through the days and nights before their opening game against Paris Saint-Germain.

Atletico players and staff all claimed pre-game that the noise and uncertainty had not affected their preparation. ‚ÄúOf course we can hear the helicopters and sirens, but we have to keep our heads 110 per cent on the game,‚Äù Giuliano Simeone told reporters at their matchday-minus-one press activities, which had been moved and rescheduled at short notice due to the tense situation in the city.

But there was a clear lack of energy and concentration as Atletico were completely overrun by PSG in the first 45 minutes. The blistering-hot conditions at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena also meant Diego Simeone's team were unable to produce their usual high-intensity style of play. Late mistakes then allowed PSG to score two more goals for an emphatic 4-0 final scoreline.

‚ÄúIt's impossible, terribly hot,‚Äù Atleti midfielder Marcos Llorente said after that game. ‚ÄúMy toenails were hurting. I couldn't slow down or speed up. It was unbelievable.‚Äù

The defeat was a huge blow for Atletico, but they still had two group games to come. And there was also plenty of commercial work to do. Players including goalkeeper Jan Oblak and Julian Alvarez were at Casa Atleti for ‚Äòmeet and greet' events with supporters. Ex-Atletico striker Fernando Torres, now coaching the club's B team, was in Venice Beach for a Nike event, along with fellow former greats of the game Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazario.

In Atletico's second group game, away from the noise and heat of California, Atletico easily outclassed Seattle Sounders 3-1, with two goals from young midfielder Pablo Barrios. That lifted the mood among the players, who thought they were back on track to qualify ‚Äî and club executives who knew most of the prize money is awarded to teams who go deep in the competition.

But during the journey back to LA, they all watched in disbelief as a heavily rotated PSG side were beaten 1-0 by the Brazilian team Botafogo.

It was quickly apparent to everyone how the late lack of control against PSG had cost them. That now meant that, unless PSG slipped up against Seattle, Atletico needed to beat the Copa Libertadores holders by three goals in their final group game to remain in the competition.

It never looked possible as Atletico laboured through the first half in Monday's game back at the Rose Bowl. There was a glimpse of hope when Alvarez appeared to win a penalty just before the break but, after a VAR consultation, a push by Alexander Sorloth early in the move saw a free kick awarded to Botafogo instead.

Simeone and his players were furious with the decision, just as they had been when another VAR call had led to a goal by Alvarez disallowed against PSG in their opener. An 87th-minute effort by substitute Antoine Griezmann on Monday night eventually gave Atletico a 1-0 win over Botafogo, but it was too little, too late.

‚ÄúThere's frustration but getting six points in a group with the Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners was not bad,‚Äù Simeone said afterwards. ‚ÄúIn the end, we paid for the game against PSG. None of the refereeing decisions went our way, against PSG or today. But that's part of football.

‚ÄúThis was a huge opportunity for us to keep evolving as a team and as a club. We know really clearly what we need to improve.‚Äù

After a disappointing 2024-25, in which Atletico lost out to Real Madrid in the Champions League in controversial circumstances, finished behind Barcelona and Real in La Liga and exited the Copa del Rey semi-finals against Barca, Simeone is keen to improve his squad.

Atletico's only signing ahead of the Club World Cup was the arrival on a free transfer of defender Clement Lenglet, who had been on loan at Atletico from Barca last season. The Frenchman was sent off during the team's meltdown against PSG.

Atletico's targets this summer include Real Betis' U.S. international midfielder Jonny Cardoso, Tottenham's Argentina defender Cristian Romero, and Villarreal's Spain international playmaker Alex Baena.

None of those will come cheap, which is another reason the early exit will hurt everyone at Atletico.

They will take home about ‚Ç¨30m from FIFA, given their mid-ranking status among the European participants, and ‚Ç¨4m in total for their two group victories.

Even making the semi-finals ‚Äî not at all unreasonable for an Atletico squad boasting six players who have won World Cups with their countries ‚Äî would have meant at least ‚Ç¨40m more in prize money.

That is before counting the extra intangible benefits of being involved in the latter stages of the tournament in front of sponsors, fans and broadcasters.

Instead, Atletico became the first European team to be eliminated from the tournament. They were hurt by many different factors beyond their control: the political protests, LA's midday heat, a tough draw, and especially Botafogo's shock win against PSG in the second round of games.

But they also did not play well enough. They were completely outclassed by PSG and then unable to cause a very well-organised Botafogo team many problems in the decisive third game.

So the Club World Cup turned out to be a missed opportunity for Atletico, both on and off the pitch. They had hoped that their much-anticipated appearance in the tournament would be like a Hollywood blockbuster for a club always striving to be taken as a serious rival to Madrid and Barcelona.

Instead, it ended up feeling more like a horror movie for Simeone and company.

Trump's military action raises questions for football body 

Infantino and council to decide if Iran can play in Mexico

Fifa is facing new questions over the increasingly fraught World Cup next year, with the issue of how to treat Iran while the country is involved in a conflict with the co-host the US.

There are no provisions within Fifa's regulations to prevent Iran from playing their group matches in the US, despite the country being subject to military action by the Trump administration and Iranian citizens being under a travel ban that prevents them from entering the country. The ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

Iran, who faced USA in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, qualified in March for their fourth consecutive World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A could Iran avoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico.

If Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Should they go further ‚Äì and they have never reached a World Cup knockout game ‚Äì they would then play in the US.

Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president, Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend.

Infantino and the Fifa Council will have the final say on inclusion in the competition and the makeup of the draw, but the organising committee for Fifa competitions will be expected to have input. The committee has members from Canada, Mexico and Iran, and its chair is Uefa's president, Aleksander Ceferin. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow.

Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a ‚Äúgeneral principle‚Äù that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

FIFA is throwing a gala to ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù the Club World Cup at a venue on Wall Street in New York City ‚Äì and attendees are being charged thousands of dollars to party with its President Gianni Infantino and, according to the co-organizers, FIFA World Cup stars.

The co-organizers Big Art (an international event management company) promoted the event on Instagram with an attached link to book tickets via a WhatsApp sales representative.

The representative described the event as ‚Äúthe official celebration of the FIFA Club World Cup finals.‚Äù The event promised a headline performance by the British popstar Rita Ora and ‚Äúworld class entertainment curated throughout the night.‚Äù

Ticket prices start at $1,000 per person for a silver category entry, rising to $2,000 for platinum entry and $3,000 for a black category entry. Promotion on Big Art's Facebook page said the ‚ÄúVIP event will gather Legends of the game, FIFA's top leadership and a handpicked guest list of international figures from business, fashion and culture.‚Äù

A sales representative said in their opening message on WhatsApp that Infantino will attend, before adding that Kaka, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Roberto Baggio will also be there. All four players have either been involved in sponsorship activations, or spoken positively about the tournament or attended games with FIFA during the Club World Cup.

The event is scheduled to take place on July 10, a day after the second semi-final and three days before the final.

A spokesperson for FIFA confirmed FIFA and Big Art are working together on a gala dinner and that FIFA is both attending and co-branding. It added that FIFA attendees are still to be confirmed.

The Big Art sales representative also said that this paid-for entry represented a ‚Äúrare opportunity to align your brand with FIFA and engage directly with global decision-makers, influencers and icons from across the world.‚Äù

FIFA did not comment when asked by The Athletic what role it had in the pricing of the event, or whether it is appropriate for individuals or brands to spend thousands of dollars to engage directly with FIFA leadership.

FIFA said it would not receive any revenue from the event but had not replied by the point of publication about who the revenue will go to.

FIFA subsequently promoted the event on its website, without mentioning the prices, but said that the night ‚Äúwill begin with a cocktail reception, followed by a gala dinner featuring world-class cuisine, fine wines and high-end production befitting the truly historic and game changing tournament.‚Äù

Big Art have been contacted for comment.

Last month, the first ticketing packages for next summer's men's World Cup went on sale with the release of a collection of high-end hospitality options.

The initial release was limited to certain hospitality offerings involving several games packaged together, starting at $3,500 (¬£2,625) per person and climbing to an eye-popping $73,200 (¬£54,750).

Paris St-Germain beat the Seattle Sounders 2-0 at Lumen Field

Paris St-Germain manager Luis Enrique has criticised the pitches at the Club World Cup and said the ""ball bounced like a rabbit"" during his side's win against the Seattle Sounders.

The match was played at Seattle's Lumen Field, home of MLS side the Sounders and NFL team the Seattle Seahawks, with the stadium's artificial turf replaced with a temporary hybrid grass for the tournament.

The Spaniard says football's world governing body Fifa needs to ""bear in mind"" the quality of both match and training pitches if it wants the Club World Cup to be ""the most high-level competition in the world"".

""I wouldn't imagine a NBA court full of holes,"" the 55-year-old said after his side won 2-0 to secure top spot in Group B in the tournament, which is being solely hosted in the United States.

""What I really care about is the state of the field of play, and I say this on the day we've won.

""The ball bounces almost like if it were jumping around like a rabbit.""

PSG won the Champions League at the end of May with a dominant victory over Inter Milan in Munich to complete a European and domestic treble.

Luis Enrique said his team have had to adjust the way they play since their arrival in the US because of pitch conditions.

""Lumen Field is an example, it used to be artificial turf and now it is natural grass and they have to water it by hand - they did so at half-time but the field was dry again in 10 minutes,"" he added. 

""For our game this a problem. It's very different to European pitches. The grass is different and therefore it is not so easy to have the same smoothness to play our style - but we did adapt well and we're very happy.""

Jude Bellingham on Club World Cup pitches

There are fewer than 12 months before the Fifa World Cup takes place across Canada, Mexico and United States.

Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham also criticised the pitches at the Club World Cup following his side's 3-1 win against Pachuca.

""The pitches aren't great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,"" said the England midfielder.

""It's tough on the knees as well. Hopefully there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year.""

Five of the venues from this year - Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium, Lincoln Financial Field and Lumen Field - will also host World Cup matches.

All five are used by NFL teams and usually have artificial turf but will have real grass installed in time for the World Cup in order to meet Fifa requirements.

The inaugural Club World Cup is not the first time the standard of pitches in the US has caused problems.

Players were critical of conditions at last summer's Copa America, with Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez saying the field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium was a ""disaster"" following a win over Canada.

Tournament organiser Conmebol defended the pitches, with director of competitions Fredirico Nantes saying ""the grass in Atlanta posed absolutely no threat"".

The stadium will host eight matches at the World Cup next summer, including one of the semi-finals.



'Impossible to train' - Chelsea face record heat in Philadelphia

'Like a sauna' - Weather concerns continue at Club World Cup

The state of the pitches is the latest concern that has been raised at the Club World Cup.

There have been concerns about the weather throughout the competition, with extreme heat causing problems for the players.

Borussia Dortmund substitutes watched the first half of their win over Mamelodi Sundowns from the dressing room because of the temperature, with their manager  Niko Kovac saying conditions were ""like a sauna"".

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has said his side have struggled to train in Philadelphia, as temperatures reached 37C. 

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.

...

The 2025 Club World Cup is reaching the end of the group stage with clubs moving on to the Round of 16. On Monday, Paris Saint-Germain emerged from Group B along with Botafogo, as Atl√©tico Madrid did not score the necessary goals to reach the knockout round.

Then on Monday night, Lionel Messi and Inter Miami nearly fell apart completely against Palmeiras, but did enough to finish second in Group A.

PSG is on to the Round of 16 after shutting out the Sounders to win Group B. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored in the 35th minute to ensure that the Champions League winners wouldn't be blanked for the second consecutive match after losing 1-0 to Botafogo on Thursday. Achraf Hakimi added a score in the 66th minute, converting a Bradley Barcola pass threaded between defenders. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma did not have to make a save in the match. Seattle is the second MLS team eliminated from the tournament, joining LAFC. PSG will face Inter Miami in the knockout round on Sunday (12 p.m. ET, DAZN) in Atlanta.

Despite winning Monday's match, Atl√©tico Madrid will not advance to the Round of 16. The Rojiblancos needed to win by three goals or more to move on from Group B. Instead, those spots will be taken by Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain. The match's lone goal didn't come until the 87th minute when Antoine Griezmann scored off a cross through several defenders from Julian Alvarez. Both clubs missed scoring chances early on with Atl√©tico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak making.a stretching save to deny Jefferson Savarino in the 10th minute. Alvarez also missed a close shot wide left just before the half. Atl√©tico Madrid got the one goal despite outshooting Botafogo 23-7.

This match was a shootout in every sense of the word. But in the end, neither club made it into the next round. Al Ahly entered the locker room at halftime up 2-1, but then the two teams traded three straight goals in a three-minute span early in the second half in wild fashion ‚Äî which tied the match up 3-3. Then, after Al Ahly jumped ahead again in the 64th minute, Pep√™ tied it up again with a huge goal from outside the box in the 89th minute to force the draw.

It looked like Inter Miami was going to roll into the knockout stage as winners of Group A, thanks to two early goals Monday night. Tadeo Allende scored first in the 16th minute on a breakaway, and Luis Suarez followed suit in the second half with a solo goal of his own after weaving past two defenders. But in the final 10 minutes of the match, Palmeiras surged back. They snuck one in in the 80th minute, and then Maur√≠cio buried one in the back of the net in the 88th minute to even the match.

Though Miami made it into the Round of 16 regardless, the late collapse wasn't great ‚Äî and it set up a battle with European champions PSG in the next round, something they nearly avoided. Palmeiras, now the winners of Group A, will get fellow Brazilian club Botafogo on Saturday (12 p.m. ET, DAZN) in Philadelphia.

This belongs to Pep√™, who completed a wild match with his deep goal against Al Ahly.

The Swedish starlet seems destined to follow in his namesake's footsteps to become one of the biggest stars in world football

""Roony! Roony! Roony!"" You would have been forgiven for mistaking the Parken Stadium for the peak years of the Wayne Rooney era at Old Trafford as that famous chant rained down from the stands in November 2023. But this was not some tribute to the Manchester United legend; instead, Copenhagen's supporters were rather poetically mocking their esteemed guests and hailing their new hero at the same time.

Roony Bardghji had just crashed home an 87th-minute winner against the three-time European champions, aged 17 and 359 days. In that moment the teenager had thrust himself into the limelight, making history in the process.

The name Rooney is already etched into football folklore, but Wayne's near namesake seems destined to forge his own path. His path to stardom has been muddied since that breakout appearance against the Red Devils, but a bright future with Barcelona beckons nonetheless.

The reigning champions of Spain have agreed a deal to sign Bardghji on a cut-price ‚Ç¨2.5 million deal after he entered the final few months of his Copenhagen contract, despite the awkward professing of his love for Real Madrid earlier in his career. At least he's claimed to be trying to emulate Lionel Messi rather than one of the Galacticos. Besides, all will be forgotten if he lights up the world in Barca colours.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL runs through the players who have announced themselves at the top level in the first week of the global tournament 

""I think the players are loving it, it's something new. It's something special,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said when asked to assess the first week of the expanded Club World Cup at the Fanatics Fest in New York at the weekend. ""It's a real World Cup with the best teams and the best players.""

That final statement may be a stretch given the absence of Premier League and La Liga champions Liverpool and Barcelona among a host of other elite teams. But Infantino is not wrong about the general mood among the players who are starring in the United States this summer.

There was much debate about potential burnout heading into the tournament, but all the big names have been playing with huge smiles on their faces. Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos have rolled back the years for Inter Miami and Monterrey, respectively, while Jude Bellingham has led by example at Real Madrid, and Phil Foden has rediscovered his best form with Manchester City.

Meanwhile, Bayern Munich duo Michael Olise and Jamal Musiala have stormed to the top of the scoring chart with three goals apiece, and former Arsenal midfielder Jorginho helped Flamengo become the first team to reach the knockout phase. But the more seasoned performers have also had to share the headlines with hungry newcomers determined to leave a lasting impression on the elite stage.

All you need to know about Argentina's squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup

Crowned champions of the world in 2022, Argentina will be defending their coveted title in the USA, Canada, and Mexico in 2026.

The Albiceleste defeated France in a thrilling final at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar to lift their third World Cup title, and their first since Diego Maradona's iconic triumph in Mexico in 1986. Kylian Mbappe's brilliant hat trick nearly stole the game from Lionel Scaloni's side, but Emiliano Martinez's heroics in the penalty shootout sealed the win for the men in blue and white for the crowning moment in Lionel Messi's illustrious career.

They comfortably secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup by topping the CONMEBOL qualifiers, beating arch-rivals Brazil both home and away along the way.

The Albiceleste are a force to be reckoned with, having won two Copa Americas and one World Cup in just four years. They will once again enter the tournament as one of the favorites, boasting quality players in every position - including the legendary Messi, who is set to play in his final World Cup.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Evans ‚Äì Paul: 25.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 1-1

Daniel Evans has won three of his last five matches. Last week in London, he lost in straight sets against Nakashima in the 1/8-Finals. This week in Eastbourne, Evans has been granted a wild card. Evans defeated Kecmanovic in three tight sets in the opening round after losing the opening set 3-6.

Tommy Paul has won four of his last five matches. His last match was at the French Open, where Paul lost against Alcaraz in the quarterfinals. His last match on grass-court was last season at Wimbledon, losing against Alcaraz in the quarterfinals in four tight sets.

According to the bookies, Evans is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He has already played around a dozen matches on grass this season, while Paul has not played any competitive matches on grass. We expect Evans to keep this match tight.

That being said, Evans covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Daniel Evans +3.5 games handicap @1.73 @bet365

Fritz ‚Äì Fonseca: 25.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: first meeting

Taylor Fritz has won four of his last five matches. Last week in London, Moutet upset him in the opening round in three tight sets.  A week before, Fritz won the title in Stuttgart. He is the defending champion in Eastbourne. He defeated Purcell in the final last season.

Joao Fonseca has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Halle, he lost against Cobolli in three tight sets. Around this time last season, the Brazilian played at the Challenger Tour level. This is his debut campaign in Eastbourne. In the opening round, he won against Bergs in three sets after losing the opening set.

According to the bookies, Fonseca is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. Once he lost the opening set against Bergs, Fonseca played his best tennis and dominated until the end. If he repeats that performance, we expect him to at least keep this match tight.

That being said, Fonseca covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Joao Fonseca +2.5 games handicap @2.10 @bet365

Sonego ‚Äì Humbert: 25.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 3-4

Lorenzo Sonego has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Halle, Sonego lost in three tight sets against Zverev in the 1/8-Finals. This week in Eastbourne, the Italian defeated Marozsan in straight sets in the opening round. Last season in Eastbourne, the Italian lost against Purcell in straight sets in the 1/8-Finals.

Ugo Humbert has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Halle, Humbert lost in the opening round against Shapovalov in three tight sets.

According to the bookies, Sonego is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. Humbert played far away from his best level last week. On the other hand, Sonego dominated against Marozsan here in the opening round. We expect Sonego to be a better player tomorrow.

That being said, Sonego winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Lorenzo Sonego winning @2.38 @bet365

A year after season-ending wrist surgery, the 23-year-old from Rome is pushing to get back to where he once was ... and beyond.ByFlorian HeerPublished Jun 24, 2025 copy_link

Born in Rome, Zeppieri earned his first ATP ranking point at just 16 and quickly rose through the ranks; he hit his career-high of No. 110 in early 2024 after a second-round effort at the Australian Open as a qualifier. His junior career was also impressive, reaching the semifinals of both singles and doubles at the 2019 Australian Open alongside fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti.As his comeback has continued to take shape, Zeppieri was thrust into the spotlight in Paris, where he faced world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in the first round of Roland Garros.‚ÄúI always played well in Paris. I played there four times in a row and never lost in qualifying,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúObviously, the match against Carlos was very tough. I didn't have a chance, but it was nice to play on a big court, which is also good for my mindset.‚ÄùReflecting on the fact that junior success doesn't always transate to professional tennis, Zeppieri said: ‚ÄúIt's almost a different sport, physically but also on the mental part. At junior level, you still have chances to win even if you don't play your best tennis. On the pro circuit, this becomes really difficult. You have to stay focused through the entire match and not give your opponent any room.‚Äù

Despite recent setbacks, Zeppieri remains positive about Italian tennis and the strong support system behind it.‚ÄúA lot of players of my age worked really hard. The federation in Italy does a good job. They give us wild cards, provide us with coaches and physios. This is key. It's also important to have so many ATP Challengers in Italy. It gives you a chance to play at different levels right from the start.‚ÄùThat support continues today.‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù Zeppieri affirmed. ‚ÄúI received wild cards into the Challenger in Perugia and Sassuolo, for example. They also supported me after my surgery and tried all they could do. I am really glad about this.‚Äù

As for his game, Zeppieri describes himself as an offensive player.‚ÄúThe volley is probably not my best shot,‚Äù he admitted, ‚Äúbut I try to work on it. I play with a lot of spin with my forehand, which isn't ideal on indoor hard courts, although I did win a Challenger in Cherbourg. I also like grass. I think being a lefty is an advantage. Right-handers don't play that often against lefties.‚ÄùEyes back on the Top 150To return to his prior position, his tournament schedule remains packed.‚ÄúI will play the qualifying at Wimbledon and will return to clay afterwards,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI still have the chance to use my protected ranking and will probably play the ATP events in Umag and Bastad to gain some points.‚ÄùHow does preparation for the grass look like?‚ÄúI don't prepare for the grass,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúOne big player told me that you don't need to.

Off the court, Zeppieri keeps things balanced. He enjoys video games, spending time with his girlfriend, and catching up with his family near Rome. A proud supporter of AS Roma, he also follows snooker, having idolized Ronnie O'Sullivan alongside his childhood tennis hero Roger Federer.Looking ahead, Zeppieri has clear goals.‚ÄúI want to get back into the Top 150 and be seeded in the qualifying of the Australian Open,"" he said.

The French number one, now ranked 65th on the WTA Tour, was defeated after almost two hours of battle in the first grass-court match of her career, going down 6-2, 6-7 (1/7), 6-4.

On a windy Court 1 in Roehampton, where qualifying for Wimbledon takes place, the 22-year-old Frenchwoman looked ill at ease on grass ‚Äì a surface which differs greatly from her favoured clay.

Despite her stunning run at the French Open earlier in June, Boisson did not receive an invitation from the organisers of the next Grand Slam in the tennis schedule.

A wildcard in Paris, the player then ranked 361st in the world delighted the home fans by reaching the last four after defeating world number three Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva.

Boisson was then beaten in the semi-finals by American Coco Gauff, the eventual champion.

By virtue of her new ranking, Boisson was the top seed in Wimbledon qualifying.

Lois Boisson was unable to repeat her French Open heroics, suffering a shock elimination in the first round of qualifying for Wimbledon.

The third Grand Slam of the season begins at the All England Club on Monday, and hopefuls are bidding to run the gauntlet of the qualifying tournament at nearby Roehampton this week. But Boisson, who stunned the tennis world to reach the semifinals at Roland Garros as a wildcard, will not make her Wimbledon debut after being dumped out in the first round.

The clay specialist was the No. 1 seed in the qualifying tournament thanks to her huge rise from 361st to 65th in the WTA rankings as a result of her epic run in Paris. But the French No. 1 was exposed on grass by the world No. 197, Canada's Carson Branstine on Tuesday.

In windy conditions, the 22-year-old was playing the first grass court match of her career, and she was beaten in three sets 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4.

Brastine was complimentary about her opponent when speaking to the press after the one-hour, 53-minute battle. The Canadian said: ""She's an incredible player. She fights for every point. Her result at the French Open speaks for itself. I'm proud of myself.""

Boisson defeated WTA No. 3 Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva on her thrilling run to the final four in Paris before she was routed in straight sets by eventual champion Coco Gauff.

Despite her breakthrough performance in the French capital, Boisson was denied a wildcard for the main draw at Wimbledon ‚Äì a decision heavily criticized in her homeland ‚Äì and she will have to settle for watching the tournament from home.

Julien Benneteau, France's Billie Jean King Cup captain, bemoaned the decision by Wimbledon organizers not to grant Boisson a wildcard ahead of her qualifying exit, although the former world No. 25 recognized that rules had been followed.

He told RMC: ""The English don't give a damn about Lois Boisson. They do what they want. They didn't break any rules, that's why it's not unfair.‚Äù

‚ÄúLois Boisson is unlucky: there are a lot of young English players who are coming up, and they've prioritised that. Before giving out wildcards, the English also look at your past on grass. Whether it's at Wimbledon or in previous tournaments on grass.

‚ÄúLois Boisson has never played on grass, so for them, when we say she's the new star of world tennis, that she's reached a semi-final‚Ä¶ For Wimbledon, it's nothing for the moment. And it's not pejorative.‚Äù

			Roger Taylor may have been a 1970s tennis star with Hollywood looks, but a player strike in 1973 almost tore his world apart

‚ÄúEveryone fantasises about being James Bond,‚Äù says Roger Taylor, the square-jawed tennis star of the early 1970s. ‚ÄúIt was every man's dream, wasn't it? This guy walks into a pub, and if somebody was a dishy one, well‚Ä¶‚Äù

Taylor tails off, but his meaning is clear. And he is right: for Englishmen of a certain vintage, nothing beats a secret agent with irresistible sexual magnetism. The difference, in Taylor's case, is that he actually auditioned for the role.

In 1967 ‚Äì the year remembered for the Summer of Love ‚Äì Taylor was 25, a self-taught player who had grown up hitting with his mother on the park courts of Sheffield. ‚ÄúTall, dark and handsome,‚Äù in the words of one broadsheet newspaper, he was the matinee idol of the British game. Like Jack Draper today, only more so.

Where Draper squeezes modelling assignments in between training sessions, Taylor went one better: he was talent-spotted by a screenwriter's wife while playing the final of Queen's. She referred him to the Bond franchise, who were then looking to replace the departing Sean Connery.

It might seem like a daft idea. A non-actor, taking on the biggest role in 1960s cinema? But then, that's exactly what would happen when George Lazenby ‚Äì an Australian car salesman turned male model ‚Äì succeeded Connery the following year.

In Taylor's case, you can still see the outlines of a striking figure, even as he approaches his 84th birthday. Sitting in front of us, in a back room at the same Queen's Club where he twice reached the final, he looks trim and fit, with a powerful left forearm that once used to punch volleys ‚Äì and occasionally opponents, as we will see.

Today, Taylor struggles with his health. He has spent the last five years battling slow-moving prostate cancer, and was more recently diagnosed with another potentially fatal condition called amyloidosis. ‚ÄúI get breathless very easily,‚Äù he says, even though he still visits the gym several times a week.

But if we rewind to 1967, Taylor had the looks to carry a movie poster, with his broad shoulders, soulful eyes, and thick mane of jet-black hair. He also had that aforementioned casting call, which took place at a hotel near Park Lane.

‚ÄúThere was a room full of men,‚Äù Taylor recalls now, ‚Äúand these two big guys, Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, had big cigars sticking out of their mouths. They're sitting at a table. And these other guys are coming, looking at me, creeping around me. I still haven't said anything, and they never asked me to say anything. I'd been working on that famous line in the mirror ‚Äì ‚ÄòThe name's Bond, James Bond' ‚Äì but it never came out.‚Äù

Taylor was invited back for a second viewing, and told to bring his bathing trunks. But he ignored the summons. As he explains in his forthcoming autobiography, ‚ÄúFrances [his first wife] became very irate, saying the whole thing was absolute madness. She's a Scottish baptist and clearly didn't fancy becoming a Bond girl.‚Äù

This was probably the right move. Lazenby ‚Äì who would later marry another tennis champion in Pam Shriver ‚Äì spent nine months shooting On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and found the attention so overwhelming that he turned down a six-film follow-up deal, despite an attached million-pound bonus.

Meanwhile, Taylor joined the so-called Handsome Eight ‚Äì a group of contracted stars that also included Australian icons John Newcombe and Tony Roche. His leading-man credentials surely contributed to that cheesy moniker, even if it fitted certain players more than others. ‚ÄúThe Handsome Seven and Tony Roche‚Äù was one suggested alternative.

Taylor's decision to join the Handsome Eight could have cost him his Wimbledon career, but fortunately his timing was perfect. The following year, 1968, All England Club chairman Herman David ended the ban on professional participation, so he never missed a match.

Unlike most of his peers, Taylor also participated in 1973, the most controversial year in the All England's Club's history. This was the summer of the players' strike, and Taylor's decision to break the picket line explains the title of his new book: The Man Who Saved Wimbledon.

The strike was part of an ongoing power struggle between increasingly militant players and stubbornly old-fashioned administrators. When Niki Pilic received a nine-month ban for refusing to represent Yugoslavia in the Davis Cup, the nascent player union (the Association of Tennis Professionals, which still runs the men's tour today) instructed its members to boycott Wimbledon in response.

Taylor, however, was reluctant. As he writes in his book, ‚ÄúWimbledon was part of my DNA and all the more important to me as British No 1 and flagbearer for the host nation ‚Ä¶ Mixing with some of the old guard who made up the bulk of the membership, eminent soldiers who'd fought in the war and risked their lives for their country, led me to question who was going to stand up for this great event and not be bullied into submission.‚Äù

More than 50 years later, the events of that summer remain fresh in Taylor's mind, and still bring a quaver to his voice. He becomes emotional during our conversation, especially when discussing the lack of appreciation he received from those in positions of power. He finds their betrayal harder to stomach than the aggressive stance of Stan Smith, the reigning Wimbledon champion who bearded him at Queen's Club after a match.

‚ÄúStan said, ‚ÄòRoger, if you don't boycott, you'll never play tennis again.' So I said, ‚ÄòWhy not?' And he said, ‚ÄòBecause we [the ATP] will be running the game.'

‚ÄúI was in a terrible state. The phone was ringing: people were calling me to say ‚ÄòDon't play, don't play'. Next call: ‚ÄòPlay, come on, play.' I was going backwards and forwards. I called the referee on the first morning to withdraw. Then I changed my mind 10 minutes later and called him back again.

‚ÄúThe hardest thing was when I saw them come back the next year, the other players, and the way the officials greeted them. I saw Tim Phillips, who was on the way to becoming chairman, put his arm around Donald Dell [a player-turned agent who had helped instigate the boycott]. I thought ‚ÄòOh, I'm a piggy in the middle here.' They're not going to be able to say I did anything because they don't want to ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Taylor tails off once again, but as before, his meaning is clear. The All England Club wanted rapprochement with the vast majority. As a result, they were never going to lionise him for his brave stand. While the AELTC did cover the ¬£5,000 fine levied by the ATP, the costs of Taylor's resistance extended far beyond his bank account. In his book, Taylor quotes Jack Kramer ‚Äì the champion-turned-promoter who formed the original professional tour ‚Äì to the effect that ‚ÄúRoger had been a good player, but he never amounted to a thing after Wimbledon '73.‚Äù

To make Taylor's memories even more painful, he probably should have won the title that summer, but came unstuck in the semi-finals against two-time French Open champion Jan Kodes. Again, there was a frustrating subplot here, because bad weather forced the players off court with Taylor leading the deciding set 5-4.

‚ÄúIt was virtually dark at 10 minutes past seven,‚Äù he recalls now. ‚ÄúIt was dull and damp, and in those days there was no cover, no roof, no lights. The crowd had mostly gone home, so we were thinking we'd be back playing the next day.

‚ÄúBut if you know Wimbledon, they were military people, so they just wanted our match to be finished, to keep the order of the week going. After 42 minutes, Captain Gibson ‚Äì who was the referee ‚Äì shouted ‚ÄòTaylor back on court, now.'‚Äù Kodes dealt with the sudden resumption better, won the next three games in a flash, and dominated Alex Metreveli in a straight-sets final.

As a working-class lad from Sheffield, whose father was a trade unionist and a steelworker, Taylor never felt accepted by the tennis establishment. In his book, he describes how Dan Maskell, the famous commentator and coach, had snubbed him as a teenager, preferring prospects with better-heeled shoes. Much later, he was devastated by the AELTC's refusal to grant membership to his son Greig, a promising player who never quite found his way in the game, and would later pass away at the tragically early age of 46.

‚ÄúWimbledon is like a cult,‚Äù says Taylor, before citing the story of the elderly committee member who dismissed the glorious career of three-time champion Fred Perry in seven condescending words: ‚ÄúFred had a bad war, you know.‚Äù Taylor found this comment hard to swallow. He had known Perry well, while working in his sports stores as an ambitious young player, and felt a certain kinship with his fellow northern misfit.

Warming to his theme, Taylor adds that ‚ÄúI've been to cocktail parties where we're sitting by Centre Court, and one of the Wimbledon committee members is addressing all these people, and everyone is sitting there in awe. I played on that court, and they never mentioned me.‚Äù

Although Taylor would eventually be appointed Davis Cup captain for four years in the early 2000s, he has never enjoyed the visibility and profile that his achievements surely warranted. Perhaps he was just too blunt-speaking and stubborn for his own good ‚Äì a quality that has earned him comparisons to his Yorkshire contemporary Sir Geoff Boycott.

Taylor certainly could be ornery, not to mention rough when necessary. This is the man who threw the most famous left hook in tennis history, flooring the notoriously objectionable Australian pro Bob Hewitt during a row in 1969.

‚ÄúHe came closer and closer,‚Äù recalls Taylor, whose only crime had been to defeat Hewitt in a tight three-setter. ‚ÄúIt was in the locker-room in Berlin, which was like an old Western with these swing doors, and he came bursting through them.

‚ÄúI said something like, ‚ÄòWell, if you touch me, it's on.' And he pushed me. Bang. And I missed the French Championships. I didn't break my hand but I had it in a bucket of ice that night and I couldn't play the semi-final the next day. Luckily I wasn't penalised in any way because everybody knew about him and I was defending myself really.‚Äù

Sounds like those Bond casting agents really did miss a trick.

The Man Who Saved Wimbledon: Roger Taylor's Official Biography, published by Pitch Publishing, ¬£25, is out June 30.

LONDON -- French Open surprise semifinalist Lois Boisson has lost in the first round of qualifying for Wimbledon.

Boisson, 22, was beaten 6-2, 6-7 (1), 6-4 on Tuesday against No. 197-ranked Carson Branstine of Canada in a rare match for the French player on grass at the Roehampton qualifying venue.

Boisson soared from No. 361 to No. 65 after her deep run at Roland-Garros in her Grand Slam main draw singles debut, and was top-seeded in the Wimbledon qualifying draw.

Being denied a wild card into the Wimbledon main draw provoked criticism in France of tournament organizers in London.

Boisson beat top-10 players Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva at the French Open before losing to eventual champion Coco Gauff.

World No 151 Taro Daniel has opened up on the harsh realities of life outside the tennis elite.

Daniel, 32, who hails from Japan but is based in Florida in the USA, has qualified for 11 Grand Slams, including Wimbledon on six occasions.

He is best known for reaching the third round of the Australian Open in 2022 after beating Andy Murray in round two, where he received ¬£150,000 in prize money.

However, despite that memorable run, Daniel has faced financial issues during his career given the cost of hiring coaches and physios, as well as travel expenses, something that is a major problem for lower-ranked players.

And the 32-year-old has opened up on those monetary challenges which has seen him give up hobbies and other things he enjoys.

'When I was younger, I even wouldn't get the avocado on my Chipotle order because it's like three dollars more,' he told the Financial Times. 'When you try to save too much it ends up impacting people's games negatively.'

World No 151 Taro Daniel has opened up on the harsh realities of life outside the tennis elite

Daniel revealed how he couldn't afford to pay for avocado with his chipotle order 

Daniel opened up on how his prize money is quickly eaten up by various expenses and costs

Daniel failed to qualify for either the Australian or French Open earlier this year, but he has still racked up around ¬£135,000 in prize money through various tournament performances. 

Nevertheless, that figure doesn't seem much when you take into account all the costs and expenses required for the life of a professional tennis player.  

'First of all, you're earning all of this money from foreign countries so they're going to take all the withholding taxes,' Daniel added.

'Tournaments cover your hotel room, but they don't cover your coach's hotel room. My credit card statement, it's at least $20,000 (¬£14,702) a month on just operational expenses of hotel, food, flights and not including the salaries I pay to my team.

'As a tennis player, you're like a small company but having all your employees travelling all the time. [It's] at least $100,000 (¬£73,518) per season for your basic level, not super experienced coach.'

The Japanese star continued: 'Ten years ago, when I started, a lot of players would travel alone because the standards were not as high. Now, it would be very rare for someone to travel alone to a Grand Slam, for example.  

'Everyone has a coach or trainer. They're probably right on the red-black line. Even in a Slam, you're not necessarily making money.'

Daniel will hope to qualify for Wimbledon this year which would guarantee him at least ¬£66,000

Qualifying for Wimbledon takes place this week and if Daniel does manage to make it to SW19, it will not only be a fantastic career opportunity but also a chance to boost his earnings.

This is because there is a significant amount of prize money available at the tournament.

Those who are knocked out in the first round are guaranteed ¬£66,000, while players who make it through to round two receive ¬£99,000 and third round losers will even make ¬£152,000.

Meanwhile, this year's ¬£3million bounty for the Wimbledon winner will be the largest prize ever handed out in Grand Slam history.

EASTBOURNE, England (AP) ‚Äî Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova saved two match points on British opponent Harriet Dart's serve before rallying to win her opening match Tuesday at the grass-court Eastbourne Open.

Dart was 40-15 up on serve leading 5-4 in the decisive third set of a rain-affected round-of-32 match that second-seeded Krejcikova went on win 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-5.

It was just the second victory this year for the 17th-ranked Krejcikova, whose season didn't start until May because of a back injury.

The 29-year-old Czech player came to Eastbourne for her final warmup before beginning the defense of her Wimbledon title next week. She lost in the first round at her previous grass-court event at Queen's Club in London.

Emma Raducanu, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, dropped the first set on her way to a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-1 win over Ann Li of the United States. The seventh-seeded British player next faces Australian teenager Maya Joint, who on Monday eliminated Ons Jabeur, the two-time Wimbledon beaten finalist from Tunisia.

Sofia Kenin, the fourth-seeded American, lost her opening match 6-4, 6-4 against Kimberly Birrell, the 77th-ranked Australian.

Andy Murray will play a role in designing his statue at Wimbledon, which is planned to be unveiled in time for the Championships' 150th anniversary in 2027. 

The two-time Wimbledon champion achieved three of his career peaks on the All England Club's iconic Centre Court, including his 2012 Olympic gold-medal win. 

Discussions about how the club should commemorate the Briton's triumphs have been ongoing since Murray won his first Wimbledon in 2013 and became the first British man since Fred Perry 77 years prior to win the Grand Slam on home soil. 

In 2019, Wimbledon's then-chief executive Richard Lewis shared that plans were in the works and that there had never been 'any doubt' that Murray would receive a statue.  

As Murray began the process of calling time on his playing career last summer, tennis greats John McEnroe and Billie Jean King were among those to voice their support of the commemoration, with the former suggesting that the 38-year-old was a meaningful choice for 'changing the way people look at British tennis'. 

Now, current chairman Debbie Jevans has shed light on the plans, and revealed how the recent celebration of Rafael Nadal's unmatched legacy at the French Open had sharpened focus in SW19. 

'We looked at Rafa Nadal having that sort of plaque unveiled to him at Roland Garros which was all very special,' Jevans told the Performance People podcast. 'We thought: ""What do we want for Andy?""

'We had a great celebration for Andy when he played his last match, which was on Centre Court. And then when he came, when all the old players came and they greeted him and Sue Barker interviewed him.

'So we did a similar thing for him here last year but we are looking to have a statue of Andy Murray here and we're working closely with him and his team.

'And the ambition is that we would unveil that on the 150th anniversary of our first championships, which was 1877, so would be in 2027.

'It will be lovely and really special. So he's got to rightly be very involved in that and he and his team will be.'

Perry received a statue on the grounds of the All England Club which was unveiled in 1984, while the last British woman to win the singles' title, Virginia Wade, was honoured with a bust in 2004. 

Two-time champions Kitty Godfree and Dorothy Round, and former winners Angela Mortimer and Ann Jones have also received tributes. 

At the start of the women's tournament at the Queen's Club in June, Murray was present for the inauguration of the historic venue's centre court, renamed in his honour. 

The one-time coach of his old rival Novak Djokovic was on typically dry form for the unveiling of the Andy Murray Arena, saying that he was very grateful for 'whoever it was that decided to name the stadium'.

'This tournament, was where I won my first match on the ATP Tour, it was my most successful event, and I always loved coming back here at the start of the British summer,' Murray added. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

The Winston-Salem Open has awarded its first 2025 main draw wild card to Stefan Dostanic.

The Wake Forest standout helped lead the Demon Deacons to the 2025 NCAA Team Championship and recently secured an automatic wild card into the 2025 US Open main draw by winning the 2024-25 American Collegiate Wild Card Playoff at the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Florida.

‚ÄúI love Winston-Salem and I would say this is a home tournament to me now,‚Äù Dostanic said upon receiving his wild card. ‚ÄúI've seen so much great support from the city and the fans being at Wake these past few months, and I couldn't be happier to get this wild card.‚Äù

Dostanic competed as Wake Forest's No. 1 for the 2025 spring season, culminating with a dominant showing in the NCAA tournament that saw the Demon Deacons capture the 2025 team national championship. Dostanic previously played for the USC Trojans before transferring to Wake and is a native of Southern California.

The 2025 Winston-Salem Open will represent Dostanic's ATP main draw debut and come at a critical time as he prepares for his Grand Slam debut at the 2025 US Open.

‚ÄúWe're thrilled to award our first wild card to Stefan,‚Äù said Tournament Director Jeff Ryan. ‚ÄúHe's shown an amazing level of tennis this year leading Wake Forest to a national championship, and this will be an amazing opportunity to highlight a rising talent with a meaningful connection to our local community here in Winston-Salem.‚Äù

The full Winston-Salem player entry list will be announced in mid-July. Tickets for the 2025 Winston-Salem Open are on sale now, with the event set to run from August 16-23 at the Wake Forest Tennis Complex.

The announcement of the mixed doubles teams for the upcoming US Open, which will feature Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz playing together, sparked speculation about the nature of their relationship (currently a friendship) between the British and Spanish tennis stars. 

Interest grew even more after Raducanu, 22, was seen in the stands at Queen's Club, watching Alcaraz's Centre Court match against Roberto Bautista. Raducanu, currently competing at the WTA 250 event in Eastbourne, spoke to the BBC and lightheartedly addressed her pairing with Alcaraz.

When asked about humorous fan accounts on social media claiming the two are ‚Äúmeant to be,‚Äù she couldn't help but laugh. One fan post even joked that Alcaraz's loss in the Doha quarterfinals was due to being distracted by Raducanu's injury. ‚ÄúI hadn't heard that one,‚Äù she said about the speculation. ‚ÄúBut I'm glad the internet is enjoying it. It's great that we're keeping people entertained.‚Äù

Raducanu also shared the backstory behind their US Open partnership with a touch of humor, noting that she didn't give Alcaraz, 22, an immediate answer, something that Alcaraz confessed recently in an interview.

‚ÄúI had to make him wait a bit,‚Äù she said, according to the Daily Express. ‚ÄúNaturally, I wanted to say yes right away, but I needed to get approval from my team first. I couldn't just decide on my own. I had to check with my coach and do things properly.‚Äù

During the interview with the BBC, Raducanu opened up about how her friendship with Alcaraz developed back in 2021. ‚ÄúThat was the year we both made big moves at Wimbledon,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think he had a five-set win in the first round, maybe against Uchiyama. Then he had a great run at the US Open, especially that win over Stef [Tsitsipas] in the third round. I remember wanting to follow his progress because he always played the day before I did.

‚ÄúWe've stayed in touch ever since. It's been incredible to watch him keep climbing, and what's even cooler is that we were already talking and friends before either of us had achieved anything big,‚Äù she added.

Rather than hold a traditional mixed doubles event in 2025, the USTA has decided to move its mixed doubles event, with the competition now being held in the pre-tournament fan week. While the move has its own controversy, tennis' biggest (singles) stars have embraced the change.

Emma Raducanu finally shares her thoughts on Carlos Alcaraz's special request for US Open. The Spaniard reached out to women's tennis star to play together in the mixed doubles event in season's last Grand Slam tournament. The British No. 1 revealed how the five-time major champion sent her an invitation to be his mixed doubles partner. 

While talking in an interview, Raducanu opened up on Carlos Alcaraz's US Open invitation and gave her opinion on teaming up with the world No. 2 in the ATP rankings. The British star is keen to play alongside the champion player in the US Open. The pair is already making headlines since the announcement of US Open's mixed doubles draw. 

‚ÄúHe messaged me and asked me to play. I mean, I was very surprised and excited, of course,‚Äù Raducanu revealed in the interview.

Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz are two former US Open champions. Both have came together to make a strong case for the mixed doubles title. Raducanu, the British No. 1 women's player, can't wait to get started with her doubles partner, Carlos Alcaraz. She also expressed respect for the Spaniard's grand slam achievements. 

‚ÄúI really want to do as best as I can to not let my partner down,‚Äù the British ace said, showing the pressure to match with Carlos. Emma wants to perform on high level so she can match the standard of world No. 2 men's tennis player. 

‚ÄúIt's just routine for him to win tournaments, it's incredible,‚Äù Raducanu said, expressing how Carlos owned the ATP and Grand Slam tournament this year. Her statement came after Alcaraz's back-to-back glory at Queen's Club.

Former doubles world No 1 Kristina Mladenovic has slammed ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù comments made by the likes of Carlos Alcaraz regarding the revamped US Open mixed doubles event.

Rather than hold a traditional mixed doubles event in 2025, the USTA has decided to move its mixed doubles event, with the competition now being held in the pre-tournament fan week.

Sixteen teams will take part in the event, which will be a best-of-three sets, first-to-four games format, with a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a full third set.

The decision was made to try and encourage more big names to take part, and that move has certainly worked.

ATP world No 2 Alcaraz pairs up with Emma Raducanu in arguably the most-talked-about pairing, with Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, and Jannik Sinner also all entered.

The Spaniard was asked about his partnership with Raducanu during his Queen's campaign and revealed his excitement for the upcoming tournament.

‚ÄúI'm super excited about it,‚Äù said the 22-year-old. ‚ÄúI think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament.

‚ÄúI will try to bring my doubles skills. We will try to win, but obviously it's going to be really, really fun.‚Äù

Though the 22-year-old's comments have been celebrated by many, they appear to have drawn the ire of WTA star Mladenovic.

The Frenchwoman is a former world No 10 in singles, though she is best known for her doubles success, winning six women's doubles and three mixed doubles Grand Slam titles.

And, in an interview with Eurosport France, the 32-year-old expressed her frustration.

‚ÄúThe communication alone is bad,‚Äù commented Mladenovic.

‚ÄúWhen you hear Alcaraz or others say they're going to have fun while preparing for the US Open, it's embarrassing.

‚ÄúA Grand Slam is neither preparation nor fun. It's years of sacrifice. When you're young, you dream of winning one, even in doubles.

‚ÄúYou don't want to see your sport turn into a gigantic spectacle, even if it will indeed bring in a lot of money.‚Äù

The winning pair will receive $1m in prize money, with the event being held from August 19-20; the main draw of the singles events will then begin on Sunday, August 24.

The event is set to be broadcast on TV and will likely encourage more fans to enter the site pre-tournament, when a string of exhibition events are usually held.

While recognising the potential financial benefits, Mladenovic has described the format change as ‚Äúproblematic.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúIn terms of business strategy, it's a brilliant idea. It guarantees the US Open a much more lucrative third week in terms of ticket sales, on-site consumption, and, I imagine, TV rights.

‚ÄúBut from a sporting point of view, it's problematic because it touches on the essence of tennis. A Grand Slam is a competition steeped in history, in singles and doubles.

‚ÄúAnd now, all of a sudden, the doubles become a super exhibition without anyone or anything having a say.

‚ÄúThere's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam.‚Äù

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Grand slam champions Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu have tennis fans watching both on and off the court.

Ahead of their mixed doubles debut together, the pair created a buzz at the recent Queen's Club Championships in London.

British tabloid newspaper The Sun has reported that the 2021 US Open champion was seen cheering on Alcaraz on two occasions during the tournament, before the Spaniard clinched the grasscourt title on Sunday AEST.

The report also claimed that the pair arrived at the venue within minutes of each other on both occasions, and that Alacaraz was seen at Raducanu's hotel.

Raducanu had been knocked out of the tournament in the quarter-finals earlier in the weekend.

This report, alongside the pair's friendly dynamic, has fuelled speculation that Alcaraz and Raducanu could be romantically involved.

The duo are set to compete together for the mixed doubles trophy at the US Open in August as part of a star-studded line-up of teams for the new-look format.

""I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me ‚Äî I made that special request,"" Alcaraz told reporters earlier this month.

He then added, with a smile: ""She's going to be the boss.

""I've known Emma for a really long time, and I have a really good relationship with her.

""We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really fun.""

When asked about their partnership, Raducanu joked about making Alcaraz wait for her answer.

""Gotta keep them on their toes,"" she told media at Queens.

""I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play, but for me, when he asked me, I was going to say 'yes'. I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach.""

The world No.2 Alcaraz is the favourite to take the title at Wimbledon when the competition starts on Monday, June 30, after his extraordinary come-from-behind win at Roland-Garros this month.

Despite rumours gaining traction, neither Alcaraz nor Raducanu has confirmed any romantic involvement.

When directly asked about the speculation in a recent BBC interview, Raducanu lightheartedly dismissed the talk.

""I'm glad the internet's having fun, and we're providing some entertainment for everyone,"" she said.

Raducanu previously dated Carlo Agostinelli, but ended their relationship last June.

When asked recently about dating, Alcaraz highlighted how being a professional tennis player makes it hard to meet and maintain a romantic relationship.

Alcaraz was previously linked to Spanish celebrity Maria Gonzalez Gimenez, though a relationship was never officially confirmed.

""I am single. I am looking for someone,"" Alcaraz said.

""It can be difficult as a tennis player to meet the right person because you are travelling all the time.""

Both Alcaraz and Raducanu will kick off their campaigns for The Championships next week.

Veteran Australian commentator Tony Jones will not be traveling to London for Wimbledon commentary as Channel Nine dropped him from its coverage. The reason behind this is the controversy he sparked with his comments at this year's Australian Open on Novak Djokovic.

Jones called the World No.6 ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù and a ‚Äúhas-been‚Äù during a live broadcast and this upset the 24-time Grand Slam champion who demanded an apology, boycotting his on-court interview with former player Jim Courier as a result of this. Jones did apologize and Djokovic moved on from the incident.

But now, Jones is again making headlines before Wimbledon, which starts on June 30. The Serb will be entering the tournament to chase his record 25th Grand Slam title. He was the finalist in the last two seasons, losing both matches to World No.2 Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic hasn't yet captured a Major since the 2023 US Open.

At this year's Melbourne Slam, after moving past Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, the 38-year-old handed the walkover to eventual finalist Alexander Zverev in the semifinal after he lost the first set due to an injury.

Then at the French Open, after strong performances one after the other, Djokovic couldn't go past World No.1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinals. He last lifted the Wimbledon title in 2022 by beating Australia's Nick Kyrgios.

Novak Djokovic will be aiming to tie the Wimbledon title tally with Roger Federer, who retired with eight of these trophies. Since 2018, Djokovic has reached the championship match of every Wimbledon, winning the titles from 2018 to 2022 and losing in the last two years to Carlos Alcaraz.

Djokovic ended his title drought by winning the Geneva Open this year, becoming the third man after Federer and Jimmy Connors to win 100 or more titles. It was his first title since last year's Paris Olympics win.

But before the ATP 250 event in the Swiss city, Djokovic lost his opening-round matches in both Monte Carlo and Madrid. Because of his campaign at Roland Garros, Serena Williams‚Äò former coach Patrick Mouratoglou considers Djokovic one of the contenders in the grass-court Major. He wrote on LinkedIn:

Next time you're asked if Novak can win a 25th Grand Slam, think about it, what did he just show us in Paris?

In the clay-court Major, Djokovic was breezing past opponents one after the other, winning his matches in straight sets before he was pitted against World No.3 Alexander Zverev, who took a set off him in the quarterfinals but the 2024 French Open runner-up ended up losing the match in four sets. In the semifinal, eventual finalist Jannik Sinner had to toil hard to knock him out and take a 5-4 lead in the head-to-head matchups.

After a shaky clay season, Novak made it all the way to the Roland Garros semifinals, beating top players like Zverev and pushing world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in a tight three-set match. Technically, physically, he's still at the level. Let's be clear: his tennis hasn't dropped. He's still capable of producing the precision, variation, and timing that made him one of the greatest players in history.

Many fans and tennis pundits think this year's Wimbledon is the last chance for Djokovic to win his 25th Major because it's the only Grand Slam tournament where he has reached the final since winning the 2023 US Open.

Djokovic will be making his 20th consecutive appearance in the third Major of the season. If he wins Wimbledon, he will become the second man to win 100 matches in two different Grand Slam events.

Wimbledon has its pristine grass courts primed for next week and Bernie Tomic, whose first big breakthrough came in London 14 years ago, is back!

Well, sort of.

As a sextet of Aussies begin their bid to qualify for the world's most prestigious tournament on Monday night, the one-time prodigy is preparing for his first tour level match in more than four years.

Watch the biggest Aussie sports & the best from overseas LIVE on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Get your first month for just $1. Limited time offer.

The Queenslander will not be at Wimbledon this year mixing it up with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and company after narrowly missing the cut-off for the qualifying event that is played a few kilometres from the main stage at Roehampton.

But rather than sitting on his heels hoping for some peers to withdraw from Wimbledon qualifying, the one-time boy wonder picked up his racquets and headed for the sun in Spain.



Tomic has been the target of much derision and criticism during a career that dates back to 2008. A degree of it has been deserved but a portion has also been unfair.

But for a player who has been called out for tanking at times ‚Äî the 28 minute blink-and-you-miss-it nightmare in Miami back in 2014 was a nightmare ‚Äî the grizzled veteran deserves a nod for getting back to work.

Far away from the big stages of sport, Tomic has been cracking in on tour backwaters in a bid to break back into the top 100 and return to the grand slam stages in Melbourne, Paris, London and New York.

An opportunity awaits to take a significant step towards that mark on the grass courts of Rafael Nadal's home island of Mallorca this week after the 32-year-old qualified for his first ATP Tour level event since the Australian Open in 2021.

From big-time boasts about his ability and earnings to losing motivation and hitting the ‚Äúparty zone‚Äù in his mid-20s, Tomic has regained his fitness and is becoming tougher to beat.





Over the weekend he defeated Jasper De Jong, a Dutchman ranked 93 who recently won a round at the French Open, and then Aleksandar Kovacevic, an American who sits at 77, to qualify for an event where the winner pockets $162,000.

The prize is a first round meeting against his compatriot Rinky Hijikata, a hard-working Aussie ranked 88 who reached the last 16 at the US Open a couple of years ago.

If the Gold Coaster happens to win that match, he will jump to a spot just outside the top 200, which would put him in the frame to play in qualifying for the US Open in New York in late August.

A slot back in the Big Apple, the city where dreams are made and broken, would be fitting for a tennis player who has ridden the rollercoaster of the sport for much of his life.



THE RISE AND FALL OF BERNARD TOMIC

Any Aussie unaware of the Queenslander's topsy-turvy career would have to have their head in the sand given Tomic's propensity for headline grabbing behaviour during his career between the baselines and beyond it.

It started way back in his early teens when, while indisputably a phenomenon in junior ranks, he reeled off the big names in the sport in declaring the track he felt he was on.

‚ÄúI still need to find the serve of Ivanisevic and the groundstrokes of Federer. I'm halfway there with the mind of Sampras. I've already got the heart of Lleyton,‚Äù he told Inside Sport.

‚ÄúI love all the competition in tennis, the battles, the winning, coming back when no-one thinks you can, like Lleyton. Even when I'm not playing for a few weeks when I have a holiday, I feel so hungry to come back and win tournaments.‚Äù

That interview was back in late 2006, not long after he had won the prestigious Orange Bowl junior event in Florida. 

Not long after Pat Rafter, John Newcombe and Tony Roche watched him in a junior match at the Australian Open, a year prior to Tomic becoming the youngest player to win the event in 2008. 

Blessed with beautiful touch and the brain to work the angles on court, he also won the boys event at the US Open in successes that inspired sponsors like Nike and Head to sign him, while also earning him representation from behemoth agency IMG.



This journalist first talked to Tomic in 2008 after a narrow loss in a Futures event in Gippsland to Nick Lindahl, another talent who was later banned for seven years on match fixing charges.

Tomic was chatty and happy to discuss his hopes. His dad John? Less so, judging by an interaction on returning to the club house afterwards. That one did not make the headlines but other altercations did over the years following as his son strove for greatness.

Tomic's best run at a grand slam came at Wimbledon in 2011 when he became the youngest player since Boris Becker in 1986 to reach the quarterfinals. There he fell to Novak Djokovic in four sets. 

Later that year he played alongside Lleyton Hewitt in an epic Davis Cup tie in Rose Bay in Sydney against a Switzerland team featuring Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.

He won the Sydney International in 2013 along with other ATP Tour titles in Italy, China and Colombia. He reached quarterfinals at Masters events and finals at ATP 500 level.

In January, 2016, he peaked at an ATP ranking of 17. That ranking is not as high as many, including Tomic, predicted. But during a golden period, he broke into the top 20 and featured in second weeks of grand slam tournaments. 

For all the critics who have dumped on Tomic, it is worth reiterating he was the 17th best tennis player in the world at a point in time on merit. He has played 37 grand slam tournaments. It is a decent career.





As to the controversies? Man, oh man. Where to begin? How about back in 2009 at Wimbledon when his agent told Hewitt he was not good enough to hit with Tomic, who was just 16?

Or the time where his dad blasted Tennis Australia officials for scheduling a night match past his bedtime? That, to be fair, was at the minor end of some of John Tomic's sins.

Tomic was pulled up three times in one day by Gold Coast police for traffic breaches and was placed on a Good Behaviour Bond for other incidents while driving flashy cars in the Sunshine State.

He carried Davis Cup teams at times and was dumped on other occasions for a poor attitude. He pissed it up big-time in Miami and got himself arrested, teed off at a journalist after a poor US Open loss, berated Hewitt and got into a war of words with Nick Kyrgios.

Tomic tanked matches, was booed off courts and received some hefty fines. As recently as last August, he was heckling rivals from a grandstand after a Challenger tour loss. 



To suggest he has had a colourful career would be an understatement. 

But even after all the drama, when journalists bumped him into at events, he would be quick to ask about someone's kids, or make a quip about something that had happened on court.

Was he treated unfairly while at the top? Even Tomic was not prepared to go that far in a recent chat on tennis podcast The Changeover when assessing how his career has been covered, particularly at a time when it seemed he was in court as often as he was on court.

‚ÄúI mean, the Australian media is probably the worst media in the world. Don't get me wrong, I did stuff, for sure, that did provoke it. I wasn't the smartest guy in the town,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe media, at the end of the day, want to sell papers. No-one's going to wake up and want to read something good about someone. They want to read something bad and stuff. So if they have any ‚Ä¶ any sort of little flame to pick on, they can, because they know that's going to sell. 

‚ÄúObviously I did stuff that was, for sure, not right. I didn't do a lot of things on court that were wrong with referees and this ‚Ä¶ but I would let go sometimes and tank and not be there. I'm sure many players have done some stuff throughout these last 10 years. 

‚ÄúI probably didn't do it the right way ‚Ä¶ and they did pick on me a little bit of the time, the media, but it's not like I have an issue with them.‚Äù



ENTERING THE ‚ÄúPARTY ZONE‚Äù

What went wrong? In his recent chat with The Changeover, Tomic highlighted a few threads that will scarcely surprise as his ranking plummeted to beyond the 1200 mark in 2023.

Injuries were a factor. The 28-minute nightmare in the Miami Masters against Jarkko Niemennen followed a hip surgery in 2014 that required three months rehabilitation.

He endured wrist and back problems in 2016, issues that have derailed more accomplished players than himself including Juan Martin del Potro, a rival whose talent he clearly rates.

And there was burnout, which will surprise no-one. Tomic admits he did not have the maturity to deal with the fame, the expectations and the commitment in his early 20s.

‚ÄúI sort of let go. I just lost the hunger,‚Äù he said. 

‚ÄúHow can I say it? Obviously I worked really hard when I was young. I missed my childhood, whatever, but then it got to the stage where, how can I say it, I didn't feel fulfilled. Even winning on the court, I just wanted to be normal. The travelling? Man, it destroyed me at 24. 

‚ÄúNow compared to who I was 10 years ago. I see things differently and react differently (but) tennis is a very isolated, very tough sport. You're travelling on your own. You've got to give up your whole life. You're not surrounded by a team (and) you're on your own. You lose. You're on your own. You go back to the room, feeling bad, being alone, away from friends, away from family.‚Äù





From free-wheeling in fast and furious cars in his early 20s, by the time Covid-19 hit Tomic was committed to the circuit. The problem for his career was that it was the party circuit.

‚ÄúI didn't train a lot, honestly, from 26 to 28. During the Covid period, I partied heaps. There was nothing to do except party, you know,‚Äù he told The Changeover.

‚ÄúThere was nothing to do. And prior to those two years, I was already, like, mucking around partying. So it was like a three year party zone. 

‚Äú(But then) I was like, ‚ÄòOkay, I've got one more shot at tennis. I better get back.' It took me like, a year, and a year and a half to get my fitness back. I would play a match and I was, like, dead.‚Äù



THE LONG ROAD BACK

For a bloke who was burned out and candidly admits he is past his prime, Tomic understands why people might be asking why he is out on back blocks grinding away.

It has been a while since his infamous ‚Äúcounting my millions‚Äù quote after an Aussie Open qualifying loss, but the 32-year-old has earned more than A$10 million in prize money, and also have benefited from lucrative sponsorships and appearance fees earlier in his career.

Partying can be expensive and so, too, the lifestyle associated with being a tennis player. 

But Tomic had a realisation. He may not love it, but he was damned good at tennis and it is the only life he has ever really known.

Over the past 12 months Tomic has bounced from the US to South America and back to America. He has played matches in Calgary and Noumea, Pune and Mexico City.

And it has been tough. While Tomic is adamant the top 10 in his prime were better ‚Äî he played the Big 4 and other big names in prime time outings ‚Äî he says the depth is stronger than ever on the tour, with rivals ranked down to the 500s outstanding in their own right.

Changes in the amount of points offered at lower levels have made it harder to climb back to where he wants to get to, which is the top 100. That would give him entry back into grand slams and the top tier events on the tour.





‚ÄúTennis has become part of my life ever since I was seven. Obviously I had a dad that pushed me extremely hard and that's one of the reasons I got there, in a sense,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut when you look at this whole picture, now that I'm 32, it's a purpose. It still gives me something to do. Without tennis, I don't know what I would do. 

‚ÄúI'm sitting about 200 in the world, or whatever, and my goal is to be top 100 and ‚Ä¶ and then I can retire. It's more of a statement, that sort of thing, so let's see if I can do it. 

‚ÄúBut the whole sort of sense (that) you've got to find your purpose, something that gets you going now that you're older, you want something to give. And it's about tennis.

‚ÄúIt's the only thing I'm good at. I've been good at it for almost three decades, so it gets me going. I can still play decent. I'm not in my prime like I was ‚Ä¶ but that's why I'm challenging myself to get back there one more time. And then (I can) retire happy (and) guilt free.‚Äù

Can Bernie get back? De Jong and Kovacevic, the blokes he beat on the weekend, will be playing at Wimbledon next week, and so too will Hijikata and much of the Mallorca draw headed by American star Ben Shelton and Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Making the jump from 200 to 100 is as tough as coming back from beyond 1200 a couple of years back to get to where he is now. And a bad back that flares on occasion will make it tougher. But if he can continue a winning run this week, Tomic Mark II will be on his way.

 Mallorca is a breeding ground for talent. Famously, the small Mediterranean island has produced some of the biggest names in tennis this century, from Carlos Moya to Rafael Nadal. But it can also count an international basketball star among its ranks in Rudy Fernandez. 

 The former Portland Trail Blazer and Denver Nuggets player on Sunday visited the Mallorca Championships presented by ecotrans Group, where he met the grass ATP 250 tournament's top seed, Ben Shelton. 

 After greeting each other on the tennis court, the No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings Shelton took the lead and invited his guest to a few rallies. The American was surprised by Fernandez's ability with racquet in hand. 

 ‚ÄúHe's a better tennis player than I was expecting,‚Äù admitted Shelton after challenging Fernandez, who also represented Real Madrid and Joventut Badalona in the Spanish basketball league. ‚ÄúHe told me that he plays golf sometimes with Rafa [Nadal], so maybe something has rubbed off from Rafa because his forehand is pretty good.‚Äù

 But the challenges did not stop there. After knocking up on the courts of the Mallorca Country Club, it was then Shelton's turn to show off his skills with a basketball under the watchful eye of a crowd of fans who were following the showdown between the two stars. 

 ‚ÄúIt was fun, Rudy is a really nice guy, I'd never met him before,‚Äù continued Shelton. ‚ÄúI knew about him. There aren't many Spanish players who have played in the NBA. He played in the Spanish league and also for Portland and Denver, so it was great to meet him.‚Äù 



 Shelton did not back down from the challenge and proved to be just as handy with a basketball as Rudy Fernandez was on the tennis court. The American even provided his new acquaintance with an alley-oop, which Rudy duly dunked home. 

 ‚ÄúHe's a great guy. He spends his summers in the USA. It was fun, really fun,‚Äù reflected Shelton. ‚ÄúI love playing basketball. It's fun, probably my second-favourite sport and I like watching it too.‚Äù

A year after season-ending wrist surgery, the 23-year-old from Rome is pushing to get back to where he once was ... and beyond.ByFlorian HeerPublished Jun 24, 2025 copy_link

A year after being forced to retire mid-match against Martin Klizan at the Emilia-Romagna Tennis Cup, Giulio Zeppieri is back on tour with renewed focus and determination.The 23-year-old from Rome, once ranked as high as world No. 110, says he is working hard to rebuild his momentum after a long injury layoff.‚ÄúIt was my last tournament before my wrist surgery,‚Äù Zeppieri recalled, speaking in Sassulo last week, one year removed from his serious injury. ‚ÄúI felt the pain already at Roland Garros, but I tried to play a couple more tournaments.

Born in Rome, Zeppieri earned his first ATP ranking point at just 16 and quickly rose through the ranks; he hit his career-high of No. 110 in early 2024 after a second-round effort at the Australian Open as a qualifier. His junior career was also impressive, reaching the semifinals of both singles and doubles at the 2019 Australian Open alongside fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti.As his comeback has continued to take shape, Zeppieri was thrust into the spotlight in Paris, where he faced world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in the first round of Roland Garros.‚ÄúI always played well in Paris. I played there four times in a row and never lost in qualifying,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúObviously, the match against Carlos was very tough. I didn't have a chance, but it was nice to play on a big court, which is also good for my mindset.‚ÄùReflecting on the fact that junior success doesn't always transate to professional tennis, Zeppieri said: ‚ÄúIt's almost a different sport, physically but also on the mental part. At junior level, you still have chances to win even if you don't play your best tennis. On the pro circuit, this becomes really difficult. You have to stay focused through the entire match and not give your opponent any room.‚Äù

Despite recent setbacks, Zeppieri remains positive about Italian tennis and the strong support system behind it.‚ÄúA lot of players of my age worked really hard. The federation in Italy does a good job. They give us wild cards, provide us with coaches and physios. This is key. It's also important to have so many ATP Challengers in Italy. It gives you a chance to play at different levels right from the start.‚ÄùThat support continues today.‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù Zeppieri affirmed. ‚ÄúI received wild cards into the Challenger in Perugia and Sassuolo, for example. They also supported me after my surgery and tried all they could do. I am really glad about this.‚Äù

As for his game, Zeppieri describes himself as an offensive player.‚ÄúThe volley is probably not my best shot,‚Äù he admitted, ‚Äúbut I try to work on it. I play with a lot of spin with my forehand, which isn't ideal on indoor hard courts, although I did win a Challenger in Cherbourg. I also like grass. I think being a lefty is an advantage. Right-handers don't play that often against lefties.‚ÄùEyes back on the Top 150To return to his prior position, his tournament schedule remains packed.‚ÄúI will play the qualifying at Wimbledon and will return to clay afterwards,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI still have the chance to use my protected ranking and will probably play the ATP events in Umag and Bastad to gain some points.‚ÄùHow does preparation for the grass look like?‚ÄúI don't prepare for the grass,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúOne big player told me that you don't need to. He said you just have to play as fast as you can.‚Äù

Off the court, Zeppieri keeps things balanced. He enjoys video games, spending time with his girlfriend, and catching up with his family near Rome. A proud supporter of AS Roma, he also follows snooker, having idolized Ronnie O'Sullivan alongside his childhood tennis hero Roger Federer.Looking ahead, Zeppieri has clear goals.‚ÄúI want to get back into the Top 150 and be seeded in the qualifying of the Australian Open,"" he said. ""Now it's important for me to get rhythm, playing as many tournaments as possible and enjoy spending my time on the court.‚Äù

In a truly dramatic Formula 1 season, the 1999 European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring had it all with a shock winner, changeable conditions and implications on the title race.

To mark F1's 75th anniversary celebrations, F1.com is counting down the sport's 25 greatest races with a new feature every week. While you may not agree with the order, we hope you enjoy the stories of these epic races that have helped make this sport what it is today. You can read the introduction to the series and see the list of races here.

At No. 19, Mike Seymour brings together voices that remember the dramatic 1999 European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. That season had already proven to be one of the most memorable in F1 history, but round 14 provided another incredible spectacle as Johnny Herbert secured a shock win for Stewart Grand Prix.

Last year marked 25 years since one of the most incident-packed and gripping seasons in F1 history, which F1.com documented in a special anniversary mini-series.

Round 14 of 16 summed it up in a single race, with the 1999 European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring featuring mixed weather conditions, various incidents, championship implications, technical controversy and an underdog winner.

Below, we retell the events of that day through the eyes and ears of those sitting in the cockpit, perched on the pit wall and watching on from the media centre...

If fans thought the 1999 season up to this point had been intense, they were in for another dramatic weekend amid changeable conditions at the Nurburgring. While title rivals Mika Hakkinen and particularly Eddie Irvine faced problems (more on that later), the Stewart Grand Prix cars of Johnny Herbert and Rubens Barrichello charged their way through the field from mid-grid starting positions to contend for an unlikely win, making the most of a scary first-lap crash, several spins and technical-related retirements elsewhere.

At the end of it all, Herbert was the man who came out on top, having timed his move to wet tyres perfectly, while Barrichello ‚Äì who lost some time sticking with slicks ‚Äì backed him up in third position, just behind Jarno Trulli's Prost. It marked a memorable and emotional moment for Herbert, who had overcome severe foot injuries sustained in his junior single-seater days to record a third and final F1 victory, as well as for the team led by former world champion Jackie Stewart and his son Paul, as they achieved a landmark triumph in what proved to be their third and final F1 season before selling up to Ford and Jaguar.

Johnny Herbert, Stewart Grand Prix driver: ‚ÄúThe first thing [I noticed] was the wind when we got on the grid. I was 14th and Rubens was 15th, and all I remember is the wind was blowing directly up the straight. When you go down towards Turn 1, keep going for about 40 kilometres and you're at Spa, and we know what happens at Spa with the weather. The race started, we got going, then I noticed this cloud in the distance, a bit wider than the track ‚Äì it looked like a rain drop shape. Then it just got closer and closer. It kept coming dead straight over the middle of the circuit, never went left, never went right. I went, ‚ÄòWhen it comes, it's going to throw it down'.

‚ÄúLuckily, when I was about to come in [for a pit stop]‚Ä¶ I was doing my in-lap, so I got called in, got to the far end of the circuit, and it just started to spit with rain. As I got back to the pits and stopped, I'd been on the radio and said, ‚ÄòPut wets on'. Rubens came in the next lap and put on slicks, so it was something that catapulted me to be in the mix. It [the rain] lasted longer than I thought and I was going 12 seconds faster than anyone else.

‚ÄúIt was very special [to win] because the Nordschleife itself, it was one of Sir Jackie's last wins there, so there was a connection with my win, their [Stewart Grand Prix's] first win and Jackie and his racing career at the same time. I was pleased for myself, but I think I was probably more pleased for my crew, who had put in a lot of hard work and stuck by me. It's always pleasing to see the smiles on their faces when you get back to the garage, and it's because of them that I was able to achieve my last win.‚Äù

Dave Redding, Race Operations and Reliability Engineer, Stewart Grand Prix: ‚ÄúI was looking at car data and health then and you could see everything unfolding, but as people kept stopping and changing tyres as the conditions changed, you just couldn't believe what you were watching, because you were just thinking, ‚ÄòWhy are you doing it?' ‚Äì it just didn‚Äòt make any sense. Then we thought they were going to catch us and then they stopped again, so [we thought], ‚ÄòWe're going to win this'. Then it turns to, ‚ÄòHopefully it doesn't break down'.

‚ÄúIn those days we didn't have radar, or not every team; we certainly didn't have radar or all the things that we have today. As Johnny said, it was more a case of guesswork, really. Even now, at Spa it's notoriously difficult to predict what the weather is doing, even with the radar and everything else, all the tools you have available. Was it luck? A little bit, because obviously we needed the weather to interrupt. But did we make the right decisions at the right time? Absolutely.

‚ÄúJohnny I've known for years, because I was at Benetton when he was there, even when he was a young driver when he broke his feet. I've known him for a long, long time, so it was very emotional. The next day at the factory, Jackie organised champagne for everybody, so basically it was a half day. We got to lunch time, we'd had champagne and not a lot happened after that! It was a long celebration.‚Äù

Rubens Barrichello, Stewart Grand Prix driver: ‚ÄúAs soon as we put the car on the track it was amazing. For me, one of the highlights was leading the Brazilian Grand Prix. [Claiming pole position and finishing third at] Magny-Cours was also a good time. The Nurburgring was fantastic for the team, but it was a disappointment [for me] because I [stayed] on slicks. Eventually I won in 2000 [at Hockenheim] with Ferrari because of that, but at the Nurburgring it didn't work. If it wasn't for that I was going to win. But still, to be part of the Stewart family, such a nice family, hard-working, with Paul, Mark, and with Jackie, obviously, was phenomenal. That '99 season gave me a really good chance‚Ä¶ It was when I opened the eyes of probably everyone, so I'm so thankful.‚Äù

David Tremayne, Hall of Fame F1 Journalist: ‚ÄúI had this thing with Jackie about clothes. I was wearing Tommy Hilfiger shirts and the like in those days. At Monza, I went to the Stewart team and he said, ‚ÄòOh, ladies and gentleman look, a journalist!' I said to him, ‚ÄòI tell you what, when you guys win a race, I will wear a Tommy Hilfiger shirt and a pair of your tartan trousers'. Anyway, Jackie's on the podium at the Nurburgring, he's holding up the plate, then he looks down at me and just points.

‚ÄúWhen I was driving back from Heathrow after the race, he phoned and said, ‚ÄòDavid, it's Jackie, I'd like you to go and see my tailor!' It was Doug Hayward, this famous guy in Mount Street, and I got fitted for a pair of these tartan trousers, which still fit, funnily enough. Then I had a picture with Paul and Jackie, wearing our tartan trousers ‚Äì it must have been in Malaysia. But I thought it was wonderful that Johnny won.‚Äù

Johnny Herbert, Jackie Stewart and Rubens Barrichello celebrate on the podium at the European Grand Prix

While Herbert, Barrichello and Stewart all deservedly enjoyed the celebrations, several factors played a role in the result. Firstly, the conditions, which saw several drivers, including Hakkinen, get caught out by running the wrong tyres at the wrong time ‚Äì leaving the McLaren a lowly fifth. Then, at Ferrari, a painfully slow pit stop, where mechanics haplessly searched for a missing tyre, sent Irvine ‚Äì who had taken on the team leader role at Ferrari after Michael Schumacher's leg-breaking crash at Silverstone ‚Äì tumbling down the order to an eventual P7 finish, outside the points.

There were also spins and slides out of the lead of the race for David Coulthard, Benetton's Giancarlo Fisichella and Williams' Ralf Schumacher (who picked up a puncture) in the mixed conditions, and arguably the most painful retirement of them all was suffered by Jordan and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who had started on pole position but came unstuck when his engine shut down after a pit stop.

Sam Michael, Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Race Engineer: ‚ÄúI remember the last practice session before Qualifying, we'd had a reliability issue, so we spent a lot of time parked in the garage. We got the car fixed in enough time that there was like a minute left, so as long as you get out of the pits, you can go around and do pretty much 99% of the timed lap, apart from the last corner. Heinz had had no practice at all on Saturday morning and he went out, started a timed lap ‚Äì everyone had been running for 45 minutes to an hour ‚Äì and all the sectors were purple, purple, purple‚Ä¶ It was good enough for P1, easily, so straight away we knew the car was fast, and he qualified on pole.

‚ÄúThe race went really well until the first pit stop. Unlike Monza, where Mika was clearly quicker, we did look like we had enough to take it to them. Then we had the anti-stall cut the engine after the pit stop and that was the end of it. Frustratingly, I'm not sure we even gained much out of using a loophole, that was legal at the time, to try and improve the starts. It wasn't intended to trigger during a pit stop, it was only for the race start. We were stretching the rules, but isn't that what F1's all about?

‚ÄúThe rules at the time did not say how much you had to activate the clutch. What we did was detect low engine revs at the start, put some throttle on but only a little clutch; the theory was to use lower revs and get better traction off the line. There was another part to the rule that said if you trigger an anti-stall and don't cancel it within 10 seconds on the steering wheel then it turns the engine off, and that's what happened that day.‚Äù

Mark Gallagher, Head of Marketing, Jordan: ‚ÄúThere was a point in that race where I remember thinking, ‚ÄòOh my Lord, this might come to us, and it could be epic', but no sooner had you had that thought everything went pear-shaped and it was game over. When we got the car back, it was fine. Because of my role in marketing and communications, we had to decide what to tell the media. There was a little bit of a moment in the team, because‚Ä¶ He wasn't an extremely senior member of the team, but an important member of the team spoke to journalists and kind of said it was Heinz's fault, and that was not the way we wanted to play it.

‚ÄúI remember talking to Eddie [Jordan] about it and saying, ‚ÄòYou win as a team and you lose as a team', and if we're going to deal with this we need to be protective of Heinz, because he's just won two Grands Prix for us and he's been doing a fantastic job. Do you throw him to the wolves or do you put out a press statement saying we had an electronic issue with the car that caused the stopping? So that's what we did. But honestly speaking, the degree to which we were in with a shout of winning the championship that year only really became apparent, I think, to many of us, with the passage of time.‚Äù

Marco Fainello, Head of Vehicle Dynamics, Ferrari: ‚ÄúI read recently in a paper that Ferrari on purpose could not find the tyre for Eddie at the Nurburgring, that they didn't want Eddie to win, or Michael on purpose could not allow Eddie to win the championship‚Ä¶ I'm sure it's not the case. Michael didn't like that someone else was going to win, of course he wants to win it himself, but he would have never done anything bad for the team ‚Äì he's really a team man.‚Äù

Louise Goodman, ITV F1 reporter: ‚ÄúI remember the tyre incident with Eddie, but a championship is made up of a series of moments good and bad ‚Äì you can never really pinpoint the ifs, buts and what ifs. Yes, they all contribute, but I think very often, for every driver, somewhere down the line there's a mistake, an issue, a failure, whatever it might be, and it's the sum of having less than anybody else that makes for a championship win.‚Äù

Sam Michael: ‚ÄúYou look at someone like Heinz and that was probably his best chance at a championship. He could look back and wonder what if, but you can also say that the entire year was a resurgence of Heinz, and there was a strong feeling of pride, throughout the whole team, to have played a part in that. A few things went the other way; it wasn't just that Grand Prix, there were other things that happened during the year. But how many drivers get close to saying, ‚ÄòI could have won the World Championship?' It's a pretty small pool where you can make a mathematical argument that you could have won it. I know it's not as good as winning it, but that's the way it is.

‚ÄúHeinz was really good afterwards with the team. He was annoyed at himself, but that was probably one of the most special things about that team at the time, that we were all in it together ‚Äì we won together and lost together. We overachieved. We were in a place that we perhaps shouldn't have been and I remember Damon [Hill] saying to me in the truck after the race that it's natural to make mistakes when you're in those positions, because the team isn't used to it yet.‚Äù

Mark Gallagher: ‚ÄúFrankly, the disappointment had to be parked for a while. The weird thing is, if you were going to wish that someone else won the race, I couldn't have thought of a better person than Johnny, who had won the British F3 championship for Jordan, and Jackie, who had also managed to start an independently owned F1 team. While we'd rather have won, it was quite nice to see another underdog achieve the victory.‚Äù

F1 The Movie London premiere interview highlights

Behind the scenes with Brad Pitt | Exclusive Interview

Following the dramatic Canadian Grand Prix that saw George Russell claim victory, F1 heads back to Europe with the Austrian Grand Prix next up on the calendar.

Fresh from the mid-summer visit to North America, it's back to Europe for the next few months, starting with a double-header.

After the drama of the closing stages in Canada, the next stop is another venue that has provided plenty of action in recent years as we head for the Red Bull Ring in Austria.

Mercedes arrives in Austria off the back of their best weekend of the year so far, with George Russell winning from pole position in Montreal and Kimi Antonelli picking up his first podium in third place.

A year ago, Mercedes had also been extremely competitive in Canada but failed to win, and then had a tougher time of things at the Red Bull Ring. Despite that, they ended up with a victory as Russell took advantage of the late contact between Lando Norris and Max Verstappen, as the team went on a particularly strong mid-season run.

Given the form that they showed last time out, could Mercedes be in the mix at the front once again?

If they are to do so, they may need a bit of help from the weather forecast, that shows a cool and potentially damp start to the race weekend, but higher temperatures coming into play by the time Qualifying and the race take place.

The Canadian Grand Prix was a rare off-weekend for McLaren, who were still extremely competitive but failed to qualify on the front row or finish with a car on the podium. That marked the first time this season that either of those milestones had been missed, but they were fighting for third place when their two cars came together late on.

Lando Norris took full responsibility for the contact with Oscar Piastri, that ended Norris' race but did not prevent his team mate from going on to finish fourth.

It was a tough moment for Norris, but his response helped defuse a potentially more significant situation for Team Principal Andrea Stella to handle. And he quickly stated he would look to learn from his mistake and move on.

There can be few better places for Norris to try and bounce back, as the Red Bull Ring was the scene of his first podium in Formula 1 back in 2020, a performance he repeated in 2021. He was trying to overtake Verstappen for victory here a year ago when the pair collided, so it has often been a strong venue for Norris, who needs to outscore Piastri or risk falling more than a race win behind the championship leader.

It really does feel like it is Max Verstappen's fanbase who are more worried about a race suspension than the reigning World Champion himself, who was very quick to show his displeasure at repeated questions relating to his penalty points situation in Montreal.

Verstappen is just one penalty point away from what would be an automatic one-race ban, meaning he cannot afford to be the guilty party in any incidents this weekend.

After the next race, two penalty points drop off his licence having been earned 12 months ago ‚Äì in the collision with Norris in last year's Austrian Grand Prix, that took place on June 30 ‚Äì meaning Verstappen will have that little bit more breathing room, but he will remain on nine points until late October.

Verstappen showed the situation was having no impact on his driving during the Canadian weekend as he qualified on the front row and finished second despite coming under pressure at different points, but what is often a large Dutch contingent at the Red Bull Ring will likely breathe out a little once this weekend is safely navigated, too.

You might have noticed just a little bit of excitement and hype around the upcoming movie ‚ÄòF1', that was often filmed during race weekends and features real footage of actors Brad Pitt and Damson Idris driving at speed on track.

Following the spectacular world premiere that was held in New York City at the start of last week, it is very nearly your turn to get to see the end product, with the film having a release date of June 25th ‚Äì although a number of other countries including the United States have to wait that little bit longer until Friday, June 27th.

Featuring cameos from plenty of your favourite drivers and team bosses too, it's a spectacular offering from Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski and legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and with plenty of input from Lewis Hamilton as well it aims to be the most authentic racing movie ever made.

There might have been a lot of focus on the F1 movie premiere last week, but there was also a very significant piece of business that was concluded by one of the teams.

Williams announced that Team Principal James Vowles has signed a new long-term contract to remain in his position, having held the role for two and a half years so far.

Over that time, Williams have already shown signs of clear progress, and currently sit fifth in the Constructors' Championship with 55 points ‚Äì more than the entire total from the past three seasons combined. They have also made a number of key hires, including adding Carlos Sainz to this year's driver line-up alongside Alex Albon, who has enjoyed an extremely impressive 2025 so far.

Vowles says Williams have put the foundations in place for future success, and they certainly appear well-placed to continue their momentum into the new era that starts in 2026. But there is still a lot of work to be done to turn the team into true contenders for race victories and championships on a regular basis, with just one podium in the past eight years.

Securing a long-term commitment from Vowles is a sign of the belief in the direction that Williams are heading from both the Team Principal himself but also their owners Dorilton Capital. It'll be a boost for the entire team, as they look to continue their best start to a season since 2016.

Join our F1 Nation crew as they get stuck into the big talking points ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix weekend.

After a well deserved weekend off, Formula 1 is back with the Austrian Grand Prix as racing returns to Europe. TheF1 Nation crew are here to discuss all of the big talking points ahead of the Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring.

Host Tom Clarkson is joined by former Renault driver Jolyon Palmer and F1 TV's lead presenter Laura Winter to discuss all the stories going into the weekend.

What's next for McLaren after the collision between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in Canada and how will that affect their championship battle going forward? And does it mean McLaren will change their approach to racing?

Palmer also talks through the characteristics of the Red Bull Ring, explaining why the first few corners provide so much action and why we can expect lots of overtaking.

There will also be plenty of attention on Max Verstappen and whether he will be fighting the McLarens for his fifth win in Spielberg. Mercedes will also want to build on their first victory of the year in Montreal, while Ferrari will hope to secure a fourth podium in a row at this track.

Plus, ahead of this week's release of F1 The Movie with Brad Pitt, Clarkson has been speaking to two of the film's stars, Damson Idris and Kerry Condon.

McLaren have confirmed Alex Dunne will fill in for Lando Norris during the first practice session at the Austrian Grand Prix weekend, while Dino Beganovic will turn out for Ferrari.

McLaren have confirmed that Formula 2 standings leader Alex Dunne will take part in Free Practice 1 at the 2025 Austrian Grand Prix, with Dino Beganovic also due to drive for Ferrari in the same session.

Dunne, a member of the McLaren Driver Development Programme since May 2024, will get behind the wheel of the MCL39 in the weekend's opening session in place of Lando Norris to become the first Irish driver to take part in an F1 weekend for 22 years.

The 19-year-old currently races for Rodin Motorsport in F2, as he sits three points ahead of second-placed Richard Verschoor in the standings, while he also serves as Reserve and Development Driver for the NEOM McLaren Formula E Team.

Dunne began karting at eight years old, and secured his first European karting title in the 2019 WSK Champions Cup OKJ Category. He then made his single-seater debut in the 2021 Spanish F4 Championship, securing pole position and a podium on his debut.

In his 2022 season, he picked up a combined 16 race wins whilst competing in the British, UAE, and Italian Formula 4 Championships, earning him the British F4 Championship, before going on to earn the vice-champion title in the GB3 Championship the following year.

Dunne then moved on to Formula 3 for 2024 with MP Motorsport, where he finished 14th in the Drivers' Standings, before stepping up to F2 this season.

The last Irish driver to participate in a Grand Prix weekend was Ralph Firman in 2003, who competed for Jordan Grand Prix that year.

‚ÄúIt's an amazing opportunity to be able to drive during FP1 in Austria,"" said Dunne. ""I'm really looking forward to getting laps in behind the wheel of the MCL39 and supporting the team with the setup for the race weekend ahead.

‚ÄúI've been preparing well for the sessions, taking part in Testing of Previous Cars tests in the MCL60 and spending time on the simulator, which has been a fantastic learning experience. Thank you to Zak [Brown], Andrea [Stella] and Alessandro [Alunni Bravi] for their faith in me. It's a great step within my development with the McLaren Driver Development Programme, and I'm really excited to join the team trackside.‚Äù

McLaren Team Principal, Andrea Stella, said: ‚ÄúIt's great to be able to give Alex the opportunity to run in Free Practice 1, and for him to get valuable time behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car as part of his development.

""The team are pleased to be working with him more closely, and for his support across the weekend, where he will be providing useful feedback to help with the car's set-up. The rookie sessions are fantastic for seeing the talent of tomorrow and enabling that rare chance to get time in a current car, so we look forward to seeing him on track.‚Äù

Elsewhere, Swedish driver Beganovic will step into the cockpit for Ferrari in Austria for his second FP1 appearance of the season, having already done so in Bahrain earlier this year.

Ferrari junior Beganovic, who currently competes in F2 with Hitech TGR, is a champion in Formula Regional European and a race winner in F3. He will sit in for Charles Leclerc in the opening session at the Red Bull Ring.

Andreas Briese, director for Germany and regional director for Central and Northern Europe at the giant video platform, highlighted newer opportunities for TV in the opening keynote at NATPE Budapest.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	‚ÄúYouTube can be a partner to your business and boost your business.‚Äù This is how Andreas Briese, a top executive at the Google-owned video platform in his role as country director for Germany and regional director for Central and Northern Europe (CCE), pitched YouTube as a partner for the TV industry, rather than a rival, during the opening keynote of NATPE Budapest 2025 on Tuesday.


	‚ÄúYouTube can be a partner to engage with new audiences, to unlock new revenue streams and also innovate,‚Äù he argued.




			Related Video		







	He pointed to a previously disclosed figure to highlight the reach and power of YouTube. The platform, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year, paid $70 billion-plus to creators, artists and media companies over the last three years, he mentioned, concluding: ‚ÄúNo other platform is operating on that scale.‚Äù

	Bries also emphasized that YouTube needs TV and other content partners, citing YouTube CEO Neal Mohan who previously explained the video platform's exit from creating content itself by acknowledging:‚ÄúWe weren't good at picking content.‚Äù


	As a consequence, ‚Äúwe are only successful if you are successful,‚Äù including through YouTube's revenue-share model, Briese said, with content partners bringing the premium content and talent that audiences crave. In turn, YouTube allows for monetization of content and data sharing tools that provide opportunities to optimize content, among other things.

	











	‚ÄúTelevision became the leading device of YouTube in the U.S.,‚Äù Briese also highlighted in his NATPE Budapest keynote. ‚ÄúIt's the most watched streaming service on TV devices, ahead of Netflix, Prime, Hulu, etc. We know in many other markets that is also the case. YouTube is currently serving 1 billion hours of TV watch time a day.‚Äù


	Also key is that 50 percent of this TV watch time is ‚Äúcoming from content that is longer than 20 minutes, which means longform content is driving TV consumption of YouTube,‚Äù he said.


	Outlining the YouTube advertising revenue model, Briese emphasized an aspect that isn't always fully understood. ‚ÄúWe share revenues with our partners ‚Äî that's the bread and butter business of YouTube,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWhat is important to understand is revenues do not scale with views on our platform, they scale with watch time. The more content is watched, the more we are able to sell ad breaks before and in between your content. And this is why watch time is really, really important,‚Äù and that's why producers and broadcasters look to allow users to engage more with long-form content on YouTube, ‚Äúbecause that is driving watch time.‚Äù


	He mentioned the example of Channel 4 in the U.K., which has shared data that shows that the broadcaster increased its longform content on YouTube by 81 percent, but boosted total time viewed on YouTube by 105 percent, full episode views by 169 percent and YouTube revenue by 78 percent. Briese didn't detail what period that data was for.

	











	In terms of full episodes of TV content coming to YouTube, ‚Äúwe have seen interesting approaches, which both pay tribute to the fact that it's a distribution platform, but also a marketing platform,‚Äù the executive told NATPE Budapest. For example, Paramount+, one week after the launch of the first episode of Lioness launched the same episode in its full length on YouTube for a period of time ‚Äúto drive, of course, watch time, but also as a promotional tool to drive awareness of their own service,‚Äù Briese explained.


	Similarly, Disney+ brought the full first season of Andor to YouTube before the launch of season 2 ‚Äúas a loyalty instrument to create awareness and also to drive traffic back to Disney+,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat we do see is, specifically when we talk about producers and broadcasters, that often longform content represents a minority of their uploads, but the majority of their revenues and their watch time.‚Äù


	The YouTube exec also pointed to YouTube as a place for innovation for content partners or, as he called it, a ‚Äúpetri dish to test new formats.‚Äù In the gaming space, that has been the case. And more recently, ‚Äúyou see, for example, for live streaming a trend toward group watching of live videos,‚Äù Briese said.


	NATPE Budapest, which has positioned itself as a platform for deal-making, exchange and content discovery, as well as ‚Äúa launchpad for the next wave of formats, scripted hits, and cross-border partnerships,‚Äù said Monday that its latest edition was welcoming more than 750 delegates from 65-plus countries, including more than 400 buyers, up from last year.

‚ÄúThe one thing that I would say I agonized over a little bit was just, ‚ÄòAm I helping?'‚Äù the actor said. 


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


Pedro Pascal is looking back at calling author J.K. Rowling a ‚Äúheinous loser‚Äù for her anti-trans views.  


	In April, the actor responded to a social media post by activist Tariq Ra'ouf, who criticized Rowling for celebrating the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's landmark ruling that trans women should not be recognized as women and that ‚Äúsex‚Äù should legally mean biological sex.




	Rowling had posted, ‚ÄúI love it when a plan comes together,‚Äù and added to the critic, ‚ÄúI get the same royalties whether you read [my books] or burn them. Enjoy your marshmallows!‚Äù

	In the comment section of Ra'ouf's post, Pascal wrote, ‚ÄúAwful disgusting SHIT is exactly right. Heinous LOSER behavior.‚Äù


	For his Vanity Fair cover story published Tuesday, Pascal said his comment growing into a larger story made him feel like ‚Äúthat kid that got sent to the principal's office a lot for behavioral issues in public schools in Texas feeling scared and thinking, ‚ÄòWhat'd I do?'‚Äù


	‚ÄúThe one thing that I would say I agonized over a little bit was just, ‚ÄòAm I helping? Am I fucking helping?'‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt's a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen, and people will actually be protected. Listen, I want to protect the people I love. But it goes beyond that. Bullies make me fucking sick.‚Äù


	Pascal's sister, Lux Pascal, came out as a trans woman in 2021. Pascal's sister Javiera defended her brother's comment about Rowling, telling Vanity Fair, ‚ÄúBut it is heinous loser behavior. And he said that as the older brother to someone saying that our little sister doesn't exist.‚Äù

	











	At the time, Rowling defenders tried to argue that Pascal was ‚Äúpresumptuous with women‚Äù by referring to a viral clip of Pascal taking Vanessa Kirby's hand at last year's Fantastic Four panel at Comic-Con. 


	‚ÄúWhat happened is we were both incredibly nervous going out in front of thousands of people who love this comic,‚Äù Kirby told Vanity Fair. ‚ÄúHe wanted me to know that we were in this together, and I found it a lovely gesture and was very glad to squeeze his hand back.‚Äù


	Speaking further of bullies and Fantastic Four, Pascal says he's ‚Äúgetting an inkling of excitement‚Äù for The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which he stars in as Mister Fantastic. However he notes, ‚ÄúI'm more aware of disgruntlement around my casting than anything I've ever done. ‚ÄòHe's too old. He's not right. He needs to shave.'‚Äù 


	He credited Robert Downey Jr. for being a support system: ‚ÄúHe's just so immediately generous and inviting that you feel like you can be afraid, you can be hungry, you can be ambivalent.‚Äù 


	Meanwhile, Downey noted of Pascal to the publication that ‚ÄúPascal's slow trajectory to becoming a household name who is on a wildly hot streak kind of reaffirms my faith in our industry.‚Äù

The actress led the original series from 1997 to 2003 and is returning for the reboot.

Sarah Michelle Gellar is hoping some original Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters rise from the dead in the forthcoming reboot.


	The actress, who led the original series for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003, is reprising her role as Buffy Summers in the reboot. Star Wars: Skeleton Crew actress Ryan Kiera Armstrong has also been cast in the new Hulu series as a new young Slayer.




	During a recent interview with Vanity Fair Italia, Gellar teased the Buffy reboot as well as who she would like to see return. ‚ÄúIt will be lighter than the last few seasons of the original,‚Äù she shared. ‚ÄúWe will try to find a balance between new and old characters. My dream is to bring back everyone who has died, but space will have to be made for new stories as well.‚Äù

	While the Dexter: Original Sin star admitted she's ‚Äúvery lucky‚Äù she ‚Äúdidn't feel the pressure that today's actors feel‚Äù with social media when she starred on Buffy, she also wants to make sure the reboot includes modern themes, issues and storylines.


	‚ÄúOne of the surprising aspects of Buffy is that it's always been a crossover series,‚Äù Gellar added. ‚ÄúWe're trying to figure out how to modernize the themes of the series, especially what it means to feel like an outsider in a world dominated by social media. What we want to explore are the space-time boundaries that affect society today.‚Äù


	Most details surrounding the reboot, which Hulu is referring to as the ‚ÄúUntitled Buffyverse Pilot,‚Äù are being kept under wraps. Gellar is also executive producing the series.

The actor has conquered Broadway and blockbuster films, but now he's taking on a new challenge as the Hood/Parker Robbins in the new Marvel series 'Ironheart.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Anthony Ramos is officially entering his villainous era with his role in Marvel's new series, Ironheart.


	Having fallen in love with musical theater in high school, it wasn't until he got a scholarship to attend the American Musical and Dramatic Academy that he decided to take acting ‚Äúto another level‚Äù and get ‚Äúserious‚Äù about it as a career. ‚ÄúOnce I got into school, it's clich√©, but I was like a kid in a candy store,‚Äù the 33-year-old actor tells The Hollywood Reporter. ‚ÄúI was learning new things. I never did ballet before. I had never done a musical theater history class. I had never taken an acting class. It was my first voice lesson.‚Äù

	In just a few years after he graduated, Ramos made his Broadway debut as John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in the Tony-winning musical Hamilton. That same year, he landed his first onscreen role in two episodes of Younger.


	Now, a decade later, Ramos has made a name for himself in Hollywood thanks to his starring roles in Twisters, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and A Star Is Born and the film adaptations of Hamilton and In the Heights, just to name a few. However, there's one thing he had yet to accomplish prior to this year: a ‚Äúreal villain‚Äù role. But now he can say he conquered that with his role as the Hood/Parker Robbins in Ironheart, opposite Dominique Thorne.


	Below, Ramos opens up about his preparation to play the Hood, his experience doing voice work for the animated films The Bad Guys 2 and Bob the Builder, whether he wants to return to Broadway in the future, working with Ryan Murphy and Kathryn Bigelow on upcoming projects and his perfect day off work.

	











What was your initial reaction when you learned you were going to be joining the Marvel universe?


	The coolest part was being on a Zoom with Ryan Coogler, Chinaka Hodge, Kevin Feige, Zoie [Nagelhout]. Just being on the Zoom with them and talking to me about the project and teaching me the project and telling me, hey, there's this character called the Hood, this is what he does, this is kind of like what we're thinking for him. It was a surreal moment honestly. I was like, ‚ÄúYo, am I really on a call with like Ryan Coogler, one of the greatest directors of all time, like Kevin Feige, he is Marvel, Chinaka is an incredible writer, Zoie is a great producer. Just on this call with some beast in the game. And they were showing me sketches of him from the comics, and they were like, ‚ÄúObviously Parker Robins is in the comics and it's set in New York, but this was set in Chicago. And you're Puerto Rican, so that's different from the guy in the comics, which is fine, we don't care. He's still got the same powers, the hood is the hood, and we just want to explore what it will look like creating this character with you.‚Äù So I was just so excited! 


How did you prepare mentally and physically to take on the villainous role of the Hood/Parker Robbins?


	It is the first real villain [I've played], because we shot this in 2022. I had played kind of a bad guy in this movie called Honest Thief that I did with Liam Neeson and Jack Courtney back in 2018, but I never played like a Parker. Also just being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and knowing these are his powers: He levitates, he shoots magic bullets, he goes invisible. He does these things and just exploring what we can do with fight choreography, like how we could expand on his character. Again, moving the character from New York to Chicago, there's a massive Puerto Rican community, like making him from Humboldt Park. Just small things like that and really paying attention to what's already there and then seeing where there was a little bit of room to expand ‚Äòcause it is a TV series and we do have a length of episodes to tell the story. 

	











Is there a specific scene as an actor you're most proud of and excited for viewers to see?


	There's one scene that comes to mind and Parker has his own layer, he has his own place where he works, and he's got this scene on his own with the kind of powers that be that gave him the hood, and he's feeling a bit confused and having this back and forth with this invisible person or whoever that gave him the hood that's not there, but he can feel it there. And he's confused by something that's just happened and he thought he had more control than he actually did, and it was a really cool scene to do. Pretty emotional and it was powerful. It was dope. 


Do you hope to do more with this character and even just Marvel overall in the future?


	I would love to expand with his character, knowing that Robert Downey Jr's coming back as Doctor Doom, and we know in the comics that those characters kind of overlap and stuff like that, so seeing if there's any possibility for any overlap with Doctor Doom would be really cool. Everything is real in the Marvel Universe, you never know what what they plan to do and how they plan to do it, but I'd love another shot to just expand on Parker a little bit. 


You also returned to voice Mr. Piranha in The Bad Guys 2, coming out later this year. Can you talk about your experience doing voice work for an animated movie?


	Animation is one of my favorite things to do in this world of acting and shit. It's just so much fun, because you go in there and you see some sketches of what they're thinking about the character looking like or they'll show you the sketch of a scene that's already written out, and they'll show you like a picture of them running out of the bank and then here's a picture of them jumping off of that building and then here's a picture of them hopping in the car and then here's where Mr. Piranha laughs. So you're only seeing pictures and photos, but you don't really know what it's going to come out like until after you put your voice down. And it's me and the director, and sometimes you get to do it with other actors if everybody's available to be there at the same time and you can feed off of each other. We had about one or two sessions for the second movie and you get to be in the room with everybody and everybody's just vibing, everybody's going back and forth and just riffing and shit that's not even on the script we're just coming up with. ‚Ä¶ Sometimes it's so hilarious, like I can't even believe where that just went, that just went so left, and then it makes it in the movie. ‚Ä¶ There's just these endless possibilities with animation, you can really just do anything you want. 

	











You're also voicing the iconic character Bob the Builder in the upcoming animated feature. How excited are you for that project?


	I was super honored and excited that they asked me to do it. I think that with Bob, it's been so many years where we haven't seen a newer version of this guy. I don't think there's ever been a movie about the village, so like I'm like, for the kids growing up, how can we create something that pays homage to the original, but do something that feels fresh where kids who are watching it feel like I'm watching something for the first time. And even want adults who are familiar with it to feel like, wow, this totally feels new, even though Bob the Builder, that IP, has been around for so many years. 


Having had so much success with Broadway as well as screen acting, do you have a preference and would you like to return to the stage in the future?


	I hope to return to the stage. I've been seeing quite a few shows lately, which has been really inspiring, you know, I feel like I always get this jolt of inspiration when I go to Broadway or just go see theater in general, like watching actors get on stage and give it their all for an hour and a half to three hours or however long the show is. There's nothing like it! Having done it and knowing what that feels like and then being able to just enjoy it and appreciate it as an audience member and appreciate it in a different way. And it motivates me to get back on stage, you know, I think there's no harder thing to do as far as in the entertainment business. I mean, I've never done stand-up comedy. I feel like maybe stand-up [would] be No. 1 on that list (Laughs), but a close second gotta be Broadway. Putting a Broadway show together and then doing it every night, eight shows a week, I've not done anything as tough as that still in my career. Ten years since I've been in Hamilton, and still I would say that and maybe one movie I shot in the middle of COVID because of the circumstances and having worn like a 30-pound spacesuit, and the movie never came out (Laughs). 

	











You also have several more projects in the works, including Ryan Murphy's The Beauty, and Kathryn Bigelow's currently untitled project. What has it been like working with these creative masterminds? 


	It was really a blessing to work with Kathryn, and she's one of the greatest directors of all time. She said something super awesome to me that I'll never forget. We finished a take and we were shooting in Iceland. I had just gotten off of an overnight flight, and they're like, ‚ÄúOK, we got to wait to see if you're gonna drive to the other side of the island or if you're gonna fly because we have to see if the weather conditions are good enough for you to fly.‚Äù And if you do fly, you're gonna go straight to set. If we drive, then you gotta shoot the next day. So I was like, ‚ÄúOh shit!‚Äù I wasn't even expecting to go straight to set. I thought I'd shoot the next day, but nonetheless, the weather was good enough. We hop on this little nine-seater plane, go to the other side of Iceland, get off the plane, go straight to set, I change and then boom, we shoot this intense-ass scene. And I was so tired and I was so delirious, but I think the fatigue and delirium helped me in a way. My brother sometimes tells me, ‚ÄúBro, sometimes when you're the most tired, you give me your best takes.‚Äù But Kathryn calls cut, and she's like, ‚ÄúThat was one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my career.‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I thought she was playing. She was like, ‚ÄòThat was phenomenal. We got it!‚Äù I'll just never forget that look on her face. I didn't even watch playback or anything, but it was just really cool to get props from her like that. 

	











	Ryan's amazing! We just did the upfronts, and Ryan Murphy's mind is so incredible and his imagination just runs like far and wide. I text Ryan after the upfronts ‚Äî they put together a trailer for the show, and we're still shooting it right now, so when you're in it, you have moments where you're like, ‚ÄúYo, I feel like what we're doing is super dope but you don't really know, right?‚Äù ‚Äî and I was like, ‚ÄúRyan, I just wanna let you know I'm grateful for this role because truly this is some of the most fun I've ever had doing anything in my whole career and my life.‚Äù And he was like, ‚ÄúI really love you in this part, and I feel good about this show.‚Äù It's just cool to know he feels that way. He's so involved and it's just nice to be actually working with Ryan. 


If you have a free day off work, what's your perfect day off look like?


	You know what I like to do, honestly, I'll be traveling a lot. When I get days off, especially if I get a string of days, I'll be out. I live in Miami, you know, I'm shooting in New York, but any chance I get, I go back down there. If my friends are like, ‚ÄúYo, let's go to whatever,‚Äù I'm like, ‚ÄúAlright, we out.‚Äù But also on days off, my family is opening a business in New York, a bar in Brooklyn, and so I help them with that. So it's cool to do something that's not acting sometimes too. Lately, we try to read these scripts for either a job that could happen or something that probably isn't realistic, but something that looks interesting. I'm writing a musical right now, too, any free days I get off, I try to work on that. 

	











It's been a decade since your first onscreen role in Younger, and you've accomplished so much since then. What have you learned about yourself during this time?


	There's never been a time that I didn't have a good time, but I especially make it a point to have a good time on set, because we get to play make believe, like this shit is all made up. And we have to put on these costumes and say these lines and do all this shit, and you get paid for it. And genuinely, I feel like going to work life stops when I'm there. Obviously it's still going, but it just feels like we're in another world now. I think when I first started, I was really scared too. I didn't go to film school. ‚Ä¶ But being inexperienced and just going for it, there are some parts that I miss about that too. I feel like I was super fearless back then, but I think that I'm kind of trying to bring some of that back now. ‚Ä¶ Just remember, just because you can say I've been here, you haven't been here. Like it's a new job, it's a new part, it's all new. It doesn't matter how long you've been doing it, every job is different, every day is different, every character is different. So it's like you gotta open yourself up to whatever is going on that day. But the one thing I think I have kept from when I started is that kind of openness. 


If you had to describe what makes Anthony Ramos, Anthony Ramos, what would you say?


	There's nobody on this planet that's like me. There's no one that talks like me, there's no one that walks like me. You can find similarities in different people, but at the end of the day, I'm me. What makes me me too is that because of God and my family, I was taught that whatever you do, you give it your whole heart. Approach it with grace, approach it with gratitude, you know, with humility in your heart, and just do your best to be your best. That's what makes me me, you know, I'm Anthony from Bushwick, from the projects, from 230 Grove Street, and there's only one me.

The Grammy-winning Hot 100 toppers are hitting the road together for the first time.


													By
												

	Kyle Denis



	Actually, the boy is theirs. Nearly 30 years after they topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 weeks with their timeless duet ‚ÄúThe Boy Is Mine,‚Äù Brandy and Monica are teaming up for their first-ever co-headlining tour.


	As announced Tuesday (June 24), Brandy and Monica will launch their co-headlining The Boy Is Mine Tour on Oct. 16 at Heritage Bank Center in Cincinnati. The 24-city trek will visit arenas in major U.S. cities including Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York before concluding Dec. 7 at the Toyota Center in Houston.

	











	Produced by Black Promoters Collective, The Boy Is Mine Tour will also feature an eye-popping lineup of special guests, including four-time Grammy winner Kelly Rowland, two-time Grammy winner Muni Long, and American Idol season 23 champ Jamal Roberts. Long dropped her fourth studio album, Revenge, last summer (Aug. 30, 2024), and Roberts recently notched a No. 1 debut on Hot Gospel Songs just weeks before tributing Kirk Franklin at the 2025 BET Awards. Earlier this month, Rowland was announced as The Voice UK‚Äòs newest coach.

	‚ÄúThis really is a full-circle moment,‚Äù Brandy, who landed at No. 41 on the Billboard staff's 75 Best R&B Singers of All Time list, said in a press release. ‚ÄúMonica and I coming together again isn't just about the music ‚Äî it's about honoring where we came from and how far we've both come. ‚ÄòThe Boy Is Mine' was a defining chapter in R&B, and to share the stage all these years later is bigger than a reunion ‚Äî it's a celebration of growth, sisterhood, and the love our fans have given us from day one.‚Äù

	











	The R&B icons, who reunited on 2012's ‚ÄúIt All Belongs to Me,‚Äù announced their new tour with a cinematic short film helmed by filmmaker and production designer Ethan Tobman, who has worked with the likes of Beyonc√©, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift. Set in a maximum sound asylum, the tour trailer finds Brandy and Monica using their powerful and ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù harmonies to break free.


	‚ÄúThe love that ‚ÄòThe Boy Is Mine' continues to receive means everything to me,‚Äù Monica said in a press release. ‚ÄúThis tour is a celebration of our history, our impact, and the fans who have grown with us. Brandy and I have been on our own unique journeys, and coming back together in this way is a reminder of the power of respect, strength, and real music. We're giving the people what they've been asking for, and doing it with grace, love, and purpose. God's timing perfectly aligned us.‚Äù


	Last year, Brandy and Monica earned their 13th and fifth Grammy nominations, respectively, thanks to their featured turn on Grande's ‚ÄúThe Boy Is Mine‚Äù remix. Named after their duet, Grande's Eternal Sunshine single reached No. 16 on the Hot 100 and soundtracked a Catwoman-inspired music video featuring cameos from all three ladies, as well as You actor Penn Badgley.


	Tickets for The Boy Is Mine Tour go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. local time via Ticketmaster.com. Presales begin Thursday from 10 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. local time via the code ‚ÄúBPC.‚Äù

Del Rey's run through the U.K. and Ireland's stadiums kicked off in Cardiff, Wales on June 24.


													By
												

	Laura Molloy



	Since her debut tour in 2011, Lana Del Rey's UK appearances have been sporadic. A mere handful of headline shows, a string of 2020 gigs cancelled, and two consecutive summers of having her set cut off early by major festivals have conjured a feeling that, when it comes to Del Rey and British stages, the stars are never quite able to align.


	So when she announced her first U.K. and Ireland stadium shows last year, it's no wonder that 300,000 tickets promptly sold out. It was assumed, though, that the performances would follow the release of her highly anticipated 10th album Lasso, which has since been renamed The Right Person Will Stay and currently remains a bewilderment.


	Yet rather than frustrating, for the legion of fans descending on Cardiff this week, these twists and turns are part of Del Rey's charm ‚Äì integral to the air of mystery that surrounds her like a cloud of her vape smoke. And, for an artist whose enigmatic presence on the charts has shaped modern pop in her image, she's earned the right to be elusive.


	It's why Cardiff ‚Äì proud host to her first ever U.K. stadium show ‚Äì has stepped up to the occasion. Ahead of her performance, the entire city is bathed in a Honeymoon glow. Loose feathers torn from boas dance in the wind, girls in white dresses and veils adjust each other's flower crowns and the bridge of ‚ÄòRide' leaks from the open doors of every other bar. It's a testament to Del Rey's enduring power and relevance as a songwriter, taking to the stage mere days after her 40th birthday and looking out onto a crowd mostly comprised of soon-to-be school leavers.


	These are the best moments from Del Rey's show at Cardiff Principality Stadium.


	Outside the stadium walls, mundane British life chugs on. Yet within them, Del Rey has concocted another world entirely. A nod to the presumed Southern Gothic influences of her upcoming album, the show takes place in the front yard of a full-sized shotgun house ‚Äì complete with a white picket fence, creaking porch swing and vintage-looking street lamp that, as it turns out, is primed for pole dancing. White roses swirl around a pond before her, and dancers twirl beneath an oak tree embellished with twinkling lights.


	From the moment she steps on stage, Del Rey's gratitude to be back in the U.K. is palpable, as she peers at the 70,000-strong crowd through eyes brimming with tears. As opening song ‚ÄúStars Fell on Alabama‚Äù (no relation to the 1934 jazz standard) draws to a close, she hurries to the side of the stage to kiss her now-husband, alligator tour guide Jeremy Dufrane, before re-emerging and promising the crowd: ‚ÄúThey're good tears.‚Äù There are undoubtedly more than a few of those on the audience side, too.


	An album might not have arrived by its initial May deadline, but the songs are ready, and Cardiff bears witness to the U.K. debut of three, including western-imbued ‚ÄúQuiet In The South.‚Äù The best received, though, is ‚Äú57.5‚Äù, first performed live in April during her headline performance at Stagecoach and already memorised by many in the crowd. Offering anecdotal wisdom from someone now nearly two decades into the game, Del Rey affirms her tenderly woven advice on navigating stardom by the fact that she has ‚Äò57.5 million listeners on Spotify.‚Äò Notably, a headline-grabbing line about Morgan Wallen is replaced with a knowing look into the audience.


	For the die-hard fans (many of whom have camped in the Welsh capital over the past few days to get a glimpse of Del Rey arriving and leaving soundcheck), the singer's catalogue brims with cult classics. Yet it's still ‚ÄúVideo Games‚Äù, the 2011 breakout single that propelled her to stardom, that is perhaps her most widely adored hit. Now, overlooking her largest British audience yet, she seems worlds from the brand new artist mumbling the lyrics into her MacBook camera all those years ago.


	Del Rey has never been predictable, and tonight's theatrics prove there's no danger of her slipping into that territory any time soon. Perhaps the set's most decisive creative decision was that, for fan-favourites ‚ÄúNorman Fucking Rockwell‚Äù and ‚ÄúArcadia,‚Äù the singer wanders off stage, enlisting a projection of herself to step in momentarily. While the real Del Rey, whom many have spent days queuing to see, is presumably still somewhere within the Principality Stadium, her digital double haunts the porch steps and croons from a crooked window ledge. Bizarre, yes, but somehow it works, and the pre-recorded vocals don't dissuade a choir of Welsh voices from singing along.


	As the show approaches its finale, Del Rey tiptoes down the stairs and into the crowd, keen to give Cardiff one final moment to remember. ‚ÄúI'm trying to think of one little thing that I could do that I didn't have planned,‚Äù she says, beckoning a chorus of screamed requests from the barrier. One impassioned plea from a front-row fan later, and she's leading the stadium in an a cappella version of ‚ÄúSalvatore‚Äù from 2014's Honeymoon, the audience as her backing choir.


	Del Rey's admiration of John Denver has been forever immortalised in the lyrics of ‚ÄúThe Grants‚Äù (‚ÄúLike Rocky Mountain High/The way John Denver sings‚Äù). And, tonight, it's his classic ‚ÄúTake Me Home, Country Roads‚Äù she selects to see us out. ‚ÄúWe're gonna end like we started, with a little bit of country flair,‚Äù she says, stretching her world-building magic a little longer into the night.

The Jay-Z-founded entertainment juggernaut says in a new court filing that its role as Fat Joe's management company shouldn't involve it in the bombshell racketeering case.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Roc Nation wants out of an explosive new lawsuit accusing Fat Joe of victimizing his longtime hypeman via a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, saying it's ‚Äúnonsensical‚Äù to suggest the rapper's management company was involved in any of the scandalous behavior alleged in the case.


Jay-Z's entertainment company was among a slew of people and companies named last week in Terrance ‚ÄúT.A.‚Äù Dixon's lawsuit against Fat Joe (Joseph Cartagena). Dixon, Fat Joe's hypeman for over a decade, said he was forced to work without pay while being subjected to psychological manipulation and exposed to sexual misconduct, including the trafficking of underage girls.


	The claims in Dixon's Thursday (June 19) complaint, which Fat Joe has fiercely denied and characterized as extortion, are framed as a racketeering enterprise abetted by Roc Nation and other outside entities. But Roc Nation's attorneys quickly filed a motion to dismiss on Monday (June 23), saying the company ‚Äúhas nothing to do with any of this.‚Äù


	‚ÄúRoc Nation's alleged role in this case ‚Äî according to plaintiff himself ‚Äî is that it became Mr. Cartagena's artist management company in 2017, and in that capacity, earned a commission on revenue Mr. Cartagena generated,‚Äù writes Roc Nation's lawyer Alex Spiro. ‚ÄúYet, according to plaintiff, the fact that Roc Nation had a business relationship with Mr. Cartagena somehow makes Roc Nation part of a RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] enterprise, a participant in sex trafficking, and an aider-and-abettor of Mr. Cartagena's alleged conduct. That is nonsensical.‚Äù


	According to Monday's motion, there's not a single factual allegation in the complaint that ties Roc Nation to any of Fat Joe's alleged wrongdoing. Dixon's lawsuit claimed the management company was responsible for his withheld wages, but Spiro says Roc Nation only manages Fat Joe's catalog, publishing rights and intellectual property.


	‚ÄúHow Roc Nation supposedly knew of this deplorable alleged conduct is a mystery,‚Äù writes Spiro. ‚ÄúHe does not assert how Roc Nation's management of Mr. Cartagena's music business gave it insight into how much plaintiff should have been paid, what he was paid, or any venture to deprive him of adequate compensation.‚Äù


	In a statement to Billboard on Monday, Spiro says, ‚ÄúRoc Nation has nothing to do with any of this. Nothing. And we expect this case to be dismissed.‚Äù


	Reached for comment on Monday, Dixon's attorney Tyrone Blackburn tells Billboard he will oppose Roc Nation's motion to be dismissed from the case.


	‚ÄúI am happy to see that Roc Nation was smart enough to distance itself from Fat Joe and his RICO enterprise,‚Äù adds Blackburn. ‚ÄúThe plaintiff has no personal animosity towards Roc Nation or its leadership.‚Äù


	Dixon's case against Fat Joe was actually preceded by the rapper suing Dixon and Blackburn for extortion. Two months ago, Fat Joe filed a lawsuit accusing the former hypeman and his attorney of trying to extract a settlement with ‚Äúwholly fabricated‚Äù and ‚Äúgrotesque‚Äù claims of pedophilia.


	In a statement after Dixon filed his own lawsuit last week, Fat Joe's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said they'll continue to fight the claims and that ‚Äúlaw enforcement is aware of the extortionate demand at the heart of this scheme.‚Äù

playlist



	Justin Bieber encountered the paparazzi during an outing and got a bit heated during the interaction. The moment quickly went viral on social media and even turned into a meme. We went to the streets to have fans weigh in on the interaction to determine whether Bieber's reaction was valid or not.


	What did you think of the viral interaction? Let us know in the comments!


	Guest 1:


	It is what it is, bro. There're paparazzi everywhere for you. Like, you're Justin Bieber, bro.  


	Tetris Kelly:


	Last week, Justin Bieber stood on business as he confronted a group of paparazzi who was determined to kill his vibe. 


	Guest 2:


	I don't know. It just seems kind of off to me. 


	Tetris Kelly:


	In the video, Justin can be heard saying, ‚ÄúIt's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business. Is it?‚Äù Things got a little heated between Justin and the paps. Their exchange went viral from content creator re-enactments. Justin, having a little fun himself, took to Instagram where he shared a content creator's remix of his viral moment. Then Justin posted a black-and-white image with the caption, ‚Äúy'all think the business is a joke, but you're drunk.‚Äù This video of Justin and the paparazzi has started an interesting discourse online. In the video, Justin talks about setting boundaries while the paparazzi say they're just doing their jobs. But we started to wonder: Who's right? Should Justin be left alone, or were the paparazzi just doing their jobs? We took it to the streets of West Hollywood to see what you all thought. 


	Guest 3:


	He's always reacted a little bit, you know, strange when it comes to paparazzi and stuff. Who knows what's going on through his head. But I feel like you know what you sign up for when you become a celebrity. 


Keep watching for more.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Relative newcomer Xavier Molyneux has landed the title role in Bloodaxe, Prime Video's new historical drama series from Vikings creator Michael Hirst and his son, Horatio Hirst, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Amazon MGM Studios couldn't be reached for comment. 


Officially ordered in March, Bloodaxe chronicles the rise of one of history's most famous Viking warriors, Erik Bloodaxe (Molyneux), and his formidable wife, Gunnhild, Mother of Kings. As they fight for the throne of Norway, the land is torn apart by fierce rivals, shifting loyalties and bloody betrayals. With war looming and chaos consuming the kingdom, drawing in the ruthless kings of other Scandinavian countries and even a powerful English ruler, the stage is set for a thundering new Viking saga.

	











Bloodaxe is created, written and exec produced by Michael and Horatio Hirst and produced by MGM Television. Other exec producers include Steve Stark of Toluca Pictures label who, as head of MGM Television, oversaw both of the 2013-20 Vikings TV series, along with fellow franchise alum Morgan O'Sullivan, Arturo Interian, John Weber and Sheila Hockin.

	While the show shares creative lineage with the 2013-20 History series Vikings and the 2022-25 Netflix follow-up Vikings: Valhalla ‚Äî all three are based on historical figures and produced by MGM Television ‚Äî Bloodaxe is not directly related to those efforts. The new Norse saga takes place decades after the original series and decades before Valhalla. Production begins in Ireland at the end of July.

	











	A rising Australian actor currently based in New Zealand, Molyneux just wrapped his run on the iconic Australian soap Neighbours and also recently starred in Netflix's romantic drama Take My Hand. He is repped by Benchmark Creative Management in Australia and The Rosenzweig Group.

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Thousands of UK actors have been ‚Äúdigitally scanned on set without their informed consent,‚Äù according to an open letter from Brit actors union Equity urging progress on artificial intelligence as it returns to the negotiating table with Pact. 


	British actors Emma D'Arcy, Tamsin Greig, Alan Davies, Nicola Walker and Wilf Scolding have so far signed the letter, which was published last week. 


	‚ÄúWe also have no transparency around how our performances, likeness and personal data are being recorded, stored and processed within the context of the production and beyond,‚Äù Equity wrote, in the letter to Pact that has amassed nearly 1,500 signatures.

	The letter comes a day before Equity and the producer trade body are due to sit down for yet another round of negotiations on a set of new collective agreements that has been rumbling for around 12 months, with AI safeguards proving quite the sticking point. Equity has been upping the stakes in recent months, with re-elected General Secretary Paul Fleming saying the union is ‚Äúindustrial action ready‚Äù if negotiations keep failing while the union threatened court action to the BBC, ITV, Disney and Pact if members rights are breached in the training of AI models.




			Watch on Deadline		







	‚ÄúWe are writing ahead of your negotiation meeting with Equity Officials on 25 June to express concern at the lack of progress on securing AI protections for performers,‚Äù wrote Equity in the open letter. ‚ÄúWe believe this is unacceptable and urge Pact to prioritise this crucial area affecting our industry and livelihoods.‚Äù Pact declined comment.


	Using the new U.S. SAG-AFTRA contacts as a partial blueprint, Equity's claim with Pact is tailored to the implications of generative AI for different categories of actor including dubbing and supporting artists. Equity said it has put forward ‚Äúa constructive proposal‚Äù including ‚Äúimportant provisions on AI training, which the union has made clear is a red line in these negotiations.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will not accept any deal that does not grant us key protections for the use of our personal data for training AI systems and creating AI-generated performances,‚Äù it added today.

	











	The collective agreements being negotiated govern the vast majority of British TV shows and indie movies. Adding to the confusion, the BBC and ITV's separate agreements with Equity failed to include artificial intelligence safeguards as the broadcasters did not want to include them until the Equity-Pact negotiations are resolved. The broadcasters have insisted that ‚Äúdiscussion around AI provisions remains firmly on the table.‚Äù


	The move comes as the UK government considers legislation that would mean copyright holders must opt-out from having their material used for training generative AI models. A BFI report earlier this month revealed that scripts from more than 130,000 films and TV shows have been used to train such models.

			By Jake Kanter, Ted Johnson 


Donald Trump did little to hide his anger at continued hostilities between Israel and Iran on Tuesday, censuring the nations in expletive-embellished remarks at the White House.


	Speaking as he was about to board Marine One for a NATO summit in the Netherlands, Trump told reporters, ‚ÄúWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*ck they're doing.‚Äù


	The outburst followed Israel saying it had intercepted a missile launched by Iran, soon after Trump had hailed an ‚Äúepic ceasefire‚Äù between the two countries. Israel accused Iran of violating the terms of the ceasefire and vowed to launch fresh strikes. Iran denied the allegations.

	Trump accused Israel of targeting Tehran soon after a deal was struck, saying both sides violated the peace agreement.

	‚ÄúIsrael, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,‚Äù Trump told reporters.


	‚ÄúYou don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either.‚Äù


	After making his TV comments about the perilous situation in the Middle East, the president appeared to continue his interventions from Marine One, posting several times on Truth Social. He warned Israel not to attack Iran.


	‚ÄúISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!‚Äù he wrote. Trump later added: ‚ÄúISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‚ÄòPlane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!‚Äù

	











	Sky News, the UK broadcaster, carried Trump's comments live and apologized for the president's language. 

‚ÄúWe're just going to apologise for the language by the US President, there.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/IiDCbYat6c


	In his remarks to reporters before leaving on his trip, Trump also lashed out again at news outlets that have reported some skepticism about the U.S. bombings and whether they neutralized Iran's nuclear capabilities. 


	‚ÄúIf you take a look at the pinprick, then you see that place is gone,‚Äù Trump said of destruction assessments. ‚ÄúAnd I say, I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. I think that MSDNC ought to apologize. I think that these guys, and these cable networks, are real losers. You really are.‚Äù


	‚ÄúThey're gutless losers. I say that to CNN because I watch it, I have no choice. I've got to watch this garbage. It's all garbage, it's all fake news. But I think CNN is  a gutless group of people. And the people that run it, no one even knows this because it's been sold so many times, but the people that run it ought to be ashamed.‚Äù

Diego Luna let the president know exactly how he felt about his draconian immigration policy when he took over as a guest host on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Monday night. ‚ÄúTonight, I want to address an important issue that is happening here in Los Angeles and all around the United States,‚Äù the Andor actor said in his opening monologue. ‚ÄúWith everything going on in this country around immigration and authoritarian policies of Donald Trump, it is no small thing that a Mexican is hosting such an important show. It's a big deal and I really hope not to fuck it up.‚Äù

The actor then took some time to reflect on his own experience in Los Angeles, sharing that he first ‚Äústepped foot in the territory known as the United States‚Äù at 20 years old following the success of Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n. He now even has an Angeleno son, he shared. But, he continued, ‚Äúthe people that lifted me up were mostly people that had left their countries to find a new life, or the sons and daughters of immigrants that had come here in order to work and build a healthy, enjoyable and dignified life, away from their place of origin.‚Äù

‚ÄúA movement of that scale, that's not natural, not unless something is very, very wrong in the place you are coming from,‚Äù Luna continued. ‚ÄúNobody leaves their land if it's not because their survival depends on it. Nobody leaves their past behind, just for fun. But you know what? All the people that I met shared an unspoken gratitude to this country, a country that opened its doors to them.‚Äù

Los Angeles, he continued, is ‚Äúa powerful example of what's possible, of what can be achieved when we put empathy first.‚Äù The city has also become a lightning rod in the fight over Trump's immigration policy, as the president moved to deploy the National Guard to step in as ICE clashed with protesters earlier this month. California Governor Gavin Newsom is now sparring with Trump over this decision in court.

Luna then took a moment to laud the fact that ‚Äúthe multiple times that this country has had to rebuild itself, immigrants were always there to pick up the slack.‚Äù He specifically reminded audiences of the L.A. wildfires earlier this year, which saw ‚Äúimmigrant workers risk their lives to stop the flames.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúThey are the ones who build this country, they feed it, they nurture and teach its children, they care for the elderly, they work in construction, hospitality, they run kitchens. They're technicians, merchants, athletes, drivers, farmers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are a lot of lies flying around about immigrants, but I'm sure you have more than one story that can attest to the contrary. Talk about it, share it. That helps. Today, they need to know that they're not alone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese have been a dark few weeks. It is not acceptable nor is it normal to separate families. Violence and terror are not OK. Immigrants need to know that their struggle is yours as well.‚Äù

Sundance has always been more than a film festival. As the indie mecca stares down a move away from Park City, there's the inclination to look backwards at the impact Robert Redford's brainchild has had on the industry at large over its long existence. This impact reaches far beyond the actual movies accepted into and screened at its festival, extending to those made by filmmakers nurtured at its various Labs‚Äîfilmmakers like Sinners‚Äò Ryan Coogler, whose Fruitvale Station got its start at the fest (and who stopped living at his parents' house thanks to a grant facilitated by the Institute). The development side of Sundance has kickstarted the careers of countless directors who've gone on to be household names, ranging from Quentin Tarantino and the Daniels to Paul Thomas Anderson and Chlo√© Zhao. As the 45th Directors Lab comes to a close, here are 10 projects that wouldn't exist without this important side of Sundance.

Ôªø

The first lab-supported film to be produced, after being developed at the first Directors Lab held in 1981, Gregory Nava's El Norte blends magical realism and the grounded stories of political refugees. A film that not only earned Nava and his co-writer Anna Thomas an Oscar nomination, but helped influence decades of U.S. immigration policy, El Norte focuses on people that Nava felt ‚Äúwere like shadows that people didn't see. They didn't see their heart and their soul.‚Äù A film filled with undocumented, Indigenous characters, El Norte remains viscerally relevant in addition to being bitingly satirical and remarkably shot in low light. Its early days at Sundance helped Nava achieve his vision. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, he remembered that ‚ÄúWe worked with Sydney Pollack. We worked with Waldo Salt. One of the requests that I made to Sundance was that in order to do El Norte, we would have to bring professional actors together with nonactors. So they brought Ivan Passer, the great Czechoslovakian filmmaker who had done Intimate Lighting and who really knew how to work with nonactors.‚Äù

Ôªø

The poster boy for the indie wave represented by Sundance, Quentin Tarantino didn't just launch his debut gangster movie at the fest out of the blue. Rather, the ‚Äúanyone can make it‚Äù story of a video store obsessive had the springboard of Harvey Keitel, who liked the script and got things fast-tracked with his commitment. But Reservoir Dogs also had a more experienced Tarantino behind the camera thanks to the 1991 Directors Lab. There, he worked with established industry figures like Terry Gilliam, Stanley Donen, Volker Schl√∂ndorff, and Robert Estrin to figure out the look of the feature‚Äîto ‚Äúget out of his system‚Äù some overly energetic ideas that simply wouldn't do service to the script that made him famous, as Gilliam recalled.

Ôªø

Paul Thomas Anderson's first feature, originally titled Sydney after its gambler-mentor played by Philip Baker Hall, Hard Eight shot the directorial wunderkind into the spotlight when he was just 23. Sydney grew from Anderson's first scrappy short, Cigarettes & Coffee, which screened at Sundance and was similarly bolstered by the presence of Hall. That experience led to Anderson's invitation to the 1993 Directors Lab, the expansion of the short into a feature, and then‚Äîin a sequence of events John H. Richardson called ‚Äúalmost mythical, a parable about the necessity of real art‚Äù‚Äîthe repossessing of the film from financiers who almost ruined it. But they didn't ruin it; Anderson restored the vision he'd worked on at the Lab, got it into Cannes, and used the ensuing goodwill to get Boogie Nights off the ground.

Ôªø

Gina Prince-Bythewood worked in TV for years before making her film debut with Love & Basketball. After writing on South Central and directing an episode of CBS Schoolbreak Special, Prince-Bythewood took her personal sports-romance to Sundance's labs, where she connected with Spike Lee, who would produce the film with the same ethos he expected from his partners: total autonomy for the creative behind the camera. After a few years of work in and out of Directors and Screenwriters Labs, Love & Basketball premiered at Sundance in 2000. The indie classic didn't immediately translate into career success for its writer-director, but 25 years since its premiere, she's in the middle of a career resurgence, having pivoted to female-fronted action with The Old Guard and The Woman King.

Ôªø

Though Nicole Holofcener was born into the industry (and then further thrust into the film world through her stepfather Charles H. Joffe, who was Woody Allen's manager/producer), she didn't strike out on her own until more than a decade after working on films like A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy and Hannah And Her Sisters‚Äîand working at a video store. But after her five-minute short Angry made it to Sundance, she entered the Directors Lab the following year to workshop Walking And Talking, which would become her debut feature. Even then, it took over half a decade to get the thing made, wrangled by super producer Ted Hope and Holofcener's chance meeting with Catherine Keener at the gym. The simple film was a standout in a mid-'90s wave of chatty, neurotic comedies, and laid the groundwork for Holofcener's more complex future films.

Ôªø

There was a decent chance that Hedwig And The Angry Inch, Stephen Trask and John Cameron Mitchell's musical rebel yell from a genderqueer punk, might've just stayed a surprise, scrappy off-Broadway hit. Stage star Mitchell was well-equipped to reprise his role, but he also made the film adaptation his directorial debut though he had little experience behind the camera. That meant a few years of development work at the Labs, connecting Mitchell with collaborators like cinematographer Frank G. DeMarco and would-be directors like Forest Whitaker (imagine that take on the film for a second). Thanks to some of the team's behind-the-scenes connections, the film had distribution and financing before Mitchell was ready to shoot a thing, but it took a year of ramping up and learning before he and his team were able to replicate the DIY spirit of the show.

Ôªø

After getting her start doing collaborative DIY video projects in Portland's riot grrrl scene and various oddball performance pieces, Miranda July submitted her first feature script to the Screenwriters Lab and got rejected‚Ä¶twice. But the third time was the charm, which led to the Directors Lab where she'd spend three-and-a-half weeks working on her debut feature, Me And You And Everyone We Know, with creative advisors like Chuck & Buck director Miguel Arteta. But once July got her foot in the door, she took full advantage of the Institute's offerings, attending writing, directing, composing, and producing events as she was getting ready to make her film. Add in a few eccentric details befitting a July story‚Äîa Japanese broadcaster ended up helping keep the film's financing afloat before IFC came aboard‚Äîand you have a strange underdog story worthy of the ‚Äú))<>((‚Äù emoticon.

Ôªø

Speaking of bodily functions represented in ridiculous ways, Swiss Army Man took filmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert from the viral music video circuit to the feature film world. Just a few years later, they'd all but sweep the Oscars with Everything Everywhere All At Once. But the road to their farting corpse comedy (starring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe) was long. The same year the Daniels were winning awards for their ‚ÄúTurn Down For What‚Äù video, they had attended the Sundance writing lab, where Quentin Tarantino tried to get them to put the Gilligan's Island theme into the film. They didn't follow his advice (or continue on with Beck Bennett, who played the Daniel Radcliffe corpse role at the Labs), but the work at Sundance helped the film make its polarizing debut at the fest just a few years later. Or, to put it in Scheinert's words, ‚ÄúThank God [Robert Redford] bought that shitty land.‚Äù

Ôªø

It's not like Boots Riley needed Sundance to find success as an artist. The rapper-turned-filmmaker has been making hits with The Coup since the early '90s (no other director on this list is featured in a music video with E-40 and 2Pac) but his political, satirical writing finally made it to the big screen in Sorry To Bother You, the stylish spectacle where LaKeith Stanfield puts on his ‚Äúwhite voice‚Äù as a telemarketer. Originally, the script simply served as the inspiration for The Coup's sixth album, and was later published in McSweeney's. But that was enough to get him into the Sundance pipeline, which hooked him up with a creative team (and mentors like David Gordon Green, Guillermo del Toro, and Joan Tewkesbury, as well as advisors like Chiwetel Ejiofor and Bradford Young) that helped the former film school student make his feature debut. 

ÔªøÔªø

One of the strongest debuts of the last few years, Charlotte Wells' Aftersun not only helped launch its filmmaker into the arthouse conversation, but jettisoned star Paul Mescal into the spotlight. Wells, an NYU graduate who began exploring similar themes in her first short film Tuesday, worked at industry service provider Digital Orchard and then as a producer before her artistic trajectory changed. After her shorts Laps and Blue Christmas got into Sundance, she'd made the contacts necessary to get Aftersun moving, but the COVID pandemic derailed things. This freed her up to go through a virtual version of the Directors Lab in 2020, which she cites as transformative to the film. While she got ‚Äúlots of practical advice about directing and prep,‚Äù Wells also ran into feedback she disagreed with around the tension (or lack thereof) between the central father-daughter duo. ‚ÄúSometimes when you hear something you disagree with,‚Äù she told Deadline, ‚Äúit clarifies your own position.‚Äù So she went her own way, and found herself racking up the awards for her trouble.

Giving everyone a masterclass in grace, Simone Ashley proudly stepped out to celebrate ‚ÄúF1: The Movie‚Äù on Monday (June 23). Simone attended the European premiere in London despite her role being cut from the final version of the film. 

The 30-year-old actress walked the red carpet solo at Cineworld Leicester Square, stunning in a gold Balmain gown. Simone's move depicts a graceful show of support for the project and her castmates.

Ashley had previously filmed scenes for F1, but does not have any speaking lines in the finished movie. 

Director Joseph Kosinski recently explained the change, telling People: ‚ÄúIt happens on every film, where you have to shoot more than you can use. There were two or three storylines that ultimately didn't make it into the final cut. But Simone, she's an incredible talent, incredible actress, incredible singer, and I would love to work with her again.‚Äù

Ashley had been seen on set and was also photographed at a Miami promotional event for F1, appearing with co-star Kerry Condon and producer Jerry Bruckheimer.

The ‚ÄúBridgerton‚Äù star doesn't believe in holding grudges. Speaking to ELLE earlier this month, Ashley said: ‚ÄúI have a very small part, but I'm grateful to be in that movie‚Ä¶ I got to experience many Grand Prix. I don't think I'll ever do anything like that again.‚Äù

Director Kosinski, 51, also told Entertainment Tonight that he informed Ashley that her scenes would not appear in the final cut, and praised her professionalism and talent.

Ashley previously told Who What Wear that her role in F1 had been in the works long before her breakout on ‚ÄúBridgerton‚Äù. 

She said, ‚ÄúI met for this movie, I think, before Bridgerton even came out. It's been a long time, and you know, it's Damson and Brad's movie. I'm just so grateful that I can be part of it.‚Äù

Though her scenes didn't make it to the screen, Simone Ashley's grace and support at the London premiere spoke volumes. She proved why she remains one of the industry's most beloved rising stars. 

Brad Pitt leads ‚ÄúF1: The Movie‚Äù as a retired Formula One driver making a comeback with a fictional team. 

The film, written by Ehren Kruger and produced in collaboration with real F1 stars including Lewis Hamilton, also features Damson Idris, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, Javier Bardem, Shea Whigham, and more.

‚ÄúF1: The Movie‚Äù opens in theaters nationwide on June 27.

HGTV ‚ÄúHome Town‚Äù star Ben Napier is a loving father to two girls, but he admits he experienced one scary part of parenthood early on. Find out why Napier called it the ‚Äúabsolute scariest thing.‚Äù

A post shared by Ben Napier | Scotsman Co. (@scotsman.co)

In a June 2025 interview with Country Living, Napier shared some words of wisdom from his experience as a dad.

‚ÄúI have two warnings and one piece of advice for first-time parents, things that were never told to me,‚Äù he explained, including what he calls the ‚Äúscariest thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy first warning is ‚Äî and I may sound like an idiot for saying it ‚Äî the first night home from the hospital is the absolute scariest thing you will go through,‚Äù Napier said. ‚ÄúWe had been in the hospital for two or three days, the baby had spent both nights in the nursery at the hospital ‚Äî and it was great.‚Äù

He continued, ‚ÄúThen we came home that first night, and she cried all night. I was trying to let Erin sleep, sitting on the couch holding Helen, and as long as I kept moving, she wouldn't cry.‚Äù

Napier also admitted he didn't know too much about women's hormones. ‚ÄúYour wife has nine months of the craziest hormonal swings ever while she's pregnant ‚Äî but then in my mind, it was like, ‚ÄòAlright, baby's here, hormone changes are over!' And that's not how it works.‚Äù

He shared, ‚ÄúI was unprepared for the next three to six months of hormonal changes that were going on. So if you're a boy who grew up in a house full of boys, just know: That's coming.‚Äù

A post shared by Shades of Light (@shadesoflight)

As for his advice, Napier offered some solid tips about giving yourself grace when you have a baby.

‚ÄúThen the advice is to just be gentle with each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEveryone ‚Äî including the baby ‚Äî is going to be out of whack.‚Äù

The HGTV star continued, ‚ÄúBe gentle with everyone. Yourself too. You're tired, and they're tired, and maybe you're hungry, and you're scared.‚Äù

Napier added, ‚ÄúBut it's going to be okay. Everything is going to be all right.‚Äù

He also advised not to ‚Äúread into what the world is telling you about, Oh, this is how you should raise your baby.‚Äù Napier explained, ‚ÄúEvery baby is different and every family is different, and what works for yours may not work for theirs.‚Äù

Dakota Johnson is embracing a new chapter. She is moving forward with strength and purpose just weeks after her split from longtime partner Chris Martin.

A source close to the ‚ÄòMaterialists' actor spoke to People and said, ‚ÄúDakota's doing well. The split wasn't exactly a shock,‚Äù. The insider added that Johnson, 35, and the Coldplay frontman, 48, ‚Äúhad the same issues for a while.‚Äù

Multiple sources confirmed to People on June 4 that Johnson and Martin had ended their nearly eight-year relationship. The couple was first linked in 2017 and were last photographed together in Malibu on May 16.

A post shared by üáπüá∑ Coldplay T√ºrkiye | coldplayturkeypage (@coldplayturkeypage)

About three months earlier, a source told People the couple had been engaged ‚Äúfor years.‚Äù 

The insider added that they were ‚Äúin no rush to get married‚Äù after first sparking engagement rumors in 2020.

A post shared by curators of pop culture (@deuxmoi)

The couple had faced breakup rumors in August 2024. Later, Johnson's rep shut down at the time. One insider had noted: ‚ÄúThey've had issues and taken breaks in the past, but things are great now. They both love their careers. They are balancing things the best they can.‚Äù

‚ÄúDakota wants to live her life very intentionally ‚Äî she doesn't want to have any regrets,‚Äù the source told People in a report published on June 23rd. 

After years of balancing a busy career with a high-profile relationship, Johnson is now focusing on what truly matters to her. 

‚ÄúShe loves all her creative projects and is excited about her career. She believes there is more to life than work, though. She wants a meaningful life on all levels,‚Äù the insider adds.

Johnson is currently starring in ‚ÄúMaterialists‚Äù, which premiered in theaters on June 13. 

Her next film, ‚ÄúSplitsville‚Äù, is set to premiere on Aug. 22. Watch the trailer here:

Martin, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on June 16 with his son, Moses, 19. The singer also shares daughter Apple, 21, with ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow.

Johnson had previously opened up about her bond with Martin's children in a March 2024 Bustle interview. ‚ÄúI love those kids like my life depends on it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWith all my heart.‚Äù

She also shared her love of watching Martin perform: ‚ÄúI could watch him every day. I don't know how to explain it. ‚Ä¶ I'm watching my most favorite being do his most favorite thing.‚Äù

Martin will resume touring with Coldplay in Toronto on July 7, with shows across North America and England through Sept. 8.

A post shared by Coldplay (@coldplay)

Fans, however, believe that the breakup may have had an emotional impact on Martin.

 In a June 19 post on X (formerly Twitter), PopTingz shared a clip of Martin performing Sparks, noting he got emotional and softly added ‚Äúyes I will‚Äù after singing ‚ÄúI won't let you down.

While the breakup may have saddened fans of one of Hollywood's favorite couples, Dakota Johnson appears to be entering a new chapter.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Adam Levine Says He's Used to ‚ÄòNot Fitting In' Anywhere","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/adam-levine-maroon-5-not-fitting-in/","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 14:05:38 GMT","

Maroon 5 frontman and ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù coach Adam Levine has sold millions of records around the world, but the Grammy winner still doesn't feel like he's found his niche ‚Äî and that's quite alright with him. 

On June 23, 2025, the group announced its first new album in four years, ‚ÄúLove is Like,‚Äù will be released in August, supported by a U.S. tour. 

In an interview with Lisa Thomas of iHeartRadio's KIIS-FM on June 17, Levine said the band is getting back to ‚Äúwhat we used to do, which is like, not pay attention to anything at all‚Äù in terms of genres or trends. While that's been problematic at times for record executives since Maroon 5 broke onto the scene in 2002, Levine said he's most comfortable and successful when he's ‚Äúnot fitting in.‚Äù

During his interview with Thomas, Levine said the new record ‚Äúwas, like, a very isolated album.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe live in Santa Barbara now,‚Äù Levine said of his wife Behati Prinsloo and their three children. ‚ÄúAnd I was in a room with very few people and producing the music kind of organically,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's about as organic as it gets right so like it doesn't follow any trends, really, I don't think.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause that's kind of how we stuck out in the beginning when we first started our career,‚Äù Levine recalled. ‚ÄúLike I don't think we fit in anywhere. I think that was, in fact, like one of the biggest concerns for the record labels that we were trying to sign to, was like, ‚ÄòOh well, these guys fit in ‚Ä¶ they're like pop group but they're a band but they're this.'‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, not fitting in is kind of what I'm most comfortable with,‚Äù Levine said. ‚ÄúAnd I think now we're kind of starting to not fit in again, which is great.‚Äù

Levine was one of the original coaches on ‚ÄúThe Voice,‚Äù launching the show in 2011 with Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, and CeLo Green. After 16 seasons, he shocked fans when he abruptly left the show in 2019, telling media outlets including ‚ÄúThe Ellen DeGeneres Show‚Äù that he wanted to spend more time with his family.

He announced his return to the series in June 2024, just before filming started on season 27 with Michael Bubl√©, John Legend, and first-time coach Kelsea Ballerini. The season wrapped in May 2025, with Team Bubl√©'s Adam David winning. 

Soon after the show wrapped, reports surfaced that Levine didn't love being back on the show as much as he expected, missing his sarcastic banter with Shelton. It's already confirmed that he won't return for season 28, which will air in the fall, but with an upcoming tour, it's highly unlikely that Levine would be able to join season 29 either.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Best Hallmark Blooper Ever? New Clip Has Fans in Stitches After Actor ‚ÄòLet One Rip'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/best-blooper-fart-video-hallmark-channel/","Tue, 24 Jun 2025 03:21:10 GMT","

With an archive of more than a thousand original movies produced over the last 15 years, Hallmark Channel and its stars have shared plenty of cute and funny bloopers with fans. But the outtake that Ashley Williams posted on June 22, 2025, in honor of Paul Campbell's birthday may very well take the cake as the best Hallmark blooper ever.

Williams waited over a year to share what happened as they filmed the final scene of ‚ÄúFalling Together‚Äù in the spring of 2024. During what was meant to be a sweet, romantic moment, Williams wrote in the caption, ‚Äúa background actor‚Ä¶ let one rip RIGHT by where Paul and I were about to kiss.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt's the blooperiest of bloopers and it makes me cry laughing to this day,‚Äù she wrote, and then made matters even funnier with a smattering of puns, joking, ‚ÄúPaul, you are the wind beneath my wings. The air in my tires. You blow me away. Happy birthday, partner.‚Äù

A post shared by Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamsandcompany)

Williams added narrative text over the video to ensure fans could tell exactly when the flatulence in question occurred. In a scene designed to look like one of the Alzheimer's Association's annual fundraising walks, Campbell could be heard delivering his line to Williams. 

Over the video, she pointed out in text, ‚ÄúHere's the fart. You really gotta listen‚Ä¶We both CLEARLY hear it. But the camera is still rolling so we can't react.‚Äù

Trying to stifle their laughter, Williams says through gritted teeth, ‚ÄúWe have to kiss.‚Äù After smooching, she whispers and wheezily giggles, ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù and Campbell kisses her again just to disguise their laughter. 

As the camera pans out, she writes over the video, ‚ÄúWe cut. I collapse on Paul.‚Äù 

Many fans said they were in tears over the blooper video, flooding Williams' post with comments, including one who wrote, ‚ÄúI'm crying from laughter watching this! ü§£‚Äù and another who called it ‚Äúthe best thing ever üòÇ‚Äù

One fan commented, ‚ÄúI laughed so hard and laughed even harder hearing you laugh üòÇ‚Äù

Someone else admitted, ‚Äúyou are a hoot Ashley Williams, you made me laugh so hard, I about peed myself üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no idea how you kept your composure so well,‚Äù someone else wrote. ‚ÄúI died laughing immediatly!!! üòÇü§£‚Äù

A post shared by Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow)

Williams has every right to toot her own horn about the hilarious blooper from ‚ÄúFalling Together,‚Äù which premiered on Hallmark Channel in September. But believe it or not, it's not the only gas-induced outtake in the Hallmark archives. In 2023, a gassy horse named Noodles caused a bit of a stir during the filming of ‚ÄúWhen Calls The Heart‚Äù season 10. 

Plenty of other mishaps have been responsible for laugh-out-loud bloopers on the sets of Hallmark movies and series over the years, with stars getting tongue-tied or tripped up over what's happening on-set. 

One classic, seen above, is from the 2021 Tyler Hynes and Erin Krakow rom-com ‚ÄúIt Was Always You,‚Äù in which he timed his invitation to dance just-right each time she took a swig of champagne, causing her to bust out laughing. 

In early June, Hallmark provided a montage of funny outtakes to ‚ÄúEntertainment Tonight‚Äù of Williams and Alison Sweeney filming their ‚ÄúTo Barcelona‚Äù movies, including shots of Williams spilling Italian food on herself. 

In 2021, Williams (are you noticing a theme here?) was featured in another adorable blooper reel with her sister, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, to promote their ‚ÄúSister Swap‚Äù movies.

Robert Downey Jr. is singing Pedro Pascal‚Äòs praises. Both actors are appearing in the next Phase of the MCU, with Pascal leading ‚ÄúThe Fantastic Four: First Steps‚Äù as Reed Richards AKA Mr. Fantastic and Downey as Victor Von Doom AKA Doctor Doom for ‚ÄúAvengers: Doomsday.‚Äù Will they first square off in ‚ÄúFirst Steps‚Äù? Unclear. However, that didn't stop Downey from pointing to how Pascal is an inspiration for Hollywood as a whole.

‚ÄúPascal's slow trajectory to becoming a household name who is on a wildly hot streak kind of reaffirms my faith in our industry,‚Äù Downey told Vanity Fair. And it's true: Pascal really is everywhere. In addition to starring in ‚ÄúThe Fantastic Four,‚Äù the actor appears in ‚ÄúThe Last of Us,‚Äù ‚ÄúMaterialists,‚Äù ‚ÄúEddington,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian.‚Äù

And Pascal is also a newfound staple at Downey's own home, too. Pascal teased to VF that he (and presumably, his fellow ‚ÄúFantastic Four‚Äù co-stars Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn) has been part of the ‚Äú‚ÄòAvengers' cast ‚Äòhomework' day,‚Äù hosted by Downey, as VF reported.

Pascal said, ‚ÄúI don't know, I don't know,‚Äù when asked if he too was an Avenger, but it's evident that Downey at least is circling the wagons for the franchise given his return to the MCU. Downey was announced in 2024 as Doctor Doom after playing Iron Man for more than a decade. 

Pascal told VF that he was nervous about joining the acclaimed MCU franchise alongside so many icons‚Ä¶and fan opinions. Yet Downey eased the way for Pascal. 

‚ÄúI'm more aware of disgruntlement around my casting than anything I've ever done. ‚ÄòHe's too old. He's not right. He needs to shave,'‚Äù Pascal said, adding that Downey made him feel comfortable about his ‚ÄúFantastic Four‚Äù role. ‚ÄúHe's just so immediately generous and inviting that you feel like you can be afraid, you can be hungry, you can be ambivalent.‚Äù 

And Downey isn't the only MCU member who adores Pascal: ‚ÄúThe Fantastic Four‚Äù star Vanessa Kirby, who plays Pascal's onscreen wife, said that Pascal has an ‚Äúimmense vulnerability‚Äù as an actor. ‚ÄúHe doesn't have much armor, so he shows himself to you straight away,‚Äù she said of his inspirational acting techniques, ‚Äúand you trust that person because he's revealing himself to you in this very brave way.‚Äù 

Director Spike Jonze (who is unaffiliated with Marvel‚Ä¶.as of now), helmed an Apple ad with Pascal and summarized the actor's appeal: ‚ÄúI think that he's what we want in masculinity.‚Äù And given Pascal's meteoric rise to fame, that proves to be a fact.

Three Gen Zers leave their phones behind to find themselves ‚Äî in Norway, as rookie dogsledders ‚Äî in Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady‚Äòs delightful documentary ‚ÄúFolktales.‚Äù The latest nonfiction film from the Oscar-nominated ‚ÄúJesus Camp‚Äù directing duo premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, where Magnolia Pictures scooped it up for a domestic release. ‚ÄúFolktales‚Äù opens in New York on July 25 from Magnolia Pictures, with dates in Los Angeles and more cities to follow starting August 1, and IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer premiere below.

 










‚ÄúFolktales‚Äù centers on teenagers converging at a Norwegian folk school in the gap year between high school and college, and with sled dogs in tow to help them on their existential coming-of-age. The documentary filmmaking team behind ‚ÄúBoys of Baraka‚Äù this time embedded themselves in the Arctic wilderness, to chronicle the charismatic and angsty Hege, Romain, and Bj√∏rn Tore. It's another likely Oscar contender, a crowd-pleasing doc that will play well into the fall awards season.

Per Magnolia's description, ‚ÄúIn Norse mythology, the three ‚ÄòNorns' are powerful deities who weave the threads of fate and shape humans' futures. Today, Pasvik Folk High School in northern Norway aims to produce a similar life-changing effect on its students. ‚ÄòFolktales' tells the timely and heartwarming story of teenagers who choose to spend an unconventional ‚Äògap year' learning to dog sled and survive the Arctic wilderness, in hopes of finding connection and meaning in the modern world. Guided by patient teachers and a yard full of heroic Alaskan huskies, they discover their own potential and develop deep relationships with the land, animals and humans around them. Through intimate verit√© storytelling and exhilarating cinematography, Ewing and Grady examine humans on the cusp of adulthood, finding themselves at the edge of the world.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe filmed six or seven people before school started, hedging our bets, just meeting people and going to their homes,‚Äù Ewing told IndieWire back at Sundance. ‚ÄúThese three individuals all had something they were seeking, a specific reason they were going to the folk high school. They had road to travel. They were looking to change. We thought [these three] had the highest chance they might be different at the end than they were at the beginning.‚Äù

 










As for the 400 folk schools throughout Scandinavia that the filmmakers had to narrow down, ‚ÄúIt's an August tradition in Scandinavia. It's a rite of passage,‚Äù Ewing. ‚ÄúNot all of them focus on the natural world or survivalist. You can study circus arts or Viking life. We were interested in the ones that focused on survival and bushcraft and dog-sledding. We visited five schools [in Norway] and talked to at least 12. The last one we visited was Pasvik. It's so hard to get to. It's so inconvenient. It's so cold. We were like, ‚ÄòI hope this isn't the one.' And of course, we met the dog-sledding teachers, and the place had this stark, brutal magic, and it was obvious that there was a movie to be made there.‚Äù

As IndieWire's Kate Erbland wrote in her review, ‚ÄúThat Hege, Bj√∏rn Tore, and Romain will learn some big life lessons from Pasvik in general and those pups in particular is expected, but it's not a given. Instead, we are treated to all the joys and pains of 10 transformative months, with Ewing and Grady taking us inside an experience that's both specific and oddly universal. Not everything turns out the way we expect, not every story has a tidy ending, but no one ever said becoming a new self was easy or expected. Folk high school? It helps. And, yes, I'd still like to go.‚Äù

Ed Ulbrich loved the days of the early '90s and late '80s, when visual effects meant sitting on set with filmmakers or in screening rooms in post-production, aiming laser pointers at screens and literally shaping the look of a film. But as CGI tentpoles dominate the industry ‚Äî and he's worked on a number of them, from ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù to ‚ÄúTop Gun: Maverick‚Äù to ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù ‚Äî a little bit of the fun has come out of it. 

Suddenly, you have thousands of artists on four continents ‚Äî many of whom will never even meet the director, let alone work beside them ‚Äî working on a film's VFX. It takes some of the personality out of the endeavor. And, as Ulbrich told IndieWire during a recent interview, his work became ‚Äúfactory work‚Äù and not what he ‚Äúfell in love with.‚Äù

Ulbrich wanted something more hands-on, more personal, and something where he could solve creative problems through technology, and he's finding it in an unexpected place: artificial intelligence.




			Popular on IndieWire		






Last week, Ulbrich was announced to have joined AI research company Moonvalley as Head of Strategic Growth & Partnerships. After holding senior roles at Metaphysic, Deluxe, and James Cameron's Digital Domain, Ulbrich will now work alongside Moonvalley's sister company Asteria, the AI studio co-founded by Natasha Lyonne, to not just advance the tech powering their model, but also to use it in real projects.

 










Moonvalley recently launched Marey, an AI model they say is the first ‚Äî and only ‚Äî clean AI model, one they say is trained only on licensed material from artists who have explicitly granted their consent. That for him was the X-factor, the combination of a seemingly ethical use of artificial intelligence with an independent film studio that wants to put advanced tools and workflows in the hands of filmmakers.

It convinced him, and he believes it will make other converts to AI, too.

‚ÄúJust the people I know around the industry, there's been a lot of apprehension, but there's also a lot of people leaning in that are very curious and want to use this,‚Äù Ulbrich told IndieWire. ‚ÄúThat idea of these things have been stolen from all of us, if you can eliminate that, suddenly you realize, OK, there's something here. These are some powerful tools that are going to let us make things.‚Äù

Ulbrich's days with AI date all the way back to ‚ÄúThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button‚Äù and one of the first major instances of machine learning in film. On that movie, all of his focus was spent on Brad Pitt's face, trying to develop a way to translate Pitt's performance to his digital avatar. The de-aging process was so time-consuming and so costly that no one even thought to fear the implications.

 










But cut to Ulbrich's work on ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù last year's Robert Zemeckis film, starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright as seen throughout their entire lives. Now the tech is capable of creating de-aged deep fakes in real time on the video playback monitor. But in all his work at Metaphysic on that film, the AI was fully licensed training data with consent from the actors.

It's why, when he was approached by other tech companies to consult or to weigh in on tools like OpenAI's Sora, it had been a ‚Äúnon-starter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can't sell stolen pixels to a buyer. You're dead in the water,‚Äù Ulbrich said. ‚ÄúIt all sounds nice, there's not anybody I know knowingly saying, hey, we'll try it. Let's experiment! Hell no. That's not how this this works. Copyright matters.‚Äù

With Moonvalley and Asteria, he feels the company has ‚Äúlightning in a bottle,‚Äù but it won't mean much unless the tools behind it are great. Ulbrich said there might be great data scientists gifted with crafting the perfect prompts, but what it needs are intuitive designs and GUIs that will ‚Äúde-mystify‚Äù AI for creative types to start turning the knobs and get something brilliant. 

‚ÄúI met some amazing people during this process, and they're focusing on controls. That's what I keep hearing, this theme of controls; that's the magic, that's what you want to hear, is demystifying this stuff,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don't need to understand data science; I'm a filmmaker. I now have tools that I can use. They're either physical tools or digital tools that I can use to make things in a way that feels right. To me, that is where you start to see true innovation. And it's so amazing to be at this point in this trajectory.‚Äù

 










Asteria CEO Bryn Mooser in a statement said Ulbrich is an ‚Äúamazing asset‚Äù to the team and praised him being behind some of the biggest movies of the past 20 years: ‚ÄúHe created the visual effects industry as we know it and is going to be integral in bringing it into the future with new tools and technology.‚Äù 

Ulbrich knows that AI has the potential to replace countless jobs. His message to those concerned is simple: ‚ÄúBe concerned. But do something. Don't do anything, you're going to get replaced. It's going to happen.‚Äù

But he also says that, just as we lived through a period of ‚ÄúCGI slop,‚Äù we're in the same period with AI and the abundance of people using it. That too is going to change.

‚ÄúThere are filmmakers and people who would never get a shot, and this old system and the gatekeepers‚Ä¶ this is a key agent of change that is going to ripple through the entire ecosystem with no doubt,‚Äù Ulbrich said. ‚ÄúWhat's different about this then to digital, analog, to CGI, those types of things, is those things have moved at a more glacial pace. This is ‚Äî buckle up ‚Äî it's fast.‚Äù

Sterling K. Brown is deepening his roots at Hulu. After starring in the iconic ABC series ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù (and later reteaming with creator Dan Fogelman for ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù), the Emmy winner and Oscar nominee is back at the streamer with the novel adaptation of ‚ÄúWashington Black.‚Äù 

Brown stars in and executive produces the series based on Esi Edugyan's bestselling novel of the same name about a young boy who leaves a plantation in the 1800s and embarks on an adventure around the world. The official synopsis reads: ‚Äú‚ÄòWashington Black' follows the 19th-century odyssey of George Washington ‚ÄòWash' Black, an eleven-year-old boy (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) born on a Barbados sugar plantation, whose prodigious scientific mind sets him on a path of unexpected destiny.

Hinds and Harrison are the showrunners for the series, which is among IndieWire's most anticipated series of the season. IndieWire's Proma Khosla wrote that ‚ÄúWashington Black‚Äù is the top pick for Hulu debuts this July.

Brown previously told IndieWire's Anne Thompson he selects his roles based on which speak to him. ‚Äú[I want to] keep surprising people as much as I possibly can,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI enjoy making people feel. [‚Ä¶] I will go where the story is, where the best story is told, with wonderful creative partnerships. I'm happy to be in a place where I have choice. That's a rarity in this business.‚Äù

This autumn, Brandy and Monica will tour together for the first time, bringing along Kelly Rowland, Muni Long, and Jamal Roberts for dates across North America. Check out the co-headlining dates below, along with a tour trailer.

Brandy said in a press release, ‚ÄúThis really is a full-circle moment. Monica and I coming together again isn't just about the music‚Äîit's about honoring where we came from and how far we've both come. ‚ÄòThe Boy Is Mine' was a defining chapter in R&B, and to share the stage all these years later is bigger than a reunion‚Äîit's a celebration of growth, sisterhood, and the love our fans have given us from day one.‚Äù

Monica added, ‚ÄúThe love that ‚ÄòThe Boy Is Mine' continues to receive means everything to me. This tour is a celebration of our history, our impact, and the fans who have grown with us. Brandy and I have been on our own unique journeys, and coming back together in this way is a reminder of the power of respect, strength, and real music. We're giving the people what they've been asking for, and doing it with grace, love, and purpose. God's timing perfectly aligned us.‚Äù

Little Richard would prop one leg up on the piano and bang chords with his foot. Jerry Lee Lewis would stand on the piano and stomp the keys. Pete Townshend would smash his guitar to bits. Jimi Hendrix would play guitar behind his head and pretend to have sex with it and then light it on fire. James Brown would pretend to faint then miraculously revive himself.

To be a real showman takes charisma, magnetism, or what they used to call moxie in this business. I'd say it's a lost art, except the art of the showman is the lingua franca of the online generation. Scroll down any social media feed far enough and witness the new Vaudevillian theatre, an endless line of people auditioning just for you, stealing your attention through some feat, stunt, bit, dance, or trick. Here is the family of oafs who rates Costco food, a cringe dad and his sons who learn all the TikTok dances, the crew who goes d√∏dsing off a dam, the jock trick shot brothers, the DJ on four decks spamming hot cues, the 12-year-old guitarist, the six-year-old drummer, the baby with a noise side project, the guy who walks around New York making songs on a mobile production rig, or the guy who is one of only a few people in the world who learned to do a standing double backflip.

This makes the classic showman‚Äîmuch less the utterly jejune single-backflipping showman‚Äîrather conventional. And still, Boone has boinged himself into the global consciousness through his enormous 2024 hit ‚ÄúBeautiful Things.‚Äù I'm not one to argue in bad faith, so let me just say that Boone is not just regular talented but rather talented. More talented than me, that's for sure. I can't backflip; I can't sing like he can; I've never dropped out of two separate institutions‚ÄîBrigham Young University and American Idol‚Äîto pursue my childhood dream of being a pop star. To admire Boone is like drunkenly admiring an Olympian, in that you're like, I could probably do this, but you almost certainly cannot.

It's also important to note that Boone has the drop on us critics here. He's aware that, following his show-stopping Grammys performance earlier this year, he might be pegged as a one-trick pony forever trying to top the two-billion streaming hit that brought him here. The music video for the lively ‚ÄúMr Electric Blue,‚Äù a dim highlight from his mercifully brief second album, American Heart, begins with a sketch of Boone being summoned into the office of his slimy agent, played by his real-life producer and songwriting partner, Jack LaFrantz. Boone is, indeed, wearing a shirt that says ‚ÄúOne Hit Wonder.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need something new,‚Äù the agent says, weary of all the backflipping. ‚ÄúWe need a new gimmick. Maybe good songwriting!‚Äù At this, Boone drops his head, looks him square in the eye and says: ‚ÄúYou know I can't do that.‚Äù

Ahh goddammit that's pretty funny. Fair play, Boone! You got me! Unfortunately, I know a lot about good songwriting. So here we are at this stalemate where I have to break one of the chief rules of criticism: faulting an artist for not doing something they didn't attempt‚Äîin this case, faulting Boone for not writing good songs. While I consider that, luckily, there are myriad other issues to address with American Heart, starting with its cover, which looks like the movie poster for Zack Snyder's lost Bruce Springsteen biopic. For a guy who told Rolling Stone he doesn't ‚Äúwant to rely on my physical form to be the primary driver of my shows,‚Äù it's interesting that he's here on the cover, abs chiseled from marble, seemingly having just rescued the American flag from a big fire at the symbolism factory.

Looking at the cover art and title, you'd think maybe one idea about America‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîmight factor into American Heart in some way, especially because Boone referenced Springsteen as a touchpoint for this album. But these songs are American insofar as they do not evoke a specific time or place and have nothing really to say, so they are just hegemonically American by default. It's not even cloying in the way that Beyonc√© waving a flag on her album feels a little cloying, or Post Malone carpetbagging into country music feels a little cloying. When Boone sings on the title track‚Äîa song about a near-death experience in a car crash when he was a teenager‚Äîrepeatedly about his ‚ÄúAmerican heart,‚Äù there's none of the ironic distance of ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù or even the national pride of ‚ÄúSweet Home Alabama.‚Äù Boone is just a 22-year-old from Monroe, Washington, and, thus, American, who has a heart.

I'm not going into Boone's album looking for the next Bob Dylan, though there is a song here called ‚ÄúMan in Me,‚Äù which bears no relation to the Dylan song of the same name, because this is the song where Boone sings, ‚ÄúYou really made me bleed blood on these ivory keys,‚Äù a line in desperate need of some workshopping. If anything, Boone struggles to sound like anyone other than Harry Styles, a more charismatic showman from across the pond whose preexistence calls into question the whole Benson Boone project in the first place. Both singers trade in this kind of fake-retro Los Angeles pop-rock sound, which is a commercialization of the indie psychedelic-soul backbeat Tame Impala's Kevin Parker minted about a decade ago. I wonder if Parker is haunted by the bouncy bassline of Boone's ‚ÄúMystical Magical,‚Äù not unlike how J. Robert Oppenheimer is haunted by his actions.

Most of Boone's album makes me appreciate the relatively cool and confident pop music of his peers. Each song on American Heart is just an empty lunchbox with a few crumbs left by his betters. His ‚ÄúI Wanna Be the One You Call‚Äù is a swipe at Styles' ‚ÄúAs It Was,‚Äù only performed by someone dripping with flop sweat. At least the Sabrina Carpenter experience comes with a legible persona and bawdy wit‚ÄîBoone's attempt at a poolside summer jam with ‚ÄúMystical Magical‚Äù feels best suited to middle school sleepovers.

Instead of a musical or narrative point of view, Boone relies on speaking his truth, a songwriting axiom that doesn't take into account whether someone's truth is fundamentally boring or has been rendered in pop music countless times before. So you get Boone, clearly someone cramming a big personality into a tight-fitting jumpsuit, singing mawkish tunes about how much he loves his mom and admires his dad.

Boone's music is an invasive species in the garden of good taste, but it's important to understand that it is a thriving, native species in the world of Netflix's Love Is Blind. The reality dating show, where conventionally attractive sales and marketing people try to fall in love with each other sight unseen, famously uses the kind of anonymous schlock pop that sync houses sell to the show for pennies on the dollar. Yes, there are several songs here that sound like Kirkland-brand Killers songs, but it's Boone's music that thrives in the common, normal world where love is banality, cliches, and the performance of how one ought to show love on a massively popular reality dating show. It's a step removed from the genuine article: music for people who like how music sounds, but not for people who like music.

So I don't fault the wholesome pop star son of Mormon parents for not writing songs about the rot at the heart of America, or for not biting the heads off bats on stage. But it's really hard to consider a teetotaling showman with a voice straight out of The Voice and not think: What makes any of this actually special? Sure, he can sing, but there's very little flair, camp, sass, or insouciance to his voice to give it dimension and character. Boone's words come out in one impressively earnest register, like his forefather Ed Sheeran, and the long line of buskers before him. There's nothing here that says Boone is ready to enter the pantheon of the real showmen, no more than the thousands of other guys singing, dancing, and backflipping for you on Instagram Reels.

8.1

Genre:

Folk/Country

Label:

Slough Water

Reviewed:

June 24, 2025

Some writers put too much stock in the Great Opening Line. S.G. Goodman has a couple of those, but more often, the Kentucky artist's best moments happen in the middle. Goodman is a structuralist at heart; all of her balancing beams connect in the center of the song, and it's there we find out‚Äînot at the beginning, or even at the end‚Äîwhat this thing is all about.

In Goodman's music, there is always a new way to understand where you come from. For her, that place is Hickman, Kentucky‚Äîa town steeped in the scent of redtops and tobacco fields, where gas station attendants still pump your gas, and families attend church no fewer than three times a week. It's a place Goodman conjures up with tactile clarity on her third album, Planting by the Signs. Each song is drowsy with heat. Goodman's voice, once climbing into yelps, now sits chesty and grounded, its depth evoking early Lucinda Williams filtered through Cat Power's Moon Pix. She sings with a little tremolo so that God can hear her better, and delivers her lyrics with the charm and ease of someone showing you around their home while tea whistles on the stove.

Goodman finds her own perspectives and idiosyncrasies in tradition. Drawing from a roots-rock sound, the drums stomp and clap with a crunch. The baritone on ‚ÄúNature's Child‚Äù sounds soaked in whiskey. The burnished tones of her keyboard pads drift lazily across ‚ÄúHeat Lightning‚Äù like cigarette butts floating down the Mississippi. All across the album, Goodman showcases a great understanding of space and how to fill it. Where she puts busier, low-end percussion in the bottom of the mix, as on ‚ÄúSatellite,‚Äù she makes sure her arrangements are sparse on the surface, her vocals and guitar gliding softly.

Goodman also knows where balance isn't necessary. She is so imaginative with words that you don't mind when her lyrics topple the syllabic weight of the line. She could have rewritten the standout lyric of ‚ÄúFire Sign,‚Äù ‚Äúliving like the sun don't shine/on the same dog's ass everyday,‚Äù with an eye toward metrical concision, but why would she? It's too good; a proverb for the ages.

Like the best artists from the South, Goodman renounces perfect symmetry and leans instead toward the crooked and out-of-focus. These are qualities embodied by the characters who populate her songs: mamas working for measly dollars. Girls unable to escape their small towns. A dying dog on his way to heaven. Her view downcast, Goodman takes on the role of omniscient narrator, threading her characters' strange particulars and stray observations into a web of connectivity. As Goodman sings on ‚ÄúI Can See the Devil,‚Äù each of them live ‚Äúunder the same sunshine‚Äù that made the potlikker grow.

These characters' intentions come into focus in the song's center, flanked on either side by a series of vivid scene descriptors. Goodman's scenes across the album are all sharply visual, but there's one image that'll get lodged in your memory in particular. You'll find it on ‚ÄúSnapping Turtle,‚Äù the album's outstanding midpoint. Before ruminating on life beyond small-town life (and whether such a thing even exists), Goodman recalls coming upon kids brutally hitting a turtle with sticks in her tiny town. She asks for ‚Äúa lick‚Äù‚Äîand just when you think she might join the cruelty, she flips it: She takes their stick, beats the kids senseless, and drives home with the turtle in the back of her truck. ‚ÄúI brought down the wrath of God himself,‚Äù she sings, her voice warbling. In that moment, she gets a little closer to God‚Äîor at least meets Him in the middle.

Paramore drummer Zac Farro has announced his debut solo album under his own name: Operator is out July 18 via Congrats. Leading the album is the new song ‚ÄúMy My,‚Äù which goes down a country-folk route that differs from the pop-rock tint of both his side-project Halfnoise and Paramore. Give it a listen below.

‚Äú‚ÄòMy My' is a personal song about witnessing a loved one try to let go of someone they care for deeply,‚Äù explained Farro. ‚ÄúThat kind of silent pain. This song holds a lot of weight and captures those moments of reflection and processing that run throughout the album.‚Äù

After years of recording music under the moniker Halfnoise, Farro decided to record a new album under his own name after exploring ‚Äúdeeply personal‚Äù subjects in a new batch of songs, such as family issues, anxieties, and communication breakdowns. Operator spans nine songs, all of which were written by Farro. Joining him on the record are friends and Nashville musicians Josh Gilligan and Chancey Pierce.

Farro started the band Halfnoise mere days after he originally departed Paramore in 2010. His band has gone on to release five albums since then, the most recent of which, City Talk, came out in 2023. Although Farro eventually rejoined Paramore as a permanent member, in 2016, Halfnoise is still active to this day. As for Paramore, their sixth album, This Is Why, came out in 2023.

New Zealand indie-rockers the Beths have announced their first new album in three years. Straight Line Was a Lie is out August 29 via Anti-, marking their debut on the label. The band has also shared the new song ‚ÄúNo Joy,‚Äù which singer Elizabeth Stokes wrote when trying to process the newfound benefits and struggles of taking an SSRI for her health. Watch the ‚ÄúNo Joy‚Äù video below.

‚Äú[‚ÄòNo Joy'] is about anhedonia, which, paradoxically, was there both in the worst parts of depression, and then also when I was feeling pretty numb on my SSRI,‚Äù Stokes explained. ‚ÄúIt wasn't that I was sad, I was feeling pretty good. It was just that I didn't like the things that I liked. I wasn't getting joy from them. It's very literal.‚Äù

Straight Line Was a Lie was written in Los Angeles and recorded in the Beths' hometown of Auckland, New Zealand. The follow-up to their 2022 full-length, Expert in a Dying Field, gets its album title from the illusion of linear progression and how, according to Stokes, life is about finding meaning in the maintenance.

As previously announced, the Beths are going on a huge headlining tour later this year, with dates scheduled across the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada, and the United States. Joining them as openers on select concerts are Illuminati Hotties, Squirrel Flower, Bret McKenzie, Phoebe Rings, and Dateline.

Last month, Thom Yorke finally released a studio version of his new song ‚ÄúDialing In,‚Äù which he's been playing live for over five years, as part of the soundtrack for the upcoming Apple TV+ series Smoke.

	After bombing three of Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend, President Donald Trump is now demanding that everyone just simmer down. It's hard to keep the peace when missiles are flying across borders, and Trump is learning firsthand that it takes more than simply posting online that a ceasefire is in effect to end military aggression. 


	Early Tuesday morning, Iran reportedly fired a barrage of missiles that struck an apartment complex in southern Israel, killing at least four people. The Iranian military later denied firing the munitions in violation of the ceasefire. Israel responded by striking a radar base north of Tehran. 


	Speaking to reporters outside of the White House, Trump said he was ‚Äúnot happy‚Äù with Israel and Iran. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	‚ÄúWe basically have two countries that are fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,‚Äù he ranted. ‚Äú[Iran] violated, but Israel violated it too. Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs ‚Äî the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen ‚Äî I'm not happy with Israel.‚Äù 

	










President Trump on Israel and Iran: ""We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing."" pic.twitter.com/xrztmebALZ


	Last week, Israel launched a wave of surprise attacks targeting Iranian military officials and members of its nuclear program. Trump then entangled the United States in the conflict,  bombing major nuclear facilities in Iran on Saturday. Iran responded with a wave of intentionally ineffective missile launches against U.S. military targets in the region. 

	











	‚ÄúCONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT'S TIME FOR PEACE!‚Äù Trump wrote shortly after on Monday, adding that it ‚Äúhas been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE [‚Ä¶] for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!‚Äù


	Case closed, skirmish over, regional destabilization and global conflict averted ‚Ä¶ or so one would hope. 


	‚ÄúTHE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!‚Äù Trump wrote Tuesday at one in the morning as reports circulated of escalating tensions between the two nations. Shortly after, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that the military would resume its offensive against Iran, and a wave of drone attacks was deployed against Iranian military bases ‚Äî and planned for more.

	‚ÄúISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!‚Äù he wrote on Truth Social at around six in the morning. About an hour and a half later, Trump wrote that ‚ÄúISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‚ÄòPlane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect! Thank you for your attention to this matter!‚Äù 


	According to Axios, the president had a decidedly terse conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, in which the Israeli leader said he was unable to cancel the ordered strikes against Iran, but agreed to scale them back. Trump spoke to Netanyahu in ‚Äúan exceptionally firm and direct way,‚Äù a White House source told Axios. 


	‚ÄúThe president told Netanyahu what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire. The Prime Minister understood the severity of the situation and the concerns President Trump expressed,‚Äù the source added. 


	Throughout the Israel-Hamas war, the Netanyahu government has repeatedly been accused of violating ceasefire agreements and tanking peace negotiations. In May, Israel broke a ceasefire agreement with Hamas by launching a wave of surprise airstrikes and blockading the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza amid talks to extend a previously negotiated pause in hostilities. Over the course of the war, the United States, Israel's chief military and political ally, has refused to meaningfully press the nation to commit to a ceasefire, or penalize it for violating human rights law over the course of the war.

	Even as Trump attempts to coordinate a workable ceasefire between Israel and Iran, on Tuesday morning Israeli military forces reportedly opened fire on crowds of Palestinians ‚Äî who remain in near-starvation conditions ‚Äî waiting for humanitarian aid in central Gaza, killing at least 25 people. The massacre is the latest instance in a string of incidents that humanitarian groups say have resulted in hundreds of Palestinians being killed while awaiting scarce food and provisions under the control of the Israeli military.

	Last I saw Willie Nelson, on the Outlaw Music Festival tour, he gave well-earned solo space to son Lukas Nelson, who just released his first solo album. It's high time. Dude's a lifelong utility player ‚Äî rock solid on guitar and vocals with the family band, while Willie circles the beat, and a team player with frequent Neil Young backing crew Promise of the Real. He's become a go-to duet partner, notably with fellow next-gen icon Sierra Ferrell. Ferrell's cameo on ¬≠Nelson's new American Romance is ‚ÄúFriend in the End,‚Äù a song about a bond that can see us through darkness, until ‚Äúthe clouds blew south/And the rain thinned out/And the sky was all sunlight again.‚Äù It's a timely metaphor, and a good example of country's ability to mirror how ¬≠America sees itself, accurately or wishfully.  


	Nelson has said the album title refers to his romance with the nation. The album's deepest song, ‚ÄúThe Lie,‚Äù is a laundry list of cultural hogwash. ‚ÄúCome here, kid/Here's a story for you/You're defined by what you do/ No one ever made it stayin' home with the kids/And if you ain't winnin'/You ain't worth shit,‚Äù describing an American mindset that can turn a ‚Äúsimple soul‚Äù into a ‚Äúspinning black hole.‚Äù But American Romance also celebrates national beauty, pride, and wonder. 

	











Hailey Whitters broadcast her storytelling skill on The Dream in 2020, and her knack for rebooting country clich√©s got sharpened on 2022's Raised. With Corn Queen, she supersizes it all into what should prove the most giddily virtuosic country album of the year. Stuart Duncan, Charlie Worsham, Justin Moses, and clawhammer guitar hero Molly Tuttle bring instrumental flash, and it serves songs that are poignant and hilarious by turns. When Tuttle and Whitters lean into the chorus of ‚ÄúProdigal Daughter‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúHoly smoke and holy water/From doe-eyed girl to prodigal daughter/Did a devil's dance to a fiddle in a holler/This angel's hell on the heavenly Father‚Äù ‚Äî it's as fun as an old-time fall-from-grace gets. Corn Queen shows how modern country can celebrate tradition without being a macho flex or a cultural bulwark. It can just be a playground: for camp cosplay, strutting your stuff, and partying with friends.

	Which doesn't mean Whitters can't go deep. She's a versatile writer, assisted here by Hillary Lindsey and Shane McAnally, among others. ‚ÄúCasseroles‚Äù is a weeper about a widower that interrogates how we care for grieving friends. ‚ÄúI Don't Want You,‚Äù with Charles Wesley Godwin, joins a mini trend in thoughtfully dysfunctional duets. But Whitters is most winning when the lyrical liquor flows ‚Äî see ‚ÄúLoose Strings‚Äù and ‚ÄúFillin' My Cup‚Äù ‚Äî and ‚ÄúShotgun Wedding Baby‚Äù is the mic drop here. Any family history that begins ‚ÄúEighteen don't know shit from Shinola/Well thank God my daddy had Crown in his cola‚Äù has our unshakable respect.

Anderson East is another ¬≠master craftsman, one whose concept of country leans into the old-school Southern R&B sounds Chris Stapleton reanimated in the genre's mainstream. With Dave Cobb co¬≠producing, East really goes in on Worthy, paying matter-of-fact homage to Otis Redding against dukes-up Stax/Volt horn arrangements, or conjuring Roy Orbison (‚ÄúSay I Love You‚Äù) in ¬≠orchestral pop settings that might've pleased George Martin. The writing shines, with assists from Lori Mc¬≠Kenna (‚ÄúChasing‚Äù) and Trent Dabbs, wingman on East's 2021 profound pandemic journey, Maybe We Never Die (he also co-wrote ‚ÄúHigh Horse‚Äù with Kacey Musgraves). In the vein of Jim Ford and Tony Joe White, East's voice is fully formed here, twining country rootstock with soul and gospel so tightly that the ¬≠traditions feel inseparable, and ¬≠rightly so.


	The head turner on Kelsey Waldon's haunting new album is ‚ÄúFalling Down,‚Äù a first-person character study of hard drinking that's a shade darker than Whitters' approach. ‚ÄúMy wife is gone, and my kids are grown/And I don't talk to them no more,‚Äù Waldon sings with a plainspoken, gut-punching lilt. But Every Ghost is a survivor's journey, from the doom-scroll sorrow of ‚ÄúNursery Rhyme‚Äù to ‚ÄúLost in My Idlin',‚Äù a Hank Williams update with a tattoo-ready ‚Äúwishin' I was fucked up in some honky-tonk‚Äù chorus. The set comes via John Prine's Oh Boy Records, and Waldon proves herself worthy of his truth-talking legacy. And for the rec¬≠ord: Your American-flag decal still won't get you into heaven.

	You can tell a lot about people by how they behave in a crisis. And it's safe to say the voyage of the Carnival Triumph, better known as the Poop Cruise, was an icky, smelly, particularly grotesque kind of crisis ‚Äî and that brought out some wild behavior.


	It happened way back in 2013, but chances are some of the details are emblazoned in your memory. The Triumph, set to cruise from Galveston, Texas to Cozumel, Mexico, suffered an electrical fire that knocked out the engine and air conditioning. And then, the coup de poop: the electrical toilets stopped working. This was definitely a problem with more than 4,000 passengers and crew onboard. And you thought Lord of the Flies was bad.


	The story is told anew, and with a heaping helping of snarky humor, in the new Netflix documentary Trainwreck: Poop Cruise, part of a series that looks at mishaps of varying severity (previous installments this season have focused on the 2021 Astroworld tragedy and scandal-ridden Toronto mayor Rob Ford). Not to belittle the trauma of anyone unfortunate enough to be aboard the Triumph, but this Trainwreck, premiering Tuesday, intentionally toes the line between tragedy and comedy. Here are five lessons learned and, er, highlights: 

	











	An initial press release relayed news of a fire aboard the cruise, but it was under control. A cruise ship adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, with no engine power or AC: interesting, unfortunate, but not the stuff of sensationalist headlines. Then passengers started calling in with their own grisly details, which got a lot grislier once the tugboats showed up and tilted the ship just enough to set loose the previously-somewhat-contained human waste. Voila: Poop Cruise.

	











	Former CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin recalls in the doc that then-new CNN president Jeff Zucker made the decision to go all-in on the story. ‚ÄúWe needed eyeballs on the screen,‚Äù she explains. Only then did we get to hear Wolf Blitzer intone that ‚ÄúSewage is dripping off the walls.‚Äù Soon the hashtag #CruiseShipFromHell was ubiquitous. Oh, the humanity.

	If you don't believe us, take it from Hanna, a bartender aboard the Poop Cruise and star of some of the doc's most candid moments. ‚ÄúThere is so much sex on the cruise ship,‚Äù she says in the doc. ‚ÄúSo much sex, you don't want to know.‚Äù (Oh, but we do, Hanna. We do). ‚ÄúEverything is hard and fun.‚Äù (So to speak).


	Later, Hannah admits she was not actually in her cabin when an alarm (‚ÄúAlpha team! Alpha team!‚Äù) signaled the crisis. She was in the bed of another crew member. And after a couple of days adrift, when the decision was made to serve free drinks, a newlywed couple could be spotted having sex on a deck chair for all to see. To be fair, panic had long since set in. 


	Once news of the toilet malfunction was announced, a contingency plan followed: pee in the showers, and do what most people in the doc call ‚Äúa No. 2‚Äù in little red biohazard bags. (Never will you hear so many people speak in childhood euphemisms about bowel movements.) Nobody seemed to like the bag idea. Some opted to pop Imodium. Others went the grin-and-hold-it route. Once the free drinks flowed, some drunken revelers Tossed the full red bags overboard. Meanwhile, others tried to use the out-of-service toilets. Abhi, a Triumph chef with an endearing habit of saying things were ‚Äúfucked up,‚Äù describes the toilet horror: ‚ÄúPeople were pooping on top of toilet paper, then pooping on top of that. It was layer after layer after layer. It was like a lasagna.‚Äù At the end of the doc, we learn that Abhi ‚Äúhas never looked at lasagna the same way.‚Äù

	Things fell apart; the center could not hold; mere anarchy was loosed upon the Poop Cruise. There was the hurling of feces bags, and open fornication, and peeing (or ‚Äúgoing No. 1,‚Äù if you prefer) off the side of the deck. There was also food hoarding. Passengers fought over deck chairs and deck square footage. Once again, Hanna the bartender, who grew up in the Soviet Union, delivers the goods: ‚ÄúIt made me think that now all these Americans somehow can feel what it was like in a dictatorship country, where shit like this happens and it doesn't surprise anyone. Welcome to the Soviet Union, people.‚Äù Once the Bible study broke out, along with full-throated hymns, the whole thing came to resemble a Cormac McCarthy novel, or maybe a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Repent, Poop Cruisers! Repent!

	











 Once the Triumph was tugged safely to Mobile, Alabama, after five days stranded at sea, Carnival insisted that the fire was an accident, that recommended actions had been taken to prevent incidents similar to previous electrical malfunctions, and that the vessel was fully compliant and had been certified to sail by regulatory bodies. The company carried out fleet-wide safety upgrades aimed at preventing engine room fires, and changed its terms and conditions, removing caveats about wholesome food, sanitary and safe living conditions, safe passage, and a sea-worthy vessel. Passengers were given a full refund, transportation expenses, and a $500 payment. They were also offered a free cruise. Carnival spent $115 million cleaning, repairing, and retrofitting the Triumph. The vessel is now called the Carnival Sunrise, should you wish to book passage.

	In a statement to Rolling Stone, Carnival called the ordeal a ‚Äúteachable moment‚Äù for the entire cruise industry. ‚ÄúA thorough investigation following the incident revealed a design vulnerability which was corrected and led Carnival Cruise Line to invest more than $500 million across our entire fleet in comprehensive fire prevention and suppression, improved redundancy, and enhanced management systems, all in support of our commitment to robust safety standards,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúWe are proud of the fact that since 2013 over 53 million guests have enjoyed safe and memorable vacations with us, and we will continue to operate to these high standards.‚Äù

	Your body heat is rising in this sweaty-packed crowd of 30,000 people descending upon a converted sports stadium, forced to cozy up next to one another amid an extraordinary public health emergency. You can smell each other's body odor as you wait for your name to be called. A ‚Äúvoucher fever‚Äù has spread to everyone you know and the many more you don't. Your heart-rate is up; your eyes are racing back and forth. The mood is fit to blow.


	Everyone haphazardly rushes the crumbling government office that has but a few hundred vouchers to distribute, by lottery, among tens of thousands desperate to win the jackpot: an American home virtually paid for by the government, even if it comes with strings attached. The dust settles on several people trampled underfoot after a stampede occurred at a similar event a year later, by a crowd measuring more than a mile long. 


	This isn't a scene cut from a dystopian sagas like World War Z or The Road. Nor did it occur in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. This scabby reality unfolded outside a cramped Housing Authority office in a wooded suburb southwest of Atlanta in 2010 when 30,000 people showed up for the chance to claim 455 available housing vouchers. The stampede occurred in 2011, when the Department of Health and Human Services used a local sports complex in the Redbird neighborhood of southwest Dallas to hand out a similarly tiny portion of housing vouchers on a first-come, first-served basis, for the first time in years.

	











	Both stories are woven seamlessly into There Is No Place for Us: Working and Homeless in America, Brian Goldstone's stunning narrative account of the working poor whose unhoused ranks have swelled over the past generation, largely without any notice or regard from media or public agencies.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Building his book upon a sturdy web of narrative detail and propulsive storytelling, Goldstone, a journalist trained as an anthropologist, follows five Black families in Atlanta as their full-time jobs and dreams of upward mobility are interrupted by a crushing inability to keep themselves housed. The booming economic development projects that surround them ‚Äî like in every major U.S. city ‚Äî are driving up rent prices higher and faster than the minimum wage can sustain. And the welfare system, by design, does not recognize their plight.

	There is early twentysomething Britt: a fast-food server, sometime security guard and other times hairstylist, mother of five. Early thirtysomething Kara Thompson: a medical worker and later a DoorDash driver, mother of four. Then there's thirtysomething Celeste: a warehouse worker whom we meet just before she's diagnosed with cancer and right after a jilted lover burns down her rental home ‚Äî all while raising three children on her own.


	The book's working parents include the steadfast Natalia and Maurice Taylor, a State Farm call operator and a rental car salesman, respectively, with three kids. Then there's the fortysomething Michelle, a back-to-school mother of three who grinds her way through the narrative as she struggles with inner demons, especially after her husband Jacob, a maintenance worker, leaves the picture.


	But desperation, Michelle has told her kids since they were younger, forces you to get creative. On a frigid January day, while Michelle ventures out to scrounge for scraps ‚Äî eventually panhandling so the family can survive ‚Äî her teenagers, D.J. and Danielle, know to always stay indoors, often watching their toddler sister Skye, spending their time on a thin layer of bath towels near a heap of discarded cleaning supplies, water buckets, and random small appliances. D.J. and Danielle know they mustn't make any noise so they can keep staying safely in their secret hovel, undetected by the outside world. For the last four nights, the family has been living in a cramped storage closet of the extended-stay hotel A2B, where Michelle had recently found a job but then lost it.

	Michelle was about to give up after hours of holding a paper sign that reads, ‚ÄúHOMELESS PLEASE HELP,‚Äù when a kind passerby offered to call her church's homeless outreach coordinator, Phillis. Within an hour Michelle was in Phillis' hatchback driving around to find the cheapest motel possible, where Phillis paid the first two weeks' rent upfront from her church's emergency fund. Michelle's new temporary shelter was the Efficiency Lodge, where much of the book's drama unfolds when multiple characters separately end up there.

	











	At the heart of Goldstone's nonfiction dystopia is The Efficiency, a world where landlords have become warlords who sic their hired mercenaries ‚Äî suited up in battle gear and armed with AR-15 automatic rifles ‚Äî to evict working families at gunpoint, like what occurred at The Efficiency in September 2020.


	Here, ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù doesn't exist for the dozen put-out families, as a sympathetic county commissioner and police lieutenant explain, in so many words, when they arrive to meet the displaced crowd. Several days earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had announced a federal moratorium on evictions to curb mass death sentences to the at least 12 million households reportedly at risk of eviction. But within hours, a county magistrate tells police they have no authority to stop the landlord's militia. Plus, a proviso buried in the fine print of the moratorium excludes residents of hotels and motels from federal protection.


	Pandemic or no pandemic, there are no happy endings here. There never was for Natalia Taylor, who ‚Äî while in an extended-stay motel when Covid hit ‚Äî experienced the early weeks of lockdown ‚Äúless as a rupture than as a continuation of the distress she had been feeling for much of the past year,‚Äù Goldstone observes.


	The sting of modern homelessness essentially creates a state of permanent pandemic that seems to take on the status of a super villain: wreaking chaos and suffering through the power of invisibility.


	The human surplus of those who are homeless while working in America numbers at least 4 million. The latest record-setting totals of over 770,000 unhoused Americans only counts people at homeless shelters or encampments, not those who sleep in their cars, double up with friends or neighbors, and languish in extended-stay hotels. 


	‚ÄúToday there isn't a single state, metropolitan area, or county in the United States where a full-time worker earning the local minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment,‚Äù Goldstone writes bluntly in the introduction. ‚ÄúA low-wage job is homelessness waiting to happen,‚Äù he adds, as unemployment remains at a generational low. 


	Natalia and her husband Maurice, like the others, spend the book in an agonizing search for an elusive American Dream that has no place for them. At one point, while living in the ‚Äúexpensive prison‚Äù that Maurice has come to call their extended-stay, with its whopping weekly rent nearly twice as much as they paid at their old apartment before getting evicted, Maurice says to his wife: ‚ÄúThis is not a home, and I'm scared we'll start to think it is.‚Äù

	











	Despite how There Is No Place For Us reflects its magnificently stylistic impression of a gripping novel ‚Äî punchy chapters that squeeze the spirit of its characters through the wringer of a punishing plot ‚Äî readers will find no profound arc of change in protagonist or circumstance. Upon each final word on the page, the families arguably suffer just as badly (if not worse) than when we first meet them.

	But that's life. Or, more accurately, that's the ‚Äúpolicy choice‚Äù of mass homelessness that has emerged only in the last generation, as Goldstone points out. ‚ÄúThe reality is that for these families, there is no tidy resolution, no dramatic turning point where things suddenly get better,‚Äù Goldstone tells Rolling Stone.


	‚ÄúThis is what happens when housing is treated as an investment vehicle, a luxury, rather than a basic human necessity,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd unless something drastic changes ‚Äî unless we collectively decide to value people's well-being more than property values ‚Äî this catastrophe will only continue to deepen.‚Äù

	It takes a specific kind of marketing mind to imagine that a dark and gritty reboot of a beloved children's character can amount to anything good. While the Golden Age of Comic Books ultimately gave way to edgier storytelling in the Seventies and Eighties, and everything from Steamboat Willie to Winnie the Pooh now has a blood-soaked live-action iteration (thanks, public domain!), the basic concept rarely offers more than shock value. What if this candy-colored icon of happier days was a killer?


	The idea's seen its day in gaming, too. Bomberman: Act Zero (2006) is one of the greatest cautionary tales about how slapping a more mature coat of paint on a classic character can end up tarnishing an entire franchise. But somewhere inside Japanese development studio Bandai Namco, the notion of making Pac-Man into an eldritch horror in time to celebrate the series' 45th anniversary gained traction. The result is the upcoming side-scrolling adventure game Shadow Labyrinth (out July 18).

	











	And honestly? Maybe the idea wasn't so stupid after all.


Rolling Stone recently played about three hours of the all-new take on Pac-Man, and what we found was a surprisingly engrossing Metroidvania-style game that's inherently ridiculous but works better than it has any right to.


	Developed internally by Bandai Namco Studios, Shadow Labyrinth is a 2D side-scrolling action and exploration game that doesn't actually star Pac-Man ‚Äî at least, not as fans know him. Set in the year 3333 on a desolate alien world, players take on the role of the Swordsman, a somewhat blank slate character with minimalist features clad in a tattered cloak.

	











	The Swordsman's background is intended to be a mystery unraveled within the game's story, but the groundwork for Shadow Labyrinth's lore was previously laid in last year's Prime Video anthology series, Secret Level, which set episodes in different game-inspired worlds. In the episode titled ‚ÄúPAC-MAN: Circle,‚Äù audiences got their first look at the world of the game through the eyes of a previous Swordsman (No. 7, preceding the game's No. 8). It was also the first look at the new Pac-Man, whose voracious hunger and relentlessness more closely resembled an updated take on the creatures from the TV mini-series The Langoliers, based on the Stephen King story.

	The game picks up with the next Swordsman, but unlike the 11-minute prequel short, Shadow Labyrinth intends to spend much more time fleshing out the plot. In the preview, the early stages of the game were omitted, leaving players to start further into the game after meeting Puck, the pseudo-robotic looking version of Pac-Man that serves as a partner and guide. The mystery of Puck's origins and goals is to be discovered in the multi-hour epic featuring full towns of NPCs and sprawling regions to explore.


	Fans of the Pac-Man series ‚Äî or anyone who's ever been forced to listen to a fan of the series like in the party scene from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World ‚Äî will know that the character's original Japanese name was Puck-Man (from the Japanese term paku-paku). Here, the moniker serves to differentiate the dark version of the mascot from the classic one.


	Visually, the game's art style feels more in line with an indie than anything produced by a massive company like Bandai Namco. Its characters, ranging from the Bosconian denizens to the grotesque enemies creeping about all feature a quaintly illustrated style and bop about with restricted animations, like a paper cutout gliding along the more static, detailed environment.

	The Bosconians are important for another reason: fan service. While Shadow Labyrinth has been billed as a celebration of Pac-Man, it also incorporates tons of other deep-cut references to older Bandai Namco games like Galaga (1981), Dig Dug (1982), and Splatterhouse (1988). The Bosconians that players will meet and do quests for are a reference to (what else?) 1981's shoot-em-up, Bosconian.


	Although most developers would like to avoid the term Metroidvania ‚Äî which is now shorthand for any 2D platformer that features exploring a pseudo-gated open world with tons of backtracking required ‚Äî there's really no way to avoid it. Shadow Labyrinth fits the bill to a tee. But that's not a bad thing!

	











	The core gameplay loop will be familiar to anyone who's played games like Metroid Dread (2021) or Hollow Knight (2017): move directionally through closed corridors, fighting enemies and solving platforming puzzles to find keys, and progress. Along the way, towns filled with NPCs will fill in the larger text and provide questlines to follow. There are upgrades to core stats and abilities, and multiple ways to maximize the synergy between the Swordsman and Puck.


	For the most part, it all works pretty well, even for a subgenre that's been thoroughly worn into the ground. Combat is fast and snappy but requires in-depth knowledge of its systems players will develop over time. An ESP gauge (basically stamina) determines how many actions can be done in rapid succession, and too many subsequent attacks or dodges can leave the Swordsman vulnerable. Enemies have pretty obvious weak points and can be parried into a stunned state that presents an opening, and larger enemies require quick thinking to find the right position without being overwhelmed by the mob.


	Some of the combat systems can feel restrictive, even in the overpowered state of the character presented in the demo, featuring multiple higher-level abilities and tons of upgrades to health. For instance, block and parry are mutually exclusive, meaning that one of the two must be selected via a quick-menu in-game. It's an odd design choice, especially for a game already stacked with forced menus like the map (which needs to be checked constantly).


	Platforming sections, too, often feel hindered by a strange air of jankiness. Every game of this type requires learning the internal physics of how jumping and inertia work ‚Äî Mario doesn't exactly feel the way Sonic does in action, right? But with very strict internal logic about what constitutes a proper jump, and some very unforgiving windows to do it correctly, solving basic puzzles and dodging hazards can be frustrating. It often feels like a game less inspired by titles of the 1980s and more like one designed in the era, with all the bugs and warts.


	Although a lot of the platforming and exploration can occasionally feel like a stilted chore, the game does shine when it commits to the Pac-Man aspect. Certain areas require the player to merge with Puck for on-rails, gravity-defying sections where the new Pac-Man reverts to his classic form. These sections play exponentially better than the base game, with a stickiness that tethers the player to walls and platforms, allowing them to focus more on precise timing than getting screwed over by a millimeter-off leap.

	











	The game's boss battles are also a high point. While the standard encounters often suffer from their chaos, the larger fights with massive singular enemies manage to focus the action on specific tasks like breaking down a boss' shield or timely dodging of wave beams. In the demo, two bosses were present. The first is a multi-story, bugged eyed creature whose design is inspired by the gory horror game Splatterhouse. The second is a techno-suit-wearing version of Pinky, one of the ghosts players gobble up in the Pac-Man arcade game.


	Both encounters precise use of parries, dodging, and strategic stamina management to overcome the enemy, and were easily the most riveting parts of the overall preview. Although a few deaths might be needed, these bouts felt like the best use of the game's various combat abilities and bode well for what the final game could offer. After defeating the bosses, the terrifyingly feral hunger seen in the Secret Level short overcomes Puck, who in true Pac-Man fashion devours the corpses with jaw unhinged.


	It's hard to say if Shadow Labyrinth will end up delivering a fully enjoyable package when it arrives later this summer. The fundamentals are there, with a grimly designed sci-fi fantasy world to explore, solid combat, and occasionally satisfying platforming. But there's a roughness around the edges that ‚Äî intentionally or not ‚Äî creates some undesirable friction. In a landscape packed to the brim with options in this same vein, is the gritty Pac-Man schtick be enough to carry it for the long haul?


	Although it's easy to roll your eyes at the general premise, the design and intent of Shadow Labyrinth works better than it should. From what's been shown so far, the game is at its best when it's embracing its arcade-era roots rather than leaning into the more forced Metroidvania tropes. When the action clicks, it's great ‚Äî and the platforming sections starring the lemon-colored 2D pixel version of Puck become something to look forward to in an otherwise overly familiar exploration game.

	While the hook of the game's marketing is undoubtedly a massive WTF seeing a dark visage of a classic character, the real test for Shadow Labyrinth's success will be whether it can balance its Jekyl with Hyde for the adventure's full playtime, and shake things up often enough to avoid making people wish the experience were as enjoyable as its no-frills coin-up inspirations.

	











Shadow Labyrinth launches on July 18 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

	New York City mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander stopped by The Late Show to reflect on their campaigns so far and to explain why they are endorsing each other. 


	Host Stephen Colbert kicked off the lengthy interview by asking why exactly they decided to collaborate to ensure they are ranked number one and two on the ballot. ‚ÄúWe both agree, for starters, that corrupt, abusive Andrew Cuomo should not be allowed anywhere near City Hall,‚Äù Lander said. ‚ÄúAnd we know that by teaming up a majority of New Yorkers won't choose him. At the same, we have a positive vision.‚Äù


	Mamdani added, ‚ÄúBrad has been a principled and progressive leader in this city for years. So many of the laws that we celebrate in this city are ones that he actually brought to bear‚Ä¶ It's exciting to know that while each of us think we will make the next best mayor of New York City, we also understand that it's time for a politics of the future. And that means a politics of collaboration, a politics of sincerity, a politics of principle.‚Äù

	











	The duo also addressed why this particular mayoral race has become news on a national level rather than just in New York. Mamdani noted that it's because it feels like a ‚Äúreferendum‚Äù on where the Democratic party goes from here, calling it a ‚Äúbattle of organized money versus organized people.‚Äù 


	‚ÄúUltimately, it's a question for our own party of how do we move forward,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDo we move forward with the same politicians of the past, the same policies of the past that delivered us this present, or do we move forward with a new generation of leadership, one that is actually looking to serve the people?‚Äù

	











	Elsewhere in the interview, Colbert asked each candidate about their views on Israel, anti-semitism, and their own religious views. Notably, he urged Mamdani to explain how he would aim to build a bridge between the city's Jewish community and its Muslim community. Mamdani that he would bring humanity to the forefront, which is ‚Äúthe most New York City thing we can do.‚Äù

	Colbert also asked Lander about being handcuffed by ICE for linking arms with an immigrant named Edgardo they attempted to detain. Lander explained that he had been volunteering to help families walk out of the building and had previously done it successfully five times before. ‚ÄúIn this case, you saw they grabbed us, separated us,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was detained for four hours. Edgardo remains in ICE detention today.‚Äù


	Lander and Mamdani are running for New York City mayor against Cuomo, who has a known history of sexual harassment. Earlier this year, it was revealed that in the four years since Cuomo resigned as governor, New York taxpayers have paid $60 million in legal expenses related to Cuomo's conduct in office, including efforts to defend the former governor in lawsuits concerning his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, his book deal, and the sexual harassment accusations. The vast majority of that total ‚Äî $46.9 million ‚Äî is related to the investigation and litigation of the numerous harassment claims.

Robert Hastings has spent nearly five decades investigating one of the most unnerving and underreported patterns in modern military history: unidentified flying objects repeatedly interfering with nuclear weapons. 

Shortly after he began interviewing retired Air Force personnel in the early 1980s, Hastings says his phone started ringing after each call - but no one would speak. Just heavy breathing.

'Somebody was trying to intimidate me,' he claimed to the Daily Mail. 

'But I took it as confirmation I was on the right track. They wouldn't be monitoring me if I was some nut listening to liars.'

Although initially shaken and concerned these mysterious calls would result in violent attacks or charges for divulging classified information, Hastings said he 'ultimately decided that this was important.'

'I felt strongly that the public needed to know the facts, and so I just stuck with it.'

Hastings is best known for helping bring to light the now-infamous 1967 incident at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where multiple nuclear missiles were mysteriously disabled while security personnel above ground reported a glowing object hovering over the silos. 

Hastings' father worked at the base's radar facility, and as a teenager, Hastings took a janitorial job cleaning the air traffic control tower.

One night, Hastings recalled, a radar supervisor waved him over to his screen and pointed out five unexplained blips. 

'He kind of motioned me over to take a look at what he was looking at. For whatever reason, he did that almost nonchalantly,' he said. 'What he pointed out were these five unknown blips, which formally are called targets. And he probably used the word ""unknown,"" which is the formal designation for a non-identified aerial object.'

That brief moment would go on to shape the rest of his life. 

Years later, he began interviewing military veterans who had witnessed similar strange phenomena - many of whom had direct experience with nuclear weapons.

'I began informally, at first very sporadically, seeking out Air Force veterans,' he said. 

'By 1981 I had probably in the neighborhood of 20 or 25 sources of veterans. And they were all telling me the same thing‚Ä¶ these kinds of nuclear weapons related UFO incidents.'

Among them was Captain David Schuur, a missile launch officer who described a chilling event at Minot Air Force Base in the 1960s. 

'He said his missiles were actually temporarily activated for a period of time and were preparing to launch for all intents and purposes,' Hastings said.

'And he had to flip what's called an inhibit switch‚Ä¶ to disrupt this what seemed to be an impending launch.'

Hastings' experience inspired him to collect interviews from veterans who had similar experiences, especially around nuclear bases (pictured: Malmstrom)

Hastings also described an event at Ellsworth Air Force Base where another witness allegedly encountered a UFO while working in a missile silo. 

Hastings said the witness was a targeting technician, adding that he was underground at the time. Suddenly, he relayed, the guard started banging on the ladder, saying, 'Get up here. Get up here.' When they emerged, Hastings said, they heard 'an omnipresent hum.'

Moments later, according to Hastings, a massive rhombus-shaped object appeared overhead - and the missile went offline.

At times, the activity was even more alarming abroad. 'Unbelievably, one of the people I interviewed was a retired Soviet Army Colonel,' Hastings said. 'According to this document that George smuggled out and had translated‚Ä¶ there was an intermediate range missile base in Soviet Ukraine‚Ä¶ and for some 15 seconds, the missiles went into countdown mode. They were apparently preparing to launch.'

Despite the pattern, Hastings doesn't believe the so-called entities - what he refers to as NHI, or non-human intelligence - are attempting to start a war.

'What I emphasize to my audiences and in my book, to my readers, I don't think that the NHI who were involved in these incidents, either here or in the Soviet Union, were actually attempting to start World War III,' he said. 

'I think rather, what they were attempting to do is to scare the hell out of the nuclear forces, the nuclear powers, to basically say, ""You better think twice. You're playing with fire.""'

He added, 'I think they're trying to keep humans from destroying ourselves, but also they don't want their activities terminated or negatively impacted by massive radiation surrounding the earth and so on years after the war.'

Even in the 21st century, the reported sightings haven't stopped. Hastings described an incident at FE Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming in 2010, shortly after he and Robert Salas held a press conference in Washington revealing decades of UAP activity at missile sites.

'According to the Atlantic story, overnight on October 23‚Ä¶ the base could not communicate with five of the launch capsules,' He said. 

Hastings explained that if war had been declared at that moment, the missiles 'could not have been launched.'

But according to Hastings, Air Force technicians who were deployed to investigate the problem saw something stunning: 'Multiple teams saw a huge, cigar shaped object in the air flying over the missile field.

'They were called together in a squadron wide meeting and told not to discuss what they quote ""may or may not have seen,"" end quote.'

The Air Force later blamed a faulty processor and claimed the problem lasted only 59 minutes. But Hastings claimed his sources told a different story.

'It was apparently intermittent for 26 hours‚Ä¶ I'm sure that the Air Force would not want to acknowledge that they had lost control or the ability to launch that many missiles for more than a day.'

In his opinion, these incidents form a consistent and disturbing pattern.

'What my sources are confirming to me is that this has gone on repeatedly, year after year, decade after decade‚Ä¶ The available testimony, the available evidence, even though it's anecdotal, confirms that the UFO nuclear weapons link is long standing, widespread and ongoing,' claimed Hastings, who has lectured at more than 500 colleges and universities over the course of his career.

Many of his most valuable leads came from veterans who approached him after his presentations. He meticulously verified each with official military discharge documents.

His work reportedly reached the highest levels of government. According to Hastings, unbeknownst to him, physics researcher Hal Puthoff 'actually gave four copies of my book to Lou Elizondo and three other persons' in Washington, DC.

Even former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reportedly read Hastings' work, which helped convince him to back the secret Pentagon program known as AAWSAP and its successor, AATIP.

Today, Hastings is 75 and retired due to congestive heart failure. He's no longer conducting new interviews, but he says his research continues to ripple through official circles - and among journalists and whistleblowers newly emboldened to speak out.

'I've done my part,' he said. 'Now it's up to the next generation to keep asking questions. The more people know about these incidents, the harder it becomes to deny they happened.' 

Asked whether he thinks official disclosure is coming, Hastings is cautiously optimistic.

'I think it's just a question of time before the US government, probably in conjunction with other world governments, they're going to have to simultaneously admit‚Ä¶ that these are NHI,' he said.

'But even when that happens‚Ä¶ I don't think that any government is going to immediately acknowledge that they've been messing with our nuclear weapons. It's just too disconcerting.'

Walk into any arcade in Japan and you'll likely be greeted by rows of claw machines, known here as UFO Catchers due to the claws' resemblance to a flying saucer descending to abduct an unsuspecting prize.

While the term initially referred to the eponymous machines produced by Sega that popularized the game in the 1980s and '90s, today the term is commonly used to mean all crane games in Japan. June 24 is even unofficially known as ‚ÄúUFO Catcher Day‚Äù in the country, and in 2025, it marks the 40th anniversary since the launch of Sega's first such machine in 1985.

However, the game got off to a rough start.

June 24 (UPI) -- Supernatural alum Jensen Ackles says reuniting with his former co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins for The Boys Season 5 was a ""really good time.""

The actor, 47, discussed the fifth and final season of The Boys when he stopped by The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon on Monday.
""So, Eric Kripke, who created Supernatural -- he is also the writer-showrunner of The Boys,"" Ackles told Fallon. ""When he likes to work with somebody, he likes to continue working with them. And I was the benefactor of that, obviously. But then he thought, 'Oh, what a great idea. Let's just bring the cast back together.'""
Supernatural premiered on the WB in 2005 before moving to the CW for its sophomore season. The series ran for 15 seasons, through 2019. It starred Ackles and Padalecki as brothers Dean and Sam, respectively. Together, they faced various obstacles presented by paranormal entities. Collins also starred.

""It was funny because there was a little, like, concern that, you know, we're gonna get Jared and Misha and Jensen together, and it's gonna be a little wacky, because, 15 years together, we got a little off,"" he added. ""...It was a really good time. I can't wait to be able to say more.""


Ackles, Padalecki and Collins announced the casting in February.

Ackles portrays Ben, or Soldier Boy, on The Boys, which follows a team of vigilantes who take issue with dishonorable superheroes. The show is adapted from the comic series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson.

It's been five years since Supernatural ended its 15-season run on The CW (the series finale aired on November 19, 2020), but the show remains as popular as ever, thanks to Netflix and fan conventions, as star Jensen Ackles, who played hunter Dean Winchester alongside Jared Padalecki as his brother Sam, noted while on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Monday, June 23.

Ackles was on the late night talk show to promote his new Prime Video series Countdown (premiering on Wednesday, June 25, with the first three episodes), but Jimmy Fallon did bring up his past show and ask about the potential for a Supernatural revival. (Watch the full video of Ackles on The Tonight Show above.)

‚ÄúI mean, look, it's always hanging out there,‚Äù Ackles said. ‚Äú‚Ä©I think there's a reason we did it for 15 years. We enjoyed it, we enjoyed each other, we enjoyed the story, the characters. It was hard to hang it up. But I don't know that we ever hang it up in Supernatural, so‚Ä¶ We'll see.‚Äù

Ackles also spoke about the Supernatural fan conventions that the actors do across the world. ‚ÄúI thought that they would fizzle out, like, once the show ‚Äî show's been off for five years,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúAnd they're still growing, and we're still getting asked to come to these different cities.‚Äù

Fallon wondered if that had to do with streaming, and Ackles did note that the show has done well on Netflix. ‚ÄúA lot of people during the pandemic, I think, found it, and they binged all 15 seasons, and now they're coming to these events, and they're wanting to ask us questions,‚Äù said Ackles. He pointed out that they don't get feedback on TV show sets from an audience while filming, but ‚Äúnow, we get to go and we get to see these crowds of people who really enjoy what we do, and it just it's energizing.‚Äù

Supernatural did end with Dean dying on an ordinary hunt then flash-forwards showing Sam's life until he died of old age and joined his brother in heaven. But in the world of Supernatural, anything can be done to bring these characters back.

Would you want a Supernatural revival? What would you want to see? Let us know in the comments section below.

Countdown boss Derek Haas talks creating the character around Ackles, and the cast teases the ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù-like team of the crime thriller.

Overconfidence is a hallmark trait of people who believe in conspiracies, and they also significantly overestimate how much others agree with them, Cornell psychology researchers have found. The study indicates that belief in conspiracies may be less about a person's needs and motivations and more about their failure to recognize that they might be wrong.

Conspiracy believers not only consistently overestimated their performance on numeracy and perception tests, revealing they tend to be less analytic in the way they think. They also are genuinely unaware that their beliefs are on the fringe, thinking themselves to be in the majority 93% of the time, according to the research. The work counters previous theories that people believe conspiracies essentially because they want to, out of narcissism or to appear unique.

""This group of people are really miscalibrated from reality,"" said Gordon Pennycook, associate professor of psychology and the Himan Brown Faculty Fellow in the College of Arts and Sciences. ""In many cases, they believe something that very few people agree with. Not only is it something that doesn't make a lot of sense, based on what we know about the world, but they also have no idea how far out in the fringe they are. They think they are in the majority in most cases, even if they're in a tiny minority.

Pennycook is the corresponding author of ""Overconfidently Conspiratorial: Conspiracy Believers are Dispositionally Overconfident and Massively Overestimate How Much Others Agree with Them,"" which is published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. Jabin Binnendyk, a doctoral student in psychology, and David G. Rand of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are co-authors.

Rand and Pennycook started this research in 2018, observing that people who believe in conspiracies seem to have real faith in their own cognitive abilities, ""which is paradoxical,"" Pennycook said, ""because prior work has shown that people who believe in conspiracies tend to be more intuitive.""

The researchers conducted eight studies with 4,181 U.S. adults. Four studies assessed participants' levels of overconfidence using tests of perception, numeracy and cognitive reflection. Because overconfidence is difficult to measure‚Äîthose who are the most incompetent are the least able to recognize their own incompetence, Pennycook said‚Äîthe researchers used a new measurement approach to account for this effect.

Rather than completing specific tests with measurable outcomes, participants were given tasks where actual performance and their perceived performance were unrelated, such as quickly discerning an image so obscured, they essentially had to guess what it is.

""Participants have little reason to believe that they did well‚Äîallowing higher estimated performance to more directly index higher levels of trait overconfidence without being confounded by actual performance,"" the researchers wrote.

The studies then measured conspiracy beliefs by asking direct questions about popular‚Äîbut false‚Äîconspiracy claims, including ""the Apollo Moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood film studio,"" ""Princess Diana's death was not an accident,"" and ""Dinosaurs never existed.""

Results of these four studies show an association between a tendency toward overconfidence and belief in conspiracies, indicating that a disposition to overrate one's cognitive skills may play an important role in conspiracy beliefs.

""If overconfidence is an important component of conspiracy beliefs, then it is likely that believers do not realize that they are in the minority,"" the researchers wrote. ""In contrast, if conspiracy beliefs are more driven by need for uniqueness, then believers may well know that they are in the minority‚Äîin fact, they may revel in this fact.""

Another four studies tested the study participants' perceptions of others' beliefs, and found that overconfidence predicted both belief in conspiracies and the tendency to overestimate how much others believe in false conspiracies. On average, a minority of participants believed in the false conspiracies. Even so, they thought that a majority of others agreed with them in each study. That is, conspiracy believers massively overestimated how much others agreed with them.

Conspiracy belief is a growing issue, thanks to an ""expanded marketplace for conspiracy theories"" online and on social media platforms, Pennycook said.

However, the propensity to think most other people share these beliefs creates challenges for efforts to undermine false beliefs in conspiracies. The researchers wrote, ""The people who most need help distinguishing truth from falsity are the least likely to recognize that they need it.""

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array has detected methanol isotopes around a nearby star, which could help explain why the ingredients for life are present on Earth.

Researchers have found alcohol in the orbit of a young star, and it could help them understand the origins of life on Earth.

Methanol (methyl alcohol) and its isotopes (versions of elements) were detected in gases around a star called HD 100453, which is about 330 light-years from Earth. This is the first time researchers have found isotopes of methanol in the disk of a young star like HD 100453, the scientists reported in a study published June 5 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Methanol is a building block for organic compounds such as amino acids, which are needed for life. Researchers had previously detected methanol ‚Äî but not its far rarer isotopes ‚Äî in other star-forming disks.

""Finding these isotopes of methanol gives essential insight into the history of ingredients necessary to build life here on Earth,"" study lead author Alice Booth, a research fellow at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said in a statement.

Many young stars are surrounded by swirling disks of gas and dust. These protoplanetary disks, also known as planet-forming disks, provide the material for planets, moons and comets to form.

The team made the methanol discovery using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. ALMA maps the chemical composition and distribution of gas in nearby (relatively speaking) protoplanetary disks.

HD 100453 is larger than the sun, with about 1.6 times the sun's mass. This means that methanol and other molecules in its disk exist as a gas farther from their home star than would have been the case when our solar system was young. Smaller stars have cooler disks, so their molecules are normally frozen as ice and undetectable to ALMA, according to the statement.

In HD 100453's disk, the researchers found that the ratio of methanol to other organic molecules was similar to that of comets in our solar system. The findings suggest that ices within protoplanetary disks eventually clump together to form comets loaded with complex organic molecules, which may then be delivered to planets through collisions.

""This research supports the idea that comets may have played a big role in delivering important organic material to the Earth billions of years ago,"" study co-author Milou Temmink, a doctoral candidate who studies protoplanetary disks at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said in the statement. ""They may be the reason why life, including us, was able to form here.""

New footage shows an expressionless iRonCub MK3 robot taking off using four thrusters ‚Äî two where its arms should be and two in a jetpack on its back.

Researchers have demonstrated the first successful vertical liftoff of a humanoid robot ‚Äî a major step toward flying robots that mimic human capabilities.

The new robot, dubbed iRonCub MK3, uses four thrusters to achieve vertical thrust, two built into its arms and two in a jetpack mounted on its back.

In footage released by the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) to YouTube on 18 June, the mask-donning robot is held from a suspender and then activates, lifting off roughly 20 inches (50 centimeters) from the ground using its thrusters.

The iCub robot that IIT's humanoid is based on is child-like in both size and appearance. It measures 3 feet (1 meter) tall while weighing 49 pounds (22 kilograms), adopting child-like dimensions, and donning a highly recognizable smooth and shiny ""baby face"" head.

First launched in 2009 by the RobotCub Consortium of European universities, it is designed to be a testbed for research into human cognition and artificial intelligence (AI) and has been used in countless projects over the last 16 years.

In a corresponding study describing the robot, published June 1 on the arXiv preprint server, the IIT engineers say their augmented version of the robot is the first such jet-powered flying humanoid robot designed to take off. They added this work highlights the new possibilities that a flying, humanoid robot presents.

In contrast to many other robotic platforms currently in development, which typically focus exclusively on ground-based locomotion and manipulation, adding aerial mobility may pave the way for assistance in search and rescue missions, traversing collapsed buildings and flooded areas, or other terrain inaccessible to humans, the scientists said in the study.

Combining flight with the ability to interact with its environment, a robot of this kind could clear debris and assist in locating or even extracting victims.

The authors of the study also point out that a flying humanoid robot could carry out repairs on structures difficult for human beings to access, like the undersides of bridges. They could even be deployed in hazardous environments where people can't safely operate, like the site of a nuclear or chemical leaks.

iRonCub is based on IIT's iCub3 platform. This system is designed to allow a robot to emulate a number of human capabilities as it's being remotely controlled by an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) helmet-like heads-up display (HUD) and other specialized equipment.

To equip the iCub for flight, the team added load-bearing mounting brackets to secure the jetpack and a new titanium spine to support its weight. Because previous versions of the iRonCub had issues with catching fire from the thrusters' exhaust, heat-resistant panels and covers were added to the iCub chassis. The thrusters' tilt angle was also adjusted to help with in-flight stability and to angle the exhaust away from the robot's body.



For this version, the robot's forearms and hands were removed to make space for the arm-mounted thrusters, but the team says the forearms are still fully compatible and will be readded in later iterations.

To ensure the chassis could handle the stress of takeoff and flight, the team performed a Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis ‚Äî a problem-solving technique that centers around breaking a structure down into smaller interconnected components. As a result, they applied axial loads of 750 newtons (three times the peak thrust of each turbine) to the brackets of the jet engines.

One of the major challenges of achieving flight in a humanoid robot of this type is accounting for all of the joints and actuation points and adjusting them, as well as the thrusters, in a coordinated way, so the robot doesn't end up flying off course or upside down.

The engineers managed this with what's called a Linear Parameter Varying Model Predictive Control (MPC), a complex flight controller that's constantly computing the optimal joint position and jet throttle.

The scientists extensively tested the system first in computer simulations before then launching real-world tests, in large part due to the safety risks of operating thrusters with exhaust temperatures in excess of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius).

After successfully demonstrating a launch with a predefined trajectory and accurate tracking, the team now plans to focus its efforts on improving the flight controller to handle external disturbances that may occur during a real flight scenario, like wind or other inclement weather.

Trump still faces tough calls that will decide the future of non-proliferation.

Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran's hard-to-reach nuclear site at Fordow couldn't have worked out better. Operationally, it was flawless, and the response it drew from Iran was the best the US president could have hoped for ‚Äî bloodless and de-escalatory by design. Most important of all, Trump then tried to bounce Israel and Tehran into a ceasefire. Kudos where it's due.And yet, this is not over. There will be more tough decisions for the White House to make, with profound implications for the cause of nuclear non-proliferation.The problem here isn't that the ceasefire announced on Monday night was breached within hours. That's hardly unusual and, in this case, there's a good chance it takes hold over the coming days. Israel has run through most if not all of its target list; Iran is running low on ways to meaningfully respond without putting the regime's survival at risk. Even so, we aren't where Trump says we are.

Trump says his ceasefire will hold for all time, but there will be no forever-peace between the Islamic Republic and Israel. No doubt, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his politically powerful generals will take time to regroup and lick their wounds. They've suffered a severe military humiliation and there will be some form of reckoning at home. But hostility to Israel is in their political DNA. There is no one-and-done here.Nor has Iran's nuclear program been wiped from the face of the earth, never to be rebuilt, as Trump claims. Let's say all the enrichment equipment at the sites that the US and Israel bombed over the last 10 days have indeed been destroyed. That's as-yet unknown except to the Iranians, but it seems very plausible. The point, however, has always been that Iran has the know-how and capacity to replace whatever gets destroyed.We also don't know the whereabouts of Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a short step to weapons grade. Nor can even Mossad be sure there are no sites that were missed because they simply weren't known. These are just some of the reasons for which US presidents resisted bombing Iran's nuclear program in the past, preferring to achieve delays and visibility through diplomacy.In other words, the risk that Iran acquires a nuclear arsenal remains. It will continue until the day that either this regime or a successor decides not to pursue one. And right now, there's no doubt ‚Äî even if hardline officials weren't saying so in public ‚Äî that the argument for Iran to get itself a nuclear deterrent has never been more compelling. Nobody, after all, is bombing North Korea.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

This is CNBC'S live blog about the conflict in the Middle East.

There is widespread uncertainty about whether a ceasefire in the brief war between Israel and Iran will hold, even after it was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump said he was ""not happy"" with Israel and Iran after both nations engaged in attacks on each other following his announcement of the truce.

CNBC reporters are covering the Middle East conflict live on air and online, reporting from Washington, D.C., London, Dubai, San Francisco, Singapore and Englewood Cliffs, N.J.

Israel has lifted war-related restrictions across the country that had banned public gatherings, closed schools, shuttered all but essential businesses, and limited air travel.

""Following a situation assessment and approval by Defense Minister Israel Katz, it has been decided that starting today at [8 p.m. local time], the Home Front Command's defensive guidelines will be updated,"" Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.

As part of these changes, ""all areas of the country will transition to full operational activity without restrictions,"" the IDF said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slams the delay of the Senate's classified briefing on Iran as ""outrageous,"" ""evasive"" and ""derelict."" 

""This last minute postponement of our briefing is outrageous,"" he tells reporters after the briefing, originally scheduled for today, was moved to Thursday, NBC News reports. 

""It's evasive, it's derelict. They're bobbing and weaving and ducking,"" he says. 

The briefing is reportedly postponed to allow for Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to return from the NATO summit and attend.

Stocks are posting gains today, amid cautious optimism about the Israel-Iran ceasefire.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 500 points, or 1.1%, with the S&P 500 also posting a 1.1% increase of nearly 70 points and the Nasdaq Composite up nearly 300 points, or 1.4%.

At least 18 stocks in the S&P 500 are trading at new 52-week highs today.

Several members of Congress are questioning what has become of Iran's stock of enriched uranium in the days since the U.S. damaged three nuclear facilities with airstrikes and bombs.

Atomic energy watchdogs estimate that Iran has at least 9 kilos of uranium enriched to 60%, a level that could relatively easily be further enriched to 90%, or weapons grade.

Republican Rep. Scott Perry, Penn., told CNN he suspects Iran still has enriched uranium even after the American strikes. ""I will put it this way. I wouldn't be surprised if some of it still exists,"" he said.

Perry told CNN's John Berman he also believed Iran was still ""a terrorist regime."" 

""So after these 12 days there is still a terrorist regime in power with enriched uranium?"" Berman asked.

 ""That is absolutely true. Yeah, I think that's a correct characterization,"" said Perry.

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal is also concerned about the threat that Iran's enriched uranium poses to the United States. 

Blumenthal told NBC he wants the administration to tell senators ""how effective the strikes against the Iranian nuclear capability have been. Where is the enriched uranium that seemingly was removed from Fordo?""  

""I believe deeply that a nuclear armed Iran is a threat to the entire world, including the United States, but confronting that threat requires a strategy as well as strength. I see no indication of a coherent strategy here. The president needs to explain to the American people as well as to Congress what the strategy is,"" said Blumenthal. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is arguing that the War Powers Act, a Nixon-era law limiting the president's power to unilaterally wage war, is unconstitutional. 

Johnson also vowed that a pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran under that law will not pass the House.

The Speaker told reporters that Trump's decision to order strikes on Iranian nuclear targets over the weekend was ""clearly"" within his powers under Article II of the U.S. Constitution.

He said he agreed with scholars who believe that the War Powers Resolution of 1973 violates Article II.

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, last week introduced a War Powers resolution that would bar the U.S. military from ""unauthorized hostilities"" in Iran. But Massie said Monday evening that he would not advance his resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, Politico reported.

Vice Admiral Charles Cooper II, Trump's nominee to serve as commander of U.S. Central Command, warns of an ""emerging axis"" among Iran, North Korea, Russia and China.

""We've certainly seen the tactical implications of support from Iran to Russia,"" he said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""We've seen tactical implications of Chinese companies providing sensors and weapons and components to Iran, who ship them to the Houthis who shoot them at Americans,"" he added.

""I think we need to call those types of things out more, but clearly that emerging foursome, that axis, is one that we need to pay attention to.""

‚Äî Erin Doherty

Oil prices have fallen sharply now that Trump says China can keep buying oil from Iran, a sign that the U.S. is easing its maximum pressure campaign on the Islamic Republic in the wake of a ceasefire with Israel.

Global benchmark Brent fell $4.14, or 5.79%, to $67.34 per barrel by 11:55 a.m. ET. U.S. crude oil was last down $3.97, or 5.79%, to $65.54 a barrel. Prices closed 7% lower on Monday as the oil market bet that the conflict in the Middle East was winding down.

""China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran,"" Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. ""Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S., also. It was my Great Honor to make this happen!""

‚Äî Spencer Kimball

Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken is calling the U.S.'s weekend missile strike on Iran nuclear sites ""unwise and unnecessary"" in a new New York Times op-ed.

""Now that it's done, I very much hope it succeeded,"" Blinken, who served under former President Joe Biden, wrote.

""I can only hope that we inflicted maximum damage ‚Äî damage that gives the president the leverage he needs to finally deliver the deal he has so far failed to achieve,"" he wrote.

‚Äì Laya Neelakandan

A former Defense Department official says the next phase in the Iran-Israel conflict will be at the negotiating table.

Mich√®le Flournoy, WestExec Advisors co-founder and managing partner and former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the Obama administration, said the focus now should be on putting pressure on both sides.

The key is to assess how much damage was actually done to Iran's nuclear programs and determine whether Iran will come to the negotiating table ""more seriously than it did before,"" she told CNBC's Squawk Box. 

""I understand that we all want to sigh a big sigh of relief today with the ceasefire, but this is far from over as yet,"" she added.

‚Äì Laya Neelakandan

Two classified briefings for Congress on Iran that were scheduled for this afternoon have been postponed, NBC News' Frank Thorp reports.

The decision to postpone the briefings comes as a fragile ceasefire appears to be taking hold, and both Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are in the Netherlands with Trump to attend the NATO summit.

It was unclear when the House briefing would be held, but the Senate briefing is scheduled for Thursday.

Thorp notes this will be the first classified briefing since the U.S. strikes last weekend to which all members of Congress are invited, not just a small group of intelligence committee leaders and party leadership.

‚Äî Christina Wilkie

Trump is claiming in a new Truth Social post that Israel and Iran both desired a ceasefire after more than a week of exchanging rocket fire. 

""Both Israel and Iran wanted to stop the War, equally! It was my great honor to Destroy All Nuclear facilities & capability, and then, STOP THE WAR!""

While U.S. bombing did significant damage to three nuclear facilities, it did not eliminate Iran's enriched uranium. U.S. intelligence officials have admitted in recent days they do not know where much of that material is being stored.

Jury awarded $500,000 to widow and estate of the police officer who killed himself nine days after the January 6 riot

A federal jury on Monday awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who killed himself nine days after he helped defend the US Capitol from the mob that attacked on January 6, 2021, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the uprising.

The eight-member jury ordered the man, 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, to pay $380,000 in punitive damages and $60,000 in compensatory damages to Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Washington DC metropolitan police officer Jeffrey Smith, inside the Capitol. They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering.

The judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith's wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. Federal judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death.

Walls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on the day of the Capitol attack occurred when another attacker threw a pole that struck Smith around his head.

On Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband ‚Äì an encounter captured on the officer's body camera.

‚ÄúErin is grateful to receive some measure of justice,‚Äù said one of her attorneys, David P Weber.

Walls-Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is ‚Äúabsolutely ridiculous‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI'm just stunned.‚Äù

After the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the parties to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal ‚Äì and for the sake of ‚Äúfinality‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou guys settle,‚Äù the judge said, ‚Äúyou can move on with your lives.‚Äù

Walls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as ‚Äúshocking‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe're talking about a three-second event,‚Äù he told the judge.

‚ÄúIt's not shocking, Mr Hunt,‚Äù Reyes replied. ‚ÄúA lot of things can happen in three seconds.‚Äù

Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol attack when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the January 6 attack.

Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide.

The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he killed himself. In 2022, the DC police and firefighters' retirement and relief board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty and the injury was the ‚Äúsole and direct cause of his death‚Äù, according to the lawsuit.

Walls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023. But Donald Trump pardoned him in January.

On the first day of his second presidency, which began in January, Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the Capitol attack.

More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes.

Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack.

Erin Smith has applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The head of Nato congratulated Donald Trump for his ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù intervention in bombing Iran in a fawning private text message to the US president.Mark Rutte, known as the ‚ÄúTrump whisperer‚Äù for their close relationship, praised Mr Trump for his strikes on Iran's nuclear programme and for pushing Nato allies to spend more on defence.‚ÄúCongratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, that was truly extraordinary and something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer,‚Äù he said.Nato leaders have been careful to placate Mr Trump, showering him with praise and rearranging the summit around his preferences.They have stripped down the meeting to one three-hour session and reduced a joint communique to one page in an effort to minimise the chances of an outburst from the US president.

The message, confirmed as authentic by a White House official, revealed just how far Mr Rutte is prepared to go to stay in the president's good books.‚ÄúYou are flying into another big success in The Hague this evening,‚Äù he continued, explaining how other member states have agreed to increase their defence spending to 5 per cent of gross domestic product.‚ÄúDonald, you have driven us to a really, really important moment for America and Europe, and the world,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúYou will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.‚Äù

It was the second time Mr Trump had published a private text message in under a week, after he posted a screenshot of a personal exchange with his ambassador to Israel.

It also came shortly after Mr Trump had taken credit for a ceasefire arranged late on Monday night between Iran and Israel.

The truce threatened to unravel, however, on Tuesday morning after Iran fired two ballistic missiles which were intercepted over northern Israel.

Israel responded by sending warplanes to bomb Tehran as civilians who had previously fled poured back into the city.

The breaches infuriated Mr Trump who shouted at reporters on the White House lawn: ‚ÄúThey don't know what the f--- they're doing, do you understand that?‚Äù

There were reports he held a last-ditch phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to call off the Israeli jets flying on bombing raids to Iran.

The plea partially succeeded as Mr Netanyahu reportedly agreed to scale back the attacks, which eventually killed a senior police intelligence chief and a commander of a paramilitary.

Iran later said it had a ‚Äúfinger on the trigger‚Äù to retaliate, but the tit-for-tat strikes appeared to have ended completely by Tuesday afternoon.

Meanwhile, Mr Trump was headed for Europe to land in the Netherlands in time for a dinner with the royals ahead of the Nato summit on Wednesday.

The message from the Nato chief revealed just how much leaders were bending over backwards to accommodate the world's most powerful man.

Austin Cantrell, a White House official during Mr Trump's first term, said of the message: ‚ÄúHe is speaking the president's language, quite literally,

‚ÄúAnd he's also telling the president something that happens to be true, which is he is making a positive impact when it comes to Nato.‚Äù

When Mr Rutte was asked why the US president had shared the message, he said: ‚ÄúI don't know but I have absolutely no trouble or problem with that because there's nothing in it which had to stay secret.‚Äù

But there are challenges in the next 24 hours.On his way over the Atlantic on Tuesday Mr Trump refused to say whether he would commit to Nato's Article 5, which requires members to come to each other's defence, as he flew to the summit.He told reporters: ‚ÄúDepends on your definition. There's numerous definitions of Article 5.‚ÄúBut I'm committed to being their friends, you know, I've become friends with many of those leaders, and I'm committed to helping them.‚ÄùHis words will trigger fresh alarm for allies already gathered in the Netherlands who have gone out of their way to back his spending demands.Brett Bruen, the former director of Global Engagement at the White House, said simply: ‚ÄúDeterrence does not depend.‚ÄùA senior diplomatic source from a Nato nation also said that having just bombed Iran, and with US interests in the Middle East on high alert, it would be ‚Äútactically unwise‚Äù to suggest Nato's Article 5 was flexible.

Without Washington's guarantees ‚Äì it provides about 70 per cent of capabilities and command and the US has 100,000 troops deployed in Europe ‚Äì Nato would be radically diminished.Asked to clarify his remarks, Mr Trump said that he was ‚Äúcommitted to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety.‚ÄúI'm going to give you an exact definition when I get there, I just don't want to do it in the back of an airplane,‚Äù he told reporters.

Leaders of most of the 31 states in the pact have agreed to raise their spending to 5 per cent of gross domestic product. In return, they hoped that Mr Trump would underline his commitment to their defence during the two-date summit in The Hague.‚ÄúThe president intends to secure a historic 5 per cent defence spending pledge from Nato allies, which will strengthen the alliance's combined military capabilities and ensure greater stability in Europe and the world,‚Äù said a senior US official before the trip.Mr Trump is expected to meet Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, on Wednesday, with no end in sight to the three-year war raging in his country.

Fred Kempe, the president of the Atlantic Council, said the spending pledges were part of an implicit deal with Article 5 at its heart.‚ÄúI think another test is if Europe can step up with this kind of spending and capabilities. If the US can stay in and continue to be the strong Article 5 guarantor, alongside its allies and partners, and continue to support Ukraine and its contest against the illegal and murderous invasion and continued war of Putin, that's going to be an amazing outcome. 

‚ÄúThis, then, will be a truly historic summit,‚Äù he said, before Mr Trump made his comments.Mr Rutte said the summit came at a critical time.‚ÄúWe meet at a truly historic moment, with significant and growing challenges to our security. 

‚ÄúAs the world becomes more dangerous, allied leaders will take bold decisions to strengthen our collective defence, making Nato a stronger, fairer and more lethal alliance.‚Äù

 Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America  By Sam Tanenhaus 

 Charles King

Was there ever anyone quite like William F. Buckley, Jr.? The founder of National Review, once the preeminent conservative magazine; the host of a talk show, Firing Line, that over its more than three decades on air formed a visual and oral history of the United States in the contemporary era; the author of popular tracts, memoirs, travelogues, and thrillers, more than one a year for stretches of his life; and the urbane and witty intellect behind the American conservative movement, Buckley embodied a style and a sensibility that belong to the last century. But he pioneered a mode of politics that came fully into power in the present one, in the person of Donald Trump.

For much of the post‚ÄìWorld War II era, few Americans could name the precepts that defined conservatism, but they knew Buckley stood for them. Young men didn't want to follow him so much as be him. Today, if younger conservatives have moved on in their admiration‚Äîto a right-wing provocateur such as Charlie Kirk or a supposedly straight-talking podcaster such as Joe Rogan‚Äîthat is only because the posture and principles that Buckley represented have become the oxygen of the American right, invisible yet essential.

Buckley, who died in 2008, did not live to see the rise of Trumpism. But it is impossible to read Buckley, Sam Tanenhaus's monumental, honest, fair-minded, and spectacularly enlightening biography‚Äîsome 30 years in the making and undertaken with Buckley's cooperation‚Äîwithout seeing in it the trailhead to our own time. Buckley was among the first to sense that American politics is downstream of culture, meaning that the drivers of political life are affect and positioning, not interests and policies. On the page and on the screen, Buckley didn't so much articulate conservative ideas as perform them: a preference for order over voice, a desire to limit participation rather than enable it, a belief that public morality should have religion near its center, and a conviction that a new elite must remake the Republican Party as the first step toward retaking the United States.

Today, listening to what Buckley had to say‚Äîand, crucially, how he said it‚Äîcan hit like a revelation. Trumpism is often characterized as a fractious coalition of techno-libertarians and populists or a new American version of older European authoritarianism. But through the prism of Buckley's life, it looks more like a radical return to something more recent and closer to home. What Buckley saw more clearly than any conservative thinker of the twentieth century was the degree to which figures such as U.S. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan were not fulfillments of the American rightist tradition of Buckley's youth but aberrations from it. Mainstream conservatism, such as it was, had evolved from old-style liberalism, with its conviction that a good society would magically emerge if government got out of the way. What conservatives lacked, Buckley felt, was both a program for a rightly ordered America‚Äîhierarchical, suspicious of opposition, and protective of a civilization under threat‚Äîand the will to achieve it. That vision and its pamphleteering defense would be his life's work. To understand the ideas animating Trump's world, a good place to start is Buckley's.

Buckley, born in November 1925, was his household's sixth child and third son but the one his parents decided should carry the paternal name. His father, William Sr., was a Texas oilman who made his fortune in Mexico and Venezuela. His mother was New Orleans aristocracy. The Buckleys were old Irish rather than Yankee, weekend sailors and equestrians but also Catholic and fecund, and in the years before World War II, they were deeply America First. Their Connecticut estate, Great Elm, housed ten children and a cavalcade of heady guests such as Albert Jay Nock, the author, anti‚ÄìNew Dealer, and casual anti-Semite. (Another visitor, the jazz pianist Fats Waller, a cousin of the Buckleys' butler, was left to entertain the servants.)

Large, loving families have their unique vices, among them self-‚Äãsatisfaction. At Millbrook, the New York boarding school, a teacher reported that Buckley was the kind of student who displayed the ‚Äúdangerous habit of generalizing at times in order to prove a point without knowing the facts.‚Äù The problem in the South was not that Black Americans were denied the vote, Buckley wrote in one Millbrook essay, but that too many white citizens of low intelligence were allowed it. He would make the same point, decades later, in his famous debate with James Baldwin at the Cambridge Union.

From Millbrook and then a stint in the U.S. Army after the war, Buckley went to Yale. It didn't take him long to find his calling as a talker and writer. He excelled in debate, discovered his favorite subjects, and honed his personal style in the Yale Daily News. A university fundraising campaign had yielded extra money that undergraduates proposed should be used for scholarships for ‚Äúdeserving Negro students.‚Äù But how would donors feel, Buckley complained in print, if they didn't have full say in how the funds were spent? That rhetorical sleight of hand would become characteristic. Liberal schemes for improvement might not be bad on their face, but they rested on some deeper principle that was ultimately self-defeating.



Today, more young people aspire to be influencers than public intellectuals, which is why it is hard to re-create how astonishing it was, in 1951, to read God and Man at Yale, which Buckley published when he was in his mid-20s. The book, a broadside at Yale's faculty and administration, would define the genre of academic jeremiad. Buckley's diction was twisty, his sentences often a yard short of the target, but his core arguments were clear. Yale claimed to be a place of free expression, yet the curriculum demonstrated a preference for the relativistic, the atheistic, and the collectivist. If universities were schools of indoctrination, as they seemed to be, then Americans should have a chance to decide which doctrines were worth instilling.

A review in The New York Times chastised Buckley for being too young to have earned a conservative outlook on the world, but the attention helped catapult the book, and Buckley, to fame. God and Man at Yale ‚Äúcontained the seeds of a modern movement,‚Äù Tanenhaus observes. A manifesto rather than a playbook, it redefined conservatism by leaping back over World War II and repackaging the prejudices of Great Elm for the coming television age.

In the years that followed, Buckley would intuit that the political battles of the 1950s and 1960s, not least those over civil rights, might be profitably framed as constitutional. White Southerners were already trying out the claim that resistance to desegregation was about state-federal relations, not race. (Confederates and Southern Redeemers had been blindingly clear during the previous century: it had always been about race.) Buckley perfected the argument. Racial politics, it went, was just one symptom of a political tradition and constitutional order in crisis, beset by ungrateful minorities and socialist malcontents at home and mobilized communists abroad. What America deserved was a movement, then a party, then a government with the courage to defend a civilization under threat.

One of the vehicles for Buckley's ideas was the magazine National Review, which he founded in 1955 with the famous editorial promise to stand ‚Äúathwart history, yelling Stop.‚Äù Every excess of the political right became an excuse for enumerating the greater sins of the left and then focusing on deeper principles, a technique he had already used in a book-length defense of Joseph McCarthy the previous year. On the pages of National Review and, after 1966, on Firing Line, Buckley pioneered the do-your-own-research rhetorical style: whataboutism and verbal misdirections that often slipped into intellectual nihilism. McCarthy might have been guilty of ‚Äúoversimplification‚Äù on occasion, Buckley said on an early episode of Firing Line, but what was the difference between his exaggerations and similar overstatements by, say, Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson? The distinction, of course, was that it was one thing to exaggerate for political gain and quite another to say things about real people and real events that were plainly false, as Buckley's guest, the lawyer and refugee advocate Leo Cherne, pointed out. That Buckley couldn't‚Äîwouldn't‚Äîadmit the difference was a Yale debater's trick. Diffused in American media and civic life, the same rhetorical move would turn out to be corrosive.

Buckley's commitments would often place him on what American schoolchildren, at least until recently, were taught to think of as the wrong side of history: standing by McCarthy, opposing much of the civil rights movement (he called Barry Goldwater's vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act a ‚Äúprofile in courage‚Äù), and callously grandstanding during the AIDS crisis. ‚ÄúEveryone detected with AIDS should be tattooed in the upper forearm . . . and on the buttocks,‚Äù he wrote in a New York Times op-ed in 1986. He attempted once to turn his notoriety into votes, with an unsuccessful bid for mayor of New York City in 1965. But Buckley was a performer, not a policymaker, and in any case, the great affairs of the day‚Äîcivil rights, Vietnam, the counterculture, Watergate‚Äîcried out for copy. Then came Ronald Reagan.

‚ÄúWe have a nation to run,‚Äù the editors of National Review wrote after Reagan's victory in the 1980 presidential election. Buckley had supported Reagan and served as a bridge between the California governor and the Republican Party's East Coast establishment. But it was the harder Reagan (fiercely anticommunist, friendly to the extremists), rather than the softer one (avuncular, enamored of ‚Äúpeace through strength‚Äù), that most attracted him. During the campaign, Buckley hosted Reagan on Firing Line. His first question was about how Reagan might deal with a hypothetical ‚Äúrace riot‚Äù in Detroit. Reagan responded that handling a riot was the responsibility of local authorities but that the federal government might step in to protect citizens against overzealous policing. Buckley looked visibly disappointed.

Buckley was by that point an institution rather than a barricade stormer, and the years of Reagan and his successor George H. W. Bush were a time of valedictions as much as victories. He handed off the editorship of National Review. His wife, Patricia, rose to fame as a socialite and tireless fundraiser for charitable causes, including AIDS research. The Berlin Wall fell. Buckley was ‚Äúan aesthete of controversy,‚Äù in Tanenhaus's phrase, and with Republicans in power, communism defeated, and the Western left soon to be reshaped by the third-way politics of President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, his canvas shrank.

In an ambitious (and sometimes antic) life, there were plenty of misses, from the disappointing to the tragic. Buckley would never finish his magnum opus of political philosophy, to be titled The Revolt Against the Masses, a reference to the Spanish philosopher Jos√© Ortega y Gasset's classic Revolt of the Masses. He helped secure the release of a death-row murderer, Edgar Smith, largely because Smith was a National Review reader and loved Barry Goldwater‚Äîonly for Smith to try to kill again. Buckley had turned ‚Äúowning the libs‚Äù into a profession before anyone had invented the term, and when he slipped, he did so spectacularly. At his debate with Baldwin in 1965, on the proposition ‚ÄúThe American dream is at the expense of the American Negro,‚Äù the audience saw him outmaneuvered by Baldwin in peak oratorical form. Buckley lost by a vote of 544 to 164.

He could be rattled by people who were ‚Äúwittier and sharper‚Äù than he was, an old friend, the historian Alistair Horne, reported to Tanenhaus. The rattler in chief turned out to be the novelist and gadfly Gore Vidal. Buckley had reluctantly agreed to join Vidal as an on-air commentator for ABC News at the 1968 Democratic Convention. At one point, Vidal and Buckley were in the middle of arguing about demonstrators who raised the Viet Cong flag at the Chicago convention site. The moderator wondered how Americans would feel if it were the Nazi flag. Buckley endorsed the comparison (his whatabout stratagem, again), and once he had taken the bait, Vidal set the hook. ‚ÄúThe only crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself,‚Äù Vidal said. Buckley lost it. ‚ÄúNow, listen, you queer,‚Äù he spat at Vidal, who was bisexual at a time when one didn't announce that fact. ‚ÄúStop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face and you'll stay plastered.‚Äù Vidal smiled like the Cheshire Cat. It was the greatest public disaster of Buckley's career.

Buckley could be generous, charming, and funny, especially with people he liked and, better yet, respected. He made a habit of conversing publicly with his political and cultural opponents, a practice that now seems ancient and utterly lost. But the role he nurtured was that of an instigator. What he offered was a credo tethered to a pose‚Äîa conviction that his job was to ‚Äúsay no to the barbarians,‚Äù as he once phrased it, and that a posture of insouciant ridicule was the hallmark of a winner. Earnest moral outrage belonged to the weak.



What is most striking, however, is that, in a long life of reading and conversation, in interviews with everyone from the antipoverty activist Michael Harrington, his first Firing Line guest, to Henry Kissinger, one of his last, it's not clear what Buckley felt he had learned. From Millbrook to the Cambridge Union, from Yale to the television studio, he often seemed to be ill prepared and winging it. As he aged, he rethought some of his earlier positions, including on civil rights. But nowhere in Tanenhaus's account is there anything that approaches a turning point or moment of reckoning that helps us make sense of Buckley as a thinker. Few people have a Rosebud, an experience that explains everything that comes after. But for an essayist, editor, and movement leader who could radiate maturity, it is remarkable how much of the precocious child remained alive in him. He never quite gave up performing for the adults in the room.

A reason for that is right at the top of Tanenhaus's book. ‚ÄúEverything he learned, and all he became, began at home,‚Äù reads the second sentence of Buckley. It is a thesis that Tanenhaus earns. People often took Buckley's affectations‚Äîthe patrician languorousness, the liquid consonants‚Äîfor Briticisms, and he could certainly seem like an Oxford don. But he was actually closer to a don. The Mexican revolution of 1910 and the overthrow of the dictator Porfirio D√≠az had been ruinous for the oil business overseen by William Sr., but he had gained a love for the culture and class of his local partners. William Jr. would learn Spanish before English and grow up in a household where attitudes toward history and human nature chimed with those of the wealthy, European-descended Mexican elite: intensely caste-conscious and fearful of the ethnically mixed, teeming mass below. Buckley would gain his own experiences in Mexico briefly as a student in the 1940s and again as a CIA operative in the early 1950s.

What all this produced in Buckley was a quiet sense that the truly compelling models of society and governance lay in the Spanish-speaking world. Francisco Franco was ‚Äúan authentic national hero,‚Äù he wrote after a visit to Spain in 1957, and ‚Äúonly as oppressive as it is necessary to be to maintain total power.‚Äù Buckley's interview with the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges in 1977 is one of Firing Line's most boring episodes, in part because he and Borges‚Äîwho welcomed the military coup that had unseated President Isabel Per√≥n a year earlier‚Äîfound so little to disagree about.

‚ÄúConnecticut Yanquis‚Äù is Tanenhaus's label for the clan at Great Elm, and it is suggestive. Via Buckley, the great unappreciated thread in American conservatism may well be the Hispanic one. Trump's second administration is America First, revanchist, and McCarthyite‚Äînot so much New Right as Very Old Right‚Äîwhich the young Buckley, at least, would have applauded. But it is also the first American presidency to have yielded a genuine strongman, a would-be caudillo.

Buckley was ‚Äúa founder of our world,‚Äù Tanenhaus concludes, but ‚Äúhe speaks to us from a different one.‚Äù The book runs to around a thousand pages with notes, but it rolls up quickly, with little in the way of grand conclusions about its subject's legacy. Trump is mentioned only once, for example, in a passage about his mentor, the disgraced lawyer (and McCarthy's chief counsel) Roy Cohn, a friend of Buckley's. Part of Tanenhaus's message is that the line of succession in American conservatism ended with Buckley. There has been no one since his death of similar stature on the right‚Äîor, for that matter, on the left, a fact that says as much about the state of political ideas in the United States as it does about conservatism. If the alternatives in politics are now reduced to either defending every federal program or becoming a national version of Florida‚Äîshaped by permanent culture war, single-party government, and an administrative system of patronage and payback‚ÄîAmericans will have lost sight of the great debates that drew Buckley's generation into civic life.

Buckley was not always a creature of practical politics. His movement was built for poking fun and pointing out contradictions, not governing. But he bequeathed one big idea to the conservatism of today: The problem with liberals wasn't just that they wanted more government. It was that they wanted to share government with people who, out of ignorance, indoctrination, or natural inadequacy, could be relied on to muck it up. That view, even in the absence of a post-Buckley torchbearer, became Trumpism.

Buckley's genius was to see that, from the New Deal to the Cold War, American conservatives had bent themselves into timid naysayers. They knew they were opposed to ‚Äúbig government,‚Äù but in all the great battles of the twentieth century‚Äîover everything from the social safety net to civil rights‚Äîthey had been cowed into accepting a liberal understanding of the ends and means of governance itself. What they lacked was a dream for what their country could become once it was freed from the barbarians. Since returning to the White House, Trump has begun to implement a substantive program in ways Buckley could have only imagined a Republican president would. The executive branch has dismantled decades-old government programs inherited from liberal administrations; sought to control universities and silence the professional media; made common cause with repressive regimes abroad; denied due process to alleged radicals and noncitizens; suspended refugee admissions (except for white South Africans); and elevated loyalty and ‚Äúnational masculinity,‚Äù as Buckley once put it, above competence and decency as political virtues. These moves are not attempts to manage a ‚Äúnew fusionism‚Äù of traditionalist and libertarian conservatism, but expressions of the same American rightist heritage that formed Buckley, one whose roots run back to the isolationism of the 1930s, to the Old South, and to continental European ideas of natural orders and social castes. Buckley imagined a conservative future that would resemble his own experience of the journey toward it: liberating, raucous, and full of energetic joy. What is so maddening about Buckley's life is that he embraced the transgressive fun of an opposition movement without thinking too hard about the cruelty it could produce once it held power.
