                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump says a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is in effect after the deal initially faltered leaving Trump frustrated with both sides. U.S. President Donald Trump said a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was in effect Tuesday after the deal initially faltered, and the American leader expressed deep frustration with both sides. Israel had earlier accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace after the truce was supposed to take effect. Iran is insisting that Israel broke the spirit of the ceasefire, claiming that it carried out attacks after it shouldn't have. Footage shows an explosion and smoke rising behind buildings in Tehran, hours before a ceasefire announced by Trump was in place. A tentative truce faltered on Tuesday when Israel vowed to retaliate after saying Iran launched missiles into its airspace more than two hours after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect. The deal was thrown into question mid-morning, after Israel said strikes were reported three hours after the ceasefire went into effect.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to hold Tuesday after initially faltering, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both sides, saying they had fought “for so long and so hard” that they didn't know what they are doing. After the truce was supposed to take effect, Israel accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace, and the Israeli finance minister vowed that “Tehran will tremble.” The Iranian military denied firing on Israel, state media reported, but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel in the morning, and an Israeli military official said two Iranian missiles were intercepted. Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for a NATO summit that, in his view, both sides had violated the nascent agreement. He had particularly strong words for Israel, a close ally, while suggesting Iran may have fired on the country by mistake. But later he said the deal was saved. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly “Plane Wave” to Iran. Indeed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he held off on tougher strikes against Iran after speaking to Trump. The conflict, now in its 12th day, began with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, saying it could not allow Tehran to develop atomic weapons and that it feared the Islamic Republic was close. Iran has long maintained that its program is peaceful. Trump phoned Netanyahu after the American bombing on Sunday and told him not to expect additional U.S. military attacks and that he should seek a diplomatic solution with Iran, a senior White House official said. Trump's position was that the U.S. had removed any imminent threat posed by Iran, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about sensitive diplomatic talks and spoke on condition of anonymity. China, which is Iran's largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, condemned the U.S. attacks and said it was concerned about a “spiral of escalations” without a ceasefire. Trump suggested the ceasefire would allow Iranian oil to continue to flow, saying on social media that China could keep purchasing crude from Iran. An Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said Iran launched two missiles at Israel hours into the tenuous ceasefire. One of those attacks killed a high-profile nuclear scientist, Mohammad Reza Sedighi Saber, at his father-in-law's residence in northern Iran, Iranian state TV reported. He said both sides had violated the agreement and used an expletive to hammer home his point. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f—- they're doing,” he said. Netanyahu said Israel agreed to the ceasefire with Iran, in coordination with Trump, after the country achieved all of its war goals, including removing the threat of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. In a televised statement, Netanyahu said late Tuesday that Israel's war had brought Iran's nuclear program “to ruin” in a historic victory. It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. Trump said Tuesday that he wasn't seeking regime change in Iran, two days after floating the idea himself in a social media post. “I don't want it,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Police said they damaged at least three densely packed residential buildings in the city of Beersheba. First responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. Police said some people were injured while inside their apartments' reinforced safe rooms, which are meant to withstand rockets but not direct hits from ballistic missiles. The attack followed a limited Iranian missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for earlier American bombing of its nuclear sites. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties. Elsewhere, U.S. forces shot down drones attacking the Ain al-Assad base in the desert in western Iraq and a base next to the Baghdad airport, while another one crashed, according to a senior U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. Some Iran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to target U.S. bases if the U.S. attacked Iran. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists. The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel. The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But while this is the first real taste of extreme heat for Northeastern cities, parts of the country like Texas have been cooking since May. Alaska this month issued its first-ever heat advisory. Summers are indeed getting hotter, a consequence of the warming planet. High temperatures often lead to more emergencies and hospital visits when they represent a big jump from a place's average, which means ordinarily cooler regions tend to suffer the worst harm from heat. That includes places like Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures rarely climb higher than 80 degrees Fahrenheit and most homes don't have air conditioning. Now researchers have found that rural areas may suffer more under extreme heat than previously thought. A report from Headwaters Economics and the Federation of American Scientists found that more than half of rural zip codes in the United States, which includes some 11.5 million Americans, have “high” heat vulnerability, a consequence not just of temperatures but unique risk factors that occur far outside of major cities. Air pollution from cars, trucks, furnaces, and factories helps trap warmer temperatures over cities, and that hotter air, in turn, accelerates the formation of pollutants like ozone. And with so many people squeezed into these metropolitan ovens, it adds up to a massive health burden from extreme heat. But far outside of downtowns, where homes and buildings get farther and farther apart, rural regions face their own long-running challenges that exacerbate the dangers of extreme heat. That matters, because on a physiological level, older adults struggle more to cope with heat than the young. People living in rural communities also have double the rates of chronic health conditions that enhance the damage from heat like high blood pressure and emphysema compared to people living in urban zip codes. While there may be more forests and farms in the country that can cool the air, the buildings there are often older, with less adequate insulation and cooling systems for this new era of severe heat. Manufactured and mobile homes, more common in rural areas, are particularly sensitive to heat. In Arizona's Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, mobile homes make up 5 percent of the housing stock but account for 30 percent of indoor heat deaths. Even if rural residents have air conditioners and fans, they tend to have lower incomes and thus devote a higher share of their spending for electricity, up to 40 percent more than city dwellers, which makes it less affordable for them to stay cool. That's if they can get electricity at all: Rural areas are more vulnerable to outages due to older infrastructure and the long distances that power lines have to be routed, creating greater chances of problems like tree branches falling on lines. Sparsely populated communities also have fewer public spaces, such as shopping malls and libraries, where people can pass a hot summer day. Rural economies also depend more on outdoor labor, and there are still no federal workplace heat regulations. Farmworkers, construction crews, and delivery drivers are especially vulnerable to hot weather, and an average of 40 workers die each year from extreme heat. “There is a longstanding healthcare crisis in rural areas,” said Grace Wickerson, senior manager for climate and health at the Federation of American Scientists. There aren't always nearby clinics and hospitals that can quickly treat heat emergencies. “To really take care of someone when they're actually in full-on heat stroke, they need to be cooled down in a matter of minutes,” Wickerson said. The Phoenix Fire Department has now started using ice immersion for heat stroke victims when transporting patients to hospitals to buy precious time. But rural emergency responders are less likely to have tools like this in their ambulances. Emergency response times are generally much longer in rural areas, sometimes extending more than 25 minutes. Hospitals in rural areas are closing down as well. So when severe heat sets in, rural healthcare systems can get overwhelmed easily. Looking at data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Census Bureau, Wickerson and her collaborators mapped out how all these underlying factors are converging with extreme heat. They found that 59 percent of urban zip codes and 54 percent of rural zip codes are highly vulnerable to extreme heat as defined by the CDC's Heat and Health Index, meaning they are much more likely to see health problems from extreme heat. So while rural areas may be cooler, the people living there face heat dangers comparable to those in much hotter cities, and geographically, they cover a much wider expanse of the country. So while temperatures out in the sticks may not climb to the same peaks they do in downtowns, urban heat islands are surrounded by an ocean of rural heat vulnerabilities. There are ways to reduce the dangers of scorching weather across vast swaths of the country, but they aren't fast or cheap. Countering extreme heat also requires bigger structural investments to reverse the ongoing rural healthcare crisis where a doctor shortage, hospital closures, and longer emergency response times are converging. But the Republican budget proposal will do the opposite, cutting healthcare access for millions of Americans that would, in turn, lead to dozens of hospitals closing down, mainly in rural areas. Protecting people from dangerous heat also demands policy changes. Most states don't have any worker protections on the books for extreme heat. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is in the process of creating the first federal heat safety standard for employers, requiring them to give employees breaks, water, and shade when it gets hot. Cities and local governments could also impose rules that prevent utilities from shutting off power to customers during heat waves, similar to regulations that limit heat shutoffs during the winter. Even places with a long history of managing heat are seeing more deaths and hospitalizations as relentless temperatures continue to mount. That means curbing the ongoing warming trend has to be part of the solution as well, reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow climate change. Even America's richest farmlands can't outrun climate collapse. ﻿The wild reason why bird advocates are releasing these reviled insects from the sky. Fossil fuel sites can emit a powerful greenhouse gas long after they shut down.</p>

Patrick Mahomes #15 of the Kansas City Chiefs and mother Randi Mahomes celebrate on stage during the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl LVII victory parade on Feb. 15, 2023, in Kansas City, Missouri. Watkins asked Mahomes about her thoughts on transgender athletes competing against girls in terms of fairness. "Personally, from being a woman and a girl and doing co-ed teams throughout my life and just having fun in sports there is a huge difference between male and female," she told Watkins. But when it comes to physical strength and you know just our DNA I don't think it's fair. Randi Mahomes (mirrored sunglasses), the mother of Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs, poses for a photo with members of law enforcement as she arrives at the stadium prior to Super Bowl LV. "… I just think maybe they create a league that everyone that's transgender could go to and have a fair game or activity. I just think there is a difference in DNA. Other places, you know whatever, but I just think in sports and community I just don't agree with it just because physically women are not as strong as men." Mahomes has not been afraid to share her opinions.

Fox News contributor Joey Jones also weighed in on the threat during 'The Faulkner Focus' and addressed growing antisemitism nationwide. EXCLUSIVE: At least five more Iranian nationals were arrested on Monday in addition to the 11 announced by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday morning. On Monday, 45-year-old Mohammad Hassanpoor was arrested by officers in Baltimore and given a "Third County Notice." He was previously criminally convicted of "assault with a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury," where he was sentenced to just under a year behind bars. He was also previously sentenced roughly three months behind bars for "battery: spouse/ex sp/date/etc." Kaveh Abedi, 45, was arrested in Chicago on Monday for "violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act" and had a 2001 conviction for selling cocaine. Federal authorities have arrested a total of 15 Iranian nationals in the country illegally, including Mohammad Hassanpoor (Right). (Daniel Torok/The White House via Getty Images/Immigration and Customs Enforcement) Arish Rustami was also arrested and has a prior sex offense, and Abdolmohammad Raghibzadeh was taken into ICE custody on Monday. He's had a deportation order since November 2005 from an Arizona immigration judge, and he's currently an Iranian citizen, according to ICE. In May 2006, Raghibzadeh could not get proper paperwork to go back to Iran, so he was given an "order of supervision" and then released. But in 2007, he was arrested again by sheriffs in Santa Ana, Calif., for not following probation and had to spend the rest of it at the California Chino Detention Center, according to ICE. Sahand Yousefinasrabadi was arrested Monday by federal authorities "during targeted enforcement action" in Forth Worth, Texas. Yousefinasrabadi was convicted in Sept. 2013 of aggravated sexual assault of a child, and he was asked in October 2013 to leave the U.S. by an immigration judge. A demonstrator holds a picture of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei while gathering with others during a rally in solidarity with the government against Israel's attacks on Iran and to mark Eid al-Ghadir, when according to Shiite Muslim belief the Islamic prophet Mohamed designated his nephew and companion Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor, at Enghelab (Revolution) Square in Tehran on June 14, 2025. While there is currently a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, DHS noted the arrests made since Sunday. "Under Secretary Noem, DHS has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden's fraudulent parole programs or otherwise," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement about the initial 11 arrests that were publicly announced. We don't wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump's mandate to secure the homeland," McLaughlin added. Notably, Yousef Mehridehno was arrested by ICE on Sunday in Mississippi and was on a "known or suspected" terror watchlist as of February. Former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps member Mehran Makari Saheli was arrested by ICE in Minnesota, and DHS said he has "admitted connections to Hezbollah" and stayed in the U.S. despite being court-ordered to leave in June 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Trump weighs in: President Donald Trump flashed intense anger today as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile. • Ceasefire violations alleged: Israel struck a radar site north of Tehran hours after the ceasefire was due to take effect, following accusations that Iran had fired several missiles at Israel. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel refrained from conducting further strikes after Netanyahu spoke to Trump in what a White House source said was a “firm and direct” call. • CNN poll on strikes: Meanwhile, the US president's decision to launch airstrikes against Iran during the weekend is broadly unpopular with Americans, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after the strikes. Israel's “campaign against Iran” is not over, the country's military chief said Tuesday. Speaking at a situational assessment after the Israel-Iran ceasefire took effect, Israeli Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said that a “significant phase” has ended and that Israel is entering a “new phase, based on the achievements of the current one.” On the rubble-strewn streets of Beer Sheva, Yogev Kudady and his wife were sitting on the sidewalk, hardly able to speak. Kudady, his wife and their four children — aged 10, 8, 5 and 1 — took cover in a bomb shelter after Israeli authorities issued an air raid warning. She said her front door, made of sturdy metal, was bent in half and the ceiling had collapsed. Blitz said she was “heartbroken” by the damage to her childhood home. “I'm so glad the house didn't fall down,” she said. Iranian media outlets are broadcasting footage of a large crowd gathering in central Tehran, which they report is showing support and appreciation for the country's armed forces. Video footage broadcast by Iranian media outlets showed people chanting in support of Iran while carrying Iranian flags and posters of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian airspace partially reopened today, following the country's ceasefire with Israel after 12 days of hostilities, according to aviation monitoring company FlightRadar24. “Iranian airspace is now open to international arrivals and departures to/from Tehran with prior permission,” FlightRadar24 said on X. Iran “does not seek nuclear weapons in any way” but is “only seeking its legitimate rights,” its President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Tuesday, according to the state-affiliated Fars News Agency. “Iran is not Gaza or Lebanon that cannot respond to the military attacks of the Zionist regime,” Pezeshkian said during a phone call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. “We expect you to explain to them in your interactions with America that the Islamic Republic of Iran is only seeking its legitimate rights and has no desire beyond that, it has not and does not seek nuclear weapons in any way,” Pezeshkian said as cited by Fars News Agency. Iran “is only seeking to create a good future for its people, the region, and other countries by interacting with its neighbors and other countries,” Pezeshkian added. Iran has maintained that it does not seek to build nuclear weapons. It has spent decades developing its nuclear program and has seen it as a source of national pride and sovereignty. It says the program is solely for peaceful energy purposes and plans to build additional nuclear power plants to meet domestic energy needs and free up more oil for export. Classified briefings on the situation in Iran set to take place on Capitol Hill today have been postponed, multiple sources told CNN. Two separate sources familiar told CNN the briefing for all House lawmakers has also been postponed. President Donald Trump took credit for brokering peace between Israel and Iran, framing the recent ceasefire as a direct result of US airstrikes authorized under his leadership. “Both Israel and Iran wanted to stop the War, equally! It was my great honor to Destroy All Nuclear facilities & capability, and then, STOP THE WAR!” he said on Truth Social. US lawmakers were expected to receive classified briefings this afternoon on the situation in Iran, but sources tell CNN that they have been postponed. Blumenthal said Trump deserves credit “if, in fact, Iran's nuclear capability has been destroyed,” adding that the Israeli forces and US military also played a significant role. ﻿North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer said, “I'd like to hear some real specifics about what we know about any missing materials that there may or may not be and what Israel would know about them.” Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, told CNN that he didn't believe Trump's decision to strike the nuclear facilities was well thought out and that he wanted more details. “In my view, this was somewhat reckless,” he said. On the House side, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries argued that Trump has “botched” his promises to bring peace to the region. “The real question that people are asking here in America is what the F is Donald Trump doing,” Jeffries told reporters this morning, referring to Trump's comments earlier that Israel and Iran “don't know what the fuck they're doing.” Speaker Mike Johnson told members at a House Republican conference meeting that he spoke with Trump earlier in the morning, and the president told him he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to retaliate against Iran, according to a person in room. Punchbowl News first reported on Johnson's comment to members. Johnson also insisted that ceasefire will hold, though he acknowledged it is “fragile,” and dismissed allegations from Democrats — and some Republicans — that Trump violated the War Powers Act by striking Iran without congressional approval. President Donald Trump showed visible anger this morning as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile. Trump was critical of both sides, but reserved his harshest condemnation for Israel, which he said “unloaded” on Iran “as soon as we made the deal.” “Iran will not violate the ceasefire, unless the Zionist regime does,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a statement Tuesday, according to Nour News. Israel had earlier accused Iran of breaking the terms of the deal, announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday, by firing rockets into Israel hours after it went into effect. President Donald Trump has walked back his comments of the possibility of a regime change in Iran following weekend strikes on three nuclear facilities. Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University Qatar, explains why regime change in Iran is complex. President Donald Trump shared screenshots on social media of a message he received from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who lauded him for his “decisive action” in Iran. “Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, that was truly extraordinary, and something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer,” Rutte wrote in the first message Trump published. Trump makes his way to NATO summit: The messages show Rutte also praised Trump for securing a landmark defense spending agreement among NATO allies. “You are flying into another big success in The Hague this evening, it was not easy but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent,” Rutte added, referring to Trump's push for NATO allies to increase defense spending. NATO is preparing to announce a new commitment requiring all member nations to spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense, a longtime demand of Trump's, which now seems closer than ever to becoming official policy. This post has been updated with confirmation that Rutte sent the messages to Trump. He added that Israel's campaign against Iran has helped American national security. Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the committee, asked him: “Would you agree with me that the remarkable effectiveness of Israel's military campaign against Iran and against its terrorist proxies has directly effected in a positive way American national security?” President Donald Trump said today that he does not want a regime change in Iran because he does not want to see “chaos.” Asked to clarify a social media post from over the weekend where he floated the possibility of regime change, Trump told reporters on Air Force One: “No, if there was, there was, but no I don't want it. They should be able to rebuild and do a good job. At least 606 people have been killed in Iran since Israel launched its attack on June 13, including 107 on Monday alone, according to figures shared by Iran's health ministry during a crisis meeting in Tehran on Tuesday. Israel struck a radar site north of Tehran on Tuesday but refrained from conducting further strikes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Donald Trump, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement. The strike on Iran, which was launched hours after the ceasefire was due to go into effect, came after Israeli officials accused Tehran of violating the truce by firing several missiles at Israel. The PMO said Trump “expressed his great appreciation for Israel” and that Netanyahu committed to refrain from additional strikes. Trump-Netanyahu call: A White House source told CNN that Trump spoke to Netanyahu Tuesday morning and was “exceptionally firm and direct.” According to Israel, two Iranian ballistic missiles were launched toward Israel approximately three hours after the ceasefire announced by Trump went into effect. With a war they “did not want” on their doorstep, Gulf nations are gripped by “fear,” Greg Carlstrom, Middle East correspondent at The Economist, told CNN's Becky Anderson on CNN Newsroom. “I can't think of another time when a country has been attacked and then turns around the next morning and brokers a ceasefire involving the country that attacked it and another country.” Carlstrom said the swift diplomatic choreography reflects “deep unease” across the Gulf, especially in Qatar, where residents were sent running for cover as missiles and interceptor fragments fell near shopping malls and roads. “These are countries in the Gulf that have long prided themselves on being oases of stability in an otherwise very chaotic region,” he added. The Kremlin has welcomed the news of a ceasefire between its ally Iran and Israel on Tuesday, a day after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. “If a ceasefire has indeed been reached, then this can and should only be welcomed,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters during his daily briefing on Tuesday. Iran has been one of Russia's strongest allies during its war on Ukraine and Moscow was quick to condemn US attacks against Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday. Asked about a Reuters report that Araghchi delivered a letter from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to Putin requesting additional support, Peskov denied he had done so but acknowledged that certain messages were conveyed. “It is true that there were some signals from the Iranian leadership, but overall, the Reuters report does not reflect reality.” Trump, who was jubilant yesterday evening when he announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, stayed up well into the night watching the coverage as it was set to go into effect. US and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have “destroyed” Iran's centrifuge program, used to enrich uranium close to weapons-grade levels, according to an assessment by a former United Nations nuclear weapons inspector. David Albright, now president of the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), told CNN that, having reviewed satellite imagery and spoken to sources with knowledge of Iran's nuclear program, he assesses that Iran's centrifuge program has been “destroyed,” after the US joined Israel's strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities. “It's amazing how much damage has been done to that program. I think that part of the mission has been accomplished,” Albright said Tuesday. Uranium stockpile: However, Albright said “residual” parts of Iran's program likely remained intact, most importantly its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a short step away from the 90% needed to build a nuclear weapon. Grossi said Iran “made no secret that they have protected this material,” amid speculation that Iran moved the stockpile to a safer location before Sunday's strikes. But even if Iran was able to safely hide its enriched uranium, Albright said that turning this into weapons-grade material “is not going to be a fast process,” since the US and Israeli bombing campaign has “done serious damage to build a nuclear weapon.” He assessed that it would take Iran “a good year or two” to build a nuclear weapon, if it chose to reconstitute its program. Albright detailed how Iran's Fordow plant, buried deep in a mountain, had been targeted by the US strikes, which used 12 “bunker buster” bombs to penetrate the rock.</p>

Trump border czar Tom Homan joins ‘Mornings with Maria' to discuss border security, deportation operations, and Iran. Biden-era open border policies have ignited concerns that Iranian "sleeper cells" could be lying in wait inside the U.S., eager to retaliate after tensions with the U.S. adversary reached a boiling point over the weekend, and the prospect has officials on high alert. Border czar Tom Homan called it the "biggest national security vulnerability" the U.S. has ever seen. "It's a significant threat," he said Tuesday on FOX Business' "Mornings with Maria." Tom Homan, White House border czar, speaks during a news conference in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, April 28, 2025. Homan stressed that the sleeper cell prospect has been one of his top concerns for years. Former acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf echoed Homan in citing the countless number of unidentified foreign nationals who poured across the U.S. border under former President Biden's tenure. "This is a real concern, and, unfortunately, four years of the Biden administration will eventually have consequences," Wolf said during an appearance on "America's Newsroom" on Tuesday. Speaking to guest host Bill Melugin, he warned that "Hezbollah and Hamas and others" are already in the United States. The FBI and local law enforcement – I know they're doing everything that they can…" he added. A senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) source recently revealed that over 1,500 Iranian nationals who illegally entered the U.S. at the southern border were arrested under the Biden administration, and nearly 50% of them were released back into the country. The bulletin came as Iranian officials warned of retaliation against the U.S., but did not cite any specific threats. Fox News' Greg Wehner and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday morning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had arrested 11 Iranian nationals, including one person with ties to the Hezbollah terrorist organization, a known or suspected terrorist, and a suspected former sniper from the Iranian army. “Under Secretary Noem, DHS has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden's fraudulent parole programs or otherwise,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. The arrests occurred amid attacks between Israel and Iran, as well as a U.S. airstrike on Iran, over the past several days. “[President Joe] Biden let a lot of stupid stuff in,” Trump told reporters en route to the Netherlands. “And among everything else he let a lot of super cells in. Trump's reference to “super cells” was likely a misspoken reference to “sleeper cells,” or groups of terrorists who are inactive and quiet before carrying out an attack. In addition to the 11 Iranians arrested, ICE also took into custody a U.S. citizen who is accused of threatening to kill an ICE employee while harboring an Iranian national. However, he never adjusted his immigration status, which is a violation of the law and makes him deportable. Behzad Sepehrian Bahary Nejad had been ordered deported and was found carrying a loaded 9 mm pistol when he was arrested on Sunday. The University of Texas, where Nejad attended school, terminated his enrollment in 2018, and he was ordered deported by a federal immigration judge in 2019. Another Houston resident, Hamid Reza Bayat, was ordered deported almost 20 years ago. ICE also arrested Linet Vartaniann at the same Tempe residence. Vartaniann is a U.S. citizen who threatened police against arresting Eidivand. DHS said Vartaniann threatened to open fire on ICE officials if they entered her home and then added that she would go outside and “shoot ICE officers in the head.” Yousef Mehridehno of Gluckstadt, Mississippi, is an Iranian and a former lawful permanent resident in the U.S. His residency was terminated in 2017 after the U.S. government determined that he had lied on his original visa application and possibly committed marriage fraud. The FBI had listed Mehridehno on its terrorism watch list in February. Mehdipour was arrested by Border Patrol agents during the Biden administration. ICE officers in St. Paul, Minnesota, took Mehran Makari Saheli on Sunday. He was ordered deported in 2022 but had not been arrested. Bahman Alizadeh Asfestani was nabbed by ICE officers in San Francisco. He was convicted in 1994 for petty theft and then convicted of possession of a controlled substance for sale the following year. ICE officers in Buffalo, New York, arrested Mohammad Rafikian, who was previously convicted of grand larceny, schemes to defraud, criminal impersonation, and practicing as an attorney.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Garcia's selection is a win for progressive Democrats, who have been eager to see fresh blood in the leadership ranks since the party's defeat in 2024. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters leaving the caucus meeting that she voted for Garcia, quipping, “Well, I'm a Californian,” noting that she is also “partial to mayors.” Garcia served as the mayor of Long Beach before heading to Congress. Pelosi said she thought all four candidates were “excellent.” “I think any one of them could have done a great job internally,” she said. Garcia will succeed Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, who died in office this year. Garcia will be the chief antagonist to Rep. James Comer (R-KY), who is chairman of the House Oversight Committee and is leading a wide-ranging investigation into Biden's health while in office and whether aides covered up his decline. Comer congratulated Garcia in a statement on Tuesday shortly after the election. “Following the passing of our friend and colleague, Gerry Connolly, Ranking Member Garcia has big shoes to fill,” Comer said. “While I'm sure we'll have our fair share of spirited debates and disagreements, I look forward to working together wherever we can find common ground.” Crockett told reporters ahead of Tuesday's full-caucus vote that the Steering Committee result, in which she got the lowest number of votes, was a “loud signal” that Democratic leaders did not want her style of leadership. … I don't want to be an impediment,” Crockett added. “Steve Lynch and Robert Garcia are friends who I have the utmost respect for, either of which will lead our Party well as we move forward to blunt the Trump administration and to fight for justice and civil rights for all Americans,” Mfume said before the final vote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TRUMP: ‘I'M NOT HAPPY': President Donald Trump emerged from the White House this morning enraged that Israel responded to what he called a single Iranian missile probably fired by mistake, to violate his carefully arranged ceasefire deal. While Trump blamed both sides for not adhering to the ceasefire, he aimed most of his ire at Israel in an angry rant before reporters on the White House South Lawn. “Israel's gotta calm down,” Trump said, calling its response to the Iranian missile “ridiculous.” I'm not happy with Iran, but I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land that was shot perhaps by mistake, didn't land. I'm not happy about that,” Trump said before boarding Marine One. “You know we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing.” Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures,” Trump posted on Truth Social late last night. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE. “Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their ‘system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE.” The response was similar to Iran's reaction to Trump's assassination of Quds Force Gen. Qassem Soleimani in 2020, when Trump claimed that Iran called him ahead of time. And I understand that,” Trump told Fox News in an interview last year. FIGHTING UNTIL ‘THE VERY LAST MINUTE': The ceasefire went into effect at 4 a.m. local time and appeared to hold for about two hours until Israel accused Iran of firing another barrage of missiles, which Iran denied. “The military operations of our powerful Armed Forces to punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute, at 4am,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on X. “Together with all Iranians, I thank our brave Armed Forces who remain ready to defend our dear country until their last drop of blood, and who responded to any attack by the enemy until the very last minute.” If signing up doesn't work, shoot us an email and we'll add you to our list. Trump will arrive triumphant, not just because he appears to have successfully brokered an end to the Israel-Iran war and Tehran's near-term nuclear ambitions but also because the 32-nation alliance is poised to adopt Trump's demand that all NATO nations spend 5% of GDP on defense, up from 2%. It's a goal that Trump says the United States doesn't need to meet. Americans, whether Democrats or Republicans, we should be celebrating that,” said Vance, who told Baier he'd seen a draft of Trump's statement before he arrived at the Fox News studios. “What the Iranians have showed through their support of terror networks, through their now-failed effort to build a nuclear weapon, is that they're just not very good at war,” Vance said. ': In an appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News show last night, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of the loudest voices calling for Trump to bomb Iran's nuclear sites, said Iran needs to do more if it truly wants peace. If the ceasefire is used to rearm and regroup by Iran, we've gone backwards,” Graham said. “Their nuclear ambitions have been set back in a very large, dramatic way between Israel and the United States, but do they still desire a nuclear weapon? We accept Israel,'” Graham said, issuing a challenge to Iran's foreign minister. If he won't say that, then I think they're just buying time to regroup and come at Israel later.” TRUMP VS. MEDVEDEV: Sunday's X post by Dmitry Medvedev, deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, in which he suggested “a number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads,” caught the attention of Trump, who chastised Russian President Vladimir Putin's hatchet man in a Truth Social post. “Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the ‘N word' (Nuclear! “Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination? Medvedev answered Trump in a follow-up post on X, in which he wrote, “Russia has no intention of supplying nuclear weapons to Iran because, unlike Israel, we are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court's decision last week in United States v. Skrmetti will have direct consequences for many transgender minors. Tennessee's law, which the Court upheld, prohibits people under age 18 from accessing certain kinds of treatment, such as hormones and puberty blockers, to treat gender dysphoria (the condition in which an individual's sex does not align with their gender identity). The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by the five other Republican appointees, revives an outdated case, Geduldig v. Aiello, that blessed discrimination based on archaic thinking. The key issue in Skrmetti was whether Tennessee's law, and others like it, requires heightened constitutional scrutiny. Roberts's majority opinion first insisted that the law does not constitute sex discrimination because it concerns a medical procedure for minors—the law prohibits using hormones or puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria. Adam Serwer: The attack on trans rights won't end there The Court's logic went as follows: Although the law restricts access to hormones and puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, both transgender and cisgender individuals can access these treatments for other conditions. Therefore, the Court suggested, even though transgender people are the only group negatively affected by the law, it still does not amount to discrimination against them, because they, along with cisgender individuals, can still receive hormones and puberty blockers as treatment for conditions other than gender dysphoria. (In a concurring opinion, Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito indicated that even if a law did specifically and overtly discriminate on the basis of transgender status, they still would not subject the law to heightened scrutiny.) The case concerned California's disability-insurance program, which excluded coverage for any disabilities arising from pregnancy. But the group of people who could access the state's disability-compensation benefits for reasons other than pregnancy included both women and men. “The program divides potential recipients into two groups—pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. In other words, the law didn't exclude all women from coverage, just those women who were unable to work because of pregnancy. “Normal pregnancy,” the justices opined, “is an objectively identifiable physical condition with unique characteristics.” At the time Geduldig was decided, laws that explicitly and specifically discriminated on the basis of sex were not subject to heightened judicial scrutiny. Many observers of constitutional law thought, until recently, that Geduldig had been consigned to history. The decision was viewed as an anomaly and outdated not only because of its reasoning, but also because it had been whittled away and rejected by both Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Congress, by statute, prohibited pregnancy discrimination in employment, that did not change the Constitution. Similarly, although the justices weakened or ignored Geduldig, they never outright overruled it. Roberts's majority opinion acknowledged that “a law that classifies on the basis of sex may fail heightened scrutiny”—but, it continued, the law would fail only “if the classifications rest on impermissible stereotypes,” as opposed to permissible ones such as those rooted in biological differences (emphasis added). The Republican-appointed justices have now indicated that Geduldig is making a comeback. When the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, Alito's majority opinion invoked Geduldig to declare that abortion restrictions do not amount to sex discrimination. Such restrictions, Alito wrote, are about a medical procedure tied to the biological differences between men and women. By invoking Geduldig, the Roberts Court is doing what the Supreme Court of earlier eras did: supplying tortured legal logic to justify long-standing hierarchies. In Plessy v. Ferguson, for example, the Court insisted that laws that required white and Black individuals to ride in different train cars were not impermissible racial discrimination—the rules applied to and burdened everyone, after all. That logic sounds like the thread in Skrmetti that maintains that bans on gender-affirming care don't constitute gender-identity discrimination because the bans allow transgender and cisgender kids to access hormones and puberty blockers—just not for treatment of gender dysphoria. That reasoning tracks with Skrmetti's insistence that the health-care bans do not discriminate on the basis of sex or gender identity; they are about age and medical procedures. The decisions in Plessy and Korematsu are rightly reviled today. Instead, the country has a Court that is turning to it as precedent, repurposing it to justify a new era of legal discrimination.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of people protest efforts to privatize federal public land in Santa Fe, N.M., outside a meeting of governors from western states and top Trump-administration officials as Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans to rescind a decades-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, in Santa Fe, N.M., Monday, June 23, 2025. SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A Republican-sponsored proposal before Congress to mandate the sale of federal public lands received a mixed reception Monday from the governors of Western states. A budget proposal from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee would mandate the sale of more than 3,125 square miles (8,093 square kilometers) of federal lands to state or other entities. It was included recently in a draft provision of the GOP's sweeping tax cut package. At a summit Monday of Western state governors, New Mexico Gov. “I'm open” to the idea, said Lujan Grisham, a second-term Democratic governor and former congresswoman. “Our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness, and they belong to all of us,” said Lujan Grisham, who was announcing written recommendations Monday on affordable housing strategies from the Western Governors' Association. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, for at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.” He has touted the many potential uses for public lands that include recreation, logging and oil and gas production, saying it could boost local economies. Several hundred protesters in downtown Santa Fe denounced efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting “not for sale” and carrying signs reading “This land belongs to you and me” and “keep our public land free for future generations.” “On a piece-by-piece basis where states have the opportunity to craft policies that make sense ... we can actually allow for some responsible growth in areas with communities that are landlocked at this point,” he said at a news conference outside the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. Lee has said federal land sales under his proposal would target “isolated parcels” that could be used for housing or infrastructure, and would not include national parks, national monuments or wilderness. Land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would be eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected. In some states, such as Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.</p>

Follow AP's live updates on the Israel-Iran war. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a “complete and total ceasefire” soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for the American bombing of its nuclear sites. But the status of a possible ceasefire remained tentative after an Iranian missile barrage struck Israel after a first deadline for the proposal. The Iranian barrages sent Israelis hurrying into bomb shelters as the sun rose, killing at least four people and injuring eight others, Israel's Magen David Adom rescue services said. Israel has yet to acknowledge Trump's proposal, which gives Israel more time to potentially strike back though Iran on its state television announced an overall ceasefire had begun at 7:30 a.m. local time. In Beersheba, first responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. The streets around the impact site were littered with glass and debris, windows were blown out of buildings as anxious neighbors stood outside their damaged houses. Trump's announcement that Israel and Iran had agreed to a “complete and total ceasefire” came soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for the American bombing of its nuclear sites. Trump's announcement on Truth Social said the ceasefire beginning about midnight Washington time would bring an “Official END” to the war. Israel did not immediately acknowledge any ceasefire, but there were no reports of Israeli strikes in Iran after 4 a.m. in Tehran. Heavy Israeli strikes continued in Iranian cities until shortly before that time. Israel in other conflicts has stepped up its strikes just before ceasefires took effect. “As of now, there is NO ‘agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a post on X. “However, provided that the Israeli regime stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people no later than 4 am Tehran time, we have no intention to continue our response afterwards.” The Israeli military declined to comment on Trump's ceasefire statement and the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Trump's reference carries emotional weight for the Arab world, particularly Palestinians. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff communicated with the Iranians through direct and indirect channels. It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties, said Trump, who dismissed the attack as a “very weak response.” Qatar condemned the attack on Al Udeid Air Base as “a flagrant violation” of its sovereignty, airspace and international law. This satellite picture by Planet Labs PBC shows Iran's underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordo following U.S. airstrikes targeting the facility, on Sunday, June 22, 2025. People enter a synagogue's bomb shelter as air raid sirens warn of incoming Iranian strikes in Haifa, Israel, Monday, June 23, 2025. Iran announced the attack on state television, with a caption calling it “a mighty and successful response” to “America's aggression.” The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said debris from a malfunctioning Iranian missile targeting Israel had triggered an alert of an impending attack on the Ain al-Assad base. By early Tuesday, Qatar Airways resumed its flights after Qatar shut down its airspace over the Iranian attack on Al Udeid Air Base. Flight-tracking data showed commercial aircraft again flying in Qatari airspace, signaling Doha believed the threat on the energy-rich nation had passed. The Israel Airport Authority said that the barrages from Iran forced them to close the country's skies for sevearl hours to all passenger planes that were expected to land and depart, including emergency flights. Israel's airports have been closed since the war with Iran began, but a handful of emergency flights had started arriving and departing over the past few days. Iran struck Israel with missiles and drones while Israel said it attacked “regime targets and government repression bodies in the heart of Tehran.” In Tehran, Israel hit the headquarters of the military force that suppressed recent protests and blew open a gate at Evin prison, which is known for holding political activists. Iranian state television aired footage it said was shot inside Evin, with prisoners under control. However, the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said many families of detainees “have expressed deep concern about the safety and condition of their loved ones” in the prison. Several Iranian officials, including Atomic Energy Organization of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, have claimed Iran removed nuclear material from targeted sites ahead of time. But the latest strikes unfolded only hours after Trump himself mentioned the possibility of regime change a day after inserting America into the war with its stealth-bomber strike on three Iranian nuclear sites. “If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change?? White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later described Trump as “simply raising a question.” AP correspondent Joe Federman reports Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomes U.S. support in the Israel-Iran war. Israel's preferred outcome is for Iran to agree to a ceasefire and reenter negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program, the official said. But Israel is prepared for the possibility of an extended low-intensity war of attrition or period of “quiet for quiet,” in which it would closely monitor Iran's activities and strike if it identifies new threats. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists. The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest such as the protests surrounding the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel. The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the hours after Iran launched a missile attack on a US base in Qatar, President Donald Trump and a group of his top diplomatic and security officials worked furiously behind-the-scenes to try to broker a peace deal to end the conflict between Iran and Israel. While Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio and Mideast Envoy Steve Witkoff worked on the Iranians – through direct and indirect channels, a senior White House official said. The government of Qatar played a key role as an intermediary, and Trump at one point spoke directly to its leader, Emir Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Roughly 48 hours after the US struck Iranian nuclear sites – and just hours after Iran hit back at the US base – Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that a deal had been struck, heralding a “complete and Total CEASEFIRE” between the warring nations that would lead to “an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR.” Vance coordinated with the office of Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani on details, one source said. Iranian state media announced Tuesday local time that a ceasefire has been “imposed on the enemy” after the country's military response to “US aggression.” ﻿In an earlier sign, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi thanked his country's armed forces and said military operations against Israel “continued until the very last minute,” hinting that hostilities may have ended. “The military operations of our powerful Armed Forces to punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute, at 4 a.m.” Araghchi said in a post on X. Earlier, Araghchi had said Iran would halt its military response if Israel stopped its strikes on Iran by that time. Trump claimed late Monday night that Israel and Iran reached out to him about peace between the two regions, as the Israeli military said it had identified missiles launched toward the nation from Iran. Trump, just a few hours after he announced the ceasefire deal, said in a post on Truth Social, “Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, “PEACE!” I knew the time was NOW. Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures.” Moments before Trump's post, the Israeli military said it had identified missiles launched toward Israel from Iran and said its defensive systems were activated. Earlier on Monday, Doha informed the US about the incoming Iranian strikes aimed at a US military base in Qatar which were successfully intercepted with no reports of injuries or deaths. Diplomatic sources told CNN they were hopeful that Iran's retaliatory strikes would serve as an off-ramp for Tehran to return to negotiations. Following Israel's launch of a military operation against Iran, there was an intensive diplomatic effort by US officials and intermediaries to get Tehran back to the table to negotiate a new nuclear deal. There were messages exchanged throughout last week between the two sides, via numerous interlocutors, to try to revive high-level discussions. There was also an active effort underway to have Trump and the Iranian president meet in Turkey last week, a regional source confirmed, but that did not materialize. Iran's consistent reply was that it was amenable to talks, but only if Israel suspended its military operations, sources said. On Saturday, ahead of its unprecedented strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites, the Trump administration messaged Iran through intermediaries. Their message was twofold: forthcoming US strikes would be contained, but also that the US terms for a diplomatic deal with Iran were clear and simple: no uranium enrichment, sources said. Iran has repeatedly said that it retains the right to enrich uranium. That sole condition from the US stripped away many other points that the two sides had discussed during multiple rounds of nuclear talks. On Sunday, Rubio repeatedly publicly messaged a desire for direct negotiations with Iran. He noted that a deal that allowed Tehran to have a civil nuclear program – without its own enrichment – was still on the table. “If they call right now and say we want to meet, let's talk about this, we're prepared to do that,” the top US diplomat said on CBS “Face the Nation.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Monday granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their homeland, including places like South Sudan, with minimal notice. The court's three liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented in a fiery opinion. The high court's order pauses a decision from US District Judge Brian Murphy, which found that the government's efforts to deport migrants to third-party countries without due process “unquestionably” violated constitutional protections. “Rather than allowing our lower court colleagues to manage this high-stakes litigation with the care and attention it plainly requires, this court now intervenes to grant the government emergency relief from an order it has repeatedly defied,” she wrote. The decision, she said, “strips away critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death.” But that will nevertheless have immediate and practical impacts. Related article Supreme Court prepares to release major opinions on birthright citizenship, LGBTQ books, porn sites and more “It's difficult to overstate how big a deal today's ruling is, especially in conjunction with the Supreme Court's two emergency docket rulings last month that, respectively, allowed the Trump administration to cancel temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans and parole for hundreds of thousands of other migrants,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. And today's ruling allows the government to remove those individuals and others to any country that will take them – without providing any additional process beyond an initial removal hearing, and without regard to the treatment they may face in those countries.” “Fire up the deportation planes,” Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote on X. The response underscores how the administration might try to capitalize on a ruling that could dramatically change the way deportations are carried out—allowing officials to deport migrants to countries where they have no ties. One of the major hurdles for previous administrations was trying to send people back to their home countries who would refuse to receive them for a host of reasons, including frosty relations with the United States. The case has drawn growing scrutiny after immigrant rights groups revealed that a group of migrants, initially bound for South Sudan, were being detained by the US at a military base in Djibouti and have been unable to contact their attorneys. The migrants, including some from Cuba, Vietnam and Laos, were being held in a converted Conex shipping container. Their lawyers argued that the high court's order didn't directly address their situation because Murphy had issued a subsequent order for them that the government did not appeal. In a new order late Monday, Murphy said that his May 21 directive remained in “full force and effect” despite the Supreme Court's decision. Humanitarian groups describe the situation in South Sudan as dire. “These individuals are stranded incommunicado in Djibouti, a country of which they have no knowledge, and en route to another country, South Sudan, where none have ever set foot,” the National Immigration Litigation Alliance and other groups told the court. In May, the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston rejected the government's request to pause a lower court ruling halting the policy, a decision that came amid reported plans to send migrants to Libya, a country widely criticized for mistreatment of detainees and ongoing civil unrest. The Trump administration has argued that a lower court's order requiring officials to give them an opportunity to claim fear of torture under federal law oversteps legal bounds and complicates foreign policy. The law is vague about how an administration is supposed to make that determination and what process rights are due to the migrant at issue. The Trump administration has said that in cases where it has received “assurances” from a foreign government that a migrant removed there will not be tortured, that officials do not have to notify a Cuban national, for instance, that he is being deported to South Sudan. In cases in which the government has not received those assurances, DHS policy requires the migrant to be notified so they can make a fear-of-torture claim. It is that timeline the Trump administration was fighting at the Supreme Court and had framed as a usurpation of “sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.” Trump has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals at the Supreme Court and most of them – including several dealings with immigration – have been successful. A majority of the court supported Trump's efforts to end temporary protected status for Venezuelan nationals, for instance, as well as the administration's plan to unwind a form of humanitarian parole for Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians. However, the high court has also repeatedly shut down efforts by Trump to speed deportations without offering due process for the affected migrants.
