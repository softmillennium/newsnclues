                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite dating rumors swirling around Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, the two are just friends. While speaking to the BBC in a video published on Monday, June 23, Raducanu, 22, reacted to the buzz, saying that she is “glad the internet is having fun and we're providing some entertainment for everyone.” Download it now for the most binge-worthy celeb content, exclusive video clips, astrology updates and more! “He asked me earlier on in the year,” she recalled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz and Tatjana Maria clinched grass-court titles at the HSBC Championships, and their Queen's triumphs are sure to send them to SW19 brimming with confidence. With plenty to keep on top of, follow Express Sport's live tennis updates below... Emma Raducanu explained that some bad news received this week prompted her to cry after her victory over Ann Li. 1 was visibly emotional after her win on the grass courts of Eastbourne. Asked about the moments after the final point, Raducanu explained: “I received some pretty bad news so I would like to keep it personal if that's okay, but it was difficult and very emotional at the end and probably just a release of different emotions.” It's an excellent victory for Billy Harris over a fellow Brit. He defeats Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-4 and progresses to the next round in Eastbourne. Billy Harris currently has the better of Cameron Norrie at Eastbourne. Harris has just broken in the second set and leads 6-4 4-3. Emma Raducanu has broken Ann Li in the deciding set of their Eastbourne clash. She has now broken early in the third set and is serving to go 3-1 ahead. Eyebrows were raised when Lois Boisson was not handed a Wimbledon wildcard. Forced to go through Wimbledon qualifying, she was beaten in three sets by Carson Branstine. Jodie Burrage fared better on Court 2 as she saw off Moyuka Uchijima 6-3 6-2. Former Grand Slam champion Conchita Martinez has warned Andy Murray about the scale of the commitment that comes with being a full-time tennis coach. Murray recently spent six months working with Novak Djokovic, and now the Scot it back on the market he has been tipped to team up with Emma Raducanu. But Martinez wants him to know what he would be getting into. She's doing great with Mark Petchey and Nick Cavaday, but we should ask Andy if he would like this experience. "It would be dependent on Andy and what he's up for doing. Andy Murray will get a statue at Wimbledon to commemorate his legacy as the first British player to win the men's singles title since Fred Perry. It saw him become the first British champion in 77 years, with Perry the last player to do it way back in 1936. All England Club stalwarts John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Pat Cash, Tracy Austin and Annabel Croft are set to join Balding and Guha in the studio to provide their hot takes on the action. There are also a number of recognisable names in the commentary box including Andrew Castle, Andrew Cotter, Jo Durie, Anne Keothavong, Nick Mullins and Todd Woodbridge, among others. And the BBC have snapped up even more tennis heroes to aid with their radio coverage as Marion Bartoli, Kim Clijsters, Laura Robson, Greg Rusedski, Naomi Broady, Daniela Hantuchova and Leon Smith all made the cut. Despite the long list of experts set to appear at Wimbledon, there are also some high-profile absentees from the BBC's list including Johanna Konta, Nick Kyrgios and Ash Barty. Emma Raducanu has praised Wimbledon organisers for dealing with a threat to her safety after police notified the Brit about the latest twist in her stalker ideal. A man was given a retraining order by authorities after following Raducanu to multiple events and causing her emotional distress. He has since been caught and blocked from attempting to buy tickets for Wimbledon, where Raducanu will play next week. She told BBC Sport: "Wimbledon did an amazing job. Venus Williams is planning another high-profile tennis appearance at 45 years old. Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz are also due to appear. Carlos Alcaraz is mentally stronger than Jannik Sinner in the big moments, according to Rafael Nadal's uncle, Toni. There is not much separating the two young guns battling for top spot in the modern era as Novak Djokovic winds down his tournament schedule. Nadal told Gazzetta dello Sport: "I think the Spaniard [Alcaraz] is mentally a little superior in the decisive moments, while the Italian [Sinner] is better at imposing a very high pace without making mistakes. Coco Gauff brought fans crashing back down to earth after Wimbledon and the WTA posted her hitting a mid-air trickshot during her preparation for Wimbledon. Gauff was a picture of elegance in the snap as she looked back at the ball after hitting a leaping tweener. Here is a list of matches involving home favourites, with play scheduled to get underway at around 11am (BST)... Kasatkina won in Eastbourne last year but she was defeated by Lulu Sun in the first round of her title defence on Monday. "I think Eastbourne is one of the oldest tournaments we've got on tour. Emma Raducanu was giddy with laughter when theories about a romance with Carlos Alcaraz were put to her this week. The duo, who are both 22, are set to pair up in mixed doubles at the US Open later this season. And eyebrows were raised when Raducanu turned up to watch Alcaraz from the stands at Queen's. During an interview with BBC Sport, Raducanu was made aware of fans on social media insisting that she and Alcaraz are 'destined for each other'. Giggling, she replied: "I'm glad the internet is having fun and we're providing some entertainment for everyone." \ud83e\udd29Emma Raducanu explains how Carlos Alcaraz asked her to be his US Open doubles partner \ud83e\udd1d pic.twitter.com/gVHz8i6Xt0 Hello and welcome to Express Sport's Wimbledon LIVE!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British lucky loser Billy Harris continued his love affair with the Lexus Eastbourne Open on Tuesday when he defeated countryman Cameron Norrie 6-4, 6-4 to reach the second round. Last year, Harris advanced to his maiden ATP Tour semi-final at the grass-court event, defeating then-World No. Twelve months on and the 30-year-old outplayed Norrie to earn his first Top 100 victory since Cobolli. Earlier, eighth seed Nuno Borges earned his second tour-level grass-court win with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win against British wild card Jack Pinnington Jones. The Portuguese star has now recorded 20 tour-level wins for the second consecutive season and will next meet Jenson Brooksby. Reilly Opelka survived a scare against British qualifier George Loffhagen to maintain his impressive grass-court season. The American fired 19 aces, according to Infoys ATP Stats, en route to a 7-6(6), 3-6, 7-6(1) victory in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Opelka reached the semi-finals in ‘s-Hertogenbosch earlier this month. Also on Tuesday, James Duckworth defeated Aleksandar Vukic 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1 and Marcos Giron downed Luciano Darderi 6-4, 7-5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight years after winning the Australian Open juniors, Carson Branstine and Bianca Andreescu face each other in Wimbledon qualifying -- older, tougher and ready to win. ROEHAMPTON, London -- Carson Branstine remembers the moment she would be lifelong friends with Bianca Andreescu. The first time they traveled together was at the 2017 Australian Open -- Branstine had just switched nationality from the U.S. to Canada -- and on their first night in Melbourne, the two 16-year-olds went on a snack run. Andreescu 'fessed up' to its theft immediately. 1 seed and Roland Garros semifinalist Lois Boisson 6-2, 6-7(1), 6-4 in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying. Eight years after bonding over Brie, Branstine will have to play her childhood friend for the first time. Andreescu, who advanced 6-2, 6-1 over Laura Pigossi, said that they had joked about the possibility two weeks ago in 's-Hertogenbosch, where they reunited as doubles partners for the first time at tour level. "The universe gave us exactly that," she said. "We both want each other to do well, but tennis doesn't give a s---." The pair are overflowing with praise for each other. "I love that girl," Branstine said. "We'll go to the grave together for sure. Bianca has one of the best hearts on tour, and I'm so blessed to call her one of my best friends." "She's one of those friends where, when we're together, it's like nothing ever happened," she said. "She's just the funniest person ever. She's super easygoing -- I know on the court she might not seem that way! She's a perfectionist, just like me." Branstine and Andreescu have wound up at Roehampton this year after taking very divergent paths -- with one unfortunate common thread -- following their standout junior careers. Andreescu delivered a spectacular breakthrough season in 2019, winning the US Open as a 19-year-old but has been unable to play a full season since due to a host of injuries and illnesses. 147 and playing Wimbledon qualifying for the first time since 2018. Branstine went to college instead -- three of them, in fact: the University of South Carolina, the University of Virginia and Texas A&M -- but injuries prevented her from even taking to the court at the first two. "I've taken more than five years off with injuries, total," Branstine said. I was playing through something all my life." She did her own research and discovered what worked for her body -- and what didn't. "Unfortunately, I had to not listen to a lot of people and learn on my own," she said. My physicality, I'm up there with anyone." 197, Branstine's win over Boisson is the second time in three weeks that she's upset a No. 1 seed in the first round of a tournament. On her WTA main-draw debut in 's-Hertogenbosch, she ousted defending champion Liudmila Samsonova 6-4, 5-7, 6-1 for her first Top 20 win. "We're not in Paris anymore," she said of facing Boisson, the darling of Roland Garros last month. Maybe not everyone knows me, but I think I can beat anyone out there." Branstine's self-belief draws on both her Top 5 junior success and the setbacks she's overcome. She started exploring other paths -- shadowing a family lawyer and signing with two modeling agencies as a “little side hustle.” My first tournaments back [in 2023], I went to Monastir with no training and no muscle. This week, Branstine and Andreescu are taking different approaches again when it comes to how they're seeking success. Andreescu is focused in her pursuit of a zen attitude, particularly when it comes to the surface. "I have this mindset of being one with the grass," she said. "It's a living thing, so I'm trying to be in touch with my spirituality in that sense. Touching the grass, speaking to it. I think it's helping for the most part. By contrast, Branstine favors a more hard-nosed approach -- self-imposed ultimatums. "It's not healthy for everyone," she said. Eight years after winning the Australian Open juniors, Carson Branstine and Bianca Andreescu face each other in Wimbledon qualifying -- older, tougher and ready to win.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon has its pristine grass courts primed for next week and Bernie Tomic, whose first big breakthrough came in London 14 years ago, is back! As a sextet of Aussies begin their bid to qualify for the world's most prestigious tournament on Monday night, the one-time prodigy is preparing for his first tour level match in more than four years. Watch the biggest Aussie sports & the best from overseas LIVE on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? The Queenslander will not be at Wimbledon this year mixing it up with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and company after narrowly missing the cut-off for the qualifying event that is played a few kilometres from the main stage at Roehampton. But rather than sitting on his heels hoping for some peers to withdraw from Wimbledon qualifying, the one-time boy wonder picked up his racquets and headed for the sun in Spain. Tomic has been the target of much derision and criticism during a career that dates back to 2008. But for a player who has been called out for tanking at times — the 28 minute blink-and-you-miss-it nightmare in Miami back in 2014 was a nightmare — the grizzled veteran deserves a nod for getting back to work. Far away from the big stages of sport, Tomic has been cracking in on tour backwaters in a bid to break back into the top 100 and return to the grand slam stages in Melbourne, Paris, London and New York. An opportunity awaits to take a significant step towards that mark on the grass courts of Rafael Nadal's home island of Mallorca this week after the 32-year-old qualified for his first ATP Tour level event since the Australian Open in 2021. From big-time boasts about his ability and earnings to losing motivation and hitting the “party zone” in his mid-20s, Tomic has regained his fitness and is becoming tougher to beat. Over the weekend he defeated Jasper De Jong, a Dutchman ranked 93 who recently won a round at the French Open, and then Aleksandar Kovacevic, an American who sits at 77, to qualify for an event where the winner pockets $162,000. The prize is a first round meeting against his compatriot Rinky Hijikata, a hard-working Aussie ranked 88 who reached the last 16 at the US Open a couple of years ago. If the Gold Coaster happens to win that match, he will jump to a spot just outside the top 200, which would put him in the frame to play in qualifying for the US Open in New York in late August. Any Aussie unaware of the Queenslander's topsy-turvy career would have to have their head in the sand given Tomic's propensity for headline grabbing behaviour during his career between the baselines and beyond it. I'm halfway there with the mind of Sampras. I've already got the heart of Lleyton,” he told Inside Sport. That interview was back in late 2006, not long after he had won the prestigious Orange Bowl junior event in Florida. Not long after Pat Rafter, John Newcombe and Tony Roche watched him in a junior match at the Australian Open, a year prior to Tomic becoming the youngest player to win the event in 2008. Blessed with beautiful touch and the brain to work the angles on court, he also won the boys event at the US Open in successes that inspired sponsors like Nike and Head to sign him, while also earning him representation from behemoth agency IMG. This journalist first talked to Tomic in 2008 after a narrow loss in a Futures event in Gippsland to Nick Lindahl, another talent who was later banned for seven years on match fixing charges. Tomic was chatty and happy to discuss his hopes. Less so, judging by an interaction on returning to the club house afterwards. That one did not make the headlines but other altercations did over the years following as his son strove for greatness. Tomic's best run at a grand slam came at Wimbledon in 2011 when he became the youngest player since Boris Becker in 1986 to reach the quarterfinals. There he fell to Novak Djokovic in four sets. Later that year he played alongside Lleyton Hewitt in an epic Davis Cup tie in Rose Bay in Sydney against a Switzerland team featuring Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka. He won the Sydney International in 2013 along with other ATP Tour titles in Italy, China and Colombia. In January, 2016, he peaked at an ATP ranking of 17. But during a golden period, he broke into the top 20 and featured in second weeks of grand slam tournaments. For all the critics who have dumped on Tomic, it is worth reiterating he was the 17th best tennis player in the world at a point in time on merit. How about back in 2009 at Wimbledon when his agent told Hewitt he was not good enough to hit with Tomic, who was just 16? Or the time where his dad blasted Tennis Australia officials for scheduling a night match past his bedtime? Tomic was pulled up three times in one day by Gold Coast police for traffic breaches and was placed on a Good Behaviour Bond for other incidents while driving flashy cars in the Sunshine State. He carried Davis Cup teams at times and was dumped on other occasions for a poor attitude. He pissed it up big-time in Miami and got himself arrested, teed off at a journalist after a poor US Open loss, berated Hewitt and got into a war of words with Nick Kyrgios. Tomic tanked matches, was booed off courts and received some hefty fines. As recently as last August, he was heckling rivals from a grandstand after a Challenger tour loss. To suggest he has had a colourful career would be an understatement. But even after all the drama, when journalists bumped him into at events, he would be quick to ask about someone's kids, or make a quip about something that had happened on court. Was he treated unfairly while at the top? Even Tomic was not prepared to go that far in a recent chat on tennis podcast The Changeover when assessing how his career has been covered, particularly at a time when it seemed he was in court as often as he was on court. They want to read something bad and stuff. “Obviously I did stuff that was, for sure, not right. I didn't do a lot of things on court that were wrong with referees and this … but I would let go sometimes and tank and not be there. I'm sure many players have done some stuff throughout these last 10 years. “I probably didn't do it the right way … and they did pick on me a little bit of the time, the media, but it's not like I have an issue with them.” In his recent chat with The Changeover, Tomic highlighted a few threads that will scarcely surprise as his ranking plummeted to beyond the 1200 mark in 2023. The 28-minute nightmare in the Miami Masters against Jarkko Niemennen followed a hip surgery in 2014 that required three months rehabilitation. He endured wrist and back problems in 2016, issues that have derailed more accomplished players than himself including Juan Martin del Potro, a rival whose talent he clearly rates. And there was burnout, which will surprise no-one. I just lost the hunger,” he said. Even winning on the court, I just wanted to be normal. “Now compared to who I was 10 years ago. I see things differently and react differently (but) tennis is a very isolated, very tough sport. You've got to give up your whole life. You go back to the room, feeling bad, being alone, away from friends, away from family.” From free-wheeling in fast and furious cars in his early 20s, by the time Covid-19 hit Tomic was committed to the circuit. “I didn't train a lot, honestly, from 26 to 28. During the Covid period, I partied heaps. There was nothing to do except party, you know,” he told The Changeover. And prior to those two years, I was already, like, mucking around partying. So it was like a three year party zone. For a bloke who was burned out and candidly admits he is past his prime, Tomic understands why people might be asking why he is out on back blocks grinding away. It has been a while since his infamous “counting my millions” quote after an Aussie Open qualifying loss, but the 32-year-old has earned more than A$10 million in prize money, and also have benefited from lucrative sponsorships and appearance fees earlier in his career. Partying can be expensive and so, too, the lifestyle associated with being a tennis player. Over the past 12 months Tomic has bounced from the US to South America and back to America. While Tomic is adamant the top 10 in his prime were better — he played the Big 4 and other big names in prime time outings — he says the depth is stronger than ever on the tour, with rivals ranked down to the 500s outstanding in their own right. That would give him entry back into grand slams and the top tier events on the tour. “Tennis has become part of my life ever since I was seven. Obviously I had a dad that pushed me extremely hard and that's one of the reasons I got there, in a sense,” he said. “But when you look at this whole picture, now that I'm 32, it's a purpose. It still gives me something to do. It's more of a statement, that sort of thing, so let's see if I can do it. “It's the only thing I'm good at. De Jong and Kovacevic, the blokes he beat on the weekend, will be playing at Wimbledon next week, and so too will Hijikata and much of the Mallorca draw headed by American star Ben Shelton and Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime. Making the jump from 200 to 100 is as tough as coming back from beyond 1200 a couple of years back to get to where he is now. And a bad back that flares on occasion will make it tougher. But if he can continue a winning run this week, Tomic Mark II will be on his way.</p>

Interest grew even more after Raducanu, 22, was seen in the stands at Queen's Club, watching Alcaraz's Centre Court match against Roberto Bautista. Raducanu, currently competing at the WTA 250 event in Eastbourne, spoke to the BBC and lightheartedly addressed her pairing with Alcaraz. When asked about humorous fan accounts on social media claiming the two are “meant to be,” she couldn't help but laugh.

Raducanu also shared the backstory behind their US Open partnership with a touch of humor, noting that she didn't give Alcaraz, 22, an immediate answer, something that Alcaraz confessed recently in an interview.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lois Boisson was unable to repeat her French Open heroics, suffering a shock elimination in the first round of qualifying for Wimbledon. But Boisson, who stunned the tennis world to reach the semifinals at Roland Garros as a wildcard, will not make her Wimbledon debut after being dumped out in the first round. 1 was exposed on grass by the world No. In windy conditions, the 22-year-old was playing the first grass court match of her career, and she was beaten in three sets 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4. The Canadian said: "She's an incredible player. Her result at the French Open speaks for itself. 3 Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva on her thrilling run to the final four in Paris before she was routed in straight sets by eventual champion Coco Gauff. Despite her breakthrough performance in the French capital, Boisson was denied a wildcard for the main draw at Wimbledon – a decision heavily criticized in her homeland – and she will have to settle for watching the tournament from home. Julien Benneteau, France's Billie Jean King Cup captain, bemoaned the decision by Wimbledon organizers not to grant Boisson a wildcard ahead of her qualifying exit, although the former world No. He told RMC: "The English don't give a damn about Lois Boisson. They didn't break any rules, that's why it's not unfair.” “Lois Boisson is unlucky: there are a lot of young English players who are coming up, and they've prioritised that. Before giving out wildcards, the English also look at your past on grass. Whether it's at Wimbledon or in previous tournaments on grass. “Lois Boisson has never played on grass, so for them, when we say she's the new star of world tennis, that she's reached a semi-final… For Wimbledon, it's nothing for the moment.

EASTBOURNE, England (AP) — Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova saved two match points on British opponent Harriet Dart's serve before rallying to win her opening match Tuesday at the grass-court Eastbourne Open.

Dart was 40-15 up on serve leading 5-4 in the decisive third set of a rain-affected round-of-32 match that second-seeded Krejcikova went on win 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-5.

It was just the second victory this year for the 17th-ranked Krejcikova, whose season didn't start until May because of a back injury.

The 29-year-old Czech player came to Eastbourne for her final warmup before beginning the defense of her Wimbledon title next week. She lost in the first round at her previous grass-court event at Queen's Club in London.

Emma Raducanu, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, dropped the first set on her way to a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-1 win over Ann Li of the United States. The seventh-seeded British player next faces Australian teenager Maya Joint, who on Monday eliminated Ons Jabeur, the two-time Wimbledon beaten finalist from Tunisia.

Sofia Kenin, the fourth-seeded American, lost her opening match 6-4, 6-4 against Kimberly Birrell, the 77th-ranked Australian.

The French number one, now ranked 65th on the WTA Tour, was defeated after almost two hours of battle in the first grass-court match of her career, going down 6-2, 6-7, 6-4.

On a windy Court 1 in Roehampton, where qualifying for Wimbledon takes place, the 22-year-old Frenchwoman looked ill at ease on grass - a surface which differs greatly from her favoured clay.

Despite her stunning run at the French Open earlier in June, Boisson did not receive an invitation from the organisers of the next Grand Slam in the tennis schedule.

A wildcard in Paris, the player then ranked 361st in the world delighted the home fans by reaching the last four after defeating world number three Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva. She was then beaten in the semi-finals by American Coco Gauff, the eventual champion.

By virtue of her new ranking, Boisson was the top seed in Wimbledon qualifying.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former doubles world No 1 Kristina Mladenovic has slammed “embarrassing” comments made by the likes of Carlos Alcaraz regarding the revamped US Open mixed doubles event. Rather than hold a traditional mixed doubles event in 2025, the USTA has decided to move its mixed doubles event, with the competition now being held in the pre-tournament fan week. The decision was made to try and encourage more big names to take part, and that move has certainly worked. ATP world No 2 Alcaraz pairs up with Emma Raducanu in arguably the most-talked-about pairing, with Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, and Jannik Sinner also all entered. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. “I will try to bring my doubles skills. Though the 22-year-old's comments have been celebrated by many, they appear to have drawn the ire of WTA star Mladenovic. Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu's US Open hopes questioned in ‘weakest pair' verdict And, in an interview with Eurosport France, the 32-year-old expressed her frustration. “When you hear Alcaraz or others say they're going to have fun while preparing for the US Open, it's embarrassing. “A Grand Slam is neither preparation nor fun. “You don't want to see your sport turn into a gigantic spectacle, even if it will indeed bring in a lot of money.” The event is set to be broadcast on TV and will likely encourage more fans to enter the site pre-tournament, when a string of exhibition events are usually held. She added: “In terms of business strategy, it's a brilliant idea. It guarantees the US Open a much more lucrative third week in terms of ticket sales, on-site consumption, and, I imagine, TV rights. “There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam.” We take a closer look at the No 1 battle between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Emma Raducanu has spoken about her "connection" with Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniel, 32, who hails from Japan but is based in Florida in the USA, has qualified for 11 Grand Slams, including Wimbledon on six occasions. However, despite that memorable run, Daniel has faced financial issues during his career given the cost of hiring coaches and physios, as well as travel expenses, something that is a major problem for lower-ranked players. And the 32-year-old has opened up on those monetary challenges which has seen him give up hobbies and other things he enjoys. 'When I was younger, I even wouldn't get the avocado on my Chipotle order because it's like three dollars more,' he told the Financial Times. 'When you try to save too much it ends up impacting people's games negatively.' Daniel revealed how he couldn't afford to pay for avocado with his chipotle order Daniel failed to qualify for either the Australian or French Open earlier this year, but he has still racked up around £135,000 in prize money through various tournament performances. Nevertheless, that figure doesn't seem much when you take into account all the costs and expenses required for the life of a professional tennis player. My credit card statement, it's at least $20,000 (£14,702) a month on just operational expenses of hotel, food, flights and not including the salaries I pay to my team. [It's] at least $100,000 (£73,518) per season for your basic level, not super experienced coach.' The Japanese star continued: 'Ten years ago, when I started, a lot of players would travel alone because the standards were not as high. Even in a Slam, you're not necessarily making money.' Daniel will hope to qualify for Wimbledon this year which would guarantee him at least £66,000 Qualifying for Wimbledon takes place this week and if Daniel does manage to make it to SW19, it will not only be a fantastic career opportunity but also a chance to boost his earnings. Those who are knocked out in the first round are guaranteed £66,000, while players who make it through to round two receive £99,000 and third round losers will even make £152,000. Meanwhile, this year's £3million bounty for the Wimbledon winner will be the largest prize ever handed out in Grand Slam history. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veteran Australian commentator Tony Jones will not be traveling to London for Wimbledon commentary as Channel Nine dropped him from its coverage. The reason behind this is the controversy he sparked with his comments at this year's Australian Open on Novak Djokovic. Jones called the World No.6 “overrated” and a “has-been” during a live broadcast and this upset the 24-time Grand Slam champion who demanded an apology, boycotting his on-court interview with former player Jim Courier as a result of this. Jones did apologize and Djokovic moved on from the incident. But now, Jones is again making headlines before Wimbledon, which starts on June 30. Djokovic hasn't yet captured a Major since the 2023 US Open. He last lifted the Wimbledon title in 2022 by beating Australia's Nick Kyrgios. Novak Djokovic will be aiming to tie the Wimbledon title tally with Roger Federer, who retired with eight of these trophies. Djokovic ended his title drought by winning the Geneva Open this year, becoming the third man after Federer and Jimmy Connors to win 100 or more titles. It was his first title since last year's Paris Olympics win. But before the ATP 250 event in the Swiss city, Djokovic lost his opening-round matches in both Monte Carlo and Madrid. Because of his campaign at Roland Garros, Serena Williams‘ former coach Patrick Mouratoglou considers Djokovic one of the contenders in the grass-court Major. Next time you're asked if Novak can win a 25th Grand Slam, think about it, what did he just show us in Paris? In the semifinal, eventual finalist Jannik Sinner had to toil hard to knock him out and take a 5-4 lead in the head-to-head matchups. After a shaky clay season, Novak made it all the way to the Roland Garros semifinals, beating top players like Zverev and pushing world No. Let's be clear: his tennis hasn't dropped. He's still capable of producing the precision, variation, and timing that made him one of the greatest players in history. If he wins Wimbledon, he will become the second man to win 100 matches in two different Grand Slam events. This article first appeared on FirstSportz and was syndicated with permission.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French Open sensation Loïs Boisson lost the first grass-court match of her career to miss out on Wimbledon on Tuesday, ensuring there will be no repeat of her fairytale run to the semi-finals at Roland Garros. Shock Roland Garros semi-finalist Loïs Boisson was eliminated in the first round of qualifying for Wimbledon on Tuesday by 197th-ranked Canadian Carson Branstine. The French number one, now ranked 65th on the WTA Tour, was defeated after almost two hours of battle in the first grass-court match of her career, going down 6-2, 6-7 (1/7), 6-4. On a windy Court 1 in Roehampton, where qualifying for Wimbledon takes place, the 22-year-old Frenchwoman looked ill at ease on grass – a surface which differs greatly from her favoured clay.

Despite her stunning run at the French Open earlier in June, Boisson did not receive an invitation from the organisers of the next Grand Slam in the tennis schedule. A wildcard in Paris, the player then ranked 361st in the world delighted the home fans by reaching the last four after defeating world number three Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva. Boisson was then beaten in the semi-finals by American Coco Gauff, the eventual champion. By virtue of her new ranking, Boisson was the top seed in Wimbledon qualifying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of their mixed doubles debut together, the pair created a buzz at the recent Queen's Club Championships in London.

This report, alongside the pair's friendly dynamic, has fuelled speculation that Alcaraz and Raducanu could be romantically involved. Add the Stan Sport package to watch tennis live and on demand with no ads in play I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me — I made that special request," Alcaraz told reporters earlier this month. He then added, with a smile: "She's going to be the boss. Emma Raducanu is seen watching one of Carlos Alcaraz's matches at the 2025 Queen's Club Championships.. Julian Finney via Getty Images But obviously it's going to be really fun." "Gotta keep them on their toes," she told media at Queens. "I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play, but for me, when he asked me, I was going to say 'yes'. Despite rumours gaining traction, neither Alcaraz nor Raducanu has confirmed any romantic involvement. Emma Raducanu watches the men's singles semi-final match between Carlos Alcaraz and Roberto Bautista Agut at the 2025 Queen's Club Championships. "I'm glad the internet's having fun, and we're providing some entertainment for everyone," she said. Raducanu previously dated Carlo Agostinelli, but ended their relationship last June. When asked recently about dating, Alcaraz highlighted how being a professional tennis player makes it hard to meet and maintain a romantic relationship. "It can be difficult as a tennis player to meet the right person because you are travelling all the time." Both Alcaraz and Raducanu will kick off their campaigns for The Championships next week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roger Taylor may have been a 1970s tennis star with Hollywood looks, but a player strike in 1973 almost tore his world apart Taylor tails off, but his meaning is clear. And he is right: for Englishmen of a certain vintage, nothing beats a secret agent with irresistible sexual magnetism. Where Draper squeezes modelling assignments in between training sessions, Taylor went one better: he was talent-spotted by a screenwriter's wife while playing the final of Queen's. A non-actor, taking on the biggest role in 1960s cinema? But then, that's exactly what would happen when George Lazenby – an Australian car salesman turned male model – succeeded Connery the following year. In Taylor's case, you can still see the outlines of a striking figure, even as he approaches his 84th birthday. Sitting in front of us, in a back room at the same Queen's Club where he twice reached the final, he looks trim and fit, with a powerful left forearm that once used to punch volleys – and occasionally opponents, as we will see. He has spent the last five years battling slow-moving prostate cancer, and was more recently diagnosed with another potentially fatal condition called amyloidosis. But if we rewind to 1967, Taylor had the looks to carry a movie poster, with his broad shoulders, soulful eyes, and thick mane of jet-black hair. He also had that aforementioned casting call, which took place at a hotel near Park Lane. “There was a room full of men,” Taylor recalls now, “and these two big guys, Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, had big cigars sticking out of their mouths. I'd been working on that famous line in the mirror – ‘The name's Bond, James Bond' – but it never came out.” Taylor was invited back for a second viewing, and told to bring his bathing trunks. As he explains in his forthcoming autobiography, “Frances [his first wife] became very irate, saying the whole thing was absolute madness. Lazenby – who would later marry another tennis champion in Pam Shriver – spent nine months shooting On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and found the attention so overwhelming that he turned down a six-film follow-up deal, despite an attached million-pound bonus. Meanwhile, Taylor joined the so-called Handsome Eight – a group of contracted stars that also included Australian icons John Newcombe and Tony Roche. His leading-man credentials surely contributed to that cheesy moniker, even if it fitted certain players more than others. “The Handsome Seven and Tony Roche” was one suggested alternative. Taylor's decision to join the Handsome Eight could have cost him his Wimbledon career, but fortunately his timing was perfect. The following year, 1968, All England Club chairman Herman David ended the ban on professional participation, so he never missed a match. Unlike most of his peers, Taylor also participated in 1973, the most controversial year in the All England's Club's history. The strike was part of an ongoing power struggle between increasingly militant players and stubbornly old-fashioned administrators. As he writes in his book, “Wimbledon was part of my DNA and all the more important to me as British No 1 and flagbearer for the host nation … Mixing with some of the old guard who made up the bulk of the membership, eminent soldiers who'd fought in the war and risked their lives for their country, led me to question who was going to stand up for this great event and not be bullied into submission.” More than 50 years later, the events of that summer remain fresh in Taylor's mind, and still bring a quaver to his voice. He becomes emotional during our conversation, especially when discussing the lack of appreciation he received from those in positions of power. He finds their betrayal harder to stomach than the aggressive stance of Stan Smith, the reigning Wimbledon champion who bearded him at Queen's Club after a match. Then I changed my mind 10 minutes later and called him back again. I saw Tim Phillips, who was on the way to becoming chairman, put his arm around Donald Dell [a player-turned agent who had helped instigate the boycott]. Taylor tails off once again, but as before, his meaning is clear. As a result, they were never going to lionise him for his brave stand. In his book, Taylor quotes Jack Kramer – the champion-turned-promoter who formed the original professional tour – to the effect that “Roger had been a good player, but he never amounted to a thing after Wimbledon '73.” To make Taylor's memories even more painful, he probably should have won the title that summer, but came unstuck in the semi-finals against two-time French Open champion Jan Kodes. Again, there was a frustrating subplot here, because bad weather forced the players off court with Taylor leading the deciding set 5-4. “It was virtually dark at 10 minutes past seven,” he recalls now. “But if you know Wimbledon, they were military people, so they just wanted our match to be finished, to keep the order of the week going. After 42 minutes, Captain Gibson – who was the referee – shouted ‘Taylor back on court, now. '” Kodes dealt with the sudden resumption better, won the next three games in a flash, and dominated Alex Metreveli in a straight-sets final. In his book, he describes how Dan Maskell, the famous commentator and coach, had snubbed him as a teenager, preferring prospects with better-heeled shoes. Much later, he was devastated by the AELTC's refusal to grant membership to his son Greig, a promising player who never quite found his way in the game, and would later pass away at the tragically early age of 46. “Wimbledon is like a cult,” says Taylor, before citing the story of the elderly committee member who dismissed the glorious career of three-time champion Fred Perry in seven condescending words: “Fred had a bad war, you know.” Taylor found this comment hard to swallow. He had known Perry well, while working in his sports stores as an ambitious young player, and felt a certain kinship with his fellow northern misfit. Warming to his theme, Taylor adds that “I've been to cocktail parties where we're sitting by Centre Court, and one of the Wimbledon committee members is addressing all these people, and everyone is sitting there in awe. I played on that court, and they never mentioned me.” Although Taylor would eventually be appointed Davis Cup captain for four years in the early 2000s, he has never enjoyed the visibility and profile that his achievements surely warranted. Perhaps he was just too blunt-speaking and stubborn for his own good – a quality that has earned him comparisons to his Yorkshire contemporary Sir Geoff Boycott. Taylor certainly could be ornery, not to mention rough when necessary. “It was in the locker-room in Berlin, which was like an old Western with these swing doors, and he came bursting through them. “I said something like, ‘Well, if you touch me, it's on.' Luckily I wasn't penalised in any way because everybody knew about him and I was defending myself really.” Sounds like those Bond casting agents really did miss a trick.
