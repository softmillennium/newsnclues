                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin recovers as the Coinbase premium soars, but retail investors' inflows are rising at Binance, and open interest is falling, proving that traders remain cautious. The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index hit its second-highest level in 2025, highlighting sustained US investor interest. Binance's retail inflow percentage reached a 2-year high, with a sharp increase in 0–1 BTC exchange deposits, hinting at active retail trading or profit-taking behavior. Bitcoin's jump to $105,000 was driven by short liquidations, not new long positions. The Coinbase Bitcoin (BTC) Premium Index reached its second-highest value on Monday, reflecting a price premium on BTC available at Coinbase versus Binance. The index has remained green for most of June, indicating sustained buying pressure from US investors. This aligns with positive spot ETF flows for most of the month, as a study noted a 0.27 coefficient linking prior-day ETF inflows to price increases, suggesting market optimism. CryptoQuant data shows that Binance's retail inflow percentage has surged to its highest level in two years, coinciding with a Bitcoin price decline. With Binance dominating global retail trading volume compared to Coinbase, its user base's behavior—potentially driven by lower entry barriers—could influence market trends. Both metrics offer contrasting insights amid Bitcoin's current price. Conversely, high Binance inflows may reflect profit-taking or panic selling by retail investors, contributing to downward pressure. This mixed scenario implies caution for buyers: the premium indicates potential undervaluation opportunities, but corrections could deepen if retail selling persists. Related: Bitcoin $105K 'trend switch' comes as Fed hints at July rate cut However, this uptick came with a 10% drop in open interest (OI), signaling that the surge was primarily driven by shorts covering rather than new bullish positions. Traders betting against Bitcoin likely faced liquidations, with $130 million in short positions wiped out on June 23, forcing them to buy back BTC, aligning with the sharp price bounce. The aggregated funding rate is now rising on minimal OI growth, indicating over-leveraged longs paying shorts, a potential sign of market exhaustion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum and XRP Pump on Relief Rally, But These Coins Are Mooning Harder: Analysis Oil prices tumbled 2.92% with Brent crude falling to $69.39 as Middle East tensions eased and analysts reject a supply shortage scenario. The risk-on rotation saw gold pull back as safe-haven demand waned. Gold prices dipped 2% to $3,315.8 per oz, with investors pivoting from defensive positions into high-beta crypto plays and riskier assets such as stocks and ETFs. And, of course, meme coins mooned even harder when these more, er, traditional altcoins spiked. The Average Directional Index also known as ADX at 35 indicates strong trending conditions—readings above 25 confirm established trends, suggesting the current momentum has legs. Traders might interpret this as particularly bullish since it shows the upward movement isn't just a brief spike but part of a sustained directional move. The Relative Strength Index or RSI (a thermometer that measures how oversold or overbought an asset is), sits at 56, placing the token in the "power zone" where momentum is strong but not yet overbought. Historical data shows meme coins often run until RSI hits 75-80, suggesting approximately 20% additional upside potential before exhaustion. Most notably, the Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows "ON" status in a bearish movement, indicating volatility compression that typically precedes explosive moves. When this indicator fires after a period of consolidation, traders often see 30-50% movements in either direction. The Dogwifthat meme coin, which trades as WIF, today popped 23% to $0.8740. What's more, this move triggered $3.71 million in short liquidations. Perhaps not fully bullish, but still a recovery from the heavy price drop. Unlike overbought conditions that limit upside, this balanced reading means WIF has room to run if buying pressure continues. The ADX at 17 shows that the bearish trend is now weaker, giving room for a short to medium term bounce if the coin can keep up momentum and this is not just a hype episode. However, today's surge brings price action closer to challenging the 50-day EMA around $0.91. A decisive break above this level would shift medium-term momentum bullish and potentially trigger algorithmic buying from trend-following systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When MEXC quietly rolled out its new Launchpad feature this past June 6th, the exchange knew that it had something special. But beyond the numbers, MEXC might have tapped into something deeper: a shift in how token launches are structured and who they're really for. In a market where token offerings have gradually tilted toward institutional players and insiders, MEXC's new approach attempts to correct the imbalance. It could be the beginning of a new phase in crypto fundraising. These brought vetting and execution under the umbrella of reputable exchanges. But new barriers emerged: limited allocations, high entry thresholds, and a tendency for whales to dominate the process. Later, lottery-style IEOs emerged to broaden access but they often introduced more luck than logic, turning token launches into glorified raffles. Over time, the excitement surrounding new launches gave way to frustration. MEXC's new feature seeks to reverse this “involution” that has taken place. It's an intentional reset, designed to offer two distinct value paths. Together, these two streams speak to both sides of the trading community. Participation involves subscribing to token sales using supported currencies (such as MX, USDT, etc.) There are no arcane staking requirements or loyalty tiers to navigate. Instead, users need to complete a few basic tasks, such as depositing funds or executing trades, in order to become eligible for a given event. Rather than relying on a lottery or first-come-first-served mechanism, the Launchpad ensures that each qualifying participant receives tokens in direct proportion to the amount they commit. This guarantees that smaller investors aren't sidelined by larger players, and everyone knows exactly what they're getting into. If an event is oversubscribed, the system adjusts allocations proportionally, and any unused funds are automatically returned to users, typically within 24 hours. The result is a launch experience that feels fair, intuitive, and genuinely accessible to everyone. While both MEXC Launchpad and Launchpool offer users opportunities to acquire new tokens, they serve fundamentally different purposes and cater to distinct trading strategies. The new Launchpad, as we've explored, focuses on providing early access to tokens through time-limited subscription events. It's geared toward traders who want to get in on the ground floor of high-potential projects, or purchase well-established tokens at steep discounts. Launchpool, by contrast, lets users stake existing assets like MX or USDT into reward pools, earning new tokens passively over time. Both paths are valuable but which one fits best depends on the user's appetite for risk and preferred strategy. In a crowded field of centralized exchanges offering token launch products, MEXC's Launchpad stands out not by being louder but by being smarter in its design. While major platforms like Binance, OKX, and KuCoin have long operated launchpads of their own, they often come with steep participation barriers. New token events are held regularly, compared to the monthly cadence seen on other platforms. This not only keeps engagement high but also increases opportunities for retail traders to find projects that match their interests. Where others rely on lottery systems or tiered allocation models that favor large holders, MEXC offers proportional distribution. This levels the playing field, giving smaller investors a real chance to participate meaningfully. The platform also skips the complex requirements and lock-in periods that characterize many competitor launchpads, instead making qualification as simple as completing a few accessible tasks. Perhaps the most compelling edge, however, lies in MEXC's discount subsidy model. By offering significant markdowns, even on major assets like Bitcoin, the exchange is actively transferring value back to users rather than extracting it. One that puts user benefit at the center of its strategy. At the heart of MEXC's approach is a radical idea: give more back to users. Project teams, whales, and exchanges tend to capture most of the upside, leaving retail investors with leftovers. This has led to growing disillusionment and a “why bother” attitude among many traders. The platform gives up part of its margin (via discounting) to attract and reward real users. This approach does more than just boost signups, as it helps re-establish trust in the token launch process. The term “Launchpad” has become synonymous with fatigue, gatekeeping, and missed opportunity. But MEXC's latest move suggests the model still has life… If it evolves. By restoring fairness, reducing complexity, and giving real value back to its users, MEXC isn't just launching tokens. It's relaunching the idea of what token access should look like in 2025 and beyond. In a space often dominated by insiders and algorithms, this return to user-first thinking might be exactly what crypto needs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's price dropped to $2,130 in the past 24 hours on crypto exchange Coinbase amidst a broader fall in the crypto industry, which also saw Bitcoin break below $100,000 very briefly. Despite the sudden Ethereum price correction, analysts have presented arguments that hint at a strong Ethereum rally once this current downturn is complete. Notably, their projections are not short-term, and one of them puts Ethereum's next major target around $6,000. The first detailed analysis came from @CryptoWaveV, a trader who uses Elliott Wave Theory to forecast market structure. According to his recent post, Ethereum's price has now completed what he considers to be wave A of a larger corrective structure. His chart shows Ethereum breaking down from a high around $2,900 and falling almost directly into a Fibonacci-based support zone between $2,134 and $1,957. However, this upward move would likely be temporary before another Wave C leg downward, which could drive the Ethereum price to as low as $1,706 before a meaningful bottom is confirmed. This level is what the analyst refers to as his “ideal buy zone” for long-term accumulation. Although the short-term view includes price crashes, a full bullish impulse will resume once this corrective phase is complete. In this case, the analyst's outlook is based on Wyckoff's accumulation framework. The chart projected that Ethereum will reclaim a horizontal range between $2,150 and $2,450, followed by a steady progression above $3,850, and then another strong move past $4,800, before ultimately culminating around $6,800 to $7,000. This bullish setup suggests that while the recent dip to $2,100 might have shaken confidence, it may have served a larger structural purpose. The spring and test patterns imply a final shakeout of weak hands, clearing the path for long-term buyers to step in. Finally, the outlooks from both analysts converge on a six-month to one-year trajectory that could see Ethereum breaking into the $6,000 range, if not higher.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital Asset has raised $135 million to promote adoption of its Canton Network blockchain. The funding round, announced Tuesday (June 24), was led by DRW Venture Capital and Tradeweb Markets, with participation from numerous investors including Goldman Sachs, which had helped launch the blockchain. “This funding milestone validates the inevitability of what we envisioned years ago: a privacy-enabled public blockchain designed specifically for institutional adoption,” Digital Asset Co-founder and CEO Yuval Rooz said in the release. “Canton is already actively supporting numerous asset classes — from bonds to alternative funds — and this raise will accelerate onboarding even more real-world assets, finally making blockchain's transformative promise an institutional-scale reality.” PYMNTS wrote about the Canton Network's launch last year, noting that its pilot effort was aimed at demonstrating the interoperability of 22 independent distributed ledger applications (dApps) in the capital markets domain “and prove how a network of interoperable applications can seamlessly connect to enable secure, atomic transactions while reducing counterparty and settlement risk.” In other blockchain-related news, PYMNTS wrote this week about some of the custody issues tied to corporate bitcoin treasuries. Insurance for digital assets is still in its early stages, that report noted, a reality that has led some companies to weigh creative solutions, like distributed custody arrangements or programmable insurance smart contracts. Others are waiting for clearer regulations that would make insurers more confident about underwriting policies at scale. “As for on-premises solutions, holding bitcoin securely requires technical knowledge, robust infrastructure and detailed internal controls,” the report added. That is likely a radically different model than most finance departments are used to.” We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He made the remarks while visiting Tehran's cinema theaters, which had temporarily shut down but have now reopened, IRNA reported. During his visit, Faridzadeh highlighted the vital social and cultural roles of cinemas in Iran. He stated that movie theaters provide a safe space where people can come together to foster unity and shared understanding. Moreover, theaters enable audiences to unite in empathy and shared language, making their continued operation crucial across the country.” He emphasized that cinema is not merely entertainment but also a national asset. “Cultural institutions must collaborate more, especially during critical periods, to keep the lights on in our cinemas.” Fostering a sense of solidarity and resilience is more important than ever.” He concluded with a call for collective effort: “While cinemas are actively serving the public, I urge all artists to understand their national responsibility and help uplift the spirits of our people. Additionally, ticket prices for cinemas in Tehran will be half-price until further notice. Early Friday morning, June 13, a series of terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Zionist regime targeted Tehran and several other Iranian cities, resulting in the martyrdom of numerous military commanders, scientists, and innocent civilians. The incident has sparked outrage not only within Iran but also among international observers. On Sunday, the United States, in violation of international law, attacked three nuclear sites—Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan—joining Netanyahu's war against Iran. Responding to these actions, Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi issued a statement affirming that, under the United Nations Charter, Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interests, and people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran, clearly fearful of an online Israeli incursion, imposed a near-total internet blackout early last week The war between Israel and Iran, though largely a fight of fighter planes, drones and bombs, is erupting in the digital realm as well. Iran, clearly fearful of an online Israeli incursion, imposed a near-total internet blackout early last week. Cybersecurity company Cloudflare assessed that internet traffic levels in Iran “are now ~97% below where they were at the same time a week ago”. The reduction in internet speeds comes after an anti-Iranian government hacking group with potential ties to Israel claimed that it hacked Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's government, said on Twitter/X that officials in Tehran had restricted internet access to ward off additional cyberattacks. The group known as Gonjeshke Darande, Farsi for Predatory Sparrow, said on Wednesday it had hacked the Nobitex exchange, a day after claiming it had destroyed data at Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah. Elliptic, a consultancy specialising in crypto-related crime, said it had so far identified more than $90m in cryptocurrency sent from Nobitex crypto wallets to hacker addresses. The hackers appear to have in effect “burned” those funds, rendering them inaccessible by storing them in “vanity addresses” for which they do not have the cryptographic keys, Elliptic said. Iran has attempted to retaliate, but as with the wider war, it seems that Israeli attacks have been more successful and damaging. Security professionals say hackers for Hamas and Russia have done the same. Late Friday, Iran seemed to lift the internet blackout for some citizens, the New York Times reported, though even those who could access limited online services believed their connections were temporary. PornHub, widely estimated to be the most-visited site for pornographic content in the world, returned to France on Friday after a three-week blackout. The site's owner, Aylo, had rescinded access to the site protest of a new French law demanding adult websites verify users' ages with a credit card or identification document. PornHub drew a line in the sand on the issue and revoked access for a market of nearly 70 million rather than implement an age gate. Since then, a French court has suspended the law while it considers compliance with the European Union's constitution, and so Pornhub is back online. It's an area where lawmakers have been uncharacteristically prone to action, even in the US, where tech regulation is often as hands off as can be. More than 20 states now have age verification laws on the books. The state legislature there passed a law requiring an ID to visit PornHub in September 2023. In Louisiana, which has imposed age verification laws, PornHub is still available, but it has seen traffic there decline by 80%, which it attributes to the barrier of the ID requirement. Online search data showed that people in states with age verification laws sought out porn sites that did not comply with local laws so as to circumvent the age gates as well as virtual private networks to hide their locations from internet providers. The other battlefields over age verification concern social media bans for underage users. Australia, which has passed a law banning under-16s from social media, has been testing different technologies with which to enforce its prohibition but found them lacking. A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives The UK's system for verifying ages to keep pornography away from children, a provision of the Online Safety Act, will take effect in July. Last week, Donald Trump debuted a mobile phone branded with his family name – “T1” etched into the gold case alongside an American flag – with a listed price of $500 and a pledge that it would be “proudly designed and built in the United States”. Its makers have to abide by the same market forces as other phonemakers. Both cheap labor and electronics expertise reside in China. There's a reason Apple's phones are labeled “Designed in California” – to take advantage of the caché and appeal of the US without suffering its labor costs. Looking ahead, experts predict that Trump's own tariffs could cause the price of smartphones to spike by double or even triple digits. Apple itself seemed to concur with those assessments when it flew some $2bn worth of iPhones into the US before the tariffs on China went into effect. Its operating system can only run basic apps such as a calculator and a web browser because it runs on PureOS, software of the company's own making, per the Journal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As organizations throughout the coffee value chain continue to call for more transparent and collective action for coffee sector sustainability, navigating the complex forest of sustainability initiatives remains a challenge. Late last week, the International Coffee Organization (ICO) unveiled an expansive new map of the trees, compiling hundreds of sustainability initiatives within a slick new filterable and navigable database called the Coffee Sustainability Support Database (C2SD). Formerly known as the Coffee Sustainability Initiatives Map, the relaunched database includes an improved interface with dedicated country views and program views. It also offers filtered lists and graphic insights into specific project types, goals, locations and status. “We are very proud of the new Coffee Sustainability Support Database, which reflects our ongoing commitment to the ICO's mission of promoting the sustainable and inclusive growth of and by the global coffee sector,” ICO Executive Director Vanúsia Nogueira said in an announcement of the launch. Daily Coffee News photo by Nick Brown. The platform is open for voluntary project submissions through an online form, while allowing for project updates following initial validation. According to the ICO, the map can be used to scale up individual sustainability efforts by aligning with broader collective strategies, as well as to identify synergies, overlaps, and funding gaps. The group is planning to broaden the database to include projects from investment banks and development funds. “Since its inception, the goal of the Coffee Sustainability Support Database has been to consolidate scattered information and make it accessible to key stakeholders,” Nogueira said. “This relaunch marks a major step forward in that mission, offering enhanced tools for decision-making, collaboration and strategic funding.” Related PostsICO Flagship Development Report: Policy Makers Should Support CircularityICO and SCA Sign MoU in Support of Global Coffee IndustryICO and UNIDO Outline an Unprecedented Global Coffee Fund</p>

The artwork, tokenized as an NFT on the WISe.ART platform, is securely stored on a WISeSat satellite using embedded hardware security modules and blockchain authentication. This milestone follows WISe.ART's 2022 achievement of minting and transmitting a space-based NFT featuring actress Brooke Shields at NASDAQ. WISeKey (NASDAQ: WKEY) ha lanciato con successo l'opera digitale dell'artista spagnola Mayte Spínola, "El Cristo Cósmico", in bassa orbita terrestre tramite un razzo SpaceX Falcon 9 il 23 giugno 2025. L'opera, tokenizzata come NFT sulla piattaforma WISe.ART, è conservata in modo sicuro su un satellite WISeSat grazie a moduli hardware di sicurezza integrati e autenticazione blockchain. Questo traguardo segue il successo del 2022 di WISe.ART, che ha coniato e trasmesso un NFT dallo spazio con l'attrice Brooke Shields al NASDAQ. La missione dimostra l'approccio innovativo dell'azienda nell'unire tecnologia satellitare sicura, infrastruttura blockchain e NFT, permettendo ad artisti e creatori di proiettare le proprie opere dall'orbita. La obra, tokenizada como un NFT en la plataforma WISe.ART, está almacenada de forma segura en un satélite WISeSat usando módulos de seguridad hardware integrados y autenticación blockchain. WISeKey (NASDAQ: WKEY)는 2025년 6월 23일 스페인 아티스트 마이테 스피놀라의 디지털 아트워크 "엘 크리스토 코스미코"를 SpaceX 팔콘 9 로켓을 통해 저지구 궤도에 성공적으로 발사했습니다. 이 작품은 WISe.ART 플랫폼에서 NFT로 토큰화되어, 내장된 하드웨어 보안 모듈과 블록체인 인증을 이용해 WISeSat 위성에 안전하게 저장되어 있습니다. 이번 성과는 2022년 WISe.ART가 배우 브룩 쉴즈를 주제로 한 우주 기반 NFT를 NASDAQ에서 발행하고 전송한 업적에 이은 것입니다. 이 임무는 안전한 위성 기술, 블록체인 인프라, NFT를 결합하여 아티스트와 창작자가 궤도에서 작품을 전송할 수 있도록 하는 회사의 혁신적인 접근 방식을 보여줍니다.

L'œuvre, tokenisée en NFT sur la plateforme WISe.ART, est stockée en toute sécurité sur un satellite WISeSat grâce à des modules matériels de sécurité intégrés et à une authentification blockchain. Cette étape fait suite à la réussite de WISe.ART en 2022, lorsqu'elle a créé et transmis un NFT spatial mettant en vedette l'actrice Brooke Shields au NASDAQ.

WISeKey combines space tech, blockchain, and art in a unique satellite NFT launch, showcasing innovative technological capabilities that extend digital assets into orbit. WISeKey's subsidiary WISe.ART has successfully launched Spanish artist Mayte Spínola's digital artwork "The Galactic Christ" into low Earth orbit via a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, creating a unique space-based NFT. This represents a technical demonstration of WISeKey's capabilities in combining several emerging technologies: satellite communications, blockchain security, and NFT tokenization. The company appears to be positioning itself at the intersection of space technology and digital authentication - a potentially unique market niche with applications beyond art. Their previous 2022 space-based NFT featuring Brooke Shields confirms this is part of a consistent strategic direction. From a technical perspective, the implementation of post-quantum secure elements in their satellite security architecture suggests forward-thinking engineering, addressing future cryptographic vulnerabilities. The two-way data connectivity for metadata validation demonstrates practical functionality beyond simple storage. While the immediate revenue impact may be limited, this launch establishes WISeKey's technical credentials in a highly specialized domain and potentially opens new commercial applications for secure, space-based digital asset management and authentication services. WISe.ART Launches Mayte Spínola's “Galactic Christ” into Space Aboard SpaceX Mission Pioneering Space-Based Art NFTs and Digital Expression Geneva, Switzerland, June 24, 2025 –WISeKey International Holding Ltd (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a leading global cybersecurity, blockchain, and IoT company, today announces that WISe.ART, its secure NFT marketplace subsidiary has successfully launched Spanish artist Mayte Spínola's digital artwork El Cristo Cósmico (“The Galactic Christ”) into low Earth orbit (LEO) aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, marking another milestone in the company's strategy to expand the frontier of digital expression through space technology. The launch occurred at 23:11 CET on June 23, 2025, placing a WISeSat satellite carrying Spínola's artwork into orbit. “Space is not only the next frontier for technology, it is a new medium for human expression,” said Carlos Moreira, Founder of WISeKey and WISe.ART. In 2022, during a special ceremony at the NASDAQ headquarters in New York, WISe.ART minted and transmitted a space-based NFT featuring actress Brooke Shields, demonstrating the platform's early commitment to combining celebrity expression, secure blockchain, and satellite communications. Mayte Spínola, one of Spain's most celebrated contemporary artists and founder of the Grupo Pro Arte y Cultura, shared her thoughts on the occasion: “Seeing my work orbiting Earth is deeply symbolic. With this launch, El Cristo Cósmico becomes a space-hosted digital artifact, merging art, spirituality, and space technology. It showcases how WISe.ART is redefining the role of NFTs, offering creators new dimensions for secure global, and now orbital engagement. WISe.ART is a full-service NFT platform designed for artists, collectors, and brands. It leverages WISeKey's trusted cybersecurity technologies to ensure secure creation, trading, and verification of digital assets, with integrations into IoT, satellite systems, and post-quantum infrastructures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rebound comes as global risk sentiment improves following a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a softer stance on crypto-related banking on Monday. Apart from this risk-on sentiment, institutional demand remained strong as corporations accumulated BTC in their reserves and fresh Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) inflows, suggesting a further recovery in BTC prices. Bitcoin price recovered sharply on Monday, closing the day with a 4.3% gain, as news emerged that Donald Trump had announced a “complete and total” ceasefire between Israel and Iran, effectively pausing the ongoing 12-day war. Later on Tuesday, Donald Trump's Truth Social account posted that “THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT,” and called on both nations not to violate it, fueling the risk-on sentiment in the global markets. Gains in crypto markets were also supported by improved risk appetite and rising expectations of a dovish Federal Reserve (Fed), which have pushed the 2-year Treasury yield further below the 4% mark. This, along with speeches by Fed officials, will drive the US Dollar and overall market sentiment. The main focus is on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee at 14:00 GMT , which could offer hints about the future rate-cut path and influence risky assets such as Bitcoin. The US Federal Reserve Board announced on Monday that “reputational risk” will no longer be a component of its examination programs in supervising banks. This news added fuel to the ongoing recovery of Bitcoin, as the “reputational risk,” also commonly known as Operation Choke Point 2.0, had previously prevented banks from providing custody services for crypto assets and financial services to digital asset companies. This policy shift and the Fed's more lenient stance on crypto-related banking could boost the wider adoption and acceptance of digital assets. However, the Fed still expects banks to maintain robust risk management to ensure safety and soundness, as well as compliance with laws and regulations. Senator Cynthia Lummis says on her X account, “This is a win, but there is still more work to be done.” Bitcoin institutional demand starts the week on a positive note. Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, announced on Monday that it has added 245 BTC to its holdings. According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $350.43 million on Monday, continuing its 10-day streak of gains since June 9. However, if BTC faces a correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,188, it could extend the decline to retest its Sunday low of $98,200. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Global risk appetite is increasing as the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, along with the Fed's softer stance on crypto-related banking, takes hold. Tensions in the Middle East have taken the backseat after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran on Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Now, as the market digests a Congress game-changer expected to “unleash” trillions, bitcoin and crypto prices are braced for Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before lawmakers—coming after Trump suddenly flipped on firing him. “Aside from any geopolitical updates, today's key event will be Fed chair Jerome Powell's testimony in Washington,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over,” Trump added. The Fed kept interest rates on hold again last week after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation. “The most bullish scenario would be confirmation of a Fed dovish policy pivot or a major de-escalation in global trade and geopolitical tensions, either of which could spark renewed interest in risk assets and push bitcoin towards retesting its all-time high.” Expectations around an eventual Fed interest rate cut have been built up by crypto traders and influencers on social media. Two Fed officials, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Austan Goolsbee, have this week joined Fed governor Christopher Waller admitting it may be time to lower interest rates. “It is time to consider adjusting the policy rate,” Bowman told a gathering held in Prague, it was reported by Reuters, while Goolsbee reportedly said that Trump's trade tariffs have “not been what people feared." Last week, Waller has said he doesn't expect Trump's tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article was co-authored by India Tisbury, Solicitor Apprentice. Developed in collaboration with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the initiative aims to strike a balance between supporting good practice and enabling innovation, while also safeguarding privacy. We consider the impact of this announcement for regulated firms. Despite previous joint efforts between the FCA and ICO to encourage responsible AI adoption, current guidance for firms remains scarce, leaving many uncertain about where they stand. In contrast, the FCA has so far issued only high-level statements and exploratory discussion papers, outlining firms' potential responsibilities when deploying such technologies, but offering no practical tools or implementation frameworks. This lack of comprehensive guidance leaves firms in a difficult position, potentially criticised for not using AI where it could have prevented harm, yet equally exposed to liability if AI adoption results in loss. This regulatory ambiguity creates a no-win scenario the FCA now appears ready to address. Following a roundtable held with industry leaders in May 2025, the FCA has announced that it will develop a statutory Code of Practice for firms developing or deploying AI and automated decision-making systems, a move aimed at setting clearer expectations and reducing regulatory uncertainty. Alongside this, the FCA is ramping up its AI Lab initiative, which will help firms to develop, test, and evaluate AI technologies in a controlled and supervised setting. The FCA's proposals mark a shift from abstract principles to practical support for firms dealing with AI implementation and a Code of Practice will be welcome news to many. The FCA's AI Lab gives firms the opportunity to test and refine AI tools in a controlled environment, helping to identify potential risks and ensure systems are robust before deployment at scale. AI is a complex beast, but something we all have to embrace. It is not surprising that uncertainty and lack of familiarity are (according to the FCA) the main factors causing industry hesitation. There are, of course, benefits to AI, but these must be balanced with the risks. For example, uncertainty and lack of familiarity could lead to an increase in claims. As we have explained previously, if a professional blindly follows AI recommendations and / or findings, without scrutinising what is being said, they risk overreliance, putting them at risk of claims. There is also the chance that many professional indemnity policies do not explicitly cover AI and so professionals are exposing themselves to coverage arguments. We anticipate the Code of Practice will be published later this year. We await with interest to see just how far the FCA's code of practice will go, how it might help or hinder AI usage, and what the impact will be for firms using AI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what exactly are NFTs, and why are people spending millions on pixelated images, funky animations, or even tweets? Well, to really get why NFTs are more than just a flashy trend, it helps to take a step back and dive into the origin of NFTs. Understanding where NFTs come from isn't just a history lesson—it's like unlocking a secret door to how digital art, ownership, and creativity have been reshaped by the vibrant world of crypto culture. Knowing their roots gives you a clearer picture of why NFTs have sparked a whole new art movement, fueled by community, technology, and a dash of internet magic. NFT stands for non-fungible token, which sounds fancy but is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. “Non-fungible” basically means something unique—one of a kind. At the heart of NFTs is the blockchain, a secure and shared digital ledger spread across thousands (or even millions) of computers worldwide. When you buy or sell an NFT, the blockchain updates this “digital notebook,” proving you own that unique digital item. To understand the origin of NFTs, we need to rewind to the early days of crypto culture—when it wasn't just about digital money, but about big ideas like decentralization and digital ownership. Decentralization means no single group or company controls the network. Instead, power is spread across many people. This idea excited internet rebels who wanted to take control away from banks and governments. Digital ownership was the dream of owning something online that only you could claim—something rare, special, and truly yours. These projects proved that digital art and collectibles could be more than just files; they could be unique, tradable assets with real value. Much of the early NFT magic happened in digital hangouts like: Artists, coders, and collectors shared ideas, inspired each other, and pushed the boundaries of what NFTs could be. So, while NFTs might look like a flashy new trend today, their origin lies in a passionate community that believed in a new way to own and share digital art. The origin of NFTs as art began with a few pioneering projects that showed digital artwork could be rare, valuable, and collectible, just like a Picasso or a Banksy—except online, and sometimes animated. Before NFT art made headlines at Christie's auctions, there were a few trailblazing projects that turned heads: These projects helped shift NFTs from tech novelty to full-blown creative outlet. In the traditional art world, artists often have to go through galleries, agents, or auction houses to sell their work—and those middlemen take a big cut. Now artists could mint (i.e., create) an NFT of their work, upload it to a marketplace like Foundation, OpenSea, or Rarible, and sell it directly to collectors with a few clicks. Many platforms let artists earn royalties every time their NFT is resold, giving creators ongoing income—a major win that doesn't exist in most physical art sales. Before NFTs, digital art had one big problem: anyone could right-click, save, and claim it as their own. There wasn't a clear way to prove who created it, who bought it, or whether a version was “authentic.” NFTs flipped the script by using blockchain tech to: With that, artists finally had a way to make digital art feel just as “real” and exclusive as anything hanging in a museum. So while the origin of NFTs may have started in code and crypto chats, their evolution into a new form of art was a wild and wonderful leap—powered by innovation, a whole lot of memes, and a creative rebellion against the old way of doing things. By the time NFTs were starting to feel like real art, things didn't just grow—they exploded. What began as a niche corner of crypto culture quickly snowballed into global headlines, eye-popping price tags, and celebrities minting cartoon apes like it was the new red carpet look. This boom phase is when the origin of NFTs went from underground tech to full-blown pop culture moment. Behind every viral NFT sale was a platform that helped make it possible. These online marketplaces are the art galleries, auction houses, and community hubs of the NFT world—all rolled into one. These platforms didn't just make NFTs easy to buy and sell—they made them feel legit. With auction timers, trending tabs, and slick interfaces, they helped transform crypto art from “weird internet thing” to “I need this on my digital wall now.” And while this explosion built on the quiet groundwork laid in the early origin of NFTs, it also marked a moment when the entire world woke up and realized: oh, this isn't just hype. To really understand what made NFTs feel different—and why they became more than just digital files with price tags—you've got to look at the culture that built them. The origin of NFTs wasn't just about technology. A movement that blended internet weirdness, creative rebellion, and crypto ideals into something totally new. In the old-school art world, a few gatekeepers decided who got shown in galleries or bought at auctions. But crypto culture had no interest in that. Instead, it championed community-driven innovation, where artists and collectors hung out in the same Discord channels, collaborated on drops, and helped each other build. One big idea kept pumping through it all: decentralization. That's just a fancy way of saying no central authority gets to make all the rules. From laser-eyed frogs to pixelated punks, internet culture didn't just inspire NFT art—it became the art. The origin of NFTs may have started with a few devs and artists tinkering with token standards, but the culture that followed? It turned the NFT space into a global gallery where internet jokes, social movements, and blockchain dreams collided in glorious, pixelated harmony. And not just any flavor—think neon nacho cheese with a side of laser-eyed cats. It was fueled by wild ideas, tight-knit communities, and a deep love for the chaotic beauty of the internet. NFTs weren't created in corporate boardrooms—they were born in Discord servers, Twitter threads, and late-night Zoom calls. It was like an indie music scene meets a startup ecosystem, except instead of guitars and pitch decks, people were trading generative skulls, animated JPEGs, and pixelated wizards. At the heart of it all was a big, rebellious idea: decentralization. That meant no one person, company, or institution got to decide what art mattered or who could participate. Crypto culture has never taken itself too seriously. The same crowd that invested in DeFi and debated tokenomics also dropped ETH on pixelated rocks and rainbow-haired apes. It just has to mean something—to someone, somewhere on the chain. Suddenly, galleries, auction houses, and legacy creatives had to reckon with pixelated punks selling for millions, GIFs being treated like Rembrandts, and artists minting wealth without ever setting foot in a gallery. One of the most beautiful things NFTs did? It was the art world's version of “We're not waiting to be discovered—we're uploading our own spotlight.” Of course, not all was pixel-perfect in paradise. And yeah, scams, rug pulls, and copy-minting didn't help the rep. For every heartfelt creator making magic, there was someone flipping derivatives of derivatives or trying to sell a stolen image. But here's the twist: all art movements face backlash at first. So whether you love them or love to roast them, one thing's clear: the origin of NFTs didn't just create a new art format—it lit a fire under an entire industry. And that flame's still burning, one mint at a time. From quirky blockchain experiments to headline-grabbing art sales, the origin of NFTs has sparked a global creative movement that blends tech, culture, and pure imagination. What began in crypto circles is now reshaping how we think about art, ownership, and expression. NFTs gave artists a new way to share and sell their work, let collectors become part of the story, and invited the internet's chaotic energy into the creative world. They're not just code or collectibles—they're digital artifacts of a new cultural era. Whether you're here to collect, create, or just explore, the NFT space is open, weird, and waiting for your curiosity.

For most of its 18-year history, Semler Scientific marketed a single medical product that became a popular way for top Medicare insurers like UnitedHealth Group to detect artery blockages in older Americans. But in its most recent earnings call, the device maker's focus on artery health gave way to a different strategy: “We are a bitcoin-first company,” Eric Semler, the company's chairman, declared in announcing a large purchase of the cryptocurrency. Semler's sudden shift toward digital currency speculation suggests that its long-running partnership with major health insurers was driven not by science or an enduring commitment to better health care, but by a singular desire to reach into a multibillion-dollar pot of federal money. Together, these companies had pledged to use Semler's device, called QuantaFlo, to detect artery disease early and head off its worst effects, such as amputation and untimely death. But as the money began to dry up, records and interviews show, so did their quest to track down the disease in communities nationwide.
