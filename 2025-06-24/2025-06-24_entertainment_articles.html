'Harold & Kumar' Getting New Sequel as 'Cobra Kai' Creators Ink Deal to Write, Direct (Exclusive) 'Karate Kid: Legends' Gets Kicked Around by 'Lilo & Stitch,' 'Mission: Impossible' With Soft $21M Box Office Opening Kove's role in that film as Kreese, reprised in its two hit sequels, instantly made him one of the iconic villains of the 1980s. “When Alicia did this, Martin Kove suddenly grabbed her arm and bit her upper arm so hard it nearly drew blood, and she yelled out in pain. He did not think it was a big deal, the report states. They told him how Martin Kove “exploded on them, saying something to the effect of how dare they confront him, and he did not do anything wrong.” When informed by his former co-star that what he did to her was illegal, Kove brushed it off, saying he was just “messing around.” His attitude sharply shifted after the officer explained the potential consequences of his actions, which amounted to assault. She told him that she did not want to press charges against Kove but did want to ensure that the assault was documented in case Kove's behavior continues. She and her husband then provided handwritten statements on the incident. Kove was then escorted, along with his son, out of the convention. Emails sent to Kove's talent agent and manager by THR on Tuesday seeking comment were not immediately returned.

The “Phoenician Scheme” actor has long voiced his aversion to celebrity, but the star is now revealing that he turned down a role in “Harry Potter” prequel franchise “Fantastic Beasts” because of it. But also, I did sort of make a conscientious choice to limit my exposure a little bit, or just try and be a little more in control of it,” Cera said during the “Louis Theroux Podcast”.

Jude Law plays a young Albus Dumbledore who enlists his help to defeat Gellert Grindelwald, as played by Johnny Depp and later Mads Mikkelsen for the third film amid Depp's firing. Law said in 2024 that the other franchise installments are most likely “on hold.” “But if a franchise came along now and seemed interesting, I don't think on the grounds of it being a franchise I would storm out of the office or anything.” Cera previously told The Guardian that by age 19, he contemplated stepping away from Hollywood for good due to his “overwhelming” rise to fame after “Juno” and “Superbad,” both of which were released in 2007. “I didn't know how to handle walking down the street,” Cera said. Cera even turned down hosting “Saturday Night Live” in an effort to tame his celeb status. “There was a point where I wanted to stop taking jobs that would make me more famous,” the actor said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DDG is asking a judge for permission to visit the son he shares with Halle Bailey in Rome, where the 25-year-old singer and actress is filming a movie and has sole custody of the child amid domestic violence claims against her rapper ex-boyfriend. A lawyer for DDG (Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr.) made the request during a Tuesday (June 24) hearing in Los Angeles court, where Bailey won temporary sole custody of their 18-month-old son, Halo, last month after accusing the 27-year-old Twitch rapper of physically attacking her multiple times in the child's presence. Bailey now has Halo with her in Rome for two months while she films a movie. A lawyer for Bailey, Jeremy Lane, responded that he's fine with DDG seeing Halo but wants the visits to be supervised by a professional monitor rather than the rapper's mother. Lane said DDG's mom has a history of “enabling” his alleged abusive behavior, including incessant posting on social media about Bailey and Halo. The judge said she thinks it's “reasonable” for DDG to visit Halo in Italy, but that she'd require an independent monitor due to Bailey's concerns. The judge also said that if these visits are permitted, she'll put in place an order barring DDG from posting about the child on social media during that timeframe. DDG denies Bailey's domestic violence claims and has filed a competing custody case of his own, claiming Bailey is actually the abuser in their relationship and has repeatedly threatened self-harm as a means of emotional manipulation. Bailey says DDG is exaggerating and that while she has struggled with thoughts of self-harm in the past, her mental health is completely under control. Bailey has been awarded sole custody of Halo while the case plays out. A final custody arrangement for the child will be determined after a full hearing on the matter, which is currently on track to take place in late July in Los Angeles family court.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A whistleblower complaint against Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove accuses the Trump administration official of instructing members of the Justice Department to ignore court orders that could have interfered with plans to transfer several planes of undocumented migrants to prisons in El Salvador. Reuveni represented the DOJ in three cases related to the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigration, and was fired after admitting in court — where he is required to tell the truth under questioning from a judge — that in April the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man residing in Maryland who had a protective court order barring his removal to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, along with hundreds of others, was sent to CECOT, a notorious maximum-security prison and propaganda production center built by El Salvador's authoritarian President Nayinb Bukele, a strauch Trump supporter. On March 15 — during a hearing over a restraining order against the deportations — Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign was asked by D.C. District Judge James Boasberg if he knew of plans to conduct removals under the Alien Enemies act “in the next 24 or 48 hours.” But according to Reuveni's complaint, Ensign was present at a meeting that took place the day before in which Bove informed high-ranking DOJ officials that “the AEA proclamation would soon be signed and that one or more planes containing individuals subject to the AEA would be taking off over the weekend — meaning Saturday, March 15 and Sunday, March 16.” Trump's Admin Is Policing Foreign Students' Social Media for ‘Political Activism' Shakira Says Being an Immigrant Under Trump ‘Means Living in Constant Fear' Reuveni — monitoring the hearing through a public line — texted his supervisor, Deputy Director August Flentje, a reference to Bove's “fuck you” comment, to which Flentje “acknowledged Bove's comment with a joke referencing the possibility that either he or Mr. Reuveni could be fired, impliedly for reporting up their chain of command concerns that a court order had been violated.” Reuveni's complaint alleges that he was told by both Flentje and Ensign that “the government was not going to answer the court's questions about anything that happened before 7:26 p.m. on March 15, and so not to provide information about when the flights took off.” Reuveni was put on administrative leave the next day, and fired within a week. On Wednesday, Bove will face the Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing discussing his nomination to serve as United State circuit judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The general consensus is that Pedro Pascal wasn't in the wrong for referring to J.K. Rowling‘s relentless spewing of anti-trans rhetoric as “heinous loser behavior” earlier this year. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, his own sister Javiera Balmaceda backed his stance, saying, “But it is heinous loser behavior. And he said that as the older brother to someone, saying that our little sister doesn't exist.” Pascal, whose sister Lux Pascal came out as trans in 2021, told the magazine that his drive to defend goes deeper than just family. It's a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen, and people will actually be protected. Pascal added that he felt for a moment like “that kid that got sent to the principal's office a lot for behavioral issues in public schools in Texas, feeling scared and thinking, What'd I do?” But the principle of his stance outweighed any external anxiety that might have accompanied the online spat.

Sherman's death was announced Tuesday by his second wife, Brigitte Poublon. It was revealed in March that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. “Bobby left this world holding my hand — just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. The blue-eyed, brown-haired Sherman had made his acting debut as a kidnapped son of a millionaire businessman on a 1965 episode of ABC's Honey West, then played a singing surfer in the mold of Frankie Avalon on NBC's The Monkees in 1967 before landing on Here Come the Brides. Sherman's siblings on the series were played by Robert Brown and future Starsky & Hutch star David Soul, and his character enjoyed a romance with Candy Pruitt (Bridget Hanley). “We had a lot of Bobby shows,” executive producer Bob Claver said in Jonathan Etter's 2015 book, Gangway, Lord! Bobby had a solid core of people that liked him, as they should have. “I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening [concerts] Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again,” he told The Washington Post in 1998. In March 1971, Sherman guest-starred on an episode of ABC's The Partridge Family that served as a back-door pilot for his new series, Getting Together, in which he played a struggling songwriter. Up against CBS' All in the Family, it lasted just 14 episodes before being canceled. More recently, Sherman worked as an emergency medical technician who trained paramedics in CPR and first aid at the Los Angeles Police Academy. “There's not a better feeling in the world than when you're responsible for saving someone's life,” he said. “It's real life — you can't say, ‘Take two.' Sherman played guitar, piano, trumpet, trombone, French horn and drums while growing up, practicing in the soundproof room at home that his dad had built for him. After graduating from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys in 1961, Sherman was studying child psychology at Pierce College when a girlfriend took him to a cast party for The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). With Mineo's help, he recorded a song, then auditioned for Shindig! On Here Come the Brides, on which future Brian's Song screenwriter William Blinn served as head writer, Sherman scored high marks for his acting, especially when it came to his stammering. and [have them] be uncomfortable, but he didn't do that.” In 1986, he played a former musician who lives next door to a Latino family led by Reni Santoni in the USA sitcom Sanchez of Bel Air, but that show didn't last long. Sherman's autobiography, Still Remembering You, was published in 1996. Two years later, he returned to the concert stage after 25 years away to take part in a “Teen Idol Tour” with Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits and Davy Jones of The Monkees. In 1994, Dick Clark asked Sherman what motivated him to become an EMT. “When my two sons, Christopher and Tyler, were growing up, I had visions of them falling out of trees and off bikes, and I wanted to be prepared for any emergency, so I took first aid and just fell in love with it,” he said. In his spare time, he rode along on rescue calls with fire department paramedics. “On one call in Northridge, we were working on a hemorrhaging woman who had passed out,” Sherman told the Los Angeles Times in 1993. Finally, he said, ‘Look, honey, it's Bobby Sherman!' She said, ‘Oh great, I must look a mess!' I told her not to worry, she looked fine.” Survivors also include his sons and six grandchildren. Sherman was married to Patti Carnel from 1971 until their 1979 divorce.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. What is the difference between sound and noise? The brains of hearing people normally do a pretty good job distinguishing between the sounds we want to pay attention to and all of the less important environmental noises all around us — and when you're on a video call and there's a dog barking or a truck beeping as it backs up, Zoom arguably does an even better job filtering those out. But when director Shoshannah Stern got sound designer Bonnie Wild to try on her hearing aids, what was striking to Wild was that, even as everything she heard was boosted, it also became tangled together. Stern and Wild were working on a sequence in Stern's new documentary “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore,” which traces Matlin's career as an actor, advocate for captions and deaf accessibility, and the many ways in which the deaf community has been able to spread a slightly better understanding to the hearing world over the course of Matlin's public life. Related Stories Michael Cera Turned Down a ‘Fantastic Beasts' Meeting: I Didn't Want to Be ‘Too Famous' Seth Rogen Auditioned for Controversial ‘Gigli' Role: ‘I Saw Myself at the Oscars' If I Got It, but the Tape Would ‘End My Career' Today So in a section of the film about Matlin's family and early life growing up in an otherwise hearing family, the documentary set up a family dinner with Matlin and her two brothers and their families. But Stern and Wild adjusted the sound so that hearing audiences would experience it from as close to Matlin's point of view as our current suite of editing filters and tools can get them. Sound is the process where there's understanding of meaning, [while with] noise, there's no meaning embedded in that. So when I use hearing aids, and Marlee uses hearing aids as well, I hear most things, right? Wild's sound design mimics this throughout the sequence — forcing hearing audiences to try to sort out everything between an auditory hum, the crinkle of a water bottle, little bits of words with mouth sounds, and everything making noise as it's touched, scraped across the floor, or shuffled around as people move through the kitchen. “Hearing families never intend to isolate or exclude the deaf child. You can't understand this process until you walk in their shoes to understand what that's really like.” Giving all audiences a visceral understanding of what it's like to miss cues and, completely unintentionally, become isolated within a larger group conversation is an important touchstone for where “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” goes in telling Matlin's story, not only how her early experiences shaped her but the things she's still striving to build in her life and career. To accomplish that, Wild did careful surgery on the audience the documentary team shot on the day, moving syllables of words around and forcing hearing audiences to try to piece words that don't actually sound like words together. “Bonnie was like, ‘Yeah, I think we can do that,'” Stern said. Adding to the audio trickery, the documentary received a grant to work with Dolby Atmos and Wild used it for the exact opposite of the kind of precise spatial audio sculpting that has been getting so much creative use in films like “Nope” and “28 Days Later.” Wild moved all of the sounds around so that they would be impossible to localize. “And sometimes the hearing aids decide what is most important, so in the scene, that plastic crunching sound you hear — sometimes my hearing aid zooms in on that kind of sound and amplifies it, and the voices are kind of diminished because the hearing aid decided that's less important. So Stern and Wild made a big mess of the sound, throwing it everywhere so it's impossible to get a sense of diction — even the captions get in on the fun, coming in all over the frame in a very legible, but unhelpful way. “It was a really cool experience working with Bonnie,” Stern said. “I don't think you can fully understand her story until you understand how she experiences the world,” Stern said. If it was true for her, then what do you think it's like for every other deaf person in the world who is not an Oscar-winning actress?” “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” is now playing in theaters.

Kove “exploded on them, saying something to the effect of how dare they confront him” (per Variety), at which point Hannah-Kim got an on-site law enforcement officer involved. The officer noted in the report that Hannah-Kim “had a very noticeable bite mark on her arm that was already turning blue and bruising.” Kove allegedly “admitted to biting” his co-star but “said he did it out of jest.” Hannah-Kim played another antagonist on Cobra Kai, Kim Da-Eun, who teams up with Kreese in the sixth season. Kove apparently told the officer at Summer Con he “thought he was being funny, and they play fight all the time on the set of Cobra Kai, and he did not think it was a big deal.” Hannah-Kim reportedly expressed to Kove that she was upset and physically hurt by his actions, which both she and the officer informed him were illegal; Kove allegedly “said that he did not mean for it to be perceived as illegal” and reiterated that “he was just messing around.” Neither actor has made any further public comment on the incident.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramore drummer Zac Farro has announced his debut solo album under his own name: Operator is out July 18 via Congrats. “‘My My' is a personal song about witnessing a loved one try to let go of someone they care for deeply,” explained Farro. This song holds a lot of weight and captures those moments of reflection and processing that run throughout the album.” After years of recording music under the moniker Halfnoise, Farro decided to record a new album under his own name after exploring “deeply personal” subjects in a new batch of songs, such as family issues, anxieties, and communication breakdowns. Operator spans nine songs, all of which were written by Farro. Farro started the band Halfnoise mere days after he originally departed Paramore in 2010. His band has gone on to release five albums since then, the most recent of which, City Talk, came out in 2023. Although Farro eventually rejoined Paramore as a permanent member, in 2016, Halfnoise is still active to this day. As for Paramore, their sixth album, This Is Why, came out in 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, Thom Yorke finally released a studio version of his new song “Dialing In,” which he's been playing live for over five years, as part of the soundtrack for the upcoming Apple TV+ series Smoke. To bring the track to life with its own visuals, the Radiohead frontman has now tapped Weirdcore—his frequent collaborator with the Smile—to whip up a surreal music video with Smoke star Taron Egerton, in which scenes from the show melt together like burning celluloid. The earliest live performance of “Dialing In” by Yorke dates back to 2019, although it used to go by the name “Gawpers” back then. According to a press release for Smoke, the previously unreleased track has since been “fine-tuned to underscore the show's themes even further.” Smoke follows a detective (played by Jurnee Smollett) and an arson investigator (played by Taron Egerton) who are trying to catch a pair of serial arsonists wreaking fiery havoc across the Pacific Northwest. The Apple TV+ series premieres this Friday, June 27. Yorke recently released Tall Tales, his new collaborative album with electronic producer Mark Pritchard. As for Yorke's work in the Smile, the band released two albums last year: Wall of Eyes and Cutouts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diego Luna let the president know exactly how he felt about his draconian immigration policy when he took over as a guest host on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “Tonight, I want to address an important issue that is happening here in Los Angeles and all around the United States,” the Andor actor said in his opening monologue. “With everything going on in this country around immigration and authoritarian policies of Donald Trump, it is no small thing that a Mexican is hosting such an important show. But, he continued, “the people that lifted me up were mostly people that had left their countries to find a new life, or the sons and daughters of immigrants that had come here in order to work and build a healthy, enjoyable and dignified life, away from their place of origin.” “A movement of that scale, that's not natural, not unless something is very, very wrong in the place you are coming from,” Luna continued. California Governor Gavin Newsom is now sparring with Trump over this decision in court. “There are a lot of lies flying around about immigrants, but I'm sure you have more than one story that can attest to the contrary. Immigrants need to know that their struggle is yours as well.” PASTELate Night Last Week: John Oliver Talks AI Slop, KeKe Palmer Crushes Tonight Show Medley, and More One of the U.S. Pilots Who Bombed Iran Was a Woman SPLINTERDemocratic Sex Pests Stick Together in New York Mayoral Race Diego Luna rebukes Trump's immigration policies in first Jimmy Kimmel guest host monologue Johnny Knoxville to test human capacity for donkey urine as host of Fear Factor reboot Undeterred by past failures, Paramount continues screwing up its South Park deal</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giving everyone a masterclass in grace, Simone Ashley proudly stepped out to celebrate “F1: The Movie” on Monday (June 23). Simone's move depicts a graceful show of support for the project and her castmates. Ashley had previously filmed scenes for F1, but does not have any speaking lines in the finished movie. Director Joseph Kosinski recently explained the change, telling People: “It happens on every film, where you have to shoot more than you can use. There were two or three storylines that ultimately didn't make it into the final cut. Ashley had been seen on set and was also photographed at a Miami promotional event for F1, appearing with co-star Kerry Condon and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The “Bridgerton” star doesn't believe in holding grudges. Speaking to ELLE earlier this month, Ashley said: “I have a very small part, but I'm grateful to be in that movie… I got to experience many Grand Prix. Director Kosinski, 51, also told Entertainment Tonight that he informed Ashley that her scenes would not appear in the final cut, and praised her professionalism and talent. Ashley previously told Who What Wear that her role in F1 had been in the works long before her breakout on “Bridgerton”. Though her scenes didn't make it to the screen, Simone Ashley's grace and support at the London premiere spoke volumes. The film, written by Ehren Kruger and produced in collaboration with real F1 stars including Lewis Hamilton, also features Damson Idris, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, Javier Bardem, Shea Whigham, and more. “F1: The Movie” opens in theaters nationwide on June 27.</p>

Find out why Napier called it the “absolute scariest thing.” “I have two warnings and one piece of advice for first-time parents, things that were never told to me,” he explained, including what he calls the “scariest thing.” I was trying to let Erin sleep, sitting on the couch holding Helen, and as long as I kept moving, she wouldn't cry.” Napier also admitted he didn't know too much about women's hormones. “Your wife has nine months of the craziest hormonal swings ever while she's pregnant — but then in my mind, it was like, ‘Alright, baby's here, hormone changes are over!' He shared, “I was unprepared for the next three to six months of hormonal changes that were going on. As for his advice, Napier offered some solid tips about giving yourself grace when you have a baby. “Then the advice is to just be gentle with each other,” he said. “Everyone — including the baby — is going to be out of whack.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Jay-Z-founded entertainment juggernaut says in a new court filing that its role as Fat Joe's management company shouldn't involve it in the bombshell racketeering case. Roc Nation wants out of an explosive new lawsuit accusing Fat Joe of victimizing his longtime hypeman via a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, saying it's “nonsensical” to suggest the rapper's management company was involved in any of the scandalous behavior alleged in the case. Jay-Z's entertainment company was among a slew of people and companies named last week in Terrance “T.A.” Dixon's lawsuit against Fat Joe (Joseph Cartagena). The claims in Dixon's Thursday (June 19) complaint, which Fat Joe has fiercely denied and characterized as extortion, are framed as a racketeering enterprise abetted by Roc Nation and other outside entities. “Yet, according to plaintiff, the fact that Roc Nation had a business relationship with Mr. Cartagena somehow makes Roc Nation part of a RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] enterprise, a participant in sex trafficking, and an aider-and-abettor of Mr. Cartagena's alleged conduct. Dixon's lawsuit claimed the management company was responsible for his withheld wages, but Spiro says Roc Nation only manages Fat Joe's catalog, publishing rights and intellectual property. “How Roc Nation supposedly knew of this deplorable alleged conduct is a mystery,” writes Spiro. “He does not assert how Roc Nation's management of Mr. Cartagena's music business gave it insight into how much plaintiff should have been paid, what he was paid, or any venture to deprive him of adequate compensation.” Reached for comment on Monday, Dixon's attorney Tyrone Blackburn tells Billboard he will oppose Roc Nation's motion to be dismissed from the case. “The plaintiff has no personal animosity towards Roc Nation or its leadership.” Two months ago, Fat Joe filed a lawsuit accusing the former hypeman and his attorney of trying to extract a settlement with “wholly fabricated” and “grotesque” claims of pedophilia. In a statement after Dixon filed his own lawsuit last week, Fat Joe's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said they'll continue to fight the claims and that “law enforcement is aware of the extortionate demand at the heart of this scheme.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
