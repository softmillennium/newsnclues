“I didn't like the fact that Israel unloaded right after we made the deal,” a frustrated Trump said.

President Donald Trump laid into Israeli leaders for bombarding Iran right after he announced a ceasefire deal between the warring states on Tuesday, levying a rare criticism of Israel even after bombing Iran on its behalf.

Speaking in remarks to the press before boarding a plane to a NATO summit, Trump expressed frustration that Israel, in its usual fashion, unleashed a barrage of strikes on Iran shortly after he unceremoniously announced a ceasefire deal between the two countries that was to take effect hours later.

These were some of the most intense bombings of the war thus far, journalists in Tehran reported. Iran struck back, with initial reports from Iranian officials saying that there was no deal; Iranian officials later confirmed the deal but said they reserved the right to fight back if Israel continued striking.

“I didn't like the fact that Israel unloaded right after we made the deal. I didn't like the fact that the retaliation [from Iran] was very strong, but in all fairness, Israel unloaded a lot, and now I hear Israel just went out because they felt there was — violated by one rocket that didn't land anywhere,” said an incensed Trump on Tuesday morning.

He went on to say that the ceasefire deal is still standing, but that both Israel and Iran have violated the ceasefire. Israel did order strikes on Iran after the ceasefire went into effect on Tuesday, accusing Iran of violating the deal, but the attacks appeared to be simmering down.

Just hours before his remarks to the press, the president had fired off numerous posts on Truth Social, saying, “ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION.”

Trump's ire seemed specifically targeted at Israel on Tuesday morning. Even after a reporter asked a question about Iran violating the ceasefire deal, he specifically brought up his frustration with Israel again unprompted.

“It's true, they violated, but Israel violated too. Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. When I say, ‘okay, now you have 12 hours,' you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them,” Trump said.

“So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning,” he went on.

“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” the president concluded.

Trump also said that he isn't interested in pursuing regime change in Iran, marking a sharp turn from just 24 hours before, when he said he supported it in a post on Truth Social. Seemingly the only thing that changed between then and Tuesday is Iran's strike on an U.S. air base in Qatar — which Trump struck an almost jovial tone toward, even thanking Iran for giving the U.S. prior notice of the strike to minimize casualties.

The president reportedly spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday as well, with Netanyahu's office later putting out a statement saying that it “refrained from further strikes” after the call, and Trump saying Israel “had achieved all the objectives of the war.”

The US has turned to Qatar to mediate between Iran and Israel, despite one of the parties firing missiles at the tiny but staggeringly rich nation

Middle East crisis – live updates

Caught in the crossfire, Qatar on Monday night found itself in the unusual position of being asked by the US to mediate to end a war where one of the two parties was firing missiles at it. But then there are few countries as multifaceted as Qatar, or few conflicts quite as tangled as the Iran-Israel war.

It seems Monday's heavily signalled Iranian attack on Qatar's 60-acre Al Udeid airbase, the largest US military facility in the Middle East, may even have become the opening to resume diplomacy. The attack, which caused no casualties, cleared the ground for Donald Trump and Qatar to work together to secure the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran. It once again highlights Qatar's role as professional mediator – a bespoke service this tiny but massively wealthy country makes available from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Gaza.

Ever since Israel launched its attack on Iran 12 days ago, Qatar has been at the forefront of the countries denouncing it, saying it considered the assault “a blatant violation of Iran's sovereignty and security, as well as a clear breach of international law”.

But Qatar also, free of charge, houses the vast Al Udeid airbase used by the US, one of the protagonists in the war against Iran. Over the years it is estimated Qatar has spent $8bn on the infrastructure of the base, an investment that buys it American goodwill despite the state's politics being very different from Trump's “America first”.

Iran's relations with Qatar have also been on a steady upward curve, especially since Iran acted as a friend of Qatar when the state was being boycotted by its Gulf allies.

Iran's Monday night missile salvo was a symbolic, almost courteous, attack on the US airbase in response to American strikes on its nuclear facilities. Trump afterwards thanked Iran for giving advance warning and time for the airbase to be cleared.

Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi, Qatar's foreign minister, issued a “strong condemnation” of the attack, and told the Iranian ambassador, Ali Salehabadi, that Qatar had a right to respond, yet at the same time Qatar's deputy foreign minister, Majed al-Ansari, balanced a condemnation of Iran's actions by pointing out that Qatar had been one of the first countries to warn against the dangers of Israeli escalation in the region.

For its part, Iran's supreme national security council said it “remains committed to maintaining and continuing warm and historic relations” with Qatar. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, insisted Tehran would not allow US and Israeli “criminal aggressions and malign policies” to create divisions between it and “brotherly” regional states. Rarely has such an intrusion of another country's sovereignty been accompanied by so much regret.

Indeed almost as soon as the near performative bombs were fended off by Qatar's air defences, Qatar's emir was being called by Trump to see if he could have the conversation required with the Iranians to secure their agreement to a ceasefire. Iran's position since the conflict started has been that the onus lies with Israel to stop striking, but if Trump delivered an Israeli ceasefire Tehran would respond, Qatar was told.

Qatar's value to the region as the one country that can talk to America's greatest enemies – whether the Taliban, Hamas or Iran – came good again.

Qatar has also worked the White House well, not just by providing Trump with a converted new Air Force One, but by being trusted by Democrats and Republicans alike.

Its value was underscored by Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy, in his recent interview with Tucker Carlson. Witkoff showered praise on Qatar, saying “they're criticised for not being well motivated. It's preposterous. They are well motivated. They're good, decent people. What they want is a mediation that's effective, that gets to a peace goal. And why? Because they're a small nation and they want to be acknowledged as a peacemaker.”

Asked if they were Iran's agents, Witkoff responded “Look, they're a Muslim nation. In the past, they've had some views that are a little bit more radical, but it's moderated quite a bit. They pay for every dollar of the airbase. They don't have their hand out for a thing. There is nothing that the United States has to fund with regard to that airbase. That's pretty unusual.”

Jury awarded $500,000 to widow and estate of the police officer who killed himself nine days after the January 6 riot

A federal jury on Monday awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who killed himself nine days after he helped defend the US Capitol from the mob that attacked on January 6, 2021, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the uprising.

The eight-member jury ordered the man, 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, to pay $380,000 in punitive damages and $60,000 in compensatory damages to Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Washington DC metropolitan police officer Jeffrey Smith, inside the Capitol. They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering.

The judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith's wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. Federal judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death.

Walls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on the day of the Capitol attack occurred when another attacker threw a pole that struck Smith around his head.

On Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband – an encounter captured on the officer's body camera.

“Erin is grateful to receive some measure of justice,” said one of her attorneys, David P Weber.

Walls-Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is “absolutely ridiculous”.

“No crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer,” he said. “I'm just stunned.”

After the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the parties to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal – and for the sake of “finality”.

“You guys settle,” the judge said, “you can move on with your lives.”

Walls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as “shocking”.

“We're talking about a three-second event,” he told the judge.

“It's not shocking, Mr Hunt,” Reyes replied. “A lot of things can happen in three seconds.”

Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol attack when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the January 6 attack.

Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide.

The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he killed himself. In 2022, the DC police and firefighters' retirement and relief board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty and the injury was the “sole and direct cause of his death”, according to the lawsuit.

Walls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023. But Donald Trump pardoned him in January.

On the first day of his second presidency, which began in January, Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the Capitol attack.

More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes.

Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack.

Erin Smith has applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.

Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) on Monday highlighted Taipei's environmental governance policies, especially those on waste disposal and traffic, at a summit in Paris of world mayors focused on climate change.

The only mayor representing an Asian city at the “Summit of Mayors: From Paris to Belem: 10 Years of Global Action for Climate” held in Paris, Chiang first talked about Taiwan's “keep trash off the ground” program.

The approach keeps streets clean and litter-free by limiting public trash bins, with garbage trucks making scheduled rounds, allowing residents to bring out their trash at designated times for collection, he said.

Taipei also collects a fee per garbage bag, requiring residents to use designated bags that they must buy, while no such rules apply for recycled waste, he said.

Because residents can save money by generating less trash, the policy has reduced household garbage by 65 percent, while the proportion of recycled waste to total waste has risen from 2 percent to 66 percent, he said.

Regarding traffic, Chiang touted the Taipei MRT's daily ridership of 2 million people, calling it one of the most reliable metro systems in the world.

He also highlighted an incentive program he introduced as mayor for the city's YouBike rental system that offers the first 30 minutes of each ride for free, leading one in four residents to switch from driving or riding motorcycles to using the city's bicycles instead.

Chiang also outlined plans to transform the city's Beitou-Shilin Technology Park (北投士林科技園區) into a net zero demonstration zone, featuring low-carbon buildings, a wind corridor layout and sustainable infrastructure.

With Nvidia Corp planning to set up its Taiwan headquarters in the area, the initiative aims to showcase the potential for “green growth.”

The mayor's summit marks the 10-year anniversary of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate.



                                                                                A year-long renovation of Taipei's Bangka Park (艋舺公園) began yesterday, as city workers fenced off the site and cleared out belongings left by homeless residents who had been living there.
Despite protests from displaced residents, a city official defended the government's relocation efforts, saying transitional housing has been offered.
The renovation of the park in Taipei's Wanhua District (萬華), near Longshan Temple (龍山寺), began at 9am yesterday, as about 20 homeless people packed their belongings and left after being asked to move by city personnel.
Among them was a 90-year-old woman surnamed Wang (王), who last week said that she had no plans                                    


TO BE APPEALED:
                                        The environment ministry said coal reduction goals had to be reached within two months, which was against the principle of legitimate expectation                                        The Taipei High Administrative Court on Thursday ruled in favor of the Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau in its administrative litigation against the Ministry of Environment for the rescission of a NT$18 million fine (US$609,570) imposed by the bureau on the Taichung Power Plant in 2019 for alleged excess coal power generation.
The bureau in November 2019 revised what it said was a “slip of the pen” in the text of the operating permit granted to the plant — which is run by Taiwan Power Co (Taipower) — in October 2017.
The permit originally read: “reduce coal use by 40 percent from Jan.                                    



                                                                                China might accelerate its strategic actions toward Taiwan, the South China Sea and across the first island chain, after the US officially entered a military conflict with Iran, as Beijing would perceive Washington as incapable of fighting a two-front war, a military expert said yesterday. 
The US' ongoing conflict with Iran is not merely an act of retaliation or a “delaying tactic,” but a strategic military campaign aimed at dismantling Tehran's nuclear capabilities and reshaping the regional order in the Middle East, said National Defense University distinguished adjunct lecturer Holmes Liao (廖宏祥), former McDonnell Douglas Aerospace representative in Taiwan. 
If                                    


‘SPEY' REACTION: 
                                        Beijing said its Eastern Theater Command ‘organized troops to monitor and guard the entire process' of a Taiwan Strait transit                                        China sent 74 warplanes toward Taiwan between late Thursday and early yesterday, 61 of which crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait.
It was not clear why so many planes were scrambled, said the Ministry of National Defense, which tabulated the flights.
The aircraft were sent in two separate tranches, the ministry said.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday “confirmed and welcomed” a transit by the British Royal Navy's HMS Spey, a River-class offshore patrol vessel, through the Taiwan Strait a day earlier.
The ship's transit “once again [reaffirmed the Strait's] status as international waters,” the foreign ministry said. 
“Such transits by

A ceasefire truce between the two countries appeared to be on shaky ground less than one day after Trump announced it.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

As President Donald Trump announced a deal brokered between Israel and Iran on Monday evening, new polling shows that a plurality of Americans disapproved of his military strikes on Iran last weekend, and that very few voters have confidence that the conflict will not escalate.

The Reuters/Ipsos polling, conducted after Trump ordered the military operation against Iran on Saturday but before he announced a supposed truce between the two sides on Monday, found that only 36 percent of Americans view the U.S. airstrikes positively, while 45 percent said they were opposed to them. Nineteen percent said they were unsure of how they felt.

When asked whether they had concerns about the conflict growing, the answers from respondents were more uniform, with 84 percent saying they were concerned about that possibility and only 15 percent saying they were not. 

Perhaps because of Trump's actions within the conflict, his approval rating reached an all-time low within Reuters/Ipsos polling during his second term in office so far. According to the most recent poll, just 41 percent of Americans approve of his job performance at this time, with 57 percent disapproving, resulting in a net -16-point approval rating. The next-lowest net rating for Trump, at -12 points, was found in a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month.

Despite concerns from most Americans that the conflict would escalate, Trump announced a tepid ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran on Monday evening. 

“CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. 

By Tuesday morning, it was unclear how strong that agreement was, with Trump even acknowledging that fact.

“THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!” Trump wrote in a subsequent post.

As the Israeli military appeared to be conducting more missions, Trump lashed out, demanding that they halt their operations against Iran.

“ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!” Trump wrote. 

Speaking to reporters as he was departing the White House Tuesday morning for a NATO summit at The Hague, Trump condemned both countries for violating the truce he had bragged about brokering less than 24 hours earlier.

“There was one rocket that I guess was fired overboard after the time limit and now Israel is going out. These guys [have] got to calm down,” Trump said.

He then uttered an expletive out of frustration with both countries' failure to abide by his demands.

“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” Trump said.

MOSCOW, June 24. /TASS/. The conflict in Ukraine is heading towards Kiev's unconditional surrender, which will be followed by Russia's diplomatic victory, with Russia deciding the future of Ukraine, former French paratrooper turned military analyst Xavier Moreau told TASS in an interview.

"All conflicts end with diplomacy, even if it is the signing of a document declaring surrender. I believe we are heading towards Kiev's unconditional surrender. Historically, defeat in battle means surrender, and later a peace treaty," he said.

According to the expert, the final say in the settlement will go to Russia. "The terms of the future peace will be decided by powerful states, but the final word on what remains of Ukraine will be Russia's. The conflict will end with Russia's military and then diplomatic victory," the expert concluded.

TEL AVIV, June 24. /TASS/. The Israeli army only attacked a radar system near Tehran in response to two Iranian missile attacks that took place after the introduction of the ceasefire, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reported.

According to its statement, the attack was limited to this one strike. "Pursuant to the conversation between [US] President [Donald] Trump and [Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, Israel has refrained from additional attacks," the office said.

The Israeli side emphasized that the attack retaliated the recent Iranian missile strikes, which Tel Aviv considered a violation of the ceasefire agreements.

"The ceasefire was set for 7:00 a.m. (4:00 a.m. GMT) this morning. At 3:00 a.m. (12:00 a.m. GMT), Israel forcefully attacked in the heart of Tehran, struck regime targets and eliminated hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces personnel. Shortly before the ceasefire was due to take effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which took the lives of four of our citizens in Be'er Sheva. The ceasefire took effect at 7:00 a.m. (4:00 a.m. GMT). At 7:06 a.m. (4:06 a.m. GMT), Iran launched one missile at Israeli territory, and two additional missiles at 10:25 a.m. (7:25 a.m. GMT). These missiles were either intercepted or fell in open areas, and caused neither casualties nor damage. In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar installation near Tehran," the statement said.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had fully agreed to implement the ceasefire agreement about six hours after its announcement, that is about 7:00 a.m. Moscow time (4:00 a.m. GMT). According to the US leader, Tehran will cease fire first, followed by Tel Aviv twelve hours later, and "upon the 24th hour, an official end to the 12-day war will be saluted by the world."

Later, the Israeli army press service said that servicemen had recorded a new missile attack by Iran. According to the military, northern Israel was shelled. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Iran had violated the ceasefire and ordered the servicemen to launch new powerful strikes against Tehran. The Iranian Armed Forces General Staff had previously refuted reports of missile attacks on Israeli territory following the ceasefire. US President Donald Trump got involved in the situation, expressing his unhappiness with both Iran and Israel and urging all sides to seek detente.

The court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries.

The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily lifted a lower court order that had required the Trump administration to give migrants the chance to challenge their deportation to a country other than their nation of origin, clearing the way for resumption of such removals and prompting a strongly worded dissent from the three liberal justices.

The conservative majority behind the ruling did not offer a rationale for the order, but said that the preliminary injunction handed down by a district court judge in April is stayed, pending appeal.

“Totally unexplained Supreme Court ruling on 3rd-country deportations will produce widespread confusion in lower courts. Did the court object to nationwide aspect? Think judges lacked jurisdiction? Something else? Who knows?” wrote Politico's senior legal affairs reporter Josh Gerstein, offering a prediction of what's to come.

Trump administration efforts to deport immigrants to countries they are not from has become one of the most contentious aspects of U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.

In May, the Trump administration put eight men, most of whom are not from South Sudan, on a flight said to be headed to South Sudan, though the flight instead landed in Djibouti. The men have been held in Djibouti since. U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy told Trump administration officials that they “unquestionably” violated a court order he issued in April when it attempted to carry out those third-country deportations to South Sudan.

The Supreme Court's order stays that ruling from Murphy issued in April, which directed the Trump administration not to deport immigrants to countries other than their home countries without giving them adequate notice to raise concerns that they might face danger if sent there.

However, “in an order Monday, Murphy said the eight men in Djibouti remain protected from immediate removal despite the Supreme Court's ruling, referencing another order he had issued last month — separate from the one put on hold by the Supreme Court,” according to ABC News.

In a blistering dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the ruling exposes “thousands to the risk of torture or death” and comes down on the side of the Trump administration even though it had violated the lower court's order. Sotomayor was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson

“The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,” she wrote in her dissent.

“Apparently,” she continued, “the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled. That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.”

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the ruling a victory on Monday. “DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,” she said in a statement. “Fire up the deportation planes.”

“When you think it can't get worse, it does!” said Jill Wine-Banks, an MSNBC legal analyst, in response to the ruling.

Far-right AfD party welcomes ruling in favour of Compact, which sets high bar for any government crackdown

A German federal court has overturned a ban on a magazine classed by the government as rightwing extremist, in a high-profile legal battle seen as pitting efforts by the authorities to protect the democratic order against media freedom.

The federal administrative court said that while Compact, a publication with close ties to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, had produced “anticonstitutional” content, it did “not yet” represent a threat to the state.

“The basic law guarantees even the enemies of the constitution, with faith in the power of free societal debate, freedom of expression and the press,” the presiding judge Ingo Kraft said.

The interior ministry last July outlawed the monthly magazine, as well as the company that publishes it, Compact-Magazin GmbH, and an affiliated media production firm, Conspect Film.

Nancy Faeser, the interior minister at the time, argued that Compact was “the main mouthpiece for the rightwing extremist scene” and fomented “unspeakable” hatred of Jews, Muslims and foreigners while propagating pro-Kremlin views, conspiracy theories and historical revisionism.

Faeser belongs to the Social Democrats, junior partners in the current government under the conservative leader Friedrich Merz, which has also signalled forceful action against rightwing extremists. The interior ministry did not immediately comment on the ruling.

The office for the protection of the constitution (BfV), the domestic intelligence agency, designated Compact-Magazin GmbH in 2021 as confirmed rightwing extremist and placed it under surveillance.

The Leipzig-based federal administrative court, which hears cases challenging association bans, issued a temporary reprieve for Compact last August, finding that the ministry had failed to make the case that the magazine's publishers were credibly agitating to overthrow constitutional democracy.

Tuesday's ruling in favour of a complaint by its editor and chief executive, Jürgen Elsässer, marked the final legal decision in the case and will allow Compact, which was founded in 2010, to resume operations immediately.

During contentious hearings before the court under tight security, Elsässer disputed any seditious intent behind the publication, saying that although it gave a platform to fierce critics of the government, “Compact is not rightwing and certainly not rightwing extremist”.

“Sieg!” (Victory!), Elsässer posted on X after the ruling. He later said he was considering suing the government for damages.

Compact had a circulation of 40,000, while its online video channel reported up to 460,000 page views a post, according to information provided by the court.

The legal victory for the magazine took place against a backdrop of calls to outlaw the AfD, Germany's biggest opposition party since February's general election.

The BfV in May deemed the pro-Russian, anti-immigrant party to be confirmed rightwing extremist and placed it under observation, potentially paving the way for an official ban.

Although some top officials in Merz's right-left governing coalition support such a move, the constitutional as well as political hurdles would be high. The AfD's “extremist” designation is under judicial review.

Björn Höcke, the leader of the party's most radical wing, welcomed Tuesday's ruling in favour of Compact as setting a high bar for any government crackdown. “Instead of going after Islamists, she [Faeser] hunted down harmless critics of the government,” he posted on X.

Elsässer thanked the judges and predicted the ruling would have a chilling effect on any attempt to outlaw the AfD. “If it wasn't possible to ban Compact, it's also impossible to ban the AfD,” he said.

            At least 120 children have been kidnapped by jihadist insurgents in northern Mozambique in recent days, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Tuesday, warning of a rise in abductions in the country's troubled Cabo Delgado province.



            The children are reportedly being used by an Islamic State–linked group known locally as al-Shabab to transport looted goods, perform forced labor, and in some cases serve as child soldiers or be forced into marriage.
    


            Mozambique has been battling the Islamist insurgency in Cabo Delgado since 2017. Government forces have struggled to contain the violence, relying on support from troops sent by Rwanda, South Africa, and other regional partners.
    


            In 2020, the insurgents carried out a wave of attacks in which they beheaded dozens of people, including children. Witnesses have said that children abducted from towns and villages have been used as fighters in subsequent attacks.

            The violence has displaced more than 600,000 people and spilled into neighboring provinces, according to the United Nations. HRW said there had been a resurgence of attacks and child kidnappings in the last two months and called on Mozambique's government to do more to find the children and prevent further abductions.
    


            The problems in Cabo Delgado were largely overshadowed by Mozambique's deadly and long-running post-election protests last year. Cabo Delgado has also been battered by several recent cyclones and hurt by US President Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid.



            The secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Jan Egeland, visited Cabo Delgado this month and described the situation in northern Mozambique as a neglected crisis.
    


            “Climate shocks, increasing violence and spiraling hunger are having a terrible impact on the population,” Egeland said.
    


            The NRC said more than 5 million people faced critical levels of hunger and more than 900,000 people faced emergency hunger conditions.

US president orders Israel to turn around its planes, warning bombing sorties would be ‘major violation'

Middle East crisis – live updates

Donald Trump has reacted furiously after an Israel-Iran ceasefire he had brokered and taken credit for was violated within a few hours, ordering Israel to turn its warplanes around midair and abort their planned bombing sorties, which he warned would be a “major violation”.

Israel claimed Iran had been the first to break the truce, saying it had shot down two ballistic missiles heading for northern Israel at about 10.30am, about two and a half hours after the ceasefire was announced.

Nevertheless, on waking in Washington to the news that his truce had been broken so soon, Trump reserved his greatest rancour for Israel, for the scale of its planned retaliation, but also for the amount of bombs Israeli planes had dropped between agreeing the ceasefire on Monday night and it coming into force at 5am GMT on Tuesday.

“Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen,” he said, in the strongest-worded public rebuke of Israel of any US president in history. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” Trump said.

On his own private online platform, Truth Social, he issued a blunt instruction, writing: “ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!”

After a conversation with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, he returned to the platform to announce: “ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!”

Minutes later, however, explosions were reported by Iranian media around Tehran and in the north of the country.

The US website Axios reported that Netanyahu had told Trump that he could not cancel the strike entirely, and that ultimately “it was decided to significantly scale back the strike, cancel the attack on a large number of targets and strike only one target”. Haaretz reported that the single target was an Iranian radar installation.

Iran denied having broken the truce or launched missiles that Israel claimed to have intercepted mid-morning on Tuesday, but Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered immediate retaliation on Tehran.

Trump had used social media to announce the ceasefire just after 5am GMT on Tuesday, asking the warring parties not to violate it. Both sides carried out an intense exchange of fire before signalling their acceptance, but hours after the declaration it remained unclear if the truce would stick.

The all clear was later sounded in the north of Israel but the country's hardline finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, posted a message on the social media platform X vowing a response, warning: “Tehran will tremble.”

Iranian state media suggested the ceasefire had been “imposed on the enemy” after “four waves of attacks on Israeli-occupied territories”. The Israeli authorities confirmed Iran had fired 20 missiles, and that five Israelis had been killed and more than 22 wounded in the southern city of Beersheba.

Ninety minutes after Trump's announcement, Israel – which began the war with a surprise attack on 13 June – also acknowledged the truce and claimed victory.

In the hours before the declaration of a ceasefire, Israel carried out some of its most intense airstrikes on Tehran yet, residents said.

The Tasnim News Agency said nine Iranians had been killed in the north of the country, while Israel claimed to have struck missile launchers in western Iran and struck dozens of targets in Tehran in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The prime minister's office claimed to have killed hundreds of militants in the Basij, a volunteer force used to suppress internal dissent, and targeted an Iranian nuclear scientist, bringing the toll of assassinations of Iranian scientists to at least 15.

Iranian state media named the scientist killed overnight as Mohammad Reza Seddighi Saber, saying he had been targeted at his parents' residence in Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh in northern Iran. His 17-year-old son was reported to have been killed in a strike on the family home in Tehran several days ago, state television said.

An Iranian social media user in Tehran wrote that the Israeli strikes on the capital city were “intense” in the run-up to the announced ceasefire. “The bombardment tonight in Tehran was extremely intense. For a full hour the explosions wouldn't stop. We are a completely defenseless people,” the user wrote.

After the Israeli government officially accepted the ceasefire, the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said it was also time to end Israel's war in Gaza. “It's time to finish it there too. Bring back the hostages, end the war. Israel needs to start rebuilding,” Lapid said on X. An estimated 56,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over 20 months of Israeli bombardment.

The ceasefire was announced after an Iranian missile launch against a US base in Qatar, in reprisal for American participation in strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday. Iran said it had given advance warning of the missiles to Qatar and there were no reported injuries, suggesting its response was carefully coordinated to allow Tehran and Washington an off-ramp.

Trump advisers privately said they believed Iran would accept the US president's olive branch in order to avoid continued strikes by Israel, and because they had inflicted symbolic retaliation.

The ceasefire announcement also appeared to be an effort to reframe the metrics for success for the US operation, after it was unclear whether the deeply buried Fordow nuclear site had been destroyed.

In a post on social media, Trump said the Iranian sites had been “totally destroyed”. But the UN's nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, said: “At this time, no one, including the [International Atomic Energy Agency], is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.”

Trump advisers tried to suggest it did not matter if Fordow was destroyed because Iran had been forced to the negotiating table – even though that would mark a departure from what Trump said he was aiming for over the weekend.

Still, the actual damage to the nuclear facilities remains an important question in advance of possible talks between the US and Iran – expected to be led by Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff – as it would affect Witkoff's negotiating leverage.

Other senior administration officials claimed victory, including the vice-president, JD Vance, who claimed Iran was “incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it”.

The US attack followed a wave of missile strikes between Israel and Iran, with Israel bombing the notorious Evin prison, and took place after Trump raised the prospect of regime change in Tehran. But as of Monday evening, senior US officials had suggested the Iranian attack on Qatar was designed to avoid a further escalation that could lead to an all-out war which could imperil the Iranian regime.

US president at one point called Benjamin Netanyahu to order him to scale down an Israeli airstrike

Middle East crisis – live updates

The shaky truce between Israel and Iran appeared to be holding on Tuesday evening after an extraordinary day in which a furious Donald Trump at one point personally intervened by calling Benjamin Netanyahu in order to get him to scale down an Israeli airstrike.

In a televised address late on Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister hailed a “historic victory” claiming that Israel had “thwarted Iran's nuclear project,” but it remained unclear whether the deeply buried Fordow nuclear site had been destroyed.

CNN reported that an early US intelligence assessment indicated that the airstrikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities did not destroy the core components of Tehran's nuclear programme and probably only set it back by months. The White House dismissed the report as “flat-out wrong”.

Waking in Washington to find the ceasefire he had brokered the night before had been violated by both sides, Trump told the media: “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.”

Both sides accused the other of violating the ceasefire. Israel claimed Iran had been the first to break the truce, saying it had shot down two ballistic missiles heading for northern Israel at about 10.30am, about two and a half hours after the cessation of hostilities was announced.

Nevertheless, Trump reserved his greatest rancour for Israel – for the scale of its planned retaliation, but also for the number of bombs its planes had dropped between agreeing the ceasefire on Monday night and it coming into force at 5am GMT on Tuesday.

“Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen,” he said, in the strongest-worded public rebuke of Israel of any US president in history. On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump issued a blunt instruction, writing: “ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!”

After a phone conversation with Netanyahu, Trump returned to the platform to announce: “ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!”

Minutes later, explosions were reported by Iranian media around Tehran and in the north of the country.

Haaretz reported that the single target was an Iranian radar installation.

Iran denied having broken the truce or launched missiles that Israel claimed to have intercepted mid-morning on Tuesday. Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered immediate retaliation on Tehran.

Trump's allies in Washington were quick to take a victory lap. Congressman Earl Carter of Savannah, Georgia, sent a letter to the nominating committee for the Nobel Peace Prize, saying Trump's “leadership at this moment exemplifies the very ideals that the Nobel Peace Prize seeks to recognise.”

And leaders of the isolationist faction of Trump's Maga coalition gave strong backing to the US president on Tuesday, including administration officials wary of foreign interventions, and conservative media pundits who had been openly critical of the US decision to launch strikes against Iranian nuclear sites at the weekend.

“We are seeing a foreign policy doctrine develop that will change the country (and the world) for the better,” wrote JD Vance, the US vice-president, usually a fierce critic of US military interventions in overseas wars. “1) clearly define an American interest; 2) negotiate aggressively to achieve that interest; 3) use overwhelming force if necessary.”

“It turns out you can just do what you said you would do,” he added. “No mission creep. No protracted, ill defined ‘nation building' BS. Just very proud of the president and the whole team this morning.”

Trump had used social media to announce the ceasefire just after 5am GMT on Tuesday, asking the warring parties not to violate it. Both sides carried out an intense exchange of fire before signalling their acceptance.

Netanyahu's office claimed to have killed hundreds of militants in the Basij, a volunteer force used to suppress internal dissent, and targeted an Iranian nuclear scientist, bringing the toll of assassinations of Iranian scientists to at least 15.

Trump advisers privately said they believed Iran would accept the US president's olive branch in order to avoid continued strikes by Israel, and because they had inflicted symbolic retaliation.

US congressional leaders were set to receive their first classified briefings on the strikes on Tuesday but they were later postponed with little explanation from the Trump administration.

“This last-minute postponement is outrageous, evasive, and derelict,” said the leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat. “What is the administration so afraid of? Why won't they engage with Congress on the critical details: the results of the recent strike, the scope and trajectory of this conflict, the administration's long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and the potential risks facing American citizens and our service members?”

Top Democrats have sharply criticised Trump for launching the strikes without consulting or informing congressional leadership before they took place. A number of top Democrats have claimed the strikes violated the War Powers Act, a 1973 law that restricts the US president's ability to order military action without congressional support.

“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional,” said the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Republican. “I'm persuaded by that argument. They think it's a violation of the article II powers of the commander-in-chief. I think that's right.”

TEHRAN, June 24. /TASS/. Tehran had a contingency plan in place for restoring its nuclear facilities in case they were attacked, and is currently assessing the damage caused, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) head Mohammad Eslami said.

"We took necessary preparatory measures and are currently evaluating the damage. Restoration plans for [nuclear facilities] were provided for in advance, and our objective is to avoid any interruptions in production and services," he told National Iranian Radio and Television.

Earlier, Iran's central military headquarters Khatam al-Anbiya said that the US attack on the Islamic republic's nuclear facilities was absolutely ineffective.

Overnight into June 13, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, aimed at Iran's nuclear program. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that 200 fighter jets attacked more than 100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities.

On the evening of June 13, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced that Iran retaliated by attacking dozens of targets in Israel with missiles, including military facilities and air bases, striking, in particular, the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. In the following days, Israel and Iran exchanged more strikes. Both sides reported casualties and losses as a result of these attacks and admitted that some targets were hit but claimed that the damage was limited. Russia has condemned Israel's actions and expressed readiness to mediate the conflict.

The United States joined the armed conflict nine days after its escalation: in the early hours of June 22, American bombers attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. On Monday evening, Tehran launched a missile strike on the United States' Al-Udeid military base in Qatar. According to the US, there were no casualties, nor any significant damage caused in the attack.

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Israel and Iran had agreed to a complete ceasefire.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 15 people and injuring scores of others, local officials reported.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak said the morning strike ignited a large fire and also damaged a dormitory, a gymnasium, and an administrative building in the city.

The Russian military also struck the nearby town of Samarske, Lysak said. Casualties were reported in both locations.

"Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere," he said. According to Lysak's latest update, there are currently more than 200 casualties in Dnipro, including 15 killed. Twelve of the wounded are in a serious condition. 

In Samarske, two people were killed, and nine injured. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition.

"As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: "The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase."

Around 6 p.m. local time, the death toll rose to 15, while the number of wounded increased to 174, Lysak reported. Almost a hundred of the victims remain in hospital, he added.

Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. 

"Ukrzaliznytsia is preparing a replacement train in Dnipro to evacuate passengers to Zaporizhzhia," the company said in a statement.

In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care.

The attack came as NATO leaders convened for a high-level summit in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat.

MOSCOW, June 24. /TASS/. The West is now pleading for a ceasefire in Ukraine without preconditions - something Vladimir Zelensky categorically rejected just a few years ago, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has stated.

"Recall how it all started. Russia is to be strategically defeated on the battlefield. They were practically shouting and going hysterical. Over time, their narrative shifted; they began loudly asserting that Russia must not be allowed to win in Ukraine. Now, they are begging and demanding an immediate ceasefire with no preconditions. This is exactly what Zelensky firmly refused a couple of years ago, when he still championed the goal of a strategic defeat for Russia on the battlefield," Lavrov explained at the 11th Primakov Readings, an international forum of scholars and experts.

He added, "The failure of Western strategy and tactics is clear, yet Europe continues to try."

Lavrov observed that, unlike the West, Russia has maintained consistent approaches to the Ukraine settlement. "President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed these principles in detail during the discussions at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum," he noted. "In contrast, Western leaders' strategies are constantly shifting, which, in essence, highlights the failure of their original plans," he emphasized.

The Primakov Readings forum has been held annually since 2015 in memory of the Russian statesman and diplomat Yevgeny Primakov. The forum discusses scenarios for the development of international relations, challenges in the field of international security, as well as new models of interaction among global political actors. TASS is the main media partner of the event.

Donald Trump will prioritise pageantry over diplomacy at the Nato summit, arriving in the Hague in time for an opulent dinner with the King and Queen while eschewing key meetings.

Mr Trump will arrive in the Hague, Netherlands, on Tuesday evening just in time for the Royal dinner, but will in turn skip a string of Nato meetings earlier in the day.

The flying 24-hour visit, which was originally scheduled to be twice as long, is a reminder of just how much the world's most powerful man chafes at the business of international summitry but never misses an opportunity to revel in pomp and ceremony.

Last week he left the G7 summit in Canada half way through, insisting he had to return to Washington to deal with the escalating crisis in the Middle East.

However, insiders pointed out that he announced he was leaving after sitting through a session on wildfires, exactly the sort of scheduling that he hates.

“He thinks these things are a total waste of time,” said a source who was at the G7 last week.

Nato officials need no reminder.

He left his last Nato summit abruptly when Justin Trudeau, the then Canadian prime minister, was caught on camera joking about Mr Trump's penchant for turning any event into a press conference.

That was six years ago just outside Watford.

This time there is more pomp and glamour in a schedule that has been carefully tailored to keep him happy. There was even talk of slotting in a round of golf on Tuesday, although the abbreviated plan means that has been jettisoned.

Instead he arrives in time to dine at the Huis ten Bosch, one of three official residences of the Dutch royal family.

He leaves the next afternoon after a press conference.

The main theme of the summit will be member states' commitment to spend five percent of gross domestic product on defence – one of Mr Trump's hobby horses and a chance for him to claim a huge win that has eluded previous American presidents.

The usual three sessions have been reduced to one three-hour meeting.

And officials have shrunk the joint communiqué, to be released at the end of the summit, to just one page, focused almost entirely on the member states' pledge to raise defence spending to five percent of gross domestic product.

The short schedule meant it made sense of Mr Trump to cut down his visit from two nights to one, said Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary.

“More action, less talk,” she told The Telegraph.

She added that he was also going to be spending the night at a royal palace, “which he is very excited about.”

It means he will get to enjoy the ceremony of the summit without having to endure the nitty gritty of negotiations or the platitudes of diplomacy.

However, plans to keep contentious issues off the agenda – such as Ukraine's request for membership – have faltered.

Mr Trump will arrive fresh from ordering strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and retaliatory strikes on US bases in the Middle East.

He may face awkward questions from allies about the legality of the move and even Sir Keir Starmer, who has a good relationship with the US president, and his team have sidestepped questions about the justification for striking Iranian territory.

Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, has kept up a positive tone during the run up.

And on Monday he said he was not planning to raise Iran during the meetings,

“It is deviating from the core issue at hand,” he told reporters. “And that doesn't mean that individual allies will not discuss this here.”

A senior US official painted a picture of a president keen to get down to the business of increasing defence spending and getting allies to sign up to a five percent spending pledge from member states.

“This effort builds on the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending increases already achieved across the alliance since 2017 thanks to president Trump's diplomacy in his first term,” said the official.

“The president will urge allies to revitalise their industrial capacities in order to create Western supply chains capable of producing the critical minerals, infrastructure, weapons and other products necessary for the security of America and her allies.”

The early months of the second Trump administration have left Europe adrift. The continent was already reeling from the war in Ukraine and increasingly worried about the specter of Russian aggression. Now, new leadership in Washington is casting doubt on its commitment to the defense of European allies.

In the eyes of Europeans, even the U.S. nuclear umbrella, which for decades has shielded the continent from outside threats, no longer seems fully dependable. “I want to believe that theUnited States will stay by our side,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in March. “But we have to be prepared for that not to be the case.”

The way forward, Macron has argued, is to protect the continent from attack without relying on the deterrent power of American nuclear weapons. France's contribution, he has suggested, might be to put its own nuclear arsenal in the service of its European neighbors.

It is too early to tell what will come of the French president's offer. A similar proposal Macron made in 2020 was ignored in other European capitals. But the continent's geopolitical predicament has grown much direr in the years since, and the probability of an attack on European NATO members is now at a level not seen since the late 1970s. Given that reality and the seeming indifference of the Trump administration to it, the continent needs to rethink its own deterrence strategies. If the American nuclear umbrella is no longer open, Europe might need one of its own. Ironically, this would run counter to U.S. President Donald Trump's ambition, stated in 2017, to “de-nuke” the world.

The credibility of any nuclear deterrent rests on two pillars: having the right capabilities and having the resolve to use them. Judged by those criteria, neither Macron's proposal nor any other option for an independent European nuclear deterrent currently passes muster. But even if the moment for Europe to decouple its security from that of the United States has not yet arrived, the continent's leaders must prepare for the possibility that it may before long. And that means beginning to take serious stock of their nuclear options. In the short term, doing so will signal that Washington needs to take Europe's deterrence concerns seriously. But it would also lay a foundation on which Europe could build should its fears of abandonment by the United States really come true.

Historically, most European countries have viewed nuclear weapons with skepticism and, in some cases, outright hostility. Antinuclear sentiment peaked in the 1980s, when NATO's “dual track” decision, which included plans to station American intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe, set off massive protests in cities across the region. Popular opposition was fueled in part by the belief that U.S. nuclear weapons were not a deterrent against Soviet aggression, as NATO leaders argued, but a vehicle for reckless provocation and warmongering. The 1983 film The Day After offered a fictionalized preview of what might lie in store: a U.S.-​Soviet confrontation in Berlin spiraling into a small-scale nuclear war and, eventually, a global nuclear wipeout. Among the record number of dystopian nuclear-themed works of science fiction to have come out of the 1980s, many played on such fears.

In reality, what followed was not Armageddon but détente. The Americans and the Soviets agreed to limit their arsenals, and those agreements held after the Soviet Union fell and Russia took its place. As the Cold War receded into history, fears of nuclear war abated.

But in European policymaking circles, resistance to the logic of nuclear deterrence persisted. Outside Europe's two nuclear powers, France and the United Kingdom, European officials and thinkers still tend to associate all things nuclear with destruction more than with deterrence.

Even so, the war in Ukraine has brought the nuclear issue back into focus, mainly in light of a renewed and growing nuclear threat from Russia. Part of the problem is the sheer size and potency of Russia's arsenal of around 5,580 nuclear warheads. It is unclear how many of those warheads are meant to target central or western Europe. But the dozens of nuclear warheads Russia has stationed in Belarus are cause for concern, as they could easily strike NATO countries such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.



More worrying than the arsenal itself, however, is Russia's potential willingness to use it, including as a means of coercion and blackmail. Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated nuclear threats against Ukraine and its European supporters portend trouble for the rest of the continent, particularly in conjunction with the ongoing reorganization and modernization of Russia's armed forces. Russia appears to be reorienting its military capabilities and strategy toward the possibility of protracted conflict with Europe. It also aims to increase active military personnel from 1.3 million to 1.5 million by 2027, raising the possibility of a return to Soviet-style mass mobilization.

Even as the geopolitical danger from the East has increased, the protection afforded by the American nuclear umbrella no longer seems guaranteed, at least not since Trump took office for the second time in January. Of course, the United States still has the ability to provide Europe with a credible nuclear deterrent. What is increasingly uncertain is whether, under Trump, it still wants to do so. Trump and those around him have repeatedly suggested that the United States might not come to its allies' rescue if they were attacked, musing about pulling U.S. troops out of Europe and implying that Washington might not defend NATO members that do not spend sufficiently on their own defense.

To be sure, such rhetoric may just be an attempt to pressure European allies into higher defense spending. To actually push those allies out from underneath the American nuclear umbrella would undermine the United States' status as a superpower, alienate some of the most important partners in its geopolitical competition with China and Russia, reduce its leverage over Europe, and perhaps open the door to nuclear proliferation on the continent. But security experts could find themselves in a similar position to that of economists: despite near-total expert consensus that tariffs will spark a trade war and hurt the U.S. economy, Trump plowed ahead. In the economic realm, such missteps are harmful. In the domain of national security, the ramifications could be existential.

As the former U.S. diplomat and political scientist Ivo Daalder wrote in Foreign Affairs earlier this year, the principle of collective defense enshrined in NATO's founding treaty “derives its credibility less from the formal treaty than from a belief among the members that they are all prepared to come to one another's defense.” Potential aggressors must believe the same thing. Europe's entire post–Cold War security architecture rests on this belief. To throw it into doubt risks undermining the entire system from within and without.



So far, European debates on how to establish deterrence without U.S. assistance have centered on conventional, nonnuclear military capabilities, and understandably so. The limited conventional military capabilities of European NATO members could tempt Russia into carrying out a limited attack—seizing a small piece of territory from one of its Baltic neighbors, say, or engaging a European military vessel—with the expectation that it would not suffer any serious consequences. If such an attack took place and Europe lacked the means for an appropriate military response, NATO's credibility would be shattered. Recognizing that danger, most European countries have pledged significant increases in defense spending. It will likely take several years for those investments to fill the gaps, but at least the necessary political decisions have been made and there is broad public support for them.

A potential European nuclear deterrent is a different matter. European politicians have sporadically expressed concern about the nuclear threat from Russia, and defense experts have begun discussing Europe's nuclear options more seriously. What is lacking, however, is an informed public debate, despite Macron's recent proposal.

The conditions for such a debate are better than they have been in years. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, polling indicated that in four European countries that hosted U.S. nuclear weapons—Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands—a plurality of respondents opposed such hosting arrangements. By contrast, in a March poll of nine European countries, 61 percent of respondents said they would welcome a French nuclear umbrella covering the entire continent.

An extended nuclear deterrent of this type, provided by France but ideally also supplemented by the United Kingdom, would certainly merit closer scrutiny if the United States further diluted or even disavowed its security guarantees. Two other options, which seem less pertinent because they are even more controversial, also deserve attention. One is a collective nuclear deterrent: that is, an arsenal that would be controlled by a pan-European institution. The other is the acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional European states. If Europe chose any of these paths, it would need to meet two criteria to make its nuclear deterrent credible. First, its arsenal would have to be sufficiently large, technically sophisticated, and capable of surviving a first strike. Second, whoever controlled the arsenal would have to demonstrate a willingness to use it.

Of the three options, only one has been seriously discussed so far: an extended nuclear deterrent provided primarily by France, with complementary support from the United Kingdom. The new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has indicated interest in such an arrangement, even if he has said it would serve only to supplement American nuclear guarantees, not to replace them. And in May, France and Poland signed a treaty to deepen their security ties, a step that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described as a step toward a potential French nuclear umbrella for his country.

As of today, however, French and British nuclear capabilities raise serious credibility concerns. Some 290 French nuclear warheads are ready for deployment; the United Kingdom can provide another 225. Taken together, that is a mere ten percent of what Russia can field.

Deterrence is no simple numbers game, but a gap this wide is a clear liability, for reasons of both objective and perceived weakness. For one thing, it effectively restricts European allies to what nuclear experts call “deterrence by punishment.” Such deterrence rests on the threat of overwhelming retaliation—attack us, and we will respond by laying waste to your cities. For that threat to work, one's own nuclear assets must be able to survive the enemy's initial attack. France certainly has that capability, since most of its warheads are deployed on submarines, which are notoriously hard to detect and destroy. But what if the aggressor used low-yield tactical weapons, and what if the target lay on the far edges of the Franco-British nuclear umbrella? Would France and the United Kingdom, which lack tactical nuclear warheads of their own, be willing to use their high-yield strategic arsenal in response—and risk total annihilation if the enemy responded in kind?



The answer might be no, and the obvious implication is that France and the United Kingdom cannot currently offer their allies the kind of extended deterrent afforded by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Getting there would require substantial investments in their respective arsenals to increase the number of strategic warheads, acquire tactical ones, and deploy them in a way that they could survive a first strike by an opponent. Given their budgetary constraints, it is unlikely that Paris and London could shoulder the burden of these investments on their own. Instead, most of the bill would have to be footed by the nuclear umbrella's future beneficiaries—that is, other European allies.

France and the United Kingdom have consistently maintained that any decision to use nuclear weapons is a matter of national sovereignty. They would thus need to issue credible assurances of protection to any third-party investors. Europe's limited geographic scale and deep economic integration make such assurances more plausible than transatlantic pledges of protection by the United States. Nonetheless, a credible deterrent would require further arrangements. Nuclear-sharing agreements between the United States and its allies offer a useful template: under these pacts, the U.S. military deploys nuclear weapons to a number of allied states, and the host countries then provide some components of the necessary delivery systems, such as carrier aircraft and pilots. But Washington retains the sole authority to order a nuclear launch. The credibility of Paris's and London's assurances could also be enhanced by the creation of a consultation mechanism similar to NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, which discusses nuclear issues and reviews member states' policies but of which France is not a member.

Still, another major weak spot would remain. Judging by the outcomes of recent elections in France and the United Kingdom, one cannot rule out the rise, in both countries, of right-wing populist governments whose geopolitical instincts would lead them to pursue a France-only or United Kingdom–only nuclear policy. In other words, a Franco-British nuclear umbrella might one day snap shut for the same reasons the American one did.

To mitigate the uncertainties that would complicate the Franco-British option, European leaders could set their sights on a more ambitious one: a collective, pan-European nuclear deterrent. During the Cold War, officials in the Kennedy administration considered a version of this arrangement: a multinational fleet of ships and submarines armed with American nuclear weapons but operated, owned, and controlled entirely by European NATO allies. The fleet would have carried enough warheads to destroy anywhere from 25 to 100 Soviet cities. But British opposition to the plan, as well as disagreements among other allies on how to implement and fund it, caused it to founder.

A modern version of this proposal could place French and British nuclear weapons under the control of the European Union or a new body. This plan would solve the political problem posed by the Franco-British option, since it would be less vulnerable to a change of heart on the part of France or the United Kingdom. In the short term, the technical shortcomings of the Franco-British option would remain, since the collective deterrent would rely on the two countries' arsenals. But Europe's nonnuclear powers would have a much stronger incentive to share the financial burden of modernizing and expanding the French and British nuclear stockpile than they would have under the first option, since they would be investing in a jointly controlled arsenal rather than in weapons wholly controlled by others.

Joint control would represent the arrangement's greatest strength for most of the continent, but it would be a nonstarter for Paris and London. Neither government would want to hand over its national arsenal to a European body and give up the final say on the weapons' use. Even if a multilateral nuclear force provided enhanced capabilities and thus a higher level of deterrence—whose benefits would also redound to the French and the British—the question of who held the ultimate launch authority would likely outweigh any other considerations.

Joint control raises other thorny issues, too. If only a single member state of the multilateral force suffered a nuclear attack, would the others really prove willing to respond? If they didn't, would that give the attacked country the right to conduct a unilateral retaliatory strike, using nuclear weapons stationed on its territory as part of the multilateral force? Would a nuclear strike require unanimity among member states, or would a majority suffice? In either case, decision-making would require more time than is available during a potential nuclear conflict. To avoid delays, launch authority could be delegated to a supranational body. But that body would not have enough democratic legitimacy to make life-or-death decisions for hundreds of millions of people. Until European nations have reached a level of integration that would allow a directly elected European government to make such a decision, option two would fail the credibility test.

What remains is undoubtedly the most controversial and far-reaching option: instead of relying on or investing in the existing French and British arsenals, other European countries could build nuclear weapons of their own. If these states accumulated arsenals comparable in size to those of France and the United Kingdom, Europe's collective capabilities would extend beyond deterrence by punishment. Rather than merely threatening retaliation in the wake of an attack, European states would be able to engage in “deterrence by denial”—that is, to make it difficult or even impossible for an adversary to carry out a devastating strike in the first place.

Several major European powers, chief among them Germany and Poland, could theoretically acquire the technological capabilities and allocate the financial resources necessary to amass enough enriched uranium and ultimately develop nuclear weapons. But doing so would still take time—certainly enough time for a potential nuclear-armed aggressor such as Russia to carry out a preemptive conventional strike on enrichment sites and other development facilities. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, such a strike would have been unthinkable. Nowadays, hardly anything can be excluded.

To mitigate that risk, France and the United Kingdom could “lend out” some of their nuclear weapons on a temporary basis. The incentive for Paris and London to go along with this plan and support the nuclear ambitions of their allies would be to achieve strength in numbers: even without joint control, multiple European nuclear powers could establish a greater level of deterrence than France and the United Kingdom can establish for themselves today. The United States, for its part, would at long last be relieved of the burden of protecting Europe, freeing resources for alternative uses. But if the benefits are of historic proportions, so, too, are the potential costs—especially the raised risk of provoking a conflict with Russia.



In practice, there is no obvious contender for the position of Europe's third nuclear power. So far, only Poland seems to be weighing the option in earnest. “Poland must pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons,” Tusk, the country's prime minister, told Polish parliamentarians in March. “This is a serious race—a race for security, not for war.”

The debate in Germany, meanwhile, is complicated by historical, political, cultural, and strategic considerations. Despite decades of reconciliation, integration, and democratic stability, the first half of the twentieth century—and Germany's role in it—still weighs heavily on European minds. A nuclear-armed Germany would entail a significant rebalancing of power in Europe and trigger deep concern in neighboring capitals. That is to say nothing of German society's own wariness. Its pacifist and antinuclear leanings run deep, as do its aversion to risk and its reservations about taking on international military responsibilities. Even the civilian use of nuclear energy has been phased out, with the last reactors shut down in April 2023. These societal and political instincts are hardly compatible with the role of a nuclear power.

The legal constraints on Germany are significant, too. As a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the country has renounced the production and possession of nuclear weapons. The same commitment is enshrined in Article 3(1) of the Two Plus Four Treaty, the 1990 agreement that provided the legal foundation for the post–Cold War reunification of East and West Germany. The Two Plus Four Treaty, in particular, is a daunting legal obstacle, as a violation of one of its central elements could put the validity of the whole document into question. That, in turn, would cause major concerns among its signatories and among Germany's immediate neighbors.

To be sure, recent events have already undercut the treaty's political basis. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the possibility of a U.S. withdrawal from Europe each threaten the very achievement that the accord was meant to secure, namely the full sovereignty of a reunified Germany. These unsettling changes could be reason enough for a joint decision by Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States to override Article 3(1). Nevertheless, any move by Germany toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons would be imaginable only in close consultation and concert with other European states, first and foremost Poland, where a nuclear-armed Germany would cause the most apprehension.

For the time being, none of the three options easily pass the credibility test. A French and British nuclear umbrella would lack the necessary capabilities, and its beneficiaries would likely doubt its reliability in times of crisis. A pan-European nuclear deterrent appears even less feasible. It would transfer an existential political decision to an entity with only indirect democratic legitimacy. Doing so would amount to a serious challenge to European democratic norms at a time when they are already under assault by illiberal forces.

Nuclear proliferation in Europe might provide effective and credible deterrence. But it would carry legal and political risks that, for the time being, are too great for European leaders to countenance. It could also set off a wave of nuclear proliferation outside Europe, including in states that Western governments consider hostile.

Then again, even if Europe stays put, there is no knowing if nonproliferation will hold in other parts of the world. If anything, current trends suggest that the first place it will buckle is East Asia. If the Trump administration continues to create a sense of uncertainty about the U.S. security guarantee to South Korea, for example, leaders in Seoul could reach a breaking point. As things stand, South Korea faces three politically hostile nuclear powers—North Korea, China, and Russia—in its immediate neighborhood. South Korean defense strategists have pointed out that this situation would become untenable if their country's only nuclear ally, the United States, were to withdraw. A nuclear-armed South Korea would, in turn, encourage Japan to pursue the same course.

Nuclear proliferation in East Asia would also alter the terms of the debate in Europe, where it might be viewed as a shift more real and definitive than Trump's threats alone. It is a sobering scenario: European leaders, faced with nothing but bad options, may prove incapable of breaking their nuclear impasse unless someone else takes the plunge first. Europe's safest bet, until then, is to at least prepare for all contingencies.

CELESTE A. WALLANDER is Executive Director of Penn Washington and an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security. She was Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and oversaw U.S. military assistance to Ukraine during the Biden administration.

 Celeste A. Wallander

For decades, the United States had asked its NATO allies in Europe to do more for their own defense. And by the alliance's 2024 summit in Washington, they had gotten the message. Twenty-three of NATO's 32 members were spending two percent of their GDP on defense, the alliance target—up from six members in 2021.

In explaining this increase, many commentators cited a single factor: Donald Trump. It is true that the U.S. president's rhetoric, broadly critical of European defense spending during his first presidential term and now his second, has played a role in the uptick. But the increase was underway before Trump entered politics. For over a decade, NATO allies have been focused on the elevated threat that Russia poses to European security, with Russian President Vladimir Putin's naked aggression against Ukraine as a harbinger. They have also warily watched as Washington paid less attention to their region and more to Asia. Together, these factors prompted the steady increase in defense spending, procurement, and production that helped Europe build more capable militaries before Trump's return to the presidency in 2025—and that will continue after he leaves office. Trump's reelection has only helped underscore the continent's burgeoning independence: Europeans now see a fundamentally changed United States, and they are no longer confident that investing in U.S. leadership will secure their interests.

The fact that Europe is spending more on its own defense is in many ways good news for Americans. Thanks to the continent's increased strength, Washington can now focus on China first and Russia second. There is a reason why generations of U.S. presidents from both parties have pushed for Europe to spend more on defense.

But before American officials pat themselves on the back or take a victory lap, they must understand the downsides of their success. Growing European power means the era of comfortable U.S. leadership is over. Now that it provides more for itself, Europe will feel less pressure to defer to Washington's interests. It is less likely to buy American-made weapons. It might deny the United States the right to use American military bases in Europe for operations in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. And the continent is already holding up Washington's efforts to end the war in Ukraine, restraining American officials in ways it previously wouldn't.

None of this means the transatlantic alliance is doomed, let alone already finished. Washington and Europe still have many shared interests, which will encourage them to keep working together. But the changing balance of power means that the United States now has to earn Europe's partnership—just when that partnership is becoming more significant. The United States is facing challenges on multiple fronts across the globe in ways it hasn't since the end of the Cold War. It will need its European friends, with their newfound strength, to help it handle aggressors in multiple regions. Washington, then, has to make a decision. It can forge a new transatlantic relationship that respects Europe's interests. Or it can lose the world order to a triumvirate of autocracies: Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran.

Ever since its 1949 founding, NATO has relied heavily on the United States. During the Cold War, in the 1970s, Europe's NATO members spent an average of two to three percent of their GDP on defense. The United States, meanwhile, averaged seven percent. As a result, the most capable military force defending Europe was made up of American troops. With some exceptions, European NATO militaries were underfunded. Credible defense and deterrence against any Soviet attack depended on Washington.

This might seem odd, given that Europe—not North America—would suffer most immediately from Soviet conquest. But preventing Moscow from controlling western Europe when it already occupied eastern Europe was the necessary condition for American global security and prosperity. The Soviet Union's ultimate goal was to defeat the United States, and control of western European economic and industrial power would fuel Moscow's ability to strike against its real enemy: an America built on democracy, a market economy, and global trade. Washington, locked in competition with the only other power that came close to matching it, could thus not risk a third world war on the continent. European and American security were, in other words, indivisible. They constituted a collective good.

Because a collective good benefits all members of a group regardless of who steps up to provide it, there is little incentive for most members to pay. But for the most powerful player, one with a huge stake in ensuring that the collective good is secure, contributing the lion's share is perfectly rational. After the disasters of two world wars and a global depression, the United States was the only country with the resources to really ensure that Europe was defended from Soviet occupation, and so it did. The imbalance of defense spending was still a source of friction in the alliance, but U.S. leadership was ultimately in Washington's own interest.

The United States got more than just a stable world order in exchange for being Europe's protector. It received a stockpile of military, political, economic, and diplomatic advantages. Some of these were explicit and negotiated. Others developed naturally from the structures and processes of the alliance, and still others arose from the determination of individual allies to support Washington one on one. (Each state gained unique benefits from its bilateral relationship with the superpower.) All of these advantages helped Americans.



Consider the most concrete benefit: the more than 30 military bases the United States has set up across Europe. The legal status of these bases is established in bilateral agreements that dictate how, when, and whether the U.S. military can operate from both the bases themselves and the airspace and waterways that allow access to them. These are called “access, basing, and overflight,” or ABO, agreements. Typically, the terms are quite generous, allowing the United States to use the bases not only to defend Europe but also to support American interests across the globe.

Washington has repeatedly availed itself of this ability. In 1973, for example, Portugal let the United States use an air base in the Azores to supply Israel during the Yom Kippur War despite the risk of economic retribution by Arab states. In 2001, multiple European allies granted Washington permission to use its bases for operations in Afghanistan, as well as the right to fly military planes through European airspace. Several NATO allies that opposed the 2003 U.S. war against Iraq nonetheless allowed Washington to use bases in Europe for the invasion—or at least permitted U.S. military aircraft to transit their territory. When France did not, it was criticized by some members for causing NATO disunity. This is the essence of the United States' hegemonic advantage, built over the course of 75 years of leadership: NATO allies often support American priorities, even when they disagree with them, to preserve U.S. leadership.

The benefits of the United States' NATO hegemony continue to this day. Washington's 2024 defense of Israel against Iranian air attacks depended on American military aircraft and ships based in Greece, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. European basing and overflight enabled the United States to destroy strike and command facilities operated by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. And European bases support U.S. counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa.

These bases even help the United States protect itself. To reach the northern Atlantic Ocean, for example, Russian submarines must first travel from a naval and air base on the Arctic Ocean through a chokepoint known as the GIUK Gap (for Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom). If they succeed in evading detection there, they can move along the U.S. coastline unnoticed, ready to launch nuclear weapons against hundreds of American targets without warning. Such an attack would be extremely difficult to defend against. The Pentagon is typically able to track these submarines through the gap, but only because of the many U.S. naval and air assets it has stationed in Europe. Washington is helped in this task by patrols from Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United Kingdom.

The United States benefits from NATO leadership in ways that go beyond basing. For the alliance to function properly, its members need to be able to jointly plan, patrol, and carry out operations. That means they must use similar sets of weapons. And although NATO states are free to purchase any systems that meet alliance interoperability and capability requirements, in practice, they very often buy U.S.-made ones.

The advantage of buying American is simple: European forces are more effective at operating alongside U.S. forces when they use American systems. Norwegian and U.S. NATO patrols in the GIUK Gap, for instance, train on the same systems, especially the Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, so that they can seamlessly coordinate complex joint military operations. Poland and the Baltic states have prioritized the purchase of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, because when their units and U.S. units need to hand off patrol duties to each other to ensure round-the-clock coverage of NATO's eastern frontline, operating with the same equipment makes the process relatively frictionless. The Polish government is more likely to get American soldiers patrolling and training with Polish soldiers every day if they are all working from the same weapons systems. American leaders, after all, will then have greater confidence that their soldiers will be effective and safe if the troops fighting alongside them are using the same technology. By equipping European forces with American weapons, eastern allies can encourage Washington to keep its military in the region.

The reliability of the U.S. defense industrial base and the scale of the Pentagon's long-term contracts offer additional incentives to use American weapons. The American Foreign Military Sales system is notoriously inefficient, with years-long processes to finalize contracts and last-minute price increases. But European countries still choose U.S. military equipment over their own partly because American defense contractors, accustomed to servicing the enormous U.S. armed forces, are typically capable of providing decades' worth of maintenance, parts, and upgrades. This reliability is one reason why European countries have inked contracts for fifth-generation F-35 aircraft despite the high prices and torturous timelines.

Europe's purchases help the United States maintain a strong defense industrial base. From 2022 to 2024, European countries purchased $61 billion worth of U.S. defense systems, accounting for 34 percent of all their defense contract procurement, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The F-35 alone is worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense companies. And these deals are growing in size and scale: since 2020, European NATO allies have more than doubled the number of weapons they import and increased the proportion they buy from the United States from 54 percent to 64 percent. U.S. military contractors are not just exporting more to European allies but also getting a larger share of the continent's defense spending pie. Yes, Washington pays more for defense than Europe does. But the United States has long enjoyed its own benefits from this predominance.

As European defense spending grows, however, the two sides are becoming more equal. In 2014, European NATO members spent an average of 1.5 percent of their GDP on defense, procurement included, compared with 3.7 for the United States. In 2024, however, European members spent an average of 2.2 percent of GDP on defense, whereas the United States spent just under 3.4 percent. Two EU countries, Estonia and Poland, spent a greater percentage than Washington: 3.43 percent and 4.12 percent, respectively. If the United States' share of global GDP were significantly larger than Europe's, Washington might still be spending far more on NATO than its transatlantic counterparts do, even as Europe begins to spend a similar share of GDP on defense. But by 2025, the United States made up 14.8 percent of global GDP, whereas European countries (the EU, along with Norway and the United Kingdom) made up 17.5 percent. European NATO allies allocated the vast majority of their defense spending to the continent. The United States, by contrast, has military forces spanning the globe.

The move toward parity in relative expenditures has been years in the making. Europe's increase in defense spending began after Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Rattled by Moscow's assault and under mounting American pressure, nearly all NATO countries began to allocate larger shares of their spending to defense, even as U.S. outlays slipped. Europe also began spending more on buying and maintaining military equipment. In 2024 alone, for instance, NATO's non-U.S. members increased their expenditures on equipment by 37 percent, while U.S. spending for equipment grew 15 percent.

Europe seems poised to go even further in the years ahead. The EU, for example, is making changes in procurement and in overall military spending to expand defense industrial production. The union recently changed its stringent deficit spending restrictions so that members can budget up to 1.5 percent more of individual GDP on defense. If EU countries take advantage of this provision, they could spend more than $700 billion more on defense through 2030 than is currently earmarked. The EU has also proposed setting aside a $163.5 billion pool of money for long-term low-interest loans for procuring military goods.



EU member governments seem similarly committed to increasing spending. Belgium, Italy, and Spain have all announced that they will reach NATO's two percent goal in 2025. Other European countries have announced defense budget increases, as well. Most strikingly, Germany—long highly averse to both defense and deficit spending—changed its constitution so it could borrow money for military purposes. The country's new government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has signaled plans to expand defense procurement through at least 2030. Should all these trends continue, Europe will not only match U.S. regional defense spending but also exceed it.

The continent has also taken steps to make sure this new money is not wasted. Right now, Europe is plagued by redundancy and poor interoperability, largely because each state is responsible for its own procurement. But the EU is adopting new rules to standardize planning and purchasing, including a 2023 provision that incentivizes and facilitates joint defense procurement and production. This change resulted in the signing last year of a $5.6 billion contract by Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and Sweden to procure Patriot missiles.

European states are not just stepping up monetarily. They are also stepping up in terms of leadership. Since 2017, for example, NATO has established nine battle groups, one for each of its nine frontline countries. Rather than expecting Washington to carry the burden, the alliance has adopted a distributed leadership approach for these groups; only in Poland does the United States lead. In Finland, Sweden is the leader. In Estonia, it is the United Kingdom. Germany leads in Lithuania, Spain in Slovakia, France in Romania, and Italy in Bulgaria. Hungary has taken leadership of its own battle group. Canada is leading in Latvia.

Washington, of course, still has a vital role to play in the defense of all these countries. No one expects that European forces can match the scale and global reach of the U.S. military. But they are now much closer in strength to the United States within the NATO alliance, even in comparison with five years ago. With Finland and Sweden as NATO members, the continent has forces that can better manage challenges from China and Russia in the Arctic. To counter Russia's use of the Black Sea as a platform for striking Ukraine, NATO's European members are developing new coastal defense forces and autonomous vehicles that can enhance U.S. operations in the Mediterranean. European defense companies are at the forefront of developing uncrewed vehicles, and the continent is no longer dependent on the United States' surveillance aircraft. The heavy burden that Washington bore for collective defense is being lightened by Europe's response to Russia.

For the United States, the upside of Europe's rise is easy to grasp. Beijing is the primary challenge to American security, so U.S. officials want to prioritize it over Moscow. Now, they can.

But Americans may find that they overcorrected in their quest to get Europe to do more. Consider, for example, the manufacturing implications. With Washington retrenching from the continent, Europe has seemingly decided to buy fewer goods from American defense manufacturers. Countries drawing from the EU's new $163.5 billion defense procurement loan pool must spend the funds only for purchases from European defense companies. A senior EU official told me that purchases from U.S. defense companies might qualify if their products are manufactured in Europe. Yet the contracts will require employing European workers and paying European taxes. Such agreements could help American production by creating more resilient supply chains, but not if tariffs and trade barriers create obstacles for U.S. companies in Europe. For example, American companies have been scouring the globe for sources of ammunition fuses and explosives, many of which European companies have been able to source. But ironically, that potential benefit could be undermined if new tariff rules label these products as European imports, even if they are ultimately produced by American companies on the continent.

Europe's newfound autonomy is also causing strategic difficulties. For instance, the United States wants to put a quick stop to the war in Ukraine, and it has therefore argued for lifting sanctions on Russia in step-by-step peace negotiations. Europe, however, does not want to pressure Kyiv into an unwanted settlement. In the past, Europe might have gone along with Washington's plans anyway, lest the bloc lose American support. But this time around, the continent has declared that it will not lift sanctions until Ukraine is ready to settle.

This has severely restricted the amount of relief American officials can provide to Russia. Europe holds two-thirds of the $330 billion of the Russian assets that U.S. allies agreed to freeze in 2022 to deny Moscow access to financing for its war in Ukraine. This means that the White House cannot dangle this carrot before Putin without European permission. Europe is also home to SWIFT, the payments mechanism that is keeping Russian banks from gaining access to the global financial system. The United States could loosen sanctions on the Russian energy sector, but since it is Europe that buys Russian natural gas through the now shuttered Nord Stream pipelines, a change in U.S. energy policy alone has little impact on the Kremlin's purse strings. And Europe has significant sanctions on Russian shipping and Russian access to dual-use technology goods, which the United States can do nothing about.



Other parts of the United States' Russia policy also depend on European acquiescence. Washington, for example, wants European countries to pledge to put troops on the ground in Ukraine to enforce an eventual peace settlement. But Europeans have demonstrated little interest in doing so as long as Washington entertains Russia's demands. Unlike the United States, for example, the vast majority of European countries will not concede that Russia should be able to dictate whether Ukraine can be a member of NATO—not least because Putin has stated that a peace settlement with Kyiv should also revisit previous rounds of NATO's enlargement.

If a sense of a common transatlantic purpose continues to fray, Europe might wind up undermining Washington's objectives elsewhere in the world. Should the United States decide to conduct a major military campaign against Iran's nuclear facilities, for example, it will want to use its military bases in Europe. This would require seeking permission from European countries. Those governments will know that their granting Washington's request will guarantee massive protests all over the continent. But in contrast to their actions in the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, many European countries might refuse. Washington would then either have to start its offensive from far-off bases in the United States—or from partner bases in the Middle East, which are easier for Iran to hit than bases in Europe.

As long as NATO remains strong, the United States will probably be able to keep using its bases in Europe for self-defense. Protecting North America is written into the alliance's charter. But European countries may no longer trust that Washington will defend them should the need arise. As a result, European leaders are seriously discussing whether the continent should acquire its own credible nuclear deterrent. France and the United Kingdom both have nuclear weapons, but neither currently has the number of warheads and the variety in delivery vehicles that the U.S. arsenal does, or the strategic depth. (Washington, for example, is separated from its competitors by vast oceans.) The United States claims it has no intention of pulling its nuclear umbrella from Europe or ignoring Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all. But Washington's NATO policy seems to change every day, and Europe does not have the time to wait and see if the Americans will actually uphold their commitments.

There is, of course, another force splitting Washington and Europe: Trump. In 2017, Europe could comfort itself with the thought that American voters didn't really know what they were getting when they elected him. But in 2024, Americans had already watched Trump bully U.S. allies, toy with leaving NATO, and cozy up to Russia. They voted for him anyway. As one European diplomat told me in January, the continent must consider the idea that Joe Biden's presidency, not Trump's, was the blip.

Unfortunately, in the months since that diplomat and I spoke, relations have deteriorated further. During his first term, Trump had advisers and cabinet members who supported the transatlantic relationship and restrained some of his worst impulses. This time around, those in his administration are far more in sync with Trump's deep-seated antagonism toward Europe. In February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told European officials in Brussels that “the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.” In a speech in Munich the same month, Vice President JD Vance said that when he looked “at Europe today, it's sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the Cold War's winners.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, told reporters that Washington had “incredible opportunities” to partner with Russia.

Europeans have listened. In a poll of 18,000 Europeans conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations just after Trump's victory in November, more than half of respondents considered the United States merely a “necessary partner” rather than an “ally,” a term that just 22 percent were willing to apply. Just 18 months earlier, more than half of Europeans polled by ECFR considered the United States an ally.



European officials, for their part, now speak of relations with the United States using a term that they once reserved for China: “de-risking.” Over the past decade, European countries have erected barriers to Chinese investment in critical national infrastructure on the assumption, pushed by Washington, that doing so was necessary to reduce the risk that Beijing could acquire leverage over their political systems and economies. Now, the script has flipped: European countries are considering enhanced trade with China to mitigate their vulnerability to the United States. They became particularly interested in doing so after Trump slapped sudden, massive tariffs on almost all the continent's exports.

In 2028, Americans might be able to slow Europe's flight from Washington by replacing Trump with a more traditional leader. But it will take more than one election to persuade Europeans that the United States can be trusted again. Even if Trump is followed by a string of committed transatlanticist presidents, U.S.-European relations will probably never return to what they were. Europe is moving away from Washington not just because of Trump but also because its priorities are different from the United States', its capabilities have improved, and Europeans are no longer certain that America is an unshakable ally.

But that doesn't mean the United States and Europe are headed for divorce. The two parties may give different weight to their respective concerns, but those concerns are still mutual. China remains a threat to Europe. Russia is still a threat to the United States. The world is changing, and not for the better, and the two sides need each other to cope with a challenging Beijing, a destructive Moscow, a dangerous Tehran, and a wildcard Pyongyang.



To repair relations, however, Washington will have to recalibrate its approach to Europe. This means accepting, first and foremost, that the world now has multiple poles and that the continent is one of them. The key will be returning to the fundamentals of defense diplomacy: accommodating power, recognizing interests, and allowing for a give and take that unlocks mutually beneficial agreements. Over eight decades of leadership born of gratitude from a destroyed Europe, generations of American officials have gotten used to European concessions to U.S. priorities. Now, they will have to get better at dealmaking and compromise. As Washington considers reducing its military posture in Europe, it will need to spend more to compete for the continent's defense contracts. The United States will likely have to listen to European arguments about balancing the continent's wariness of Chinese influence with the need for Chinese trade, investment, and technology—just as the United States heeds the needs of its partners in the Middle East, who are developing strong ties with China out of economic necessity. The United States will also have to accept that NATO allies hosting U.S. military bases might have strong views on how Washington can prevent Iranian nuclear proliferation. It certainly will have to acknowledge that the European Union is a powerful economic force essential to NATO's success.

If the United States can maintain its partnership with Europe, it will have an advantage not available to China or Russia in a multipolar world. Neither Beijing nor Moscow has an alliance of such economic heft, diplomatic might, and global reach. They cannot muster the kind of power wielded by NATO. Europe may give Americans headaches, but it always has; there is a reason why Washington has long wanted the continent to give the United States freedom to focus on other issues.

But having achieved what they wanted, U.S. officials now have to make a choice. They can spurn Europe and face a more dangerous world alone and depleted. Or they can forge a new, more accommodating transatlantic relationship. They will face obstacles in attempting the latter, given all that has changed. But the two parties have nearly a century of shared experience. Their friendship can prevail.

U.S. President Donald Trump's allies insist he had the authority to take unilateral action against Iran to eliminate what they called a potential nuclear threat posed by Tehran.Carlos Barria/Reuters

Three Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a war powers resolution on Monday to check President Donald Trump's use of military force against Iran after U.S. strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites over the weekend.

Trump's Republican Party holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and it is unlikely any resolution restricting Trump's actions could pass both chambers.

Iran targeted a U.S. base in Qatar on Monday in retaliation. The Israel-Iran war, which began on June 13 when Israel attacked its regional rival, further raised tensions in a region already on edge since the start of Israel's war in Gaza in October 2023.

Mr. Trump on raised the question of regime change in Iran following U.S. strikes against key military sites over the weekend, as senior officials in his administration warned Tehran against retaliation.

The joint statement issued late on Monday by Democratic U.S. Representatives Jim Himes, Gregory Meeks and Adam Smith came hours after Trump claimed on social media Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. 

“President Trump must not be allowed to start a war with Iran, or any country, without Congressional approval,” the lawmakers said, adding that Trump ordered the strikes “without meaningful consultation or Congressional authorization.”

Analysis: Donald Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear sites were ‘obliterated' seems stretched

Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers had called on Congress to rein in Trump's use of military force in Iran and prevent U.S. involvement in the conflict. Many Democratic U.S. lawmakers said Trump's actions were unconstitutional and that it was Congress that had the power to declare war on foreign countries.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier on Monday it was not the time to consider a war powers resolution.

Trump's allies insist he had the authority to take unilateral action against Iran to eliminate what they called a potential nuclear threat posed by Tehran.

The Democratic lawmakers said Trump's actions appeared broader.

“The president has posted on social media about regime change, undermining any claim that this was a narrowly tailored operation to eliminate a nuclear threat,” the Democratic lawmakers said, referring to a Sunday post in which Trump raised the prospect of overthrowing Iran's government.

“No thoughtful deliberation nor careful planning occurred here - and serious actions demand serious debate, not presidential impulse,” they added.

Israel is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons and says its war against Iran aims to prevent Tehran from developing its own nuclear weapons.

Iran, which says its nuclear program is peaceful, is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty while Israel is not.

From Georgia to Oregon, New England to New Mexico, data center projects are drawing opposition in local government hearings by residents concerned about the voracious demand for electricity, water consumption, and noise. Critics also argue that data centers don't produce the jobs other land uses generate.

In Texas, people in small towns question data center development in the broader context of rapid rural industrialization.

President Donald Trump says a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is in effect after the deal initially faltered leaving Trump frustrated with both sides.

U.S. President Donald Trump said a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was in effect Tuesday after the deal initially faltered, and the American leader expressed deep frustration with both sides. Israel had earlier accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace after the truce was supposed to take effect. Iran is insisting that Israel broke the spirit of the ceasefire, claiming that it carried out attacks after it shouldn't have.

Israeli strikes hit the capital of Iran in the early hours of Tuesday. Footage shows an explosion and smoke rising behind buildings in Tehran, hours before a ceasefire announced by Trump was in place.

A tentative truce faltered on Tuesday when Israel vowed to retaliate after saying Iran launched missiles into its airspace more than two hours after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect. Iran's military denied firing on Israel, state media reported — but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel midmorning.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to hold Tuesday after initially faltering, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both sides, saying they had fought “for so long and so hard” that they didn't know what they are doing.

After the truce was supposed to take effect, Israel accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace, and the Israeli finance minister vowed that “Tehran will tremble.”

The Iranian military denied firing on Israel, state media reported, but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel in the morning, and an Israeli military official said two Iranian missiles were intercepted.

Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for a NATO summit that, in his view, both sides had violated the nascent agreement. He had particularly strong words for Israel, a close ally, while suggesting Iran may have fired on the country by mistake.

But later he said the deal was saved.

“ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly “Plane Wave” to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!” Trump said in his Truth Social post.

Indeed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he held off on tougher strikes against Iran after speaking to Trump.




The conflict, now in its 12th day, began with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, saying it could not allow Tehran to develop atomic weapons and that it feared the Islamic Republic was close. Iran has long maintained that its program is peaceful.

If the truce holds, it will provide a global sense of relief after the U.S. intervened by dropping bunker-buster bombs on nuclear sites over the weekend — a move that risked further destabilizing the volatile region. 

Trump phoned Netanyahu after the American bombing on Sunday and told him not to expect additional U.S. military attacks and that he should seek a diplomatic solution with Iran, a senior White House official said.

Trump's position was that the U.S. had removed any imminent threat posed by Iran, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about sensitive diplomatic talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Israel followed up the U.S. air attacks by expanding the kinds of targets it was hitting.

After Tehran launched a limited retaliatory strike Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, Trump announced the ceasefire.

A protracted conflict could have a broad economic impact if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel.

China, which is Iran's largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, condemned the U.S. attacks and said it was concerned about a “spiral of escalations” without a ceasefire.

Trump suggested the ceasefire would allow Iranian oil to continue to flow, saying on social media that China could keep purchasing crude from Iran.

The deal got off to a rocky start.

An Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said Iran launched two missiles at Israel hours into the tenuous ceasefire. Both were intercepted, the official said.

Iranian state television reported that the military denied firing missiles after the start of the ceasefire — while condemning Israel for predawn strikes of its own.

One of those attacks killed a high-profile nuclear scientist, Mohammad Reza Sedighi Saber, at his father-in-law's residence in northern Iran, Iranian state TV reported.

Trump's frustration with the early morning strikes was palpable as he spoke to reporters before departing for the Hague. He said both sides had violated the agreement and used an expletive to hammer home his point.

“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f—- they're doing,” he said.

Netanyahu said Israel agreed to the ceasefire with Iran, in coordination with Trump, after the country achieved all of its war goals, including removing the threat of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

In a televised statement, Netanyahu said late Tuesday that Israel's war had brought Iran's nuclear program “to ruin” in a historic victory.

Israel took out top generals and nuclear scientists and destroyed nuclear facilities in Natanz, Isfahan and the Arak heavy water reactor, Netanyahu said. He thanked Trump for his help.

It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. He said earlier on social media that he would not surrender.

Trump said Tuesday that he wasn't seeking regime change in Iran, two days after floating the idea himself in a social media post.

“I don't want it,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “Regime change takes chaos and, ideally, we don't want to see much chaos.”

Before the ceasefire was announced, Israel's military said Iran launched 20 missiles toward Israel. Police said they damaged at least three densely packed residential buildings in the city of Beersheba. First responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. At least 20 people were injured.

Outside, the shells of burned out cars littered the streets. Broken glass and rubble covered the area. Police said some people were injured while inside their apartments' reinforced safe rooms, which are meant to withstand rockets but not direct hits from ballistic missiles.

The attack followed a limited Iranian missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for earlier American bombing of its nuclear sites. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties.

Elsewhere, U.S. forces shot down drones attacking the Ain al-Assad base in the desert in western Iraq and a base next to the Baghdad airport, while another one crashed, according to a senior U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

No casualties were reported, and no group claimed responsibility for the attacks in Iraq. Some Iran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to target U.S. bases if the U.S. attacked Iran.

In Israel, at least 28 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the war. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.

The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel.

The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.

There are roughly 700,000 American citizens, most of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, believed to be in Israel.

The urban heat island sits in a rural heat ocean.

Summer has officially begun with a blast of scorching temperatures across much of the United States. The National Weather Service is warning of “extremely dangerous heat” baking 160 million people under a heat dome stretching from the Midwest to the East Coast the rest of this week. It's already proven fatal. 

But while this is the first real taste of extreme heat for Northeastern cities, parts of the country like Texas have been cooking since May. Alaska this month issued its first-ever heat advisory. Forecasters expect more above-average temperatures through the summer. 

Summers are indeed getting hotter, a consequence of the warming planet. As the climate heats up, the frequency and intensity of heat waves is increasing and their timing is changing, arriving earlier in the season. 

But the damage from extreme heat isn't spread out evenly, and the more dangerous effects to people are not necessarily found in the hottest places. High temperatures often lead to more emergencies and hospital visits when they represent a big jump from a place's average, which means ordinarily cooler regions tend to suffer the worst harm from heat. That includes places like Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures rarely climb higher than 80 degrees Fahrenheit and most homes don't have air conditioning. 

Now researchers have found that rural areas may suffer more under extreme heat than previously thought. A report from Headwaters Economics and the Federation of American Scientists found that more than half of rural zip codes in the United States, which includes some 11.5 million Americans, have “high” heat vulnerability, a consequence not just of temperatures but unique risk factors that occur far outside of major cities. 

The thermometers thus do not tell the whole story about who is likely to suffer from extreme heat — nor do the images, which tend to come from sweltering cities. But understanding the factors that worsen the harm of rising temperatures could help save lives.

The discussion around the geography of extreme heat tends to focus on the urban heat island effect. The concrete, asphalt, steel, and glass of dense urban areas act as a sponge for the sun's rays. Air pollution from cars, trucks, furnaces, and factories helps trap warmer temperatures over cities, and that hotter air, in turn, accelerates the formation of pollutants like ozone. On a hot summer day, a city center can be 25 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the surrounding regions. And with so many people squeezed into these metropolitan ovens, it adds up to a massive health burden from extreme heat. 

But far outside of downtowns, where homes and buildings get farther and farther apart, rural regions face their own long-running challenges that exacerbate the dangers of extreme heat. 

A major factor: the median age of the rural population is older than in cities. That matters, because on a physiological level, older adults struggle more to cope with heat than the young. People living in rural communities also have double the rates of chronic health conditions that enhance the damage from heat like high blood pressure and emphysema compared to people living in urban zip codes.

Rural infrastructure is another vulnerability. While there may be more forests and farms in the country that can cool the air, the buildings there are often older, with less adequate insulation and cooling systems for this new era of severe heat. Manufactured and mobile homes, more common in rural areas, are particularly sensitive to heat. In Arizona's Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, mobile homes make up 5 percent of the housing stock but account for 30 percent of indoor heat deaths.

Even if rural residents have air conditioners and fans, they tend to have lower incomes and thus devote a higher share of their spending for electricity, up to 40 percent more than city dwellers, which makes it less affordable for them to stay cool. That's if they can get electricity at all: Rural areas are more vulnerable to outages due to older infrastructure and the long distances that power lines have to be routed, creating greater chances of problems like tree branches falling on lines. According to the US Census Bureau, 35.4 percent of households in rural areas experienced an outage over the course of a year, compared to 22.8 percent of households in urban areas. 

Sparsely populated communities also have fewer public spaces, such as shopping malls and libraries, where people can pass a hot summer day. Rural economies also depend more on outdoor labor, and there are still no federal workplace heat regulations. Farmworkers, construction crews, and delivery drivers are especially vulnerable to hot weather, and an average of 40 workers die each year from extreme heat.

The health infrastructure is lacking as well. “There is a longstanding healthcare crisis in rural areas,” said Grace Wickerson, senior manager for climate and health at the Federation of American Scientists. There aren't always nearby clinics and hospitals that can quickly treat heat emergencies. “To really take care of someone when they're actually in full-on heat stroke, they need to be cooled down in a matter of minutes,” Wickerson said. 

The Phoenix Fire Department has now started using ice immersion for heat stroke victims when transporting patients to hospitals to buy precious time. But rural emergency responders are less likely to have tools like this in their ambulances. “In Montana, which has not traditionally seen a lot of extreme heat, you would not have those tools on your truck and not have that awareness to do that cooling. When you see someone who has to also then travel miles to get care, that's going to worsen their health related outcomes,” Wickerson said. 

Emergency response times are generally much longer in rural areas, sometimes extending more than 25 minutes. People also have lower incomes and lower rates of insurance far from cities. Hospitals in rural areas are closing down as well. So when severe heat sets in, rural healthcare systems can get overwhelmed easily. 

Looking at data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Census Bureau, Wickerson and her collaborators mapped out how all these underlying factors are converging with extreme heat. They found that 59 percent of urban zip codes and 54 percent of rural zip codes are highly vulnerable to extreme heat as defined by the CDC's Heat and Health Index, meaning they are much more likely to see health problems from extreme heat. So while rural areas may be cooler, the people living there face heat dangers comparable to those in much hotter cities, and geographically, they cover a much wider expanse of the country.

So while temperatures out in the sticks may not climb to the same peaks they do in downtowns, urban heat islands are surrounded by an ocean of rural heat vulnerabilities. 

There are ways to reduce the dangers of scorching weather across vast swaths of the country, but they aren't fast or cheap. They require big upgrades to infrastructure — more robust energy delivery, more shade and green spaces, better insulation, cool roofs, and more energy-efficient cooling. 

Countering extreme heat also requires bigger structural investments to reverse the ongoing rural healthcare crisis where a doctor shortage, hospital closures, and longer emergency response times are converging. But the Republican budget proposal will do the opposite, cutting healthcare access for millions of Americans that would, in turn, lead to dozens of hospitals closing down, mainly in rural areas. 

Protecting people from dangerous heat also demands policy changes. Most states don't have any worker protections on the books for extreme heat. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is in the process of creating the first federal heat safety standard for employers, requiring them to give employees breaks, water, and shade when it gets hot. But it's not clear how strong the final regulation will be given that the Trump administration has been working to weaken rules across the board. 

Cities and local governments could also impose rules that prevent utilities from shutting off power to customers during heat waves, similar to regulations that limit heat shutoffs during the winter. 

But there are limits to how much people can adapt to hotter temperatures. Even places with a long history of managing heat are seeing more deaths and hospitalizations as relentless temperatures continue to mount. That means curbing the ongoing warming trend has to be part of the solution as well, reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow climate change.

Fox News' Christina Coleman reports on the state competition that sparked protests and saw competitors share a podium.

The mother of Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes made her stance on transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports clear during a recent podcast interview.

Randi Mahomes was on the "MOMetize Your Passion" podcast with Tirralan Watkins and brought up the recent controversy in California high school sports that saw a transgender track and field athlete win events over biological girls.

The issue captured the attention of the U.S., including President Donald Trump.

Watkins asked Mahomes about her thoughts on transgender athletes competing against girls in terms of fairness.

"Personally, from being a woman and a girl and doing co-ed teams throughout my life and just having fun in sports there is a huge difference between male and female," she told Watkins. "There is a huge difference and as a female I just think that it is not a fair matchup. A transgender, I am OK with, I understand, I love everyone. But when it comes to physical strength and you know just our DNA I don't think it's fair.

TRAVIS HUNTER SECURES UNPRECEDENTED ROOKIE DEAL WITH JAGUARS, WHO MAKE UNIQUE ANNOUNCEMENT

"… I just think maybe they create a league that everyone that's transgender could go to and have a fair game or activity. I just think there is a difference in DNA. I just think that women really need to be with women. And men need to be with men. I think that makes it fair. That is just my personal beliefs. Other places, you know whatever, but I just think in sports and community I just don't agree with it just because physically women are not as strong as men."

Mahomes has not been afraid to share her opinions.

Fox News' David Spunt reports the latest on national security concerns related to Iranian sleeper cells. Fox News contributor Joey Jones also weighed in on the threat during 'The Faulkner Focus' and addressed growing antisemitism nationwide.

EXCLUSIVE: At least five more Iranian nationals were arrested on Monday in addition to the 11 announced by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday morning.

On Monday, 45-year-old Mohammad Hassanpoor was arrested by officers in Baltimore and given a "Third County Notice." He was previously criminally convicted of "assault with a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury," where he was sentenced to just under a year behind bars. 

He was also previously sentenced roughly three months behind bars for "battery: spouse/ex sp/date/etc." and sentenced to two years for stalking.

Kaveh Abedi, 45, was arrested in Chicago on Monday for "violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act" and had a 2001 conviction for selling cocaine.

Arish Rustami was also arrested and has a prior sex offense, and Abdolmohammad Raghibzadeh was taken into ICE custody on Monday. He's had a deportation order since November 2005 from an Arizona immigration judge, and he's currently an Iranian citizen, according to ICE.

In 1999, he previously faced arrests for "domestic violence, vandalism and intimidation" and faced 90 days behind bars and five years of probation as a result. He faced two other arrests and jail time for "violations of probation of the previous crimes."

In May 2006, Raghibzadeh could not get proper paperwork to go back to Iran, so he was given an "order of supervision" and then released.  But in 2007, he was arrested again by sheriffs in Santa Ana, Calif., for not following probation and had to spend the rest of it at the California Chino Detention Center, according to ICE.

Sahand Yousefinasrabadi was arrested Monday by federal authorities "during targeted enforcement action" in Forth Worth, Texas. Yousefinasrabadi was convicted in Sept. 2013 of aggravated sexual assault of a child, and he was asked in October 2013 to leave the U.S. by an immigration judge.

The arrests come amid concerns about Iranian sleeper cells in the United States following the strikes on nuclear sites in the Middle Eastern nation. While there is currently a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, DHS noted the arrests made since Sunday.

"Under Secretary Noem, DHS has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden's fraudulent parole programs or otherwise," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement about the initial 11 arrests that were publicly announced. 

"We have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out—and we are. We don't wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump's mandate to secure the homeland," McLaughlin added.

Former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps member Mehran Makari Saheli was arrested by ICE in Minnesota, and DHS said he has "admitted connections to Hezbollah" and stayed in the U.S. despite being court-ordered to leave in June 2022.

During the Biden administration alone, 729 out of the roughly 1,500 Iranian nationals that came into the country illegally were released into the U.S.

Live Updates


• Trump weighs in: President Donald Trump flashed intense anger today as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile. Before heading to the NATO summit in the Netherlands, the president conveyed he was particularly unhappy with Israel, which he said quickly violated the truce. Trump also said he does not seek regime change in Iran because he doesn't want to see “chaos.”
    


• Ceasefire violations alleged: Israel struck a radar site north of Tehran hours after the ceasefire was due to take effect, following accusations that Iran had fired several missiles at Israel. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel refrained from conducting further strikes after Netanyahu spoke to Trump in what a White House source said was a “firm and direct” call.
    


• CNN poll on strikes: Meanwhile, the US president's decision to launch airstrikes against Iran during the weekend is broadly unpopular with Americans, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after the strikes.
    


            Israel's “campaign against Iran” is not over, the country's military chief said Tuesday.
    


            Speaking at a situational assessment after the Israel-Iran ceasefire took effect, Israeli Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said that a “significant phase” has ended and that Israel is entering a “new phase, based on the achievements of the current one.”
    


            The military chief cautioned challenges remain for the armed forces, and he urged them to remain focused amid the ongoing campaign in Gaza.
    


            “Now the focus shifts back to Gaza — to bring the hostages home and to dismantle the Hamas regime,” he said.
    


            On the rubble-strewn streets of Beer Sheva, Yogev Kudady and his wife were sitting on the sidewalk, hardly able to speak.
    


            The city in southern Israel was one of the last places targeted by Iran before a ceasefire between the two countries came into effect Tuesday. Just before 6 a.m. local time, a ballistic missile slammed into a residential building, killing at least four people.
    


            By the afternoon, the residents of Beer Sheva were still trying to come to terms with what had happened.
    


                    “I'm speechless. I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do,” Kudady told CNN. “It's like a nightmare.”
                





            Kudady, his wife and their four children — aged 10, 8, 5 and 1 — took cover in a bomb shelter after Israeli authorities issued an air raid warning. “I told my family, keep close to each other, and close to the wall,” he said. Their house was damaged in the blast.
    


            Dana Blitz, 21, lives in a building near the one struck by the missile. The blast from the explosion shattered her windows, filling a room with “dust and glass,” she told CNN. She said her front door, made of sturdy metal, was bent in half and the ceiling had collapsed.
    


            Blitz said she was “heartbroken” by the damage to her childhood home. “I'm so glad the house didn't fall down,” she said.
    


            Blitz said she had been “paranoid” about a possible attack for days, and she had prepared a bag of her belongings in case she had to evacuate.
    


            “Everybody says, ‘It's not going to happen to me, it's not going to happen around me.' But you never know,” she said.
    


            Iranian media outlets are broadcasting footage of a large crowd gathering in central Tehran, which they report is showing support and appreciation for the country's armed forces.
    


            The gathering in Revolution Square was reported by state and state-affiliated news agencies IRNA, Fars and Mehr.
    


            According to reports, demonstrators are vowing to stand by the armed forces until the end, praising their “crushing response to the aggressions” of Israel and the United States.
    


            Video footage broadcast by Iranian media outlets showed people chanting in support of Iran while carrying Iranian flags and posters of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
    


            It's unclear whether the Iranian regime organized the rally.
    


            Iranian airspace partially reopened today, following the country's ceasefire with Israel after 12 days of hostilities, according to aviation monitoring company FlightRadar24.
    


            “Iranian airspace is now open to international arrivals and departures to/from Tehran with prior permission,” FlightRadar24 said on X.
    


            Iraqi airspace has also reopened, it added.
    


            Iran “does not seek nuclear weapons in any way” but is “only seeking its legitimate rights,” its President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Tuesday, according to the state-affiliated Fars News Agency.
    


            “Iran is not Gaza or Lebanon that cannot respond to the military attacks of the Zionist regime,” Pezeshkian said during a phone call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
    


                    “We expect you to explain to them in your interactions with America that the Islamic Republic of Iran is only seeking its legitimate rights and has no desire beyond that, it has not and does not seek nuclear weapons in any way,” Pezeshkian said as cited by Fars News Agency.
                





            Iran “is only seeking to create a good future for its people, the region, and other countries by interacting with its neighbors and other countries,” Pezeshkian added.
    


            Iran has maintained that it does not seek to build nuclear weapons. It has spent decades developing its nuclear program and has seen it as a source of national pride and sovereignty. It says the program is solely for peaceful energy purposes and plans to build additional nuclear power plants to meet domestic energy needs and free up more oil for export.
    


            Classified briefings on the situation in Iran set to take place on Capitol Hill today have been postponed, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            The all-Senate briefing has been moved to Thursday, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Two separate sources familiar told CNN the briefing for all House lawmakers has also been postponed. It was not immediately clear why it was being delayed or when it would be rescheduled.
    


            President Donald Trump took credit for brokering peace between Israel and Iran, framing the recent ceasefire as a direct result of US airstrikes authorized under his leadership.
    


                    “Both Israel and Iran wanted to stop the War, equally! It was my great honor to Destroy All Nuclear facilities & capability, and then, STOP THE WAR!” he said on Truth Social.
                





            Trump is currently on his way to the NATO summit in the Netherlands.
    


            US lawmakers were expected to receive classified briefings this afternoon on the situation in Iran, but sources tell CNN that they have been postponed.
    


            “President (Donald) Trump owes the facts to the American people, and so far, we've received no real information in the Congress,” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN earlier today.
    


            Blumenthal said Trump deserves credit “if, in fact, Iran's nuclear capability has been destroyed,” adding that the Israeli forces and US military also played a significant role.
    


            ﻿North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer said, “I'd like to hear some real specifics about what we know about any missing materials that there may or may not be and what Israel would know about them.”
    


Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, told CNN that he didn't believe Trump's decision to strike the nuclear facilities was well thought out and that he wanted more details. “In my view, this was somewhat reckless,” he said.
    


            On the House side, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries argued that Trump has “botched” his promises to bring peace to the region.
    


                    “The real question that people are asking here in America is what the F is Donald Trump doing,” Jeffries told reporters this morning, referring to Trump's comments earlier that Israel and Iran “don't know what the fuck they're doing.”
                





Speaker Mike Johnson told members at a House Republican conference meeting that he spoke with Trump earlier in the morning, and the president told him he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to retaliate against Iran, according to a person in room. Punchbowl News first reported on Johnson's comment to members.
    


            Johnson also insisted that ceasefire will hold, though he acknowledged it is “fragile,” and dismissed allegations from Democrats — and some Republicans — that Trump violated the War Powers Act by striking Iran without congressional approval. Johnson, a former constitutional lawyer, told reporters he is “persuaded” by the argument that the War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional.
    


            Republican Rep. Buddy Carter, who is running for US Senate in Georgia, announced that he has nominated President Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his handling of the Iran-Israel conflict.
    


            “There's no one else who deserves it more than this president deserves it,” he said.
    


This post has been updated with additional remarks.



            President Donald Trump showed visible anger this morning as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile.
    


            Trump was critical of both sides, but reserved his harshest condemnation for Israel, which he said “unloaded” on Iran “as soon as we made the deal.”
    


Here's what else the president said:



            Iran's president has said the country will not violate the terms of its ceasefire with Israel, unless Israel breaks the pact first, as reported by state-affiliated Nour News
    


                    “Iran will not violate the ceasefire, unless the Zionist regime does,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a statement Tuesday, according to Nour News. “Tehran is ready for talks and to defend the rights of the Iranian people at the negotiation table.”
                





            Israel had earlier accused Iran of breaking the terms of the deal, announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday, by firing rockets into Israel hours after it went into effect. Tehran denied it had broken the ceasefire.
    


            President Donald Trump has walked back his comments of the possibility of a regime change in Iran following weekend strikes on three nuclear facilities.
    


            Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University Qatar, explains why regime change in Iran is complex. “Popular discontent, by itself, is not enough, for the collapse of the government,” Kamrava said.
    


Watch Kamrava discuss the feasibility of the Iranian regime collapsing:



            President Donald Trump shared screenshots on social media of a message he received from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who lauded him for his “decisive action” in Iran.
    


            “Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, that was truly extraordinary, and something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer,” Rutte wrote in the first message Trump published.
    


Trump makes his way to NATO summit: The messages show Rutte also praised Trump for securing a landmark defense spending agreement among NATO allies.
    


            “You are flying into another big success in The Hague this evening, it was not easy but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent,” Rutte added, referring to Trump's push for NATO allies to increase defense spending.
    


            A NATO official confirmed to CNN that the messages shared by Trump on Truth Social were sent by Rutte.
    


            NATO is preparing to announce a new commitment requiring all member nations to spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense, a longtime demand of Trump's, which now seems closer than ever to becoming official policy.
    


This post has been updated with confirmation that Rutte sent the messages to Trump.

            The US military's second-most senior officer overseeing the Middle East told lawmakers today that he believes Iran “has been weakened” since the October 7, 2023 attacks. He added that Israel's campaign against Iran has helped American national security.
    


                    “At the strategic level, I think they've been weakened since the events of 7 October. At the tactical level, I think they've been degraded, and the degree to which that degradation has taken place — particularly in the last 12 days — is best discussed in a classified form,” Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of US Central Command who has been nominated to take over as commander, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
                





            Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the committee, asked him: “Would you agree with me that the remarkable effectiveness of Israel's military campaign against Iran and against its terrorist proxies has directly effected in a positive way American national security?”
    


            “I would, sir,” Cooper responded.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that he does not want a regime change in Iran because he does not want to see “chaos.”
    


            Asked to clarify a social media post from over the weekend where he floated the possibility of regime change, Trump told reporters on Air Force One: “No, if there was, there was, but no I don't want it. I'd like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible.”
    


                    “Regime change takes chaos, and ideally we don't want to see so much chaos,” the president added. “You know, the Iranians are very good traders, very good business people, and they've got a lot of oil. They should be fine. They should be able to rebuild and do a good job. They're never going to have nuclear but other than that, they should do a great job.”
                





            Trump had raised the possibility of a change in leadership in Iran after the US struck three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend.
    


            “It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.
    


            At least 606 people have been killed in Iran since Israel launched its attack on June 13, including 107 on Monday alone, according to figures shared by Iran's health ministry during a crisis meeting in Tehran on Tuesday.
    


            The ministry said 95% of the victims died at the scene of the attacks, with Monday marking the deadliest day of the conflict.
    


            Israel struck a radar site north of Tehran on Tuesday but refrained from conducting further strikes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Donald Trump, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement.
    


            The strike on Iran, which was launched hours after the ceasefire was due to go into effect, came after Israeli officials accused Tehran of violating the truce by firing several missiles at Israel.
    


            The PMO said Trump “expressed his great appreciation for Israel” and that Netanyahu committed to refrain from additional strikes.
    


Trump-Netanyahu call: A White House source told CNN that Trump spoke to Netanyahu Tuesday morning and was “exceptionally firm and direct.”
    


            Iran's state-affiliated news agency Fars said Tuesday that its correspondent heard explosions in northern Iran, hours after Israel and Iran agreed to the ceasefire.
    


            The Fars correspondent reported that an explosion was heard in the coastal city of Babolsar, north of Tehran. Rescue vehicles and ambulances are moving toward the site of the explosion, Fars said.
    


            According to Israel, two Iranian ballistic missiles were launched toward Israel approximately three hours after the ceasefire announced by Trump went into effect. At the White House, Trump later described it as “one rocket that didn't land — that was shot — perhaps by mistake, that didn't land.”
    


            With a war they “did not want” on their doorstep, Gulf nations are gripped by “fear,” Greg Carlstrom, Middle East correspondent at The Economist, told CNN's Becky Anderson on CNN Newsroom.
    


            The ceasefire is “remarkable,” he said. “I can't think of another time when a country has been attacked and then turns around the next morning and brokers a ceasefire involving the country that attacked it and another country.”
    


            Carlstrom said the swift diplomatic choreography reflects “deep unease” across the Gulf, especially in Qatar, where residents were sent running for cover as missiles and interceptor fragments fell near shopping malls and roads.
    


            “These are countries in the Gulf that have long prided themselves on being oases of stability in an otherwise very chaotic region,” he added. “They did not want this war between Israel and Iran to have ripple effects, to come home.”
    


            The Kremlin has welcomed the news of a ceasefire between its ally Iran and Israel on Tuesday, a day after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
    


            “If a ceasefire has indeed been reached, then this can and should only be welcomed,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters during his daily briefing on Tuesday.
    


            “This is what the Russian Federation has been calling for from the very beginning of this conflict,” he said, adding, “We hope that this will be a sustainable ceasefire.”
    


            Iran has been one of Russia's strongest allies during its war on Ukraine and Moscow was quick to condemn US attacks against Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.
    


            Peskov said that Araghchi “highly praised” Russia's “clear position” on the Middle East crisis when he met Putin on Monday.
    


            Asked about a Reuters report that Araghchi delivered a letter from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to Putin requesting additional support, Peskov denied he had done so but acknowledged that certain messages were conveyed.
    


            “There was no written document,” Peskov said. “It is true that there were some signals from the Iranian leadership, but overall, the Reuters report does not reflect reality.”
    


            Peskov added that Iran and Russia did not discuss Tehran's response to the American strikes during the talks in Moscow.
    


            President Donald Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday morning and was “exceptionally firm and direct,” a White House source said about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire.
    


            This source said Netanyahu understood the severity of the situation and Trump's concerns.
    


            Trump, who was jubilant yesterday evening when he announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, stayed up well into the night watching the coverage as it was set to go into effect.
    


            He became increasingly angry when he believed both countries were violating the agreement, several sources told CNN — anger that was on full display as he departed for his trip to the NATO summit.
    


            US and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have “destroyed” Iran's centrifuge program, used to enrich uranium close to weapons-grade levels, according to an assessment by a former United Nations nuclear weapons inspector.
    


            David Albright, now president of the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), told CNN that, having reviewed satellite imagery and spoken to sources with knowledge of Iran's nuclear program, he assesses that Iran's centrifuge program has been “destroyed,” after the US joined Israel's strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


                    “It's amazing how much damage has been done to that program. I think that part of the mission has been accomplished,” Albright said Tuesday.
                





Uranium stockpile: However, Albright said “residual” parts of Iran's program likely remained intact, most importantly its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a short step away from the 90% needed to build a nuclear weapon.
    


            Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on Monday was unable to confirm the whereabouts of Iran's 400-kilogram (880-pound) stockpile of this nuclear material. Grossi said Iran “made no secret that they have protected this material,” amid speculation that Iran moved the stockpile to a safer location before Sunday's strikes.
    


            But even if Iran was able to safely hide its enriched uranium, Albright said that turning this into weapons-grade material “is not going to be a fast process,” since the US and Israeli bombing campaign has “done serious damage to build a nuclear weapon.” He assessed that it would take Iran “a good year or two” to build a nuclear weapon, if it chose to reconstitute its program.
    


            Albright detailed how Iran's Fordow plant, buried deep in a mountain, had been targeted by the US strikes, which used 12 “bunker buster” bombs to penetrate the rock.
    


            By analyzing post-strike satellite imagery — and using designs of the plant from before the strike — Albright said the US strikes had targeted parts of the site that were particularly vulnerable: a ventilation shaft that is “absolutely critical” to the operations, and a target above where the centrifuges are stored.
    


            Albright stressed that insider information will be required to be certain of the extent of the damage, but said the satellite imagery suggested that the Fordow plant had been destroyed.

Trump border czar Tom Homan joins ‘Mornings with Maria' to discuss border security, deportation operations, and Iran. 

Biden-era open border policies have ignited concerns that Iranian "sleeper cells" could be lying in wait inside the U.S., eager to retaliate after tensions with the U.S. adversary reached a boiling point over the weekend, and the prospect has officials on high alert.

Border czar Tom Homan called it the "biggest national security vulnerability" the U.S. has ever seen.

"It's a significant threat," he said Tuesday on FOX Business' "Mornings with Maria."

"The average under the Biden administration every single day was 1,800 known gotaways… these are people we knew came to the United States and entered illegally. We don't know who they are, where they came from, why they're here, but they got away." 

Homan stressed that the sleeper cell prospect has been one of his top concerns for years. Now, the Trump administration is focused on "clean[ing] up" the mess left by the previous administration, an effort that started with securing the border.

"We knew we had a big job to do, and we're working on it," he said.

Former acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf echoed Homan in citing the countless number of unidentified foreign nationals who poured across the U.S. border under former President Biden's tenure.

"This is a real concern, and, unfortunately, four years of the Biden administration will eventually have consequences," Wolf said during an appearance on "America's Newsroom" on Tuesday.

Speaking to guest host Bill Melugin, he warned that "Hezbollah and Hamas and others" are already in the United States. 

"We'll see if they are activated. We'll see if they're inspired. The FBI and local law enforcement – I know they're doing everything that they can…" he added.

A senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) source recently revealed that over 1,500 Iranian nationals who illegally entered the U.S. at the southern border were arrested under the Biden administration, and nearly 50% of them were released back into the country.

Hours after President Trump addressed the nation about successful military strikes against key Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend, the DHS issued a memo sounding the alarm on a "heightened threat environment" in the U.S.

The bulletin came as Iranian officials warned of retaliation against the U.S., but did not cite any specific threats.

People across the nation discuss President Trump's strike against Iran and if they make America safer.

Everyday Americans around the country sounded off this week on President Donald Trump's strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities that made headlines around the globe.

Most of the people Fox News Digital spoke to said they believe Trump's strikes on the country were warranted and make the world a safer place. 

"I support it fully. Honestly, I think it took too long. We can't have a threat like that existing, so I totally support it," said Gary, a native of Oklahoma City.

The U.S. military on Saturday carried out massive precision strikes on three key nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, to eliminate the threat the country manufacturing a nuclear weapon. Long-range B-2 stealth bomber aircraft dropped 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on the locations in an attack that Trump called "a spectacular military success."

The president announced on Truth Social on Monday that both Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire following the U.S. strikes, although a frustrated Trump lashed out at both countries on Tuesday morning for continued hostilities.

Fox News Digital spoke to Americans about what they thought about Trump's strikes on Iran prior to news of the cease-fire and its subsequent breaching.

"I think it's something that needed to be done. You can't let them have a nuclear weapon," South Carolina resident Raymond told Fox News Digital while in Alexandria, Va.

Tim, from Las Vegas, considered it a bold and necessary move on the part of Trump. "Sometimes you gotta go for the jugular, and you know, to make a point to try and alleviate the rest of it."

Eric, a California native living in Alexandria, said, "It's somewhat of a necessity. I think with how Iran is actually the only real big threat to America, I think it's somewhat a positive thing."

"Thank God we have a chief executive that has the guts and the common sense to do what's right," said Ron, from Tennessee.

Another man in Jersey City told Fox, "I think he did what he [had] to do as he promised to take care of this country and protect us."

However, not everyone was convinced it was the best decision. Nerissa in Birmingham, Mich., told Fox that Trump should have exercised more caution before bombing Iran. 

"I feel like there could have been a little more counseling, a little more opinions. A couple more people could have put in a word before we went through and just kind of did it," Nerissa said.

In the same city, Pamela said, "if we get into this war, we will regret it in more ways than one, particularly the casualties that will take place."

Houston native Kaden said, "I don't see it as a big enough threat to do it. And I believe it was kind of wrong, you know, getting involved in a war that we shouldn't have really got involved with."

When asked if the U.S. strike made the country more or less safe, many said it makes the country safer. 

Raymond said, "I think it makes us safer in the long run. Anybody or any country that says ‘Death to America,' I think is safer that they do not have a weapon like that."

Tammy from Fort Pierce, Florida told Fox that the move "made America more safe."

"We are protecting not only America, but the world from terrorists and nuclear weapons," she added. 

A handful of those polled, however, said the country is less safe now following the attack. 

Paige in Birmingham said she feels "Not safe," noting, "I'm definitely nervous for sure."

Nerissa said she feels uneasy after the strikes, stating, "It's a little bit of a situation that we don't have much information on so just the lack of knowledge does make you on edge for sure."

Federal immigration officers carried out the arrests of 11 illegal immigrants from Iran who were living in the United States, a precautionary move that unfolded over the weekend amid rising tensions between both nations.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday morning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had arrested 11 Iranian nationals, including one person with ties to the Hezbollah terrorist organization, a known or suspected terrorist, and a suspected former sniper from the Iranian army.

“Under Secretary Noem, DHS has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden's fraudulent parole programs or otherwise,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “We have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out — and we are. We don't wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump's mandate to secure the homeland.”

The arrests occurred amid attacks between Israel and Iran, as well as a U.S. airstrike on Iran, over the past several days.

On Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for allowing Iranian “super cells” to enter the U.S.

“[President Joe] Biden let a lot of stupid stuff in,” Trump told reporters en route to the Netherlands. “And among everything else he let a lot of super cells in. Many from Iran. But hopefully we'll take care of it.”

Trump's reference to “super cells” was likely a misspoken reference to “sleeper cells,” or groups of terrorists who are inactive and quiet before carrying out an attack.

In addition to the 11 Iranians arrested, ICE also took into custody a U.S. citizen who is accused of threatening to kill an ICE employee while harboring an Iranian national.

Ribvar Karimi of Locust, Alabama, is believed to have been an Iranian army sniper from 2018 to 2021 based on the discovery of an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card found at the time of his arrest. Karimi initially entered the U.S. on a K-1 visa in October 2024 on the basis that he was marrying a U.S. citizen. However, he never adjusted his immigration status, which is a violation of the law and makes him deportable.

Behzad Sepehrian Bahary Nejad had been ordered deported and was found carrying a loaded 9 mm pistol when he was arrested on Sunday. Nejad entered the U.S. in 2016 on an F-1 student visa. He was arrested in 2017 by Harris County, Texas, police for assaulting a family member by impeding breathing.

The University of Texas, where Nejad attended school, terminated his enrollment in 2018, and he was ordered deported by a federal immigration judge in 2019.

Another Houston resident, Hamid Reza Bayat, was ordered deported almost 20 years ago. He was previously convicted twice of drug crimes, as well as driving on a suspended license.

Mehrzad Asadi Eidivand was arrested by ICE in Tempe, Arizona, and had been ordered deported after he crossed the border in Southern California in 2012. Eidivand was convicted of threatening a law enforcement officer and being an illegal immigrant in possession of a firearm.

ICE also arrested Linet Vartaniann at the same Tempe residence. Vartaniann is a U.S. citizen who threatened police against arresting Eidivand. DHS said Vartaniann threatened to open fire on ICE officials if they entered her home and then added that she would go outside and “shoot ICE officers in the head.”

Yousef Mehridehno of Gluckstadt, Mississippi, is an Iranian and a former lawful permanent resident in the U.S. His residency was terminated in 2017 after the U.S. government determined that he had lied on his original visa application and possibly committed marriage fraud. The FBI had listed Mehridehno on its terrorism watch list in February.

Colorado Springs, Colorado, residents and roommates Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour were arrested at the same time on Sunday. 

Shafiei was first encountered by federal immigration officials in Seattle in 1981, and he was ordered deported in 1987. He has been convicted of drug crimes, as well as arrested for assault and child abuse.

Mehdipour was arrested by Border Patrol agents during the Biden administration. He illegally crossed the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas in 2023.

ICE officers in St. Paul, Minnesota, took Mehran Makari Saheli on Sunday. He was previously convicted as a felon in possession of a firearm and is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, “with admitted connections to Hezbollah,” according to the DHS. He was ordered deported in 2022 but had not been arrested.

Bahman Alizadeh Asfestani was nabbed by ICE officers in San Francisco. He was convicted in 1994 for petty theft and then convicted of possession of a controlled substance for sale the following year.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE THREE IRAN NUCLEAR SITES TARGETED IN US STRIKES

ICE officers in Buffalo, New York, arrested Mohammad Rafikian, who was previously convicted of grand larceny, schemes to defraud, criminal impersonation, and practicing as an attorney.

Arkavan Babk Moirokorli was arrested by San Diego ICE officers and was previously convicted of forging an official seal.

Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) is the new ranking member for the House Oversight Committee after the Democratic caucus overwhelmingly voted for him on Tuesday morning.

Garcia defeated Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) in a 150-63 vote. Reps. Kweisi Mfume (D-MD) and Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) dropped out shortly before the final vote, after the Steering Committee recommended Garcia for the role in a Monday evening vote. 

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE: WHAT TO KNOW AS TRUMP ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PREDECESSOR

Garcia's selection is a win for progressive Democrats, who have been eager to see fresh blood in the leadership ranks since the party's defeat in 2024. Many had eyed Crockett for the role, given her ascension as a figurehead and vocal mouthpiece for the Democrats.

The caucus decided Garcia was the best fit to serve as the top Democrat on the powerful House committee, which has been focused lately on investigating former President Joe Biden and his use of the autopen.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters leaving the caucus meeting that she voted for Garcia, quipping, “Well, I'm a Californian,” noting that she is also “partial to mayors.” Garcia served as the mayor of Long Beach before heading to Congress.

Pelosi said she thought all four candidates were “excellent.”

“I think any one of them could have done a great job internally,” she said. “Question is, how to spread that word outside?”

Garcia will succeed Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, who died in office this year. Garcia will be the chief antagonist to Rep. James Comer (R-KY), who is chairman of the House Oversight Committee and is leading a wide-ranging investigation into Biden's health while in office and whether aides covered up his decline.

Comer congratulated Garcia in a statement on Tuesday shortly after the election.

“Following the passing of our friend and colleague, Gerry Connolly, Ranking Member Garcia has big shoes to fill,” Comer said. “While I'm sure we'll have our fair share of spirited debates and disagreements, I look forward to working together wherever we can find common ground.”

Crockett told reporters ahead of Tuesday's full-caucus vote that the Steering Committee result, in which she got the lowest number of votes, was a “loud signal” that Democratic leaders did not want her style of leadership. 

“They were clear that I was the one that made least sense in their minds,” the Texas Democrat said. 

“I think the people may be disappointed, but at the end of the day, we've got to move forward in this country. … I don't want to be an impediment,” Crockett added. “I will still be me. I will still be loud and proud. I mean, I will still do my things. It's just that I will have less structure, and I won't have a budget to be able to kind of do the more robust things that I wanted to do to hopefully push this caucus in a place in which people start to trust us.” 

STEFANIK MOUNTS ‘SHADOW CAMPAIGN' FOR NEW YORK GOVERNOR AFTER UN LETDOWN

Mfume said he withdrew his name for consideration because the “preservation of the institution and the success of the Democratic Caucus are paramount to me.”

“Steve Lynch and Robert Garcia are friends who I have the utmost respect for, either of which will lead our Party well as we move forward to blunt the Trump administration and to fight for justice and civil rights for all Americans,” Mfume said before the final vote.

A visibly frustrated President Donald Trump said he is "not happy" with Israel for threatening the fragile ceasefire with Iran, as he said both countries "don't know what the f*** they're doing."

Former Cincinnati Reds shortstop Zack Cozart backtracked on his criticism of President Donald Trump and his plan to intervene in Iran and strike the country's nuclear facilities.

Cozart, a one-time All-Star, wrote on social media last week that he would "no longer support" the president if the U.S. was dragged into a war with Iran and Israel. However, after the president announced that a ceasefire agreement had been reached, Cozart fired off a new reaction.

"I'll gladly eat my words for what has transpired today… lesson learned to trust the man," he wrote on X.

Cozart was far from the only person in the sports world to heap praise on Trump after Iran's retaliatory attack on a U.S. base in Qatar failed to do much of anything.

Auburn Tigers men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl wrote on social media that Trump should earn the Nobel Peace Prize.

"This is what a peace maker and the leader of the free world does, he steps in when both sides can't agree and he gives them an offer they can't refuse," the college basketball coach wrote on X. "He should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. I pray that all sides can offer some grace and keep the peace."

Trump on Tuesday made his way to a NATO summit while the ceasefire between Iran and Israel hung in the balance. He told the two countries to quit firing missiles at each other after the deal was brokered.

"I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning," Trump told reporters before he left.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to 'Sunday Morning Futures' following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites and why the Iranian regime underestimated President Trump.

The Trump administration's successful surprise strikes on Iran on Saturday night were executed without issue after the National Security Council saw massive overhauls earlier in 2025, and the national security advisor was replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to fulfill an additional job role that critics said would likely end in failure. 

President Donald Trump made a surprise announcement on Truth Social Saturday evening announcing the U.S. military carried out successful strikes on a trio of Iranian nuclear facilities as tensions and conflict heightened between Iran and Israel since June 12. 

"A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan," Trump said from the White House in an address to the nation just hours after the Truth Social announcement. "Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success." 

By Monday evening, Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire with Trump declaring the "12 Day War" was over following the U.S. strikes. 

The operation, which was also praised by Pentagon brass as a total success, was executed after the Trump administration slashed the National Security Council and replaced former national security advisor Mike Waltz with Rubio, who currently serves four different roles within the administration. 

Democratic lawmakers and former National Security Council staffers seethed against potential and finalized cuts to the council, alleging that Trump was politicizing and potentially crippling national security. 

TRUMP TO MEET WITH SECURITY TEAM AFTER US CARRIED OUT 'OPERATION MIDNIGHT HAMMER'

The Trump administration and its supporters, however, viewed the overhauls as the president coming through on his campaign promise to strip Washington of the "deep state" and streamline the office. 

The National Security Council operates within the White House to advise the president on foreign policy issues. 

It is chaired by the president, with other members including the vice president, the secretaries of state, treasury and defense, and the assistant to the president for national security affairs. Other staffers on the council include foreign policy experts who frequently join the team on loan from the Pentagon or State Department.

The Trump administration has made a handful of cuts to the National Security Council since Inauguration Day, most notably trimming roughly half of the National Security Council's 350-person team in May, Fox Digital previously reported. Waltz, who served as Trump's national security advisor for roughly 100 days, was removed from the post May 1 and named Trump's nominee to serve as ambassador to the U.N. following a Signal chat leak with a journalist.

Following Waltz's departure, Trump named Rubio as his acting national security advisor, and he carried out a massive overhaul to the office, including trimming it of more than 100 staffers ahead of Memorial Day.

"The NSC is the ultimate Deep State. It's Marco vs. the Deep State. We're gutting the Deep State," a White House official told Axios in May as Rubio took a hatchet to the NSC staff. 

A White House official told Fox Digital on Monday that Rubio's joint roles have allowed for "greater coordination between the State Department and White House," which they said has led to "more efficient execution of the president's foreign policy agenda." 

Democrats, however, predicted that Rubio serving simultaneously as chief of the State Department and Trump's national security advisor, would prove to be a failure. They argued that he would be unable to juggle the high-profiled roles, in addition to serving as acting archivist of the U.S., as well as acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

"There's no way he can do that and do it well, especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD with Pete Hegseth being secretary of defense and just the hollowing out of the top leadership," Illinois Democrat Sen. Tammy Duckworth said on CBS' "Face the Nation" last month. "There's no way he can carry all that entire load on his own."

HEGSETH, PENTAGON BRASS PRAISE TRUMP'S 'SPECTACULAR' MILITARY SUCCESS IN IRAN NUCLEAR STRIKES

"I don't know how anybody could do these two big jobs," Democrat Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."

Fast-forward less than two months; Trump and his national security team executed "Operation Midnight Hammer" in Iran, which has received widespread support among Republicans and a handful of Democrats. Historic critics of the president, such as Democrat New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, however, have railed against the operation as bypassing congressional authority. 

"The success of Operation Midnight Hammer speaks to the unmatched capabilities of the United States military, as well as President Trump's brilliant foreign policy strategy, which included working closely with his national security team to flawlessly execute this mission and obliterate Iran's ability to possess a nuclear weapon," White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told Fox Digital on Monday. 

"As usual, Democrats and the legacy media were wrong – President Trump has rightfully placed immense trust in his top officials, including Secretary Rubio, Secretary Hegseth, and Director Gabbard, to help him make the world safer," she added. 

Trump repeatedly met with the National Security Council and other administration leaders between June 12 and last Saturday, when the strikes were ordered on Iran. 

Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Vice President JD Vance were fixtures of the discussions, with photos showing them criss-crossing in and out of the White House last week as they reported to the Situation Room to meet with the president. The trio of U.S. officials flanked Trump as he addressed the nation about the operation Saturday night. 

The White House sees a "substantial chance" for renewed negotiations with Iran. 

"For 40 years, Iran has been saying, ‘Death to America. Death to Israel.' They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs," Trump said in his address Saturday with the trio standing behind him. "That was their specialty. We lost over a thousand people, and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and around the world have died as a direct result of their hate, in particular."

"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated," Trump said. "And Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks would be far greater and a lot easier." 

The operation itself was cloaked in secrecy and took Iran and the world by surprise. Trump had said on Thursday – via comment from press secretary Karoline Leavitt – that he would make a decision on Iran within two weeks, which signaled a longer time frame than 48 hours for such a mission. 

RETIRED GENERAL TELLS CNN HE'S 'IMPRESSED' BY TRUMP STRIKING IRAN, SAYS AMERICAN LIVES POTENTIALLY SAVED

There were no media leaks or speculation that such strikes were imminent, while earlier on Saturday, six B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri were spotted en route to a U.S. Air Force base in Guam, which signaled the U.S. was likely making moves on Iran, but not in just mere hours from when news broke of the stealth bombers. The bombers were later revealed to be decoys. 

Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a press conference Sunday from the Pentagon, where they celebrated that strategic deception and misdirection played a key role in the operation. 

"At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprised of bombers launched from the continental United States," Caine said on Sunday. "As part of the plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy – a deception effort, known only to an extremely small number of planners and key leaders here in Washington and in Tampa." 

TRUMP ADDRESSES NATION ON 'SPECTACULAR MILITARY SUCCESS' OF US STRIKES ON IRANIAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES

Hegseth said in his remarks before the media Sunday morning that the U.S. military had leveraged "misdirection" and total secrecy, aside from top national security officials, to carry out the strikes "without the world knowing at all."

"It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security. Our B-2s went in and out of… these nuclear sites, in and out and back, without the world knowing at all," Hegseth said. "In that way, it was historic."

It was the longest B-2 spirit bomber mission since 2001, the second-longest B-2 mission ever flown and the largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history, Hegseth and Caine said during the Sunday press conference. 

Rubio spoke to the media on Sunday morning shows, telling "Sunday Morning Futures" host Maria Bartiromo that the "most important thing" Iran should realize following the strikes is "the game is up" and it's time for peace. 

"They have played the world for 40-something years with these nuclear talks and delaying things… they're not going to play President Trump, and they found out last night that when he says he's going to do something, he'll do it. And he doesn't want to do it. It's not his first choice, but it's the only choice. That's the choice the Iranian regime left us, because they play too many games," he said. 

Trump celebrated on Monday evening in another Truth Social post that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire deal and that the 12 Day War had ended.

"On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, "THE 12 DAY WAR." This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't, and never will! God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!" he wrote. 

Tensions are still flared in the Middle East, as both Israel and Iran accuse each other of violating the ceasefire on Tuesday morning, with Trump urging them to put down their weapons while triumphantly declaring Iran's nuclear capabilities have been crippled.

The Oklahoma City Thunder are the 2024/25 NBA Champions following a 103-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers. Tyrese Haliburton suffered a game-ending injury in the 1st quarter. Nick Wright, Chris Broussard, and Kevin Wildes look back at the series ...

Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton made a candid social media post reflecting on the team's NBA Finals loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder and the torn Achilles he suffered in Game 7.

Haliburton made a late-night post on X with a lengthy statement and a photo of himself in a hospital bed. It came more than 24 hours after he was seen writhing in pain on the floor at the Paycom Center.

"Man. Don't know how to explain it other than shock. Words cannot express the pain of this letdown. The frustration is unfathomable. I've worked my whole life to get to this moment and this is how it ends? Makes no sense," he wrote.

"Now that I've gotten surgery, I wish I could count the number of times people will tell me I'm going to ‘come back stronger'. What a cliche lol, this s--- sucks. My foot feels like dead weight fam. But what's hurting most I think is my mind. Feel like I'm rambling, but I know this is something I'll look back on when I'm through this, as something I'm proud I fought through. It feels good to let this s--- out without y'all seeing the kid ugly cry.

"At 25, I've already learned that God never gives us more than we can handle. I know I'll come out on the other side of this a better man and a better player. And honestly, right now, torn Achilles and all, I don't regret it. I'd do it again, and again after that, to fight for this city and my brothers. For the chance to do something special."

THREE ACHILLES INJURIES IN ONE NBA POSTSEASON: WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW IS IT FIXED?

Haliburton apologized to the city of Indianapolis for letting fans down, though he did nothing of the sort.

He delivered one of the most epic playoff performances in recent memory as he broke the hearts of fans in Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York on his way to the NBA Finals. He nearly did it in Oklahoma City if it was not for a calf strain that hampered him as well as the torn Achilles.

"Indy, I'm sorry. If any fan base doesn't deserve this, it's y'all. But together we are going to fight like hell to get back to this very spot, and get over this hurdle," he added. "I don't doubt for a second that y'all have my back, and I hope you guys know that I have yours. I think Kobe said it best when in this same situation. There are far greater issues/challenges in the world then a torn achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever." And that's exactly right. I will do everything in my power to get back right.

"My journey to get to where I am today wasn't by happenstance, I've pushed myself every day to be great. And I will continue to do just that. The most important part of this all, is that I'm grateful. I'm grateful for every single experience that's led me here. I'm grateful for all the love from the hoop world. I don't ‘have to' go through this, I get to go through this. I'm grateful for the road that lies ahead. Watch how I come back from this. So, give me some time, I'll dust myself off and get right back to being the best version of Tyrese Haliburton."

Haliburton is reportedly likely to miss the 2025-26 season as well.

TRUMP: ‘I'M NOT HAPPY': President Donald Trump emerged from the White House this morning enraged that Israel responded to what he called a single Iranian missile probably fired by mistake, to violate his carefully arranged ceasefire deal. 

While Trump blamed both sides for not adhering to the ceasefire, he aimed most of his ire at Israel in an angry rant before reporters on the White House South Lawn. “Israel's gotta calm down,” Trump said, calling its response to the Iranian missile “ridiculous.”

“I didn't like plenty of things I saw yesterday,” Trump said, clearly agitated. “I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning, and I'm gonna see if I can stop it, so as soon as I get away from you.”

“When I say, ‘OK, now you have 12 hours,' you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran, but I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land that was shot perhaps by mistake, didn't land. I'm not happy about that,” Trump said before boarding Marine One. “You know we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing.”

LAST NIGHT, TRUMP WAS GIDDY: Trump, possibly with visions of the Nobel Peace Prize dancing in his head, was positively ebullient last night as he declared what he dubbed “The 12 Day War” between Iran and Israel over, thanks to a ceasefire he said he brokered at the request of both countries.

“Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, ‘PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW. The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures,” Trump posted on Truth Social late last night. “They have so much to gain, and yet, so much to lose if they stray from the road of RIGHTEOUSNESS & TRUTH. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!”

It was just one of a string of Truth Social posts in which Trump's enthusiasm bubbled over into sheer giddiness. “​​On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR.'” Trump posted earlier in the evening. “This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't, and never will! God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!”

Labeling the conflict “The 12 Day War” obviously invokes the historic 1967 “Six-Day War,” in which Israel defeated a group of Arab countries, including Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.

TRUMP EXPECTS ISRAEL-IRAN CEASEFIRE TO LAST ‘FOREVER,' NEVER TO SHOOT AT EACH OTHER AGAIN

IRAN OFFERS ‘OFF RAMP,' TRUMP TAKES IT: The stage for the ceasefire was set by what appeared to be a symbolic missile attack by Iran on the U.S. air base in Qatar, where Trump gave a speech to U.S. troops last month. Iran said it launched 14 missiles, the same number of bunker-buster bombs that were dropped on two of Iran's three nuclear facilities Saturday.

Qatar, which shares a major oil field with Iran, was given advance warning of the strikes in time for U.S. troops to take shelter, and the base's missile defenses shot 13 of the missiles out of the sky. 

“Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered. There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was ‘set free,' because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction,” Trump posted on Truth Social. 

“I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured,” Trump said. “Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their ‘system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE.”

The response was similar to Iran's reaction to Trump's assassination of Quds Force Gen. Qassem Soleimani in 2020, when Trump claimed that Iran called him ahead of time. “They had to hit back. They feel they have to do that. And I understand that,” Trump told Fox News in an interview last year. “They had to do it because they have people and they have to show strength. So they aimed the missiles, but they said, ‘Please don't attack us. We're not going to hit you.' That was respect. We had respect.”

IRAN ATTACK ON QATAR AIR BASE WAS DESIGNED AS AN ‘OFF-RAMP' TO CONFLICT WITH US

FIGHTING UNTIL ‘THE VERY LAST MINUTE': The ceasefire went into effect at 4 a.m. local time and appeared to hold for about two hours until Israel accused Iran of firing another barrage of missiles, which Iran denied.

Up until the hour the ceasefire was to begin, both sides traded a flurry of strikes, making use of the final hours to get in some last licks.

“The military operations of our powerful Armed Forces to punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute, at 4am,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on X. “Together with all Iranians, I thank our brave Armed Forces who remain ready to defend our dear country until their last drop of blood, and who responded to any attack by the enemy until the very last minute.”

The Israeli government posted on X this morning, “This is a great success for the people of Israel and its fighters, who removed two existential threats to our country, and ensured the eternity of Israel. The Prime Minister will issue a statement later today.”

According to an Israeli government statement, “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the Security Cabinet last night, together with the Defense Minister, the IDF Chief-of-Staff and the Director of the Mossad, in order to report that Israel has achieved all of the objectives of Operation Rising Lion, and much more.”

IRAN GETS FINAL WORD BEFORE '12 DAY WAR' CEASEFIRE WITH DEADLY MISSILE ATTACK ON ISRAEL

HAPPENING TODAY: TRUMP TO NATO: Trump wrapped up his ceasefire deal just in time to make his scheduled 6 a.m. departure from the White House to the Netherlands for today's gathering of the leaders of NATO nations in The Hague.

Trump will arrive triumphant, not just because he appears to have successfully brokered an end to the Israel-Iran war and Tehran's near-term nuclear ambitions but also because the 32-nation alliance is poised to adopt Trump's demand that all NATO nations spend 5% of GDP on defense, up from 2%. It's a goal that Trump says the United States doesn't need to meet. “I don't think we should, but I think they should,” he said last week.

“The defense investment plan that allies will agree on in The Hague introduces a new baseline: 5% of GDP to be invested in defense. This is a quantum leap that is ambitious, historic, and fundamental to securing our future,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters ahead of the two-day summit. “The new defense investment plan is the key deliverable for this summit and will be decisive when it comes to ensuring effective deterrence and defense.”

The plan, which would be phased over 10 years, calls for 3.5% of GDP for military spending and an additional 1.5% for “defense-related” infrastructure, such as upgrading roads, bridges, ports, and airfields.

VANCE: THE IRANIANS HAVE SHOWN ‘THEY'RE JUST NOT VERY GOOD AT WAR': Vice President JD Vance was sitting on the set with Fox News anchor Bret Baier the moment Trump posted the first word of the ceasefire.

“We have destroyed the Iranian nuclear program. Zero Americans have died. That's an amazing, amazing thing. Americans, whether Democrats or Republicans, we should be celebrating that,” said Vance, who told Baier he'd seen a draft of Trump's statement before he arrived at the Fox News studios.

Baier asked Vance about one of the key unknowns: what happened to the roughly 880 pounds of uranium enriched to 60% purity, enough to make nine or 10 bombs if enriched to 90%.

“Our goal was to bury the uranium. And I do think the uranium is buried. But our goal was to eliminate the enrichment and eliminate their ability to convert that enriched fuel into a nuclear weapon,” Vance said. “The main focus, Bret, has been to destroy their enrichment capacity, because we don't want that 60% uranium to become 90% uranium. That's the real concern. And that's what was so successful about our mission.”

“What we destroyed is their ability to enrich uranium,” he said. “Our hope is that the lesson that the Iranians have learned here is, look, we can fly a bunker-buster bomb from Missouri to Iran completely undetected without landing once on the ground, and we can destroy whatever nuclear capacity you build up.”

“What the Iranians have showed through their support of terror networks, through their now-failed effort to build a nuclear weapon, is that they're just not very good at war,” Vance said. “And I think the president really hit the reset button and said, ‘Look, let's actually produce long-term peace for the region.'”

VANCE SAYS TOMORROW ‘A NEW DAY' AFTER TRUMP ANNOUNCES ISRAEL-IRAN CEASEFIRE

GRAHAM: ‘DO THEY STILL DESIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPON?': In an appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News show last night, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of the loudest voices calling for Trump to bomb Iran's nuclear sites, said Iran needs to do more if it truly wants peace.

“If the ceasefire is genuine and will lead to peace, it is a major league accomplishment. If the ceasefire is used to rearm and regroup by Iran, we've gone backwards,” Graham said. “Their nuclear ambitions have been set back in a very large, dramatic way between Israel and the United States, but do they still desire a nuclear weapon? Do they still want to kill all the Jews and wipe Israel off the map, attack Saudi Arabia and purify Islam and come after us? Do they still want to be the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet?”

“What I want to do is hear from the Iranians, ‘We don't want to kill all the Jews anymore. We've abandoned that as our goal. We accept Israel,'” Graham said, issuing a challenge to Iran's foreign minister. “If he will say that, then you got a real breakthrough. If he won't say that, then I think they're just buying time to regroup and come at Israel later.”

TRUMP VS. MEDVEDEV: Sunday's X post by Dmitry Medvedev, deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, in which he suggested “a number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads,” caught the attention of Trump, who chastised Russian President Vladimir Putin's hatchet man in a Truth Social post.

“Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the ‘N word' (Nuclear!), and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran?” Trump posted. “Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination? If he did say that, and, if confirmed, please let me know, IMMEDIATELY. The ‘N word' should not be treated so casually.”

Medvedev answered Trump in a follow-up post on X, in which he wrote, “Russia has no intention of supplying nuclear weapons to Iran because, unlike Israel, we are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. … But other countries might — and that's what was said.”

Trump said, “I guess that's why Putin's ‘THE BOSS.'”

President Donald Trump spoke to reporters Tuesday before departing for a NATO summit, saying that Israel and Iran "don't know what the **** they're doing" following his declaration of a ceasefire.

President Donald Trump expressed deep frustration with both Israel and Iran on Tuesday, saying the two countries "don't know what the **** they're doing."

Trump made the comments while departing from the White House for a NATO summit Tuesday morning. Both Israel and Iran fired missiles at one another following the imposition of a ceasefire on Monday night.

"I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning," Trump said.

He continued, "We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the **** they're doing." 

"I'm gonna see if I can stop it," he added.

ISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT: LIVE UPDATES

"ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!" Trump wrote on Truth Social shortly after boarding Marine One.

Minutes later, he announced that Israel was canceling its plans for an attack Tuesday morning.

"ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect! Thank you for your attention to this matter!" he wrote.

He then topped it off with a post stating: "IRAN WILL NEVER REBUILD THEIR NUCLEAR FACILITIES!"

Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran on Monday night, dubbing the conflict a "12-day war."

Qatar's prime minister secured Iran's agreement to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire after Iran's limited strikes on America's Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL AND IRAN 'HAVE TO FIGHT IT OUT' BUT BELIEVES DEAL IS POSSIBLE

A senior Israeli official told Fox News on Tuesday that Iran had launched two missiles toward Israel following the announcement of the ceasefire "and we believe they are trying to fire more in the next couple of hours."

"Unfortunately, the Iranians have decided to continue to fire toward Israel," the official said to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent  Trey Yingst after Trump unveiled the deal Monday.

"Now we will have to retaliate, this will happen of course," the official added. "It could end within several hours, but they [the Iranians] need to make a decision." 

Israel has yet to confirm that it has canceled its follow-up attack.

In Skrmetti, the Court turned to a decades-old decision once thought to be consigned to history.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The Supreme Court's decision last week in United States v. Skrmetti will have direct consequences for many transgender minors. Tennessee's law, which the Court upheld, prohibits people under age 18 from accessing certain kinds of treatment, such as hormones and puberty blockers, to treat gender dysphoria (the condition in which an individual's sex does not align with their gender identity). But the consequences will be indirect as well, and reach beyond the realm of transgender rights—potentially representing a setback for gender equality and the enforcement of antidiscrimination law.

The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by the five other Republican appointees, revives an outdated case, Geduldig v. Aiello, that blessed discrimination based on archaic thinking. If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of “biological differences” between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women. The Court's logic underscores the extent to which the ideology and methodology of the conservative justices threaten many of the hard-fought civil-rights protections of the 20th century.

The key issue in Skrmetti was whether Tennessee's law, and others like it, requires heightened constitutional scrutiny. The Court said it does not and rejected two different theories to the contrary—first, that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, and second, that the law discriminates on the basis of gender identity against trans minors.

Roberts's majority opinion first insisted that the law does not constitute sex discrimination because it concerns a medical procedure for minors—the law prohibits using hormones or puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria. Therefore, Roberts reasoned, the law distinguishes between persons on the basis of medical treatment and age rather than sex.

Adam Serwer: The attack on trans rights won't end there

Roberts next explained that the law does not constitute discrimination on the basis of gender identity—discrimination against transgender individuals as such. The Court's logic went as follows: Although the law restricts access to hormones and puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, both transgender and cisgender individuals can access these treatments for other conditions. Therefore, the Court suggested, even though transgender people are the only group negatively affected by the law, it still does not amount to discrimination against them, because they, along with cisgender individuals, can still receive hormones and puberty blockers as treatment for conditions other than gender dysphoria. (In a concurring opinion, Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito indicated that even if a law did specifically and overtly discriminate on the basis of transgender status, they still would not subject the law to heightened scrutiny.)

As support for the majority's claims, the Court cited Geduldig v. Aiello, a 1974 case about sex discrimination that somewhat infamously concluded that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy does not constitute discrimination on the basis of sex. The case concerned California's disability-insurance program, which excluded coverage for any disabilities arising from pregnancy. Sure, the Geduldig Court acknowledged, the group excluded from the disability-insurance program by the pregnancy-discrimination provision included only women. But the group of people who could access the state's disability-compensation benefits for reasons other than pregnancy included both women and men. “The program divides potential recipients into two groups—pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes,” the Court wrote. In other words, the law didn't exclude all women from coverage, just those women who were unable to work because of pregnancy.

Geduldig also gestured to the idea that pregnancy reflects an objective biological condition, which, the all-male justices explained, made the law legitimate and meant that the law was not a form of discrimination. “Normal pregnancy,” the justices opined, “is an objectively identifiable physical condition with unique characteristics.” At the time Geduldig was decided, laws that explicitly and specifically discriminated on the basis of sex were not subject to heightened judicial scrutiny. The courts instead excused and explained away the discrimination by invoking the biological differences between men and women—legitimate reasons for legitimate discrimination.

Many observers of constitutional law thought, until recently, that Geduldig had been consigned to history. The decision was viewed as an anomaly and outdated not only because of its reasoning, but also because it had been whittled away and rejected by both Congress and the Supreme Court. Congress overturned the result in Geduldig when, in 1978, it designated pregnancy discrimination as a species of sex discrimination. The Supreme Court also declined to apply Geduldig in cases where states sought to invoke biological differences between men and women to excuse discrimination against women. For example, in United States v. Virginia, the Court rejected the argument that Virginia could maintain a men's-only military-leadership academy because the state insisted that women, due to their biology, could not conform to the school's rigorous methods. Although Congress, by statute, prohibited pregnancy discrimination in employment, that did not change the Constitution. Similarly, although the justices weakened or ignored Geduldig, they never outright overruled it. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called for Geduldig to be formally overruled, perhaps recognizing that the Court's failure to do so left the decision available to be invoked in the future to protect other discrimination.

Garrett Epps: What ‘because of sex' really means

In Skrmetti, the Court dropped even more hints that it is open to green-lighting more sex discrimination. Roberts's majority opinion acknowledged that “a law that classifies on the basis of sex may fail heightened scrutiny”—but, it continued, the law would fail only “if the classifications rest on impermissible stereotypes,” as opposed to permissible ones such as those rooted in biological differences (emphasis added).

The Republican-appointed justices have now indicated that Geduldig is making a comeback. When the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, Alito's majority opinion invoked Geduldig to declare that abortion restrictions do not amount to sex discrimination. Such restrictions, Alito wrote, are about a medical procedure tied to the biological differences between men and women.

By invoking Geduldig, the Roberts Court is doing what the Supreme Court of earlier eras did: supplying tortured legal logic to justify long-standing hierarchies. In Plessy v. Ferguson, for example, the Court insisted that laws that required white and Black individuals to ride in different train cars were not impermissible racial discrimination—the rules applied to and burdened everyone, after all. That logic sounds like the thread in Skrmetti that maintains that bans on gender-affirming care don't constitute gender-identity discrimination because the bans allow transgender and cisgender kids to access hormones and puberty blockers—just not for treatment of gender dysphoria. In Korematsu v. United States, the Court claimed that the internment of Americans of Japanese descent did not constitute racial discrimination; the policy was about national security. That reasoning tracks with Skrmetti's insistence that the health-care bans do not discriminate on the basis of sex or gender identity; they are about age and medical procedures.

The decisions in Plessy and Korematsu are rightly reviled today. Geduldig should be as well. Instead, the country has a Court that is turning to it as precedent, repurposing it to justify a new era of legal discrimination.

Republicans are staring down more complications this week with their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, this time from the Senate's parliamentarian, who ruled against several provisions that they included to win over conservative support.

The House narrowly passed the tax and spending legislation last month after weeks of fierce negotiations. Now the bill is in the Senate, where parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has ruled that specific provisions cannot pass using the special legislative process that allows Republicans to skirt the filibuster.

The changes forced by the parliamentarian threaten Republican leadership's vote tally on the bill, especially among conservatives who demand spending cuts. Many such lawmakers were already apprehensive about the bill because it does not sufficiently cut spending.

Usually, Republicans would need 60 votes in the Senate to pass this legislation. Advertently, Republicans are moving President Donald Trump's tax and border agenda through reconciliation, a legislative process that allows bills to bypass the filibuster and pass with only a simple majority in the Senate.

However, only specific matters are included in a reconciliation bill. The parliamentarian goes through the legislation and ensures its provisions comply with the Byrd Rule, which requires reconciliation to focus solely on fiscal matters and allows senators in the minority to raise a point of order if they believe there is “extraneous matter” in the bill.

Some notable measures are already on the chopping block, threatening Republican votes. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), a fiscal hawk, took to social media Monday and branded MacDonough's changes to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as “NOT GOOD.”

“The OBBB is now 1) increasing deficits a LOT than the House bill, 2) watering down termination of the Green New Scam to less than 50%, 3) watering down food stamp reforms, 4) taking out HSA expansion, 5) gutting our (weak) effort to stop rogue judges, & 6) more… so… NOT GOOD,” Roy said.

One notable measure MacDonough ruled will not survive the so-called “Byrd bath” is a provision to cut funding from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. According to congressional Democrats, that would have cut some $6.4 billion in funding for the agency.

Some Republicans also hoped to slip in provisions related to the REINS Act, which would give Congress more power over the federal bureaucracy and rulemaking. However, MacDonough cut a reworked version of the REINS Act that Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) had pushed for.

“Moving in the wrong direction,” Lee said on Monday about the parliamentarian's rulings.

MacDonough's team also ruled against a GOP plan to make states pay a portion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, expenses in another blow for conservatives. The House version of that plan would have saved $130 billion.

The parliamentarian also ruled against a provision that would have prevented noncitizens from receiving SNAP benefits, with Democrats arguing that such a measure would violate the Byrd Rule. If it had not been on the chopping block, that would have been another $4 billion in savings.

The Senate parliamentarian also ruled against a Republican effort to restrict the power of federal judges to block Trump administration policies with preliminary injunctions.

Likewise, MacDonough ruled against cutting some $1.4 billion in pay for staff at the Federal Reserve.

Taken together, MacDonough's and her team's highly anticipated rulings are a big setback for Republicans, who are working to whip as much support from conservatives as they can for the legislation, with slim margins.

And the parliamentarian isn't done yet. MacDonough will go through other provisions in the coming days.

The bulk of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act extends or permanently implements the tax cuts that were part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and implements some of Trump's new tax priorities. Republicans have yet to make their final arguments to MacDonough on the Finance Committee language.

As the rulings and changes continue, especially if unfavorable to Republicans, more lawmakers might speak out about the process.

For instance, on Monday, Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO) accused MacDonough of being politically biased and called for her to be “overruled or fired.”

“The Senate parliamentarian decided that a ban on illegal aliens receiving food stamps did not fit the ‘Byrd rule,'” Onder said. “It is pretty clear that this woman is not an impartial arbiter, but a liberal activist. She should be overruled or fired.”

TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' GETS SMALLER AS SENATE REFEREE STRIKES GOP PRIORITIES

And if MacDonough keeps peeling away at provisions in the bill that Republicans included to save money and make the deficit hit of reconciliation more palatable to fiscal hawks, it could spell trouble for the overall bill, or at least make it more challenging for Republican leadership to get it to Trump's desk.

The rulings also come as Republicans try to pass the bill in the Senate before July 4th.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A Republican-sponsored proposal before Congress to mandate the sale of federal public lands received a mixed reception Monday from the governors of Western states.

A budget proposal from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee would mandate the sale of more than 3,125 square miles (8,093 square kilometers) of federal lands to state or other entities. It was included recently in a draft provision of the GOP's sweeping tax cut package.

At a summit Monday of Western state governors, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the approach is problematic in New Mexico because of the close relationship residents have with those public lands.

“I'm open” to the idea, said Lujan Grisham, a second-term Democratic governor and former congresswoman. “Except here.”

“Our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness, and they belong to all of us,” said Lujan Grisham, who was announcing written recommendations Monday on affordable housing strategies from the Western Governors' Association. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, for at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.”

Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum was among the leaders from several federal agencies who attended the meeting that runs through Tuesday. He has touted the many potential uses for public lands that include recreation, logging and oil and gas production, saying it could boost local economies.

Several hundred protesters in downtown Santa Fe denounced efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting “not for sale” and carrying signs reading “This land belongs to you and me” and “keep our public land free for future generations.”




Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon voiced qualified support for plans to tap federal land for development.

“On a piece-by-piece basis where states have the opportunity to craft policies that make sense ... we can actually allow for some responsible growth in areas with communities that are landlocked at this point,” he said at a news conference outside the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. “There may be value there.”

Lee has said federal land sales under his proposal would target “isolated parcels” that could be used for housing or infrastructure, and would not include national parks, national monuments or wilderness.

Land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would be eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected.

In some states, such as Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a “complete and total ceasefire” soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for the American bombing of its nuclear sites. But the status of a possible ceasefire remained tentative after an Iranian missile barrage struck Israel after a first deadline for the proposal.




The Iranian barrages sent Israelis hurrying into bomb shelters as the sun rose, killing at least four people and injuring eight others, Israel's Magen David Adom rescue services said. Israel has yet to acknowledge Trump's proposal, which gives Israel more time to potentially strike back though Iran on its state television announced an overall ceasefire had begun at 7:30 a.m. local time.

In Beersheba, first responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. The streets around the impact site were littered with glass and debris, windows were blown out of buildings as anxious neighbors stood outside their damaged houses. Three people were rescued from nearby buildings.

The direct hit in the largest city in southern Israel came just days after the city's hospital sustained significant damage in a missile strike.

The Israeli military said people could leave bomb shelters but cautioned the public to stay close to shelter for the coming hours.




Trump's announcement that Israel and Iran had agreed to a “complete and total ceasefire” came soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, retaliating for the American bombing of its nuclear sites. Israel has not acknowledged the Trump ceasefire announcement.

Trump's announcement on Truth Social said the ceasefire beginning about midnight Washington time would bring an “Official END” to the war.

Writing over an hour after the first phase of the tentative ceasefire, which called for Iran to halt its attacks, Trump added: “THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!”

Israel did not immediately acknowledge any ceasefire, but there were no reports of Israeli strikes in Iran after 4 a.m. in Tehran. Heavy Israeli strikes continued in Iranian cities until shortly before that time. Israel in other conflicts has stepped up its strikes just before ceasefires took effect.

“As of now, there is NO ‘agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a post on X. “However, provided that the Israeli regime stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people no later than 4 am Tehran time, we have no intention to continue our response afterwards.”

His message was posted at 4:16 a.m. Tehran time. Araghchi added: “The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later.”

The Israeli military declined to comment on Trump's ceasefire statement and the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. 

Trump gave the conflict between Israel and Iran a name: the “12 Day War.” That recalls the 1967 Mideast war, known by some as the “Six Day War,” in which Israel fought a group of Arab countries including Egypt, Jordan and Syria.

Trump's reference carries emotional weight for the Arab world, particularly Palestinians. In the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Though Israel later gave the Sinai back to Egypt, it still holds the other territories.

Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the ceasefire, according to a senior White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss the Monday talks. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff communicated with the Iranians through direct and indirect channels.

The White House has maintained that the Saturday bombing helped get the Israelis to agree to the ceasefire and that the Qatari government helped to broker the deal.

It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. He said earlier on social media that he would not surrender. 

Iran attacked a U.S. base in Qatar on Monday, but appeared to indicate it was prepared to reduce tensions. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties, said Trump, who dismissed the attack as a “very weak response.”

Qatar condemned the attack on Al Udeid Air Base as “a flagrant violation” of its sovereignty, airspace and international law. Qatar said it intercepted all but one missile, though it was not clear if that missile caused any damage.

Iran said the volley matched the number of bombs dropped by the United States on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Iran also said it targeted the base because it was outside of populated areas.

Qatar Maj. Gen. Shayeq Al Hajri said 19 missiles were fired at the base that is home to the Combined Air Operations Center, which provides command and control of air power across the region, as well as the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, the largest such wing in the world. Trump said 14 missiles were fired, 13 were knocked down and one was “set free” because it posed no threat.

Iran announced the attack on state television, with a caption calling it “a mighty and successful response” to “America's aggression.”

Earlier reports that a missile was launched at a base housing American forces in Iraq were a false alarm, a senior U.S. military official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said debris from a malfunctioning Iranian missile targeting Israel had triggered an alert of an impending attack on the Ain al-Assad base.

By early Tuesday, Qatar Airways resumed its flights after Qatar shut down its airspace over the Iranian attack on Al Udeid Air Base. Flight-tracking data showed commercial aircraft again flying in Qatari airspace, signaling Doha believed the threat on the energy-rich nation had passed.

The Israel Airport Authority said that the barrages from Iran forced them to close the country's skies for sevearl hours to all passenger planes that were expected to land and depart, including emergency flights.

Some flights were forced to circle over the Mediterranean Sea, according to Israeli media.

Israel's airports have been closed since the war with Iran began, but a handful of emergency flights had started arriving and departing over the past few days.

Israel and Iran traded barrages early Tuesday morning.

Iran struck Israel with missiles and drones while Israel said it attacked “regime targets and government repression bodies in the heart of Tehran.”

In Tehran, Israel hit the headquarters of the military force that suppressed recent protests and blew open a gate at Evin prison, which is known for holding political activists.

Iranian state television aired footage it said was shot inside Evin, with prisoners under control. However, the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said many families of detainees “have expressed deep concern about the safety and condition of their loved ones” in the prison.

The Israeli military also confirmed it struck roads around Iran's Fordo enrichment facility to obstruct access to the site. The underground site was one of those hit in Sunday's attack by the United States. The Israeli military did not elaborate.

In Vienna, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said he expected there to be heavy damage at the Fordo facility following Sunday's U.S. airstrike there with sophisticated bunker-buster bombs.

Several Iranian officials, including Atomic Energy Organization of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, have claimed Iran removed nuclear material from targeted sites ahead of time.

Israeli officials insisted they did not seek the overthrow of Iran's government, their archenemy since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

But the latest strikes unfolded only hours after Trump himself mentioned the possibility of regime change a day after inserting America into the war with its stealth-bomber strike on three Iranian nuclear sites.

“If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???” he asked on his Truth Social website. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later described Trump as “simply raising a question.”

Before the news of a ceasefire, an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss high-level internal deliberations, said Israel aimed to wind down the war in the coming days, but that it would depend on the Iranians.

Israel's preferred outcome is for Iran to agree to a ceasefire and reenter negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program, the official said. But Israel is prepared for the possibility of an extended low-intensity war of attrition or period of “quiet for quiet,” in which it would closely monitor Iran's activities and strike if it identifies new threats.

In Israel, at least 24 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the war. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.

The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest such as the protests surrounding the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel.

The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.

There are roughly 700,000 American citizens, most of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, believed to be in Israel.

            In the hours after Iran launched a missile attack on a US base in Qatar, President Donald Trump and a group of his top diplomatic and security officials worked furiously behind-the-scenes to try to broker a peace deal to end the conflict between Iran and Israel.
    


            While Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio and Mideast Envoy Steve Witkoff worked on the Iranians – through direct and indirect channels, a senior White House official said.
    


            The government of Qatar played a key role as an intermediary, and Trump at one point spoke directly to its leader, Emir Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
    


            Roughly 48 hours after the US struck Iranian nuclear sites – and just hours after Iran hit back at the US base – Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that a deal had been struck, heralding a “complete and Total CEASEFIRE” between the warring nations that would lead to “an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR.”
    


            But it remained unclear Monday night in the US – early Tuesday morning in the Middle East – whether the fragile equilibrium would hold.
    


            Israel agreed to the ceasefire deal on the condition that Iran stop its attacks, the White House official said. Iran agreed to those terms, they added.
    


            Trump told the Qatari Emir that the US was able to get Israel to agree to a ceasefire with Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said. He also thanked him for his help in mediating, the White House official said, and asked the Emir to help persuade the Iranians to accept the deal.
    


            Vance coordinated with the office of Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani on details, one source said. After speaking with Al-Thani, the Iranians agreed to the ceasefire proposal, the source and a diplomat familiar with negotiations said. A US official said that a series of calls with the Qatari Emir was pivotal on the Iranian side.
    


            Iranian state media announced Tuesday local time that a ceasefire has been “imposed on the enemy” after the country's military response to “US aggression.”
    


            ﻿In an earlier sign, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi thanked his country's armed forces and said military operations against Israel “continued until the very last minute,” hinting that hostilities may have ended.
    


            “The military operations of our powerful Armed Forces to punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute, at 4 a.m.” Araghchi said in a post on X.
    


            Earlier, Araghchi had said Iran would halt its military response if Israel stopped its strikes on Iran by that time.
    


            Israel is yet to publicly comment on whether it has agreed to the ceasefire.
    


            Trump claimed late Monday night that Israel and Iran reached out to him about peace between the two regions, as the Israeli military said it had identified missiles launched toward the nation from Iran.
    


            Trump, just a few hours after he announced the ceasefire deal, said in a post on Truth Social, “Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, “PEACE!” I knew the time was NOW. The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures.”
    


            Moments before Trump's post, the Israeli military said it had identified missiles launched toward Israel from Iran and said its defensive systems were activated.
    


            The White House maintains that the ceasefire deal was only possible due to the US strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities on Saturday.
    


            Earlier on Monday, Doha informed the US about the incoming Iranian strikes aimed at a US military base in Qatar which were successfully intercepted with no reports of injuries or deaths. Iranian officials had given Qatar advance notice of the retaliatory attack, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Diplomatic sources told CNN they were hopeful that Iran's retaliatory strikes would serve as an off-ramp for Tehran to return to negotiations. The ceasefire is likely to create further space for discussions between the US and Iran to continue.
    


            Following Israel's launch of a military operation against Iran, there was an intensive diplomatic effort by US officials and intermediaries to get Tehran back to the table to negotiate a new nuclear deal.
    


            There were messages exchanged throughout last week between the two sides, via numerous interlocutors, to try to revive high-level discussions. There was also an active effort underway to have Trump and the Iranian president meet in Turkey last week, a regional source confirmed, but that did not materialize.
    


            Iran's consistent reply was that it was amenable to talks, but only if Israel suspended its military operations, sources said. Even after the US strikes, the Iranian foreign minister has conveyed to some interlocutors a willingness to return to the table if Israel stops its military attacks on Iran, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            On Saturday, ahead of its unprecedented strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites, the Trump administration messaged Iran through intermediaries. Their message was twofold: forthcoming US strikes would be contained, but also that the US terms for a diplomatic deal with Iran were clear and simple: no uranium enrichment, sources said.
    


            Iran has repeatedly said that it retains the right to enrich uranium.
    


            According to one source familiar with a secret meeting that took place on Saturday, an intermediary reiterated to the Iranians that the White House was still willing to come to the table with no other conditions beyond enrichment. That sole condition from the US stripped away many other points that the two sides had discussed during multiple rounds of nuclear talks.
    


            Witkoff has continued to exchange messages with the Iranians in the aftermath of the US military operation, a senior White House official and source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            On Sunday, Rubio repeatedly publicly messaged a desire for direct negotiations with Iran. He noted that a deal that allowed Tehran to have a civil nuclear program – without its own enrichment – was still on the table.
    


            “If they call right now and say we want to meet, let's talk about this, we're prepared to do that,” the top US diplomat said on CBS “Face the Nation.”

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Officials in South Dakota are pushing hard to build President Donald Trump ‘s proposed National Garden of American Heroes in the Black Hills near Mount Rushmore, but the effort has sparked a backlash from Indigenous groups who see the area as sacred.

A mining company has offered to donate 40 acres (16 hectares) less than a mile from Mount Rushmore, where massive sculptures of four of the nation's most prominent presidents are carved out of granite.

“The Black Hills mark the perfect location to achieve your vision for the National Garden of American Heroes,” Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden wrote in a letter to Trump. “Together, we will make this project happen in a way that honors America's heroes, takes advantage of South Dakota's natural beauty, and incorporates the most iconic monument to our greatest leaders: Mount Rushmore National Memorial.”

But the Black Hills have long been the subject of disputes between South Dakota and its tribes. The 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie recognized that the Black Hills belong to the Sioux people, but the U.S. government seized the land less than a decade later to mine for gold. A 1980 Supreme Court decision found that the U.S. violated the treaty, but the tribes refused the $1.3 billion in compensation they were offered and maintained their rights to the land.

The mining company, Pete Lien & Sons, also has had conflicts with Indigenous groups in the area, most recently because of an exploratory drilling project for graphite near the sacred Lakota site of Pe' Sla. The company also is working with theme park designer Storyland Studios to build an attraction in the Black Hills opposed by some Indigenous groups.

“It's absurd for Storyland Studios and Gov. Rhoden to claim they care about preserving history while they watch Lien & Sons attempt to destroy Pe' Sla, and do nothing,” said Taylor Gunhammer, an organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective.

“They are the ones erasing and paving over history, not preserving it,” Gunhammer said.

Rhoden's press secretary, Josie Harms, wrote in a statement that the garden “will have no disruption to either state or tribal land” because the tract of land is owned by Chuck Lien, owner of Lien & Sons, and his family. 

Pete Lien & Sons did not respond to multiple requests from The Associated Press for comment.

Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to build the garden, to feature 250 life-size statues of historical figures in honor of the country's 250th birthday on July 4, 2026. Applications for sculptors are due in early July, though the administration no longer seeks to have it completed by next summer.

The U.S. House has approved $40 million for the project, which is being overseen by the Department of Interior and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The Senate hasn't yet approved the funding.

Trump first announced the project in his first term in a July 3, 2020, speech at Mount Rushmore at a time during the Black Lives Matter movement when some protesters were tearing down statues depicting Confederate generals and others.

“Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our Founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities,” Trump said in that speech. “But no, the American people are strong and proud, and they will not allow our country, and all of its values, history, and culture, to be taken from them.”

In a 2021 executive order, Trump called for statues depicting a range of prominent figures, from the likes of Amelia Earhart, Muhammad Ali and Steve Jobs to more controversial ones like Christopher Columbus and President Andrew Jackson. No site was selected, however, and the garden was never funded by Congress.

The Department of Interior said the revived garden project is still in the “planning and discussion phase” and declined to say which sites it is considering.

It's unclear if any other states are seeking to host the statue garden.

When Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was the state's governor, she offered the mining company's 40 acres of land in the Black Hills. Her successor, Rhoden, doubled down on that offer in his letter, emphasizing the site would be “in sight of Mount Rushmore.”

South Dakota Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson also wrote a letter to Trump, and said he will “keep advocating for this iconic landmark to make its home in the Black Hills” in a social media post.

Darren Thompson, director of media relations for the Indigenous nonprofit Sacred Defense Fund, called for more discussions with Indigenous groups in the Black Hills.

“It's a very touchy and sensitive subject that I think requires input by the local Indigenous people who have claim to the land and cultural ties to the land,” Thompson said.

CLAYMONT, Del. (AP) — Lawmakers in Texas, Oklahoma and Nevada have recently approved changes aimed at helping their states dip into the lucrative side of corporate litigation that Delaware, with a specialized court and business-friendly laws, has dominated as the world's incorporation capital. 

Concerned that these changes may lure corporations away from Delaware, thereby causing the small state to lose millions in corporate franchise taxes, Delaware officials have responded with their own changes to solidify their status in the business world.

In Texas, which opened a business court last year, there was bipartisan support for legislation diminishing shareholder powers and giving businesses more legal protections against shareholder lawsuits. Nevada lawmakers approved a corporation-friendly update to its business laws, also with bipartisan support, and separately moved toward asking voters to consider changing the state constitution to create a dedicated business court with appointed judges. 

Billionaire Elon Musk had advocated both states as better options for incorporation after a Delaware judge struck down his shareholder-approved $56 billion compensation package from Tesla. Musk's businesses have also changed where they're incorporated: Tesla and SpaceX relocated to Texas, while Neuralink moved to Nevada.

Oklahoma also took action to get in the mix, as the Republican-led Legislature sanctioned the creation of business courts in its two most populous counties, a move the governor said would help Oklahoma become the most business-friendly state.

“This is an area in which states, in many ways, are behaving like businesses,” said Robert Ahdieh, dean of the Texas A&M University School of Law. “Delaware is selling something. Texas is selling something that they hold out to be better. So it is very much a comparative exercise.”

Since 2024, several billion-dollar companies including TripAdvisor and DropBox have relocated to Nevada. More than a dozen others, including the AMC theater chain and video game developer Roblox Corporation, have announced plans to incorporate there this year. Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre filed a request for shareholders to approve a Texas relocation in April, citing Delaware's “less predictable” decision-making process — a common thought among exiting companies.

Amid concerns about more companies reincorporating elsewhere in a so-called “Dexit,” Delaware passed its own legislation to help protect its status as the corporate capital, limiting shareholders' access to records and increasing protections for leadership. Opposition dubbed it “the Billionaire's Bill.”

“Ultimately, I think the damage is done because businesses successfully undermined shareholder rights in Delaware,” said Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at Consumer Federation of America, who argues that the Delaware bill was a rash acquiescence to “Dexit” concerns.

However, some business law experts, like Ahdieh, say the average shareholder is focused on increasing their returns and does not care about shareholder power or where the company is incorporated.

Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer has vowed to win back companies that leave, arguing his state's experience “beats going to Vegas and rolling the dice.” 

Companies flock to Delaware for its well-respected Court of Chancery, a sophisticated and separate forum focusing on equity, corporate and business law. This incorporation machine generates $2.2 billion annually, about one-third of the state's operating budget.

There is comfort in working in the familiarity of Delaware law, said Ahdieh, but that predictability has come into question in the last decade as corporate leaders grew unhappy over losing precedent-setting court decisions governing corporate conflicts of interest.

Widener University Commonwealth law school professor Christian Johnson acknowledged a shift in Delaware but said reincorporating elsewhere might be “a bit of an overreaction.” Although a few big-name companies have moved, there are still more than 2 million legal entities incorporated in Delaware, including two-thirds of the Fortune 500. 

Statutes in Texas and Nevada may appear more flexible, but they have not been extensively tested, and their courts are not as experienced working with the larger entities that favor Delaware, Johnson said.

In May, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation providing greater securities for corporate officers and adding restrictions to shareholder records requests. The bill also allows corporations to require an ownership threshold, no more than 3% in outstanding shares, before a shareholder can initiate a derivative lawsuit, typically on behalf of the company and against its own board or directors. 

Restrictions on who can initiate such lawsuits are not uncommon, but Texas' implementation imposes a “far higher barrier than the norm,” Ahdieh said.

Consumer advocates worry the changes endanger shareholder and investor protections by giving owners and directors more protection against lawsuits that could hold them accountable if they violate their fiduciary duty.

For businesses, the changes mean potentially saving millions of dollars in shareholder lawsuit settlements and legal fees by mitigating the likelihood of those costly cases reaching court. For the states, attracting the companies means millions in business activity and revenue from regulatory filing and court case fees and taxes.

Eyeing a piece of that, Oklahoma is on pace to establish its recently approved business courts in 2026. 

“I'm trying to take down Delaware,” said Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican. “We want to be the most business-friendly state.”

Nevada wants to compete, too. It has run business dockets in Washoe and Clark counties since 2001, and it's in the state's interest to expand operations considering its fast-growing economy and population, said Benjamin Edwards, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas law professor who studies business and securities law.

But he said it could take decades to build up a court comparable to Delaware, which has a valuable reputation for handling cases relatively quickly. 

Nevada's proposed business court wouldn't take effect until 2028 at the earliest and would require amending the state constitution, which would need approval by the 2027 legislature and voter approval in 2028 to allow for the appointment of judges.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.

The roadless rule adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.

The rule impeded road construction and “responsible timber production” that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.

“This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,” Rollins said.

Scientists say that worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has allowed fuels to build up.

The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres (24 million hectares), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.

State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.

Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.




The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab. 

Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands. 

Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new “era of abundance” on public lands under President Donald Trump's administration in the development of natural resources including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.

Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting “not for sale” and carrying signs that read, “This land belongs to you and me” and “keep our public land free for future generations.”

On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas “another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.”

The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.

Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.

“Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,” Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.

Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.

“This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,” Hamby said in a statement.

In Alaska, home to the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.

During the latter part of Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.

Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.

The Tongass is a temperate rainforest of glaciers and rugged coastal islands. It provides habitat to wildlife such as bears, wolves, salmon and bald eagles.

Follow:


            The Supreme Court on Monday granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their homeland, including places like South Sudan, with minimal notice.
    


The decision is a significant win for the Trump administration, which had argued that a lower court usurped its authority by ordering the Department of Homeland Security to provide written notice to the migrants about where they would be sent as well as an opportunity to challenge that deportation on the grounds that they feared being tortured.
    


            The court's three liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented in a fiery opinion.
    


            The high court's order pauses a decision from US District Judge Brian Murphy, which found that the government's efforts to deport migrants to third-party countries without due process “unquestionably” violated constitutional protections.
    


            Sotomayor, in a dissent aimed at the administration's broader approach, said her colleagues in the majority were “rewarding lawlessness” with the decision, asserting that the Trump administration has “openly flouted” previous court orders.
    


            “Rather than allowing our lower court colleagues to manage this high-stakes litigation with the care and attention it plainly requires, this court now intervenes to grant the government emergency relief from an order it has repeatedly defied,” she wrote.
    


            The court itself offered no explanation for the decision.
    


            Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, described the ramifications of the court's order as “horrifying.”
    


            Realmuto's group represented several of the migrants at the Supreme Court.
    


            The decision, she said, “strips away critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death.”
    


            Like other cases on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, the ruling Monday was not the final word – and it did not resolve the underlying legal questions the appeal raised. Instead, it allowed the administration to continue the policy while the legal challenge moves through the lower courts.
    


            But that will nevertheless have immediate and practical impacts.

            “It's difficult to overstate how big a deal today's ruling is, especially in conjunction with the Supreme Court's two emergency docket rulings last month that, respectively, allowed the Trump administration to cancel temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans and parole for hundreds of thousands of other migrants,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
    


            “In those earlier rulings, the court cleared the way for the government to treat as many as a million migrants as removable who previously weren't. And today's ruling allows the government to remove those individuals and others to any country that will take them – without providing any additional process beyond an initial removal hearing, and without regard to the treatment they may face in those countries.”
    


            The Trump administration quickly praised the ruling on social media.
    


            “Fire up the deportation planes,” Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote on X.
    


            DHS Secretary Kristi Noem posted an image of the court's decision alongside a GIF of Trump dancing.
    


            The response underscores how the administration might try to capitalize on a ruling that could dramatically change the way deportations are carried out—allowing officials to deport migrants to countries where they have no ties. One of the major hurdles for previous administrations was trying to send people back to their home countries who would refuse to receive them for a host of reasons, including frosty relations with the United States.
    


            The case has drawn growing scrutiny after immigrant rights groups revealed that a group of migrants, initially bound for South Sudan, were being detained by the US at a military base in Djibouti and have been unable to contact their attorneys. The migrants, including some from Cuba, Vietnam and Laos, were being held in a converted Conex shipping container.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision set off a flurry of briefings on behalf of those migrants in Murphy's court. Their lawyers argued that the high court's order didn't directly address their situation because Murphy had issued a subsequent order for them that the government did not appeal.
    


            In a new order late Monday, Murphy said that his May 21 directive remained in “full force and effect” despite the Supreme Court's decision. That order required the government to give the migrants at issue “a reasonable fear interview in private, with the opportunity for the individual to have counsel of their choosing present during the interview.”
    


            Humanitarian groups describe the situation in South Sudan as dire. The United Nations recently warned about food insecurity in the country, which is also facing political instability and escalating violence.
    


            “These individuals are stranded incommunicado in Djibouti, a country of which they have no knowledge, and en route to another country, South Sudan, where none have ever set foot,” the National Immigration Litigation Alliance and other groups told the court.
    


            In May, the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston rejected the government's request to pause a lower court ruling halting the policy, a decision that came amid reported plans to send migrants to Libya, a country widely criticized for mistreatment of detainees and ongoing civil unrest.
    


            Libyan officials denied any agreement to accept deportees.
    


            The Trump administration has argued that a lower court's order requiring officials to give them an opportunity to claim fear of torture under federal law oversteps legal bounds and complicates foreign policy. The administration has also claimed that the migrants who were sent to third countries have significant criminal records and represent the “worst of the worst” of people in the US illegally.
    


            But the migrants' lawyers pushed back on that assertion this week, noting in a filing to the Supreme Court that many of the detainees have no criminal convictions, contrary to the administration's characterization.
    


            At issue is the Convention Against Torture, ratified by the Senate in 1994, that generally bars deportation or extradition to countries where there is a possibility that the migrant might be tortured. The law is vague about how an administration is supposed to make that determination and what process rights are due to the migrant at issue.
    


            The Trump administration has said that in cases where it has received “assurances” from a foreign government that a migrant removed there will not be tortured, that officials do not have to notify a Cuban national, for instance, that he is being deported to South Sudan. In cases in which the government has not received those assurances, DHS policy requires the migrant to be notified so they can make a fear-of-torture claim.
    


            The groups representing the migrants argued that the administration, in some cases, has provided less than 24-hours' notice. Murphy, nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, ruled that was insufficient, and he ordered the government to give migrants 10 days to raise a claim about fear of torture and 15 days after that to contest a denial of that claim. It is that timeline the Trump administration was fighting at the Supreme Court and had framed as a usurpation of “sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.”
    


            Trump has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals at the Supreme Court and most of them – including several dealings with immigration – have been successful. A majority of the court supported Trump's efforts to end temporary protected status for Venezuelan nationals, for instance, as well as the administration's plan to unwind a form of humanitarian parole for Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.
    


            However, the high court has also repeatedly shut down efforts by Trump to speed deportations without offering due process for the affected migrants. In perhaps the most notable example of that, the court ruled that the administration could not deport people under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act without giving them sufficient opportunity to contest their removability.

The House Democratic Steering Committee recommended Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) to be the next top Democrat on the powerful House Oversight Committee ahead of the caucus vote Tuesday morning. 

Four House Democrats, Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), Stephen Lynch (D-MA), Kweisi Mfume (D-MD), and Garcia entered the June 24 race to be named the next top dog on House Oversight and Government Reform after former Democratic Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly died last month of cancer. Since Connolly's death, 70-year-old Lynch, the most senior member on the panel, has been the acting ranking member.

The contenders for the job appeared before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee Monday evening, and then made recommendations ahead of the caucus votes Tuesday morning to solidify the top member. The members of the committee were allotted questioning time for these four members ahead of casting their votes, but the fight for the top spot will not be secured until the full caucus votes. 

Last year, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) came up short behind Connolly after a contentious race for the ranking spot on the committee. Despite not receiving the recommendation of the Steering Committee, Ocasio-Cortez still moved full steam ahead in her campaign for the caucus vote.

Ocasio-Cortez still came up short during the full caucus vote, however, and does not currently hold a seat on the Oversight Committee, as she now sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee this Congress, which opened the path for these four members to make their case. 

As Democrats search for messaging that will stick leading into the 2026 midterm elections, this spot has given a glimpse of a middle ground between the younger generation and seniority that usually takes precedence in the House.

Garcia, who won on the first vote, ran on the notion of generational changes in the party, but was careful with his push to still attract members of the caucus who value seniority. The 47-year-old sophomore served as the mayor of Long Beach, California, from 2014 to 2022 before being sworn into Congress. 

Garcia was the only member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus eyeing the seat, while two members, Mfume and Crockett, are both part of the Congressional Black Caucus. All three of these members are part of the Progressive Cause led by 35-year-old Chairman Greg Casar (D-TX), likely splitting the caucus on the secret ballot, if they continue ahead with their bids.

“We showed that government can be both progressive and effective,” Garcia wrote in his Dear Colleague letter announcing his bid. “Driven by values powered by innovation, and always working with the people we serve.”

The job's focus is countering GOP investigations into former President Joe Biden and other political investigations pursued by Chairman James Comer (R-KY).

NEW YORK (AP) — Their chances of becoming the next mayor of New York City may have dimmed. Their mission now? Stopping former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from getting to City Hall.

In the final day of campaigning before the city's Democratic primary, candidates who are seen as longer shots to win the nomination urged voters to leave Cuomo off their ballots in the city's ranked choice election in a last-ditch effort to block the former governor's comeback from a sexual harassment scandal.

“Let's make sure Andrew Cuomo gets nowhere near City Hall,” candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said Monday on WNYC radio, which interviewed the major candidates ahead of the election.

State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, another candidate, similarly asked voters not to vote for Cuomo, telling the station, “We need fresh leadership, we need to turn the page and we need bold solutions at this moment.”

The pitches came as Cuomo, who has been considered the frontrunner for months, has been trying to fend off a charge from Zohran Mamdani ahead of Tuesday's election.

Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, would be the city's first Muslim and first Indian American mayor if elected. A democratic socialist who got elected to the Legislature in 2020, Mamdani started the campaign as a relative unknown but has won support with a energetic campaign centered on improving the cost of living.

He spent part the second-to-last day of the campaign visiting businesses and potential voters in northern Manhattan, followed by a crowd of supporters and a man banging a drum.




“This is the most expensive city in the United States of America and New Yorkers are tired of having to worry each and every hour of each and every day of whether they can afford to live here,” said Mamdani.

Cuomo spoke at a union hall, where he warned Democrats against both radicalism and picking a candidate without experience.

“This is not a job for a novice. This is not a job for a person who never really had a job before,” Cuomo said. “We need someone who knows what they are doing on day one, because your lives depend on it.”

Mamdani, meanwhile, exuded confidence, telling WNYC he is “one day from toppling a political dynasty.”

Mamdani and Cuomo represent the Democratic Party's ideological divides, with Cuomo as an older moderate and Mamdani a younger progressive.

Former President Bill Clinton endorsed Cuomo on Sunday, saying voters should not “underestimate the complexity” of the challenges faced by a mayor. The New York Times didn't issue an endorsement this year, but wrote an editorial praising Lander and saying Cuomo would be a better choice than Mamdani, who it said was unworthy of being on people's ballots.

Mamdani has been endorsed by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.

The two candidates' reactions to the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites on Sunday offered more evidence of the party's internal split.

Cuomo, in a statement, criticized “the way Trump went about this without consulting Congress, without consulting the normal congressional officials” but stressed that “Iran cannot have nuclear capability.”

Mamdani released a statement that slammed Trump but quickly shifted focus back to his key issues, saying “these actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within.”

Cuomo, who won three terms as governor, resigned in 2021 after a report from the state attorney general concluded that he sexually harassed 11 women. He has denied wrongdoing.

New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters, that person wins the race outright. If nobody hits that threshold, the votes are then tabulated in multiple rounds. After each round, the candidate in last place is eliminated. Votes cast for that person are then redistributed to the candidates ranked next on the voter's ballot.

That continues until one candidate gets a majority.

Cuomo's opponents have urged voters not to rank him at all and therefore deprive him of support in later rounds of counting. 

Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.

This is CNBC'S live blog about the conflict in the Middle East.

There is growing optimism that a ceasefire in the brief war between Israel and Iran will hold, after it was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump.

What to know:

Trump said he was "not happy" with Israel and Iran after both nations engaged in attacks on each other following his announcement of the truce.

CNBC reporters are covering the Middle East conflict live on air and online, reporting from Washington, London, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, San Francisco, Singapore and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns that his country "will strike again" if Iran "thinks of rebuilding" its nuclear program.

"We destroyed the key facilities in Arak, Natanz, and Isfahan," Netanyahu says during remarks to the nation, NBC News reports.

He touts Israel's attack on Iran as "a historic victory" and says that his country would have "faced the danger of annihilation" if it did not act.

He also says Israel "has never had a greater friend" than Trump, who he says "joined our cause in an unprecedented way."

"We must not ease up. Hamas must be defeated, and our hostages must be brought home," Netanyahu says, adding that Israel has "no intention of easing off the gas pedal."

U.S. missile strikes did not completely destroy Iran's key nuclear sites, CNN first reported, citing an early U.S. intelligence assessment described to the news outlet by three sources briefed on it.

Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was not destroyed, two of those people told CNN.

One of the people said Tehran's centrifuges remain largely "intact," adding that the "assessment is that the US set them back maybe a few months, tops," CNN reported.

The assessment from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency was based on U.S. Central Command's analysis of battle damage from the bombings of three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. That analysis is ongoing, CNN reported.

The New York Times, citing officials familiar with the findings, later reported that a preliminary classified U.S. report found the bombings did not collapse the underground buildings of the Iranian nuclear sites.

The Times also reported that the early assessment is that the strikes set back Iran's nuclear program by just a few months.

The reports appear to contradict Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who have asserted that the strikes completely "obliterated" the Iranian nuclear sites.

Asked for comment by CNBC, the Pentagon shared a statement from Hegseth that, "Based on everything we have seen — and I've seen it all — our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons."

"Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target — and worked perfectly," Hegseth said in the statement. "The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission."

Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday, "The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed, and everyone knows it."

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement that the "alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as 'top secret' but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."

"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program," Leavitt said.

She added: "Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The classified House briefing on the Middle East, originally scheduled for today, is now set to take place on Friday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson says.

"Senior Administration officials will present the latest information pertaining to the situation involving Israel and Iran," he says in a post on X.

Earlier, he said the classified briefing was postponed "due to ongoing developments in the Middle East."

"This decision reflects the need to ensure that Members receive timely and complete information aligned with the current circumstances," Johnson writes on X.

Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, says he spoke with U.S. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth to thank Trump for taking action "against the Iranian nuclear threat."

"I emphasized that Israel will respect the ceasefire — as long as the other side does," Katz says in an X post. "We agreed to deepen the close U.S.-Israel security cooperation."

Katz writes that Hegseth "praised Israel and the IDF for the historic achievements made."

Israel's Ben Gurion Airport is returning to normal operations, the country's airports authority says.

"Restrictions on the number of incoming and outgoing flights, as well as the number of passengers on each flight, have been lifted," the Times of Israel reports from an Israel Airports Authority statement.

"In addition, restrictions on the arrival of passengers and accompanying persons at the airports have been lifted," the statement continues.

Iran's airspace is also partially open, according to flight monitoring company FlightRadar24.

"Iranian airspace is now open to international arrivals and departures to/from Tehran with prior permission," FlightRadar24 wrote on X.

Several of the Iranian nuclear sites struck by Israeli and U.S. missiles have sustained "extensive damage" to their uranium conversion and enrichment facilities, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency says.

"Our assessment is that there has been some localized radioactive as well as chemical release inside the affected facilities that contained nuclear material – mainly uranium enriched to varying degrees," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a press release.

Grossi said that "there has been no report of increased off-site radiation levels" or radiological impact in neighboring countries. And "crucially in terms of nuclear safety, Iran's research and power reactors were not targeted," he added.

U.S. strikes at Iran's Natanz nuclear site created two impact holes above the subterranean halls that were used for enrichment, the IAEA release said. "Based on its knowledge of what these halls contained, the IAEA assesses that this strike may have caused localized contamination and chemical hazards," the agency said.

Israel has lifted war-related restrictions across the country that had banned public gatherings, closed schools, shuttered all but essential businesses, and limited air travel.

"Following a situation assessment and approval by Defense Minister Israel Katz, it has been decided that starting today at [8 p.m. local time], the Home Front Command's defensive guidelines will be updated," Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.

As part of these changes, "all areas of the country will transition to full operational activity without restrictions," the IDF said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slams the delay of the Senate's classified briefing on Iran as "outrageous," "evasive" and "derelict."

"This last minute postponement of our briefing is outrageous," he tells reporters after the briefing, originally scheduled for today, was moved to Thursday, NBC News reports.

"It's evasive, it's derelict. They're bobbing and weaving and ducking," he says.

The briefing is reportedly postponed to allow for Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to return from the NATO summit and attend.

Stocks are posting gains today, amid cautious optimism about the Israel-Iran ceasefire.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 500 points, or 1.1%, with the S&P 500 also posting a 1.1% increase of nearly 70 points and the Nasdaq Composite up nearly 300 points, or 1.4%.

At least 18 stocks in the S&P 500 are trading at new 52-week highs today.

Several members of Congress are questioning what has become of Iran's stock of enriched uranium in the days since the U.S. damaged three nuclear facilities with airstrikes and bombs.

Atomic energy watchdogs estimate that Iran has at least 9 kilos of uranium enriched to 60%, a level that could relatively easily be further enriched to 90%, or weapons grade.

Republican Rep. Scott Perry, Penn., told CNN he suspects Iran still has enriched uranium even after the American strikes. "I will put it this way. I wouldn't be surprised if some of it still exists," he said.

Perry told CNN's John Berman he also believed Iran was still "a terrorist regime." 

"So after these 12 days there is still a terrorist regime in power with enriched uranium?" Berman asked.

 "That is absolutely true. Yeah, I think that's a correct characterization," said Perry.

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal is also concerned about the threat that Iran's enriched uranium poses to the United States. 

Blumenthal told NBC he wants the administration to tell senators "how effective the strikes against the Iranian nuclear capability have been. Where is the enriched uranium that seemingly was removed from Fordo?"  

"I believe deeply that a nuclear armed Iran is a threat to the entire world, including the United States, but confronting that threat requires a strategy as well as strength. I see no indication of a coherent strategy here. The president needs to explain to the American people as well as to Congress what the strategy is," said Blumenthal. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is arguing that the War Powers Act, a Nixon-era law limiting the president's power to unilaterally wage war, is unconstitutional. 

Johnson also vowed that a pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran under that law will not pass the House.

The Speaker told reporters that Trump's decision to order strikes on Iranian nuclear targets over the weekend was "clearly" within his powers under Article II of the U.S. Constitution.

He said he agreed with scholars who believe that the War Powers Resolution of 1973 violates Article II.

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, last week introduced a War Powers resolution that would bar the U.S. military from "unauthorized hostilities" in Iran. But Massie said Monday evening that he would not advance his resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, Politico reported.

Vice Admiral Charles Cooper II, Trump's nominee to serve as commander of U.S. Central Command, warns of an "emerging axis" among Iran, North Korea, Russia and China.

"We've certainly seen the tactical implications of support from Iran to Russia," he said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

"We've seen tactical implications of Chinese companies providing sensors and weapons and components to Iran, who ship them to the Houthis who shoot them at Americans," he added.

"I think we need to call those types of things out more, but clearly that emerging foursome, that axis, is one that we need to pay attention to."

Oil prices have fallen sharply now that Trump says China can keep buying oil from Iran, a sign that the U.S. is easing its maximum pressure campaign on the Islamic Republic in the wake of a ceasefire with Israel.

Global benchmark Brent fell $4.14, or 5.79%, to $67.34 per barrel by 11:55 a.m. ET. U.S. crude oil was last down $3.97, or 5.79%, to $65.54 a barrel. Prices closed 7% lower on Monday as the oil market bet that the conflict in the Middle East was winding down.

"China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. "Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S., also. It was my Great Honor to make this happen!"

— Spencer Kimball

Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken is calling the U.S.'s weekend missile strike on Iran nuclear sites "unwise and unnecessary" in a new New York Times op-ed.

"Now that it's done, I very much hope it succeeded," Blinken, who served under former President Joe Biden, wrote.

"I can only hope that we inflicted maximum damage — damage that gives the president the leverage he needs to finally deliver the deal he has so far failed to achieve," he wrote.

A former Defense Department official says the next phase in the Iran-Israel conflict will be at the negotiating table.

Michèle Flournoy, WestExec Advisors co-founder and managing partner and former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the Obama administration, said the focus now should be on putting pressure on both sides.

The key is to assess how much damage was actually done to Iran's nuclear programs and determine whether Iran will come to the negotiating table "more seriously than it did before," she told CNBC's Squawk Box. 

"I understand that we all want to sigh a big sigh of relief today with the ceasefire, but this is far from over as yet," she added.

Two classified briefings for Congress on Iran that were scheduled for this afternoon have been postponed, NBC News' Frank Thorp reports.

The decision to postpone the briefings comes as a fragile ceasefire appears to be taking hold, and both Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are in the Netherlands with Trump to attend the NATO summit.

It was unclear when the House briefing would be held, but the Senate briefing is scheduled for Thursday.

Thorp notes this will be the first classified briefing since the U.S. strikes last weekend to which all members of Congress are invited, not just a small group of intelligence committee leaders and party leadership.

— Christina Wilkie

Trump is claiming in a new Truth Social post that Israel and Iran both desired a ceasefire after more than a week of exchanging rocket fire. 

"Both Israel and Iran wanted to stop the War, equally! It was my great honor to Destroy All Nuclear facilities & capability, and then, STOP THE WAR!"

While U.S. bombing did significant damage to three nuclear facilities, it did not eliminate Iran's enriched uranium. U.S. intelligence officials have admitted in recent days they do not know where much of that material is being stored.

Starbucks:

A coffee drink at a Starbucks location in New York.

Starbucks Corp. is simplifying how it charges for drink modifications, a change the company said will result in better value for customers.

Starting Tuesday, the coffee chain is charging a flat fee of 80 cents for any combination of sauces and syrups, no matter the number of pumps. Previously, the cost could vary depending on the flavor of the sauce or syrup, or the type of drink it was added to.

One piece of career advice that's stood the test of time is to write a thank you note to anyone you interview with for a job. Doing so can help give you an edge to stand out from other applicants, experts say.

For one woman, a thank you note landed her a gig working with a CEO right after college, and it even helped shape her career.

Ashley Graef was a senior in college working an internship where she interviewed people for a fashion publication. During one assignment, she connected with the CEO of a tech company.

She hand-wrote him a thank you note after their meeting, expressing her gratitude for his time. Graef tells CNBC Make It that he was taken by the gesture, noting that "nobody ever does this anymore."

Graef says the CEO offered her a gig to ghostwrite his Medium blog posts, where he'd share updates about his business and thought leadership on his industry.

She earned between $150 to $200 per post, about once or twice a month, she says, for a few years after college.

Sending a handwritten thank you note is "a lost art," Graef says, but she was taught to do so when she was a kid. "I tell people I've gotten jobs that way."

It doesn't take much time or effort to send a thoughtful thank you after a job interview, though "surprisingly few" applicants do it these days, executive recruiter Jeff Hyman previously told Make It.

A good note doesn't have to be long but should:

Graef, now 29, also recommends personalizing your note. "You don't have to write a thesis, but point out a moment or two that are specific to your interaction with whomever is receiving the note," she says.

Graef says she writes thank you notes for "everything": if she makes a new connection, after a job interview and even if she gets a job rejection. She prefers to send a handwritten note — if time is of the essence, she'll send an email right after the interaction but follow up with a physical card to arrive a day or two later.

Graef went into copywriting after college. In early 2024, she was laid off from her job as a Macy's copywriter and has since focused on building her own business doing freelance copywriting, editing and proofreading for companies.

Late last year, she decided to revisit her earlier efforts to ghostwrite for CEOs and other executives, especially as they build their brands on LinkedIn.

Graef landed a full-time contract job in January and spends 10 to 15 hours per week on her own writing business. Working in her new quality assurance job doesn't feel as rewarding as writing for clients, but she hopes to one day scale her business to replace her income and eventually quit the corporate world.

Anthropic's use of books to train its artificial intelligence model Claude was "fair use" and "transformative," a federal judge ruled late on Monday.

Amazon-backed Anthropic's AI training did not violate the authors' copyrights since the large language models "have not reproduced to the public a given work's creative elements, nor even one author's identifiable expressive style," wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup.

"The purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate new text was quintessentially transformative," Alsup wrote. "Like any reader aspiring to be a writer."

The decision is a significant win for AI companies as legal battles play out over the use and application of copyrighted works in developing and training LLMs. Alsup's ruling begins to establish the legal limits and opportunities for the industry going forward.

CNBC has reached out to Anthropic and the plaintiffs for comment

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, was brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson in August. The suit alleged that Anthropic built a "multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books."

Alsup did, however, order a trial on the pirated material that Anthropic put into its central library of content, even though the company did not use it for AI training.

"That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft, but it may affect the extent of statutory damages," the judge wrote.

The conflict in the Middle East has led many insurance underwriters in the maritime shipping market to avoid offering coverage in the region to any U.S., Israel, or U.K.-linked vessels.

"Many underwriters are not touching vessels with perceived U.S., U.K. or Israeli links at any price," said David Osler, insurance editor for Lloyd's List.

According to insurance broker Marsh McLennan, rates among insurance companies that are offering coverage to vessels are now ranging between 0.25%-0.45% of ship value, up from 0.125% a few weeks ago.

These rates were consistent over the previous week, but after the U.S. strikes over the weekend on Iran nuclear sites, Middle East marine war risk rates "hardened significantly," according to Osler.

By the end of the day on Monday, pricing had risen to as high as 0.5%, and was even higher for U.S.-affiliated ships.

Container ships and tankers vary in estimated value based on age, size, cargo held and markets served, with containerships worth anywhere from tens of millions of dollars to the most expensive container ships and oil tankers reaching $100 million in value and above.

Osler tells CNBC because of the fluidity, underwriters also cut the required notification period from 48 hours to 24 hours.

"The certainty we can convey is that we can get insurance. The uncertainty is the pricing," said Marcus Baker, global head of marine, cargo, and logistics at Marsh McLennan.

Baker told CNBC he cannot remember a time when the notification period was reduced from 48 hours to 24 hours.

Middle East ocean freight rates have also experienced a surge.

Among issues that are influencing the insurance market are concerns about Iran blocking and trapping ships, and the level of appetite from China, a big customer of Iranian oil. President Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday that China can keep buying Iranian oil, a signal the U.S. was not intent on maximizing pressure on Iran's economy.

"If there was a pullback from China, there would be less call for war risk, so the simple laws of supply and demand suggest it should calm rates," said Osler.

Osler said rates should ease off if the current tentative ceasefire holds, based on information he has received from insurance market sources, but headlines on Tuesday indicated that was uncertain and weighed on the outlook.

"This just gets to the heart of the nervousness that we're seeing in the marketplace, because they just, don't know, and things are happening so fast. I mean, in Trump's interview this morning, I don't know what that's going to do, but he's obviously angry," Osler said of President Trump's comments to the press before he left for a NATO summit when he said he was "not happy" with Israel and Iran, after having announced the ceasefire on Monday night.

"The developments effectively put the market in wait-and-see mode, with conditions volatile as underwriters come to terms with political developments as they unfold," Osler said. "Inquiries are said to be well down, which indicates that some owners are not prepared to take bookings to the region, given the military situation."

Baker said a decision by Iran to shut down the Strait of Hormuz has political and economic aspects, and practical issues for China and India, the largest destinations of Iranian crude, not to mention the reaction from other Middle Eastern nations to consider, incuding Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman.

Last Wednesday, the Joint War Committee of Lloyd's of London's war risk underwriters met, where they released a list of designated areas underwriters have the discretion, but not the obligation, to levy additional premiums or APs. This list remains unchanged.

In an updated threat circular from British maritime security firm Ambrey released on Tuesday, it wrote, "There is a realistic possibility that the conflict between Israel and Iran will continue/restart, and there may be subsequent U.S. involvement, but the risk of U.S. involvement is assessed to have lowered. However, the Gulf is generally taken to be part of the wider Indian Ocean listed area and links to the listed Red Sea. This means that in practice, shipowners must provide insurers with notification of transits."

Baker said it is important to put the rise in rates in context of recent conflict zones and shipping.

"Ukraine rates went up to 5% and we're only, we're not even a tenth of those rates yet," he said. "Five percent of around a million dollars, or a million and a half dollars, depending on the size of the ship. It was a very significant increase in the value of grain, which was way less than the value of a cargo of oil and a VLCC [very large crude carrier]. It's just a question of different underlies, different appetites, different risk perceptions, and that will influence where things go," Baker added.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European stocks ended the day on a high as the Israel-Iran ceasefire appeared to be holding.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index provisionally rose 1.2% for the day. Regionally, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 rose 1.6% and 1% respectively. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 tentatively closed flat.

Among the stocks losing the most were oil and gas related, such as tanker owner Frontline, energy giants Equinor and BP, as well as defense contractors BAE Systems, Thales, Dassault Aviation, Hensoldt, Renk and Rheinmetall.

Travel stocks and building materials firms led gains on the Stoxx Europe 600 index during afternoon trade.

Carnival Plc shares jumped 12% after the company beat adjusted earnings per share expectations for the second quarter with $0.35 per share.

Shares of TUI Group were also up by more than 10% after the company announced a deal to acquire a 20% stake in Swiss tour operator Bentour Reisen. TUI also sold a 20% stake in its subsidiary, Nazar Nordic, to Bentour Reisen.

Building materials and construction stocks, Amrize, Buzzi and Holcim were all trading up between 6% and 11%, indicating a risk-on mood among investors as the Israel-Iran ceasefire appears to be holding.

The government of Spain has approved BBVA's hostile takeover of peer Sabadell, the fourth-largest bank in Spain, with conditions.

Spain's second-largest bank can proceed with the takeover of its rival, provided they operate as separate entities for at least three years. The government said it will also be able to extend the duration by two additional years, if it deems necessary.

"The government has authorized the BBVA and Sabadell deal on the condition that, for the next three years, they remain separate legal entities and maintain separate assets, as well as autonomy in the management of their activities," Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo told a news conference, according to Reuters.

The conditions are in addition to those imposed by competition watchdog CNMC earlier this year, including payment services where BBVA said it would commit to divesting some of its stake.

The approval from the government would be the final hurdle before shareholders of the banks are able to approve the deal, currently valued at around 14 billion euros ($16.25 billion).

The euro, British pound and Swiss franc have been on the rise against the U.S. dollar throughout the session, and were last seen trading 0.2%, 0.6% and 0.3% higher against the greenback, respectively.

Sterling also made gains against the euro, jumping by around 0.4%.

The British currency has surged by 8.7% against the dollar so far this year, but the rally cooled somewhat in June, with the cable up by around 1% since the month began.

Amazon said Tuesday that it plans to invest £40 billion ($54.4 billion) in the U.K. over the next three years.

The e-commerce giant announced several commitments as part of the multibillion-pound investment, including the development of four new fulfillment centers and upgrades to existing operations across the country.

The announcement was cheered by the British government, which has been courting investments from major tech players. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the investment would create thousands of new jobs and was a sign the government's growth plan was working.

In its third-quarter Eurozone Economic Outlook report, published Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings forecast that euro zone economic growth would rebound from 0.8% this year to 1.4% by 2027 — despite more severe tariff effects than previously anticipated.

Strong private balance sheets, regional fiscal policy and cooling interest rates would support the uptick in gross domestic product, S&P said.

"We do not expect tariff-related volatility to hamper the ongoing recovery in domestic demand," Sylvain Broyer, S&P's chief EMEA economist said. "Public spending on infrastructure and defence should boost growth from 2026."

European defense spending was forecast in the report to hit 800 billion euros ($928 billion) by 2029.

The Stoxx Europe Travel and Leisure index jumped 4% in early trade after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Iran and Israel had committed to a ceasefire.

London-listed airlines and leisure stocks also topped the Stoxx 600 in the morning. EasyJet rose 6.5%, InterContinental Hotels was up 3.3% and Carnival jumped 5.9%.

Multiple airlines announced on Monday they were diverting flights in the Middle East as the region's military conflict continued to disrupt flights. This morning, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian state media outlet Press TV confirmed a ceasefire had begun.

As investors weigh the latest developments out of the Middle East — where Israel and Iran now have a ceasefire in place, according to U.S. President Donald Trump — German defense stocks are selling off.

Shares of Hensoldt were last seen down 4.1%, while Rheinmetall, down 3.9%, and Renk, down 3.5%, were also among those in the defense sector seeing big downward moves.

Shares of Swedish carmaker Volvo were up 2.3% in early trade, paring earlier gains.

That came after the firm announced on Tuesday morning that its Volvo Construction Equipment arm would sell its ownership in China-based SDLG, and would acquire construction machinery supplier Swecon.

We're 20 minutes into Tuesday's trading session, and the regional Stoxx 600 is up by around 1.2%.

Travel and leisure stocks are leading the gains, with airlines jumping after the announcement of an Israel-Iran ceasefire. The Stoxx Travel and Leisure index was last seen trading 4.2% higher, putting it on track for its biggest one-day jump since April 10.

All major bourses are in positive territory, with Germany's DAX index jumping 1.8%.

— Chloe Taylor

The pan-European Stoxx 600 began the week on a negative note, ending Monday's trading session around 0.3% lower.

Looking at individual stocks, Monday's worst performers included Poste Italiane, which closed 6.3% lower, Danish jewelry maker Pandora, which shed 5.3%, and pharma giant Novo Nordisk, which also lost 5.3% during the session.

On Monday, it was announced that Novo had ended its deal with U.S. telehealth firm Hims & Hers over concerns about sales of Wegovy copycat drugs.

At the other end of the index, London-listed shares of Spectris jumped 15.7% on Monday after it was reported private equity firm Advent had agreed to take over the company for £4.4 billion ($6 billion). The company, which makes testing equipment, rejected a bid from private equity giant KKR earlier this month. KKR said Monday that it "strongly encourages [Spectris] shareholders to take no action with regards to the Advent offer."

Good morning from London on Tuesday, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests a positive start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 0.3% higher at 8,792, Germany's DAX up 1.1% 23,541, France's CAC 40 1% higher at 7,618 and Italy's FTSE MIB also up 1% at 39,321.

Global market sentiment rose after President Donald Trump said that there is a ceasefire timeline for Israel and Iran, prompting U.S. stock futures and Asia-Pacific markets to rise on Monday night.

"It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE ... for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Neither Iran nor Israel has publicly confirmed acceptance of a ceasefire timeline, however.

NATO's annual summit begins on Tuesday, with a defense spending hike the focus of the two-day gathering in The Hague, in the Netherlands.

Allies have agreed in principle to sharply increase their defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035. Whether those pledges materialize will be the big question, with some member states already pushing back against the figure.

There are no major earnings or data releases Tuesday.

Amazon is expanding its rapid delivery machine to more rural corners of the U.S.

The company said Tuesday it plans to bring same- or next-day delivery to more than 4,000 smaller cities, towns and rural communities across the country "for the first time" by the end of this year.

The move is part of a previously announced small-town expansion that will see Amazon spend roughly $4 billion by the end of 2026 to triple the size of its rural delivery network.

Amazon has made speedy delivery a cornerstone of its juggernaut e-commerce business as it faces heightened competition from brick-and-mortar stalwarts such as Walmart, and newer entrants including Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop, which have hooked shoppers with their ultradiscounted wares.

"This expansion goes beyond speed — it's about transforming daily life for rural customers, who typically live farther from brick-and-mortar retailers, have fewer product and brand choices, and face limited delivery options when shopping online," Amazon said in a release.

The announcement comes as Amazon prepares to kick off its longest-ever Prime Day. The 96-hour event will run four days this year starting at 12:01 a.m. PT on July 8, and continuing through July 11.

The U.S. and President Donald Trump are totally committed to NATO, the military alliance's chief said on Tuesday, looking to reassure allies following concerns that Washington could abandon the Western military bloc due to frustration over uneven defense spending.

"There is total commitment by the U.S. president and the U.S. senior leadership to NATO," NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Tuesday morning, as the summit kicked off in The Hague Netherlands.

"However, it comes with an expectation. And the expectation is that we will finally deal with this huge irritant, which is that we are not spending enough as Europeans and Canadians," Rutte told a public forum at the summit.

"They want us to equalize with what the U.S. is spending," he added, saying it was not only fair to do so, but also necessary amid the continuing threat from Russia.

Tensions between Washington, Canadian and European allies' defense spending have overshadowed NATO for a number of years, however ahead of this summit, members agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035.

This year's gathering is taking place against a backdrop of conflict in the Middle East and ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. In addition there have been ongoing questions over the U.S.' commitment to the alliance given arguments over the varying amounts member states allocate to defense and security.

Rutte said his key message to European allies was to "stop worrying so much."

"Start to make sure you get [defense] investment plans done, that you get the industrial base up and running, that the support for Ukraine remains at a high level, this is what you should work on and stop running around worrying about the U.S., they are with us," he added.

NATO members pledged back in 2014 to spend 2% of GDP on defense but some countries, such as Canada and Spain, have struggled to meet even that threshold. Other member states, particularly those on the northern and eastern flanks of the bloc and closer to adversary Russia, such as Poland and Estonia, have far exceeded the 2% target.

As such, some allies will be in Trump's good books when he joins the summit later Tuesday, while others will not be.

Spain has already balked at the 5% spending target — it is the lowest spender in the alliance — and there were reports that it had received an exemption from the new threshold, but the Netherlands' Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans disputed that, telling CNBC that Madrid had to match the commitments made by others.

"I don't think Spain gets an exception, because they will sign the Joint Declaration tomorrow, and the rules that we have within NATO also apply to Spain, so they also need to take their responsibility. They also committed to the military plans [agreeing new capability targets] two weeks ago, and I expect Spain also to fulfil their commitment," he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the sidelines of the summit on Tuesday.

Allies will sense the need to keep Trump onside, given his well-known skepticism and criticism of collectives like NATO and the Group of Seven of industrialized nations as talking shops that lack substance. Last week, the president left a G7 summit early, ostensibly due to the situation in the Middle East, but the departure was also seen as an expression of his frustration with such summits.

Trump is due to join fellow NATO leaders on Tuesday evening for a red carpet ceremony and dinner hosted by the King and Queen of the Netherlands. It's expected that the alliance will issue a joint statement at the end of the summit on Wednesday, formally committing to the 5% defense spending increase.

Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kęstutis Budrys told CNBC Tuesday that Trump's presence at the summit, albeit shorter than other leaders' attendance, was "proof that NATO is a strong alliance that is functional, that we are ambitious, and that we deliver."

"And with the joint statement tomorrow, we will see that we are capable of agreeing on [an] ambitious benchmark on 5% of GDP being spent on defense, and that's a big thing, and it's also because of the leadership of President Trump and of leadership of our Secretary General Mark Rutte," he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick.

OpenAI:

Microsoft is struggling to sell its Copilot AI assistant to corporations because many of their employees want ChatGPT.

OpenAI's nascent strength in the enterprise market is giving Microsoft, its partner and biggest investor, indigestion.

Last spring, drugmaker Amgen Inc. announced plans to buy Microsoft Corp.'s Copilot AI assistant for 20,000 employees. It was a timely endorsement of the software company's multibillion-dollar bet on generative artificial intelligence, and Microsoft touted its new Copilot customer in three separate case studies.

Thirteen months later, Amgen employees are using a rival product: OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Google could face changes to its online search services in the U.K. after regulators raised concerns over the tech giant's dominance.

The Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday said it is consulting on a proposal to give Google "strategic market status," a designation under new competition rules for tech firms that hold entrenched power in a certain market.

The watchdog was granted expanded competition and merger control powers this year as the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act came into force.

Similar to a European Union law known as the Digital Markets Act, the legislation gives the CMA the ability to directly enforce consumer protections on tech giants and take action — including fines of up to 10% of global annual revenues for breaches.

The CMA laid out a roadmap of measures for Google if its strategic market status designation is successful, including:

In response to the CMA's decision, Google on Tuesday said the outcome of such changes "could have significant implications for businesses and consumers" in the U.K.

"The CMA has today reiterated that 'strategic market status' does not imply that anti-competitive behaviour has taken place — yet this announcement presents clear challenges to critical areas of our business in the UK," Oliver Bethell, Google's senior director for competition, said in a statement.

"We're concerned that the scope of the CMA's considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided."

Bethell added that Google plans to "continue working constructively with the CMA" to avoid such measures from being imposed.

It comes as regulators around the world have increasingly been looking to rein in Big Tech players over their significant market power.

In April, a U.S. judge ruled that Google holds illegal monopolies in two markets for online advertising technology, paving the way for antitrust prosecutors to seek a breakup of its ad products.

Meanwhile, an advisor to the European Union's top court last week recommended it dismiss Google's appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro ($4.8 billion) antitrust fine.

Oil prices are down sharply while stocks are up on Tuesday after Middle East tensions lessened.

President Donald Trump said Israel and Iran have agreed to a "complete and total" cease-fire and, early Tuesday morning, Israel agreed.

In a statement, Israel said it had "achieved the objectives of the operation." Hours before this, Iran's foreign minister posted on X that there was no cease-fire agreement — but that if Israel stopped attacking Iran, Iran would not engage further.

Benchmark US West Texas Intermediate oil futures were down 3.2% to $66.30 a barrel at 6:10 a.m. ET, while international Brent crude oil futures were 3.4% lower at $69.08 a barrel.

Oil prices have now reversed gains from June 12, a day before Israel struck Iran.

US stock futures were higher at 6.10 a.m. ET:

Oil prices were already falling after Iran's retaliatory strikes on a US airbase in Qatar on Monday, following the American forces' strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

Though Iran targeted US military assets, markets are relieved that Iran did not target the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route for the global oil and gas trade, wrote analysts at Rystad Energy, a research and intelligence firm.

Tehran's strikes on US airbase in Qatar signaled "a possible desire from Iran to de-escalate by inflicting minimal damage to US infrastructure in the region," wrote the analysts.

Qatar said Iranian missiles were intercepted. US officials said there were no reports of casualties.

The energy markets are now focused on developments in the Strait of Hormuz, where a quarter of seaborne oil and a fifth of global liquefied natural gas trade passes. If the Hormuz is affected and closes, the markets may turn again.

"The waterway handles significant volumes for global markets and its importance cannot be understated," added Janiv Shah, a vice president of oil markets analysis at Rystad Energy.

In an earlier Truth Social post, Trump described Iran's retaliatory attack as a "very weak response," and thanked Tehran for giving the US early notice of the strikes.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould wrote in a note on Tuesday that markets "will be watching closely to see if the cessation in hostilities is maintained and for Iran's next move."

"There are still outstanding questions, from whether a ceasefire will hold given that mutual strikes had continued overnight, to the future of what remains of Iran's nuclear programme," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a blog on Tuesday.

"But as things stand, the past 12 days look set to join the long list of geopolitical shocks that proved temporarily disruptive but had little lasting effect on markets," they added.

Many couples go all-out for their wedding. But what exactly does it look like when the third-richest person in the world gets married in one of the most romantic cities in the world?

We could soon find out as billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez, a newscaster turned helicopter pilot, are set to tie the knot in Venice this week.

Business Insider asked luxury wedding planners, who were not involved in the Bezos and Sánchez nuptials, in Venice and elsewhere, to dish on what exactly goes into planning a high-profile wedding like this one.

"Whoever you are, on your wedding day, you want a day that's more special than your ordinary everyday," said wedding planner and event producer Sarah Haywood. "But if your ordinary everyday is Jeff Bezos', that's a challenge."

When working on luxury weddings of this scale, the planners said no details would be overlooked.

"There's a really specific picture of what we're envisioning, and we're not leaving anything to chance for these types of weddings," said Chelsea LaFollette, owner, planner, and designer of Brilliant Event Planning.

As for how much Bezos and Sánchez's wedding might cost, Roberta Camille Lione, a luxury wedding planner and founder of Italian Knot, said it could get into the eight-figure range.

Lione, who plans luxury weddings in Venice but is not connected to the Bezos wedding, told BI it was "absolutely plausible" for a multi-day, high-end wedding celebration in the city to cost 10 million euros, or about $11.5 million.

She said unconfirmed reports that the wedding will cost 30 million euros seemed quite high, even by luxury standards, but that it was "not impossible — especially if the couple is sparing no expense across accommodations, logistics, entertainment, and design."

"Underneath everything is this huge machine with cogs going around making sure that the event's going to happen seemingly seamlessly," Haywood said of luxury weddings. "We're preempting everything that the bride, the groom, their families, the bridal party, and the guests will want."

That might mean creating tablescape pictures to pinpoint exactly where every type of fork, knife, and spoon goes. LaFollette said vendor timelines are so granular they're down to 5-minute intervals.

Whereas most couples might rent a bar, at more upscale weddings, "everything is bespoke," said Haywood.

"From the platforms that they're dining on, to the staging, to the bars — anything that you can see has been created especially for them," in many of these cases, she said.

Service alone can be a huge cost. For a multi-day celebration, as Bezos and Sánchez's is expected to be, sometimes a couple can also expect to buy out a hotel just to put the workers up.

"Behind the scenes, we're often working with 100+ people to really pull these days together from start to finish to take care of every little detail," LaFollette added.

A hospitality team could also be hired to serve as a concierge for the wedding guests, taking care of their every need, with someone on call 24 hours a day.

Headline entertainment is also not out of the question, and a performer's technical rider can create some hefty expenses.

"If a global star like Beyoncé were performing, that could add several million euros just for the performance, not to mention staging, production, and logistics," Lione said.

Another major cost driver would be if the couple is covering the stay for their guests at top-tier hotels, which could run into the millions of euros, she added.

"Transportation is an enormous cost, especially the luxury transportation for hundreds of people multiple times, which can be hundreds of thousands of dollars," LaFollette said.

And besides the wedding ceremony itself, the events leading up to a destination wedding that turn it into a "mini-vacation" for guests, like a welcome party or a local excursion, can add significantly to the costs for the couple.

Haywood said Venice made sense as the destination for Bezos and Sánchez's wedding, saying, "European glamour is having a bit of a renaissance" right now.

While details about where the events will take place or where guests will stay have not been made public, several luxury hotels in Venice are largely booked for the week, including the Gritti Palace, Hotel Cipriani, and Aman, which was where George and Amal Clooney got married in 2014.

Two Italy-based wedding planners told BI that while Venice is a stunning location for a wedding, the floating city poses unique logistical challenges.

"With no cars in the city, all transport is via private boats, water taxis, and gondolas. For ultra-VIP events, fleets of luxury boats are arranged to handle guest transfers with discretion and style," Lione said.

Giovanna Wurmbrand Stuppach, founder of Anthea Wedding, told BI that a wedding of this reported size, around 200 guests, should not cause major disruptions to residents because they are typically "very discreet" and take place in private venues.

But she said she expects some businesses, from hotels to water taxis to florists, to benefit from the celebrations. "The luxury sector will undoubtedly be the biggest winner in the city. This is certainly not to be underestimated," she said.

Weddings of the ultrawealthy also incur some expenses that many others don't.

There will likely be security watching the perimeter of the space, keeping an eye on the guest list, and even watching out for people flying drones to try to catch a glimpse.

"Nobody wants to have to think about their security plans" for their wedding day, LaFollette says. "But it's a reality for a lot of these clients."

Lione said that Venice's narrow streets and crowded canals means "discreet but robust security details are essential."

"Coordination with local authorities is often necessary, especially for controlling access to public areas," she said, adding that VIP guests could also cause fan-driven overcrowding that would need to be managed and planned for.

When the Clooneys got married in Venice over a decade ago, the groom and guests arrived at the Aman via water taxis on the Grand Canal, which was lined with paparazzi and well-wishers.

However, protesters in Venice have said they plan to disrupt the Bezos-Sánchez wedding, so the event organizers are likely also factoring that in when it comes to coordinating transportation and security.

The wedding planners may also coordinate with a couple's PR teams on the degree of social media posts and publicity that the wedding may or may not have.

Whatever Bezos and Sánchez have in store for their nuptials, LaFollette said the celebrations would be "setting the example of what weddings are going to aspire to for the next few years."

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Two Republican senators are planning to debut a framework on Tuesday for a major bill that would set the rules of the road for digital assets.

According to the framework, being introduced by Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott of South Carolina and Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, who heads the panel's digital assets committee, the future bill will define when crypto is a commodity or a security, allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of digital currencies.

Also signing on are Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.

Those pushing the legislation say the proposed bill would also contain a "small, common-sense package of measures directed at preventing money laundering and sanctions evasion."

"These principles will serve as an important baseline for negotiations on this bill," Scott told CNBC in a statement. "I'm hopeful my colleagues will put politics aside and provide long-overdue clarity for digital asset regulation."

Scott is looking to build off the bipartisan momentum around crypto on display last week, when a bill on stablecoins passed the Senate. Nearly all Republicans were joined by 18 Democrats in supporting the legislation.

Taking to the Senate floor after the vote, Lummis said the stablecoin bill is "only the first step," and she called on lawmakers to finish the more complex market structure bill this year.

A House version of the market structure legislation was approved by two committees this month – the Financial Services Committee, which oversees the SEC, and Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC.

While President Donald Trump said on Truth Social that the House should move "LIGHTNING FAST" on the Senate's stablecoin bill, House Financial Services Chairman French Hill, R-Ark., said at an event that he wants stablecoin and market structure bills to move together. He avoided answering questions about whether the House would take up the Senate's differing stablecoin bill.

The Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the forthcoming bill at 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

In this article

Crypto company Digital Asset said Tuesday that it's netted $135 million in funding from a raft of major names in banking and finance.

The firm, which touts itself as a regulated crypto player, said it raised the fresh cash in a funding round co-led by DRW and Tradeweb, with Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas and Ken Griffin's Citadel Securities also investing.

The investment highlights how large financial institutions are embedding themselves in the once murky world of cryptocurrencies.

Previously associated with fraud, money laundering and other illicit activities, digital assets have become a more mainstream asset class over the years as big names like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley warmed to the space.

Just last week, JPMorgan launched its own version of a stablecoin, a deposit token called "JPMD."

"With growing participation from global financial institutions and market participants, we expect this funding round to help us solidify our role as the backbone of digital finance," Yuval Rooz, Digital Asset's CEO and co-founder, told CNBC. 

Digital Asset sells a number of digital asset services to its clients, which include major Wall Street players like Goldman Sachs, Citadel and Virtu. Co-founded in 2014 by Rooz, a trader turned entrepreneur, the firm competes with the likes of Ripple, R3 and Consensys.

The firm will use the new funding to advance adoption of the Canton Network. Initially developed by Digital Asset but now open-source, Canton is a public blockchain designed for financial institutions to move assets and data around while meeting regulatory and privacy requirements.

Banks and trading firms are using Canton to tokenize real-world assets such as bonds, commodities and money market funds.

"This raise will allow us to build upon the continuing momentum around the Canton Network and accelerate the onboarding of more high-quality assets, finally making blockchain's transformative promise an institutional-scale reality," Rooz told CNBC.

The network now supports trillions of dollars in tokenized assets, according to Digital Asset's CEO.

When Jayant Tyagi, a Salesforce software engineer, wants quick answers from ChatGPT, he doesn't bother opening the app or heading to his browser.

Instead, he fires off a voice message to ChatGPT inside WhatsApp, the world's most popular messaging service owned by Meta.

"I'm already an avid WhatsApp user, so it makes sense to access ChatGPT right there instead of installing yet another app," he told Business Insider. "It's super quick."

Tyagi is far from alone. Lately, WhatsApp has quietly become the place where users around the world talk to and juggle multiple rival AI chatbots like those from OpenAI and Perplexity alongside Meta AI, Meta's own assistant that the company bakes into the app.

WhatsApp, used by more than 3 billion people globally, is "the largest surface that people use Meta AI on," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's April earnings call. The app is also becoming an AI free-for-all, with rival chatbots now jockeying for attention inside.

As WhatsApp becomes one of the most important battlegrounds in consumer AI, that competition could make it harder for Meta AI to become the default choice for the billions of users the company hopes to win over.

"A lot of people are finding WhatsApp to be a natural and useful place to explore AI," Meta spokesperson Vispi Bhopti told BI.

Bhopti added that more than a billion users use Meta AI across WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, although WhatsApp continues to see the strongest usage.

"We believe people will try multiple AIs and choose what's right for them," Bhopti said.

OpenAI, which made ChatGPT available on WhatsApp at the end of last year, said that the move is part of a broader accessibility mission.

"We're continuing to reduce barriers for people new to AI to experience the power of this technology," an OpenAI spokesperson told BI.

Perplexity's chatbot, which launched on WhatsApp in the spring, now handles more than a million queries a day on the app, a spokesperson told BI. Demand for the bot on WhatsApp was so strong that it briefly crashed at launch.

"Perplexity's WhatsApp bot has seen unprecedented demand — volume far beyond anything we anticipated," Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas posted a month ago.

Rival chatbots plug in to WhatsApp through WhatsApp Business Platform, a service that lets larger businesses pay Meta to send messages to people asking to receive them, and which nets the company over $1 billion a year, Bhopti said.

This means any company can run a chatbot on WhatsApp simply by paying Meta, no formal partnership required. In practice, that has opened the door for rival AI companies to tap into WhatsApp's massive global audience without needing Meta's explicit blessing.

That reach is especially valuable in emerging markets. While WhatsApp has roughly 100 million monthly users in the US, its footprint is far larger in countries like India and Brazil, where it serves as a primary communication tool, and for many, the main gateway to the internet.

By plugging into WhatsApp, companies like OpenAI and Perplexity can grow their presence in these markets without having to convince users to download separate apps or sign up for new services.

"We do not think of users as 'monetizable,'" a Perplexity spokesperson told BI. "We think about them as people with questions, and our mission is to answer any question, any time, on any platform. Users choose to upgrade to Perplexity Pro for many reasons, but it's their choice. This experience aligns with the spirit of WhatsApp as well."

For users, WhatsApp is becoming an AI marketplace where chatbots from different companies now compete for attention inside the same app.

Users can reach both ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp simply by saving their official numbers in your phone's contacts (1-800-CHATGPT — handy!) and starting a chat — no sign-up required. Both allow users to ask questions, generate images, and interact with voice notes.

"Using these bots directly in WhatsApp feels more natural, like texting a smart friend, compared to opening separate apps for each one," Sumit Gupta, an engineer at San Francisco-based productivity startup Notion, told BI.

Both bots are restricted to one-on-one chats. Meta AI, on the other hand, can be pulled directly into group conversations, which remains a key advantage for it.

"I use Meta AI a lot in groups to generate memes and create polls," Naga Santhosh Reddy Vootukuri, an engineering manager at Microsoft, told BI. "But if I want something more creative, like Ghibli-style images, I'll go to ChatGPT. I still trust Perplexity's search the most."

WhatsApp has long been a breeding ground for misinformation. Now, users are turning AI chatbots on the app into their own truth squads.

Vootukuri said that he often pulls Meta AI into group chats to "bust fake videos," especially around politics, that crop up in conversations. Srinivas, the Perplexity CEO, highlighted the trend on LinkedIn earlier this year, urging users to forward misinformation to Perplexity's WhatsApp chatbot and get it fact-checked instantly.

A Perplexity spokesperson told BI that the company introduced the feature because "WhatsApp, in particular, often struggles with misinformation through forwarded messages."

AI chatbots through WhatsApp can work even on flights. Many airlines limit in-flight WiFi to basic messaging apps, and since the ChatGPT and Perplexity bots run entirely within WhatsApp, users can easily access them midair, as several people have posted on social media.

For power users, mixing and matching chatbots within WhatsApp has become second nature.

"I use Meta AI a lot for rephrasing messages or casual stuff where I don't care about accuracy," Manas Paldhe, a software engineer at Infinitus Systems, told BI. "But when I want a more retrieval-based approach, such as getting links to news articles, I turn to Perplexity. For serious writing or deeper work, I still go back to ChatGPT."

That kind of flexibility could make it harder for Meta to lock users into its own assistant.

For now, users seem happy with the growing AI mix inside the app. After all, the best chatbot is simply the one that gets the job done, no matter where it lives.

Hims & Hers stock plunged 35% on Monday after its collaboration with Novo Nordisk came to a halt.

The Danish pharmaceutical giant said it was ending the partnership because Hims is selling and promoting a cheaper copycat of Novo's blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy.

"Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk," Novo said in a statement on Monday.

Novo added that according to its investigation, telehealth companies that compound semaglutide drugs use ingredients "manufactured by foreign suppliers in China."

Novo said that Hims would no longer have direct access to Wegovy. Novo's stock closed more than 5% lower on Monday.

In a statement on X on Monday, Hims' CEO Andrew Dudum said Novo was being anti-competitive and that Hims will continue to provide a range of treatments, including Wegovy.

"In recent weeks, Novo Nordisk's commercial team increasingly pressured us to control clinical standards and steer patients to Wegovy regardless of whether it was clinically best for patients," he wrote. "We refuse to be strong-armed by any pharmaceutical company's anticompetitive demands that infringe on the independent decision making of providers and limit patient choice."

Hims' stock has been on a roller coaster this year, with shares dropping and jumping sharply on new developments in the weight loss drug industry.

At the end of April, Hims stock surged 20% after Novo announced a long-term collaboration with Hims to make obesity treatments accessible on the Hims platform.

The announcement came just months after Hims' CEO said that the company would no longer sell compounded versions of Novo's weight loss drugs. Instead, it would sell "personalized" dosages of Wegovy under rules allowing it for clinical reasons such as decreased side effects. The company's stock fell over 19% following Dudum's remarks on Novo.

The company was allowed to make legal copies of Novo's weight loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during a shortage that began in 2022. In February, the US Food and Drug Administration removed semaglutide injection products from its shortage list and gave compounders 60-90 days to stop making copies.

Hims is up 74% this year. Novo is down 19% this year on worries that the company is rapidly losing market share to American pharmaceutical rival Eli Lilly.

Hims and Novo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Bitcoin recovers as the Coinbase premium soars, but retail investors' inflows are rising at Binance, and open interest is falling, proving that traders remain cautious. 

Key takeaways:

The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index hit its second-highest level in 2025, highlighting sustained US investor interest.

Binance's retail inflow percentage reached a 2-year high, with a sharp increase in 0–1 BTC exchange deposits, hinting at active retail trading or profit-taking behavior.

Bitcoin's jump to $105,000 was driven by short liquidations, not new long positions.

The Coinbase Bitcoin (BTC) Premium Index reached its second-highest value on Monday, reflecting a price premium on BTC available at Coinbase versus Binance. The index has remained green for most of June, indicating sustained buying pressure from US investors. This aligns with positive spot ETF flows for most of the month, as a study noted a 0.27 coefficient linking prior-day ETF inflows to price increases, suggesting market optimism. 

CryptoQuant data shows that Binance's retail inflow percentage has surged to its highest level in two years, coinciding with a Bitcoin price decline. Onchain metrics also indicate a sharp rise in exchange inflows, particularly in the 0 to 1 BTC range, as reflected by the Spent Output Value Bands (SOVB) on the exchange.

With Binance dominating global retail trading volume compared to Coinbase, its user base's behavior—potentially driven by lower entry barriers—could influence market trends. Onchain analyst Maartunn explained that, 

Both metrics offer contrasting insights amid Bitcoin's current price. The Coinbase premium suggests strong buyer interest, potentially from institutional investors via ETFs, cushioning the decline. 

Conversely, high Binance inflows may reflect profit-taking or panic selling by retail investors, contributing to downward pressure. This mixed scenario implies caution for buyers: the premium indicates potential undervaluation opportunities, but corrections could deepen if retail selling persists.

Bitcoin surged to $105,000 on Monday, after forming a range low around $98,300 on Sunday, a notable 6.7% rise. However, this uptick came with a 10% drop in open interest (OI), signaling that the surge was primarily driven by shorts covering rather than new bullish positions. Traders betting against Bitcoin likely faced liquidations, with $130 million in short positions wiped out on June 23, forcing them to buy back BTC, aligning with the sharp price bounce. 

The aggregated funding rate is now rising on minimal OI growth, indicating over-leveraged longs paying shorts, a potential sign of market exhaustion.

For a bullish continuation, Bitcoin needs sustained buying volume and a rebound in OI, confirming new long positions. A retest of the $108,500 resistance could occur, with strong momentum signaling a sustained rally. 

Conversely, a bearish outlook could emerge if funding rates spike further without OI support, suggesting a possible reversal. A drop to $102,000 and declining volume could trigger a deeper correction, especially if sentiment shifts bearish again. The current short-covering rally may evolve into a bull run or a pullback, as volatility remains evident this month.

The crypto market erupted in a relief rally today as President Donald Trump claimed a full cease fire between Iran and Israel, sparking a general market rebound as global tensions seem to fade.

Oil prices tumbled 2.92% with Brent crude falling to $69.39 as Middle East tensions eased and analysts reject a supply shortage scenario. In the meantime, S&P 500 futures climbed 0.58% to 6,112, and the dollar index dropped 0.32% to 98.10. The risk-on rotation saw gold pull back as safe-haven demand waned. Gold prices dipped 2% to $3,315.8 per oz, with investors pivoting from defensive positions into high-beta crypto plays and riskier assets such as stocks and ETFs.

The cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 2.9% to $3.23 trillion, with Bitcoin climbing 3.6% to $105,471 and Ethereum jumping 6.5% to $2,422. The broader recovery saw altcoins outperform, with XRP gaining 8.1%, while nearly 30 of the top 100 coins saw double-digit increases with SEI being the top performer, mooning 46.5% to $0.2855.

And, of course, meme coins mooned even harder when these more, er, traditional altcoins spiked.

dMeme coins tend to be volatile and unpredictable, but according to the charts, SPX6900's explosive 28% rally to $1.3476 comes with compelling technical confirmation. The Average Directional Index also known as ADX at 35 indicates strong trending conditions—readings above 25 confirm established trends, suggesting the current momentum has legs. Traders might interpret this as particularly bullish since it shows the upward movement isn't just a brief spike but part of a sustained directional move.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI (a thermometer that measures how oversold or overbought an asset is), sits at 56, placing the token in the "power zone" where momentum is strong but not yet overbought. Historical data shows meme coins often run until RSI hits 75-80, suggesting approximately 20% additional upside potential before exhaustion. The 50-day EMA (the average price over the last 50 days) at $1.07 now provides dynamic support, having flipped from resistance during today's breakout.

Most notably, the Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows "ON" status in a bearish movement, indicating volatility compression that typically precedes explosive moves. When this indicator fires after a period of consolidation, traders often see 30-50% movements in either direction. Combined with today's volume surge of 96.8%, the setup suggests continuation toward the $1.51 resistance level tested in mid-June.

Key Levels:

The Dogwifthat meme coin, which trades as WIF, today popped 23% to $0.8740. That's a win for the WIF traders who study charts, as the token reclaimed the $0.79 level, a former support zone that had capped prices since early June. What's more, this move triggered $3.71 million in short liquidations. This kind of flip from resistance to support often marks the beginning of sustained uptrends. In other words, it's a good sign for the spot price of the coin to go back to being higher than the average price over the last 200 days. Perhaps not fully bullish, but still a recovery from the heavy price drop.

The RSI at 52 presents an interesting setup as it's almost perfectly neutral territory offering maximum flexibility for the next move. Unlike overbought conditions that limit upside, this balanced reading means WIF has room to run if buying pressure continues. The ADX at 17 shows that the bearish trend is now weaker, giving room for a short to medium term bounce if the coin can keep up momentum and this is not just a hype episode.

For traders, the one concerning signal may be the EMA configuration, with the 50-day average below the 200-day in a "death cross" formation since January. However, today's surge brings price action closer to challenging the 50-day EMA around $0.91. A decisive break above this level would shift medium-term momentum bullish and potentially trigger algorithmic buying from trend-following systems.

When MEXC quietly rolled out its new Launchpad feature this past June 6th, the exchange knew that it had something special. In its inaugural two weeks, over 100,000 users had participated in four oversubscribed projects, with some reaching over 200x their funding targets. But beyond the numbers, MEXC might have tapped into something deeper: a shift in how token launches are structured and who they're really for.



In a market where token offerings have gradually tilted toward institutional players and insiders, MEXC's new approach attempts to correct the imbalance. By blending accessibility with strong returns, and fairness with flexibility, the Launchpad might be more than a product. It could be the beginning of a new phase in crypto fundraising.



To understand the significance of what MEXC is doing, it's worth revisiting the last several years of project fundraising. The ICO boom of 2017 promised democratized investing; anyone with a wallet and some ETH could participate in a project's early days. But without oversight, scams flourished, and investor trust eroded.



In response, centralized exchanges launched the first IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings) in 2019. These brought vetting and execution under the umbrella of reputable exchanges. But new barriers emerged: limited allocations, high entry thresholds, and a tendency for whales to dominate the process.



Later, lottery-style IEOs emerged to broaden access but they often introduced more luck than logic, turning token launches into glorified raffles. Over time, the excitement surrounding new launches gave way to frustration. Participation became confusing, outcomes opaque, and the sense of community and fairness, once a hallmark of the crypto ethos, was lost.



MEXC's new feature seeks to reverse this “involution” that has taken place.



MEXC's Launchpad isn't just another IEO platform. It's an intentional reset, designed to offer two distinct value paths.



On one side, it offers early access to promising, curated projects like IDOL and BEE, with two to three new launches each week and historical post-listing returns in the 5x to 8x range. On the other, it caters to more conservative users by offering discounted access to blue-chip tokens like Bitcoin, sometimes at up to 90% off market prices, effectively giving participants a second chance at 2017-era valuations.



Together, these two streams speak to both sides of the trading community. That is, the risk-tolerant early adopter, and the long-term investor looking for value.



Launchpad simplifies token subscriptions while promoting equitable access, making it refreshingly accessible when token launches are usually overly complicated or engulfed by whales. After standard KYC verification, users can explore the available Launchpad events through the platform's event page.



Participation involves subscribing to token sales using supported currencies (such as MX, USDT, etc.) or other eligible assets. The process avoids convoluted barriers. There are no arcane staking requirements or loyalty tiers to navigate. Instead, users need to complete a few basic tasks, such as depositing funds or executing trades, in order to become eligible for a given event.



What sets MEXC apart is its proportional distribution model. Rather than relying on a lottery or first-come-first-served mechanism, the Launchpad ensures that each qualifying participant receives tokens in direct proportion to the amount they commit. This guarantees that smaller investors aren't sidelined by larger players, and everyone knows exactly what they're getting into.



If an event is oversubscribed, the system adjusts allocations proportionally, and any unused funds are automatically returned to users, typically within 24 hours. In the case of under-subscription, users receive their full allocation based on their committed amount.



The result is a launch experience that feels fair, intuitive, and genuinely accessible to everyone.



While both MEXC Launchpad and Launchpool offer users opportunities to acquire new tokens, they serve fundamentally different purposes and cater to distinct trading strategies.



The new Launchpad, as we've explored, focuses on providing early access to tokens through time-limited subscription events. It's geared toward traders who want to get in on the ground floor of high-potential projects, or purchase well-established tokens at steep discounts.



Launchpool, by contrast, lets users stake existing assets like MX or USDT into reward pools, earning new tokens passively over time.



Both paths are valuable but which one fits best depends on the user's appetite for risk and preferred strategy.



In a crowded field of centralized exchanges offering token launch products, MEXC's Launchpad stands out not by being louder but by being smarter in its design. While major platforms like Binance, OKX, and KuCoin have long operated launchpads of their own, they often come with steep participation barriers. Users may need to hold or stake large amounts of native tokens for extended periods just to qualify, and lotteries or randomized draws can make outcomes feel arbitrary or outright inaccessible.



MEXC flips the typical launchpad model on its head, favoring equity and accessibility over gatekeeping and exclusivity. Its Launchpad prioritizes frequency, fairness, and ease of use. New token events are held regularly, compared to the monthly cadence seen on other platforms. This not only keeps engagement high but also increases opportunities for retail traders to find projects that match their interests.



Where others rely on lottery systems or tiered allocation models that favor large holders, MEXC offers proportional distribution. This levels the playing field, giving smaller investors a real chance to participate meaningfully. The platform also skips the complex requirements and lock-in periods that characterize many competitor launchpads, instead making qualification as simple as completing a few accessible tasks.



Perhaps the most compelling edge, however, lies in MEXC's discount subsidy model. By offering significant markdowns, even on major assets like Bitcoin, the exchange is actively transferring value back to users rather than extracting it. Not just a gimmick, it's a structural advantage that directly impacts user outcomes.



This makes MEXC a rare outlier. One that puts user benefit at the center of its strategy.



At the heart of MEXC's approach is a radical idea: give more back to users.



The current Launchpad paradigm is broken by design. Project teams, whales, and exchanges tend to capture most of the upside, leaving retail investors with leftovers. And that's if they're lucky. This has led to growing disillusionment and a “why bother” attitude among many traders.



MEXC's model reframes the relationship. The platform gives up part of its margin (via discounting) to attract and reward real users. This approach does more than just boost signups, as it helps re-establish trust in the token launch process.



If involution is a race to the bottom, MEXC is trying to opt out of the race entirely.



It's not just theory. Early results are already validating the model:





In just two weeks, four Launchpad events brought in eight-figure total fundraising, showing strong demand from both projects and users.



The term “Launchpad” has become synonymous with fatigue, gatekeeping, and missed opportunity. But MEXC's latest move suggests the model still has life… If it evolves.



By restoring fairness, reducing complexity, and giving real value back to its users, MEXC isn't just launching tokens. It's relaunching the idea of what token access should look like in 2025 and beyond.



In a space often dominated by insiders and algorithms, this return to user-first thinking might be exactly what crypto needs.

Ethereum's price action in the past 24 hours has been characterized by a fall toward $2,100 before rebounding to the upside very quickly. Ethereum's price dropped to $2,130 in the past 24 hours on crypto exchange Coinbase amidst a broader fall in the crypto industry, which also saw Bitcoin break below $100,000 very briefly. 

Despite the sudden Ethereum price correction, analysts have presented arguments that hint at a strong Ethereum rally once this current downturn is complete. Notably, their projections are not short-term, and one of them puts Ethereum's next major target around $6,000.

Wave A Complete, But Downside Likely Before Rally

The first detailed analysis came from @CryptoWaveV, a trader who uses Elliott Wave Theory to forecast market structure. According to his recent post, Ethereum's price has now completed what he considers to be wave A of a larger corrective structure. His chart shows Ethereum breaking down from a high around $2,900 and falling almost directly into a Fibonacci-based support zone between $2,134 and $1,957.

Now that the Wave A pattern is complete, the prediction is a short-term bounce to as high as $2,792 as part of a wave B retracement. However, this upward move would likely be temporary before another Wave C leg downward, which could drive the Ethereum price to as low as $1,706 before a meaningful bottom is confirmed. 

This level is what the analyst refers to as his “ideal buy zone” for long-term accumulation. Although the short-term view includes price crashes, a full bullish impulse will resume once this corrective phase is complete.

Wyckoff Structure Points $6,000 ETH Price

Merlijn, a popular analyst on X, shared a contrasting yet converging perspective. In this case, the analyst's outlook is based on Wyckoff's accumulation framework. Merlijn stated, “Ethereum: Wyckoff says go.” 

According to the daily price chart that followed his analysis, the analyst showed that the crypto had already completed the spring and test phases, which are both components of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern. What comes next, according to the Wyckoff method, is the markup phase. 

The chart Merlijn posted aligns with this outlook. The chart projected that Ethereum will reclaim a horizontal range between $2,150 and $2,450, followed by a steady progression above $3,850, and then another strong move past $4,800, before ultimately culminating around $6,800 to $7,000. This bullish setup suggests that while the recent dip to $2,100 might have shaken confidence, it may have served a larger structural purpose. The spring and test patterns imply a final shakeout of weak hands, clearing the path for long-term buyers to step in.

Finally, the outlooks from both analysts converge on a six-month to one-year trajectory that could see Ethereum breaking into the $6,000 range, if not higher. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,420, up by 7.4% in the past 24 hours.

The funding round, announced Tuesday (June 24), was led by DRW Venture Capital and Tradeweb Markets, with participation from numerous investors including Goldman Sachs, which had helped launch the blockchain.

“This funding accelerates institutional and decentralized finance adoption on the Canton Network, the only public, permissionless Layer-1 blockchain that offers configurable privacy and institutional-grade compliance at scale,” the company said in a news release.

The capital expands the integration of hundreds of billions of real-world assets (RWAs) onto Canton, while also strengthening the relationship with many of the companies already part of the network, including Goldman, that have played roles related to testing, governance, infrastructure or app development on the Canton Network since its debut.

“This funding milestone validates the inevitability of what we envisioned years ago: a privacy-enabled public blockchain designed specifically for institutional adoption,” Digital Asset Co-founder and CEO Yuval Rooz said in the release.

“Canton is already actively supporting numerous asset classes — from bonds to alternative funds — and this raise will accelerate onboarding even more real-world assets, finally making blockchain's transformative promise an institutional-scale reality.”

PYMNTS wrote about the Canton Network's launch last year, noting that its pilot effort was aimed at demonstrating the interoperability of 22 independent distributed ledger applications (dApps) in the capital markets domain “and prove how a network of interoperable applications can seamlessly connect to enable secure, atomic transactions while reducing counterparty and settlement risk.”

The pilot's chief finding was the ability of distributed ledger networks to leverage blockchain technology and preserve the privacy and controls regulated institutions require. The lack of control over data and the need to trade interoperability for privacy have historically curbed firms' ability to use the efficiencies that blockchain technology provides.

“Canton allows previously siloed financial systems to connect and synchronize in previously impossible ways while abiding by the current regulatory guardrails,” Rooz said at the time.

In other blockchain-related news, PYMNTS wrote this week about some of the custody issues tied to corporate bitcoin treasuries.

Insurance for digital assets is still in its early stages, that report noted, a reality that has led some companies to weigh creative solutions, like distributed custody arrangements or programmable insurance smart contracts. Others are waiting for clearer regulations that would make insurers more confident about underwriting policies at scale.

“As for on-premises solutions, holding bitcoin securely requires technical knowledge, robust infrastructure and detailed internal controls,” the report added. “The company, in essence, needs to become a bank itself. That is likely a radically different model than most finance departments are used to.”

ProCap BTC, a cryptocurrency financial services firm founded by investor Anthony Pompliano, wasted no time putting new money to work.

Less than 24 hours after revealing a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. (CCCM) and a separate $775 million capital raise, the firm snapped up 3,724 bitcoin BTC$105,764.07 at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per coin.

The purchase kicks off a treasury program that could swell to $1 billion in bitcoin once the SPAC transaction closes and the combined company, to be called ProCap Financial, lists on Nasdaq.

It comes after the company revealed it raised $550 million through a preferred equity offering and an additional $225 million in convertible notes. If the company was already publicly traded, it would rank as the 14th biggest BTC holder among listed companies, just below Semler Scientific, according to Bitcointreasuries.com.

PropCap BTC has argued that bitcoin is now the new “hurdle rate” for capital deployment. “If you can't beat it, you have to buy it,” it wrote in a press release.

The firm plans on leveraging its bitcoin in yield-generating strategies.

TEHRAN – The Head of the Iranian Cinema Organization Raed Faridzadeh emphasized the continued activity of the country's cinematic sector amid the Israeli strikes.

He made the remarks while visiting Tehran's cinema theaters, which had temporarily shut down but have now reopened, IRNA reported. 

Following the announcement that cultural and artistic centers would reopen from June 21, Faridzadeh toured various cinemas across Tehran to assess ongoing services and operations.

During his visit, Faridzadeh highlighted the vital social and cultural roles of cinemas in Iran. He noted, “While cinema complexes are actively serving the public, I call on all artists to understand their national duty and contribute to strengthening the people's morale.”

He stated that movie theaters provide a safe space where people can come together to foster unity and shared understanding. 

He specifically underscored the importance of maintaining cinema activities, saying, “Cinema plays an essential role in Iranian society, offering a safe environment for people to temporarily escape their worries. Moreover, theaters enable audiences to unite in empathy and shared language, making their continued operation crucial across the country.”

“As cinemas across Iran resume normal operations from June 21 and film screenings recommence, I was very pleased to see audiences purchasing tickets and enjoying the latest films. This demonstrates that, even in these challenging times, Iranians remain hopeful and vibrant in their daily lives,” he added. 

He emphasized that cinema is not merely entertainment but also a national asset. “Cultural institutions must collaborate more, especially during critical periods, to keep the lights on in our cinemas.” 

He also called on media outlets to give serious coverage to cinematic activities, stating, “The culture and arts sector must stand with the people. Fostering a sense of solidarity and resilience is more important than ever.”

Expressing appreciation for the filmmakers' empathy and unity, Faridzadeh praised their timely support during the crisis, noting, “The punctuality and solidarity of cinema professionals are commendable, and they have shown they stand with the nation in these perilous times.”

He concluded with a call for collective effort: “While cinemas are actively serving the public, I urge all artists to understand their national responsibility and help uplift the spirits of our people. This is a crucial test for Iranian cinema—to contribute to national peace and unity—and I am confident we will emerge victorious as we have before.”

Additionally, ticket prices for cinemas in Tehran will be half-price until further notice. This measure aims to show solidarity with the public. Following the decision by the Cinema Owners Association and in cooperation with film exhibitors, ticket prices are temporarily reduced to support viewers.

Early Friday morning, June 13, a series of terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Zionist regime targeted Tehran and several other Iranian cities, resulting in the martyrdom of numerous military commanders, scientists, and innocent civilians. 

In response to the savage Zionist attack, the Islamic Republic of Iran launched Operation True Promise 3 on Friday night, unleashing a barrage of missiles against the occupied territories. 

The Israeli attacks targeted areas within Iran that were not military installations, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent civilian lives including women and children. The incident has sparked outrage not only within Iran but also among international observers.

On Sunday, the United States, in violation of international law, attacked three nuclear sites—Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan—joining Netanyahu's war against Iran.

Responding to these actions, Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi issued a statement affirming that, under the United Nations Charter, Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interests, and people.

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran condemned the assault on nuclear sites, asserting that Iran will not allow the development of its national industry to be halted despite these aggressive acts, which violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

Furthermore, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced the initiation of the 20th wave of combined missile and drone attacks targeting military and industrial centers in Haifa and Tel Aviv.

Iran, clearly fearful of an online Israeli incursion, imposed a near-total internet blackout early last week

The war between Israel and Iran, though largely a fight of fighter planes, drones and bombs, is erupting in the digital realm as well. Both countries have long histories with digital warfare. The particular focus of the current conflict, Iran's nuclear program, was the target of one of the first cyberweapons meant to cause physical destruction, the sophisticated worm Stuxnet.

Iran, clearly fearful of an online Israeli incursion, imposed a near-total internet blackout early last week. My colleague Johana Bhuiyan reports:

Cybersecurity company Cloudflare assessed that internet traffic levels in Iran “are now ~97% below where they were at the same time a week ago”. Severed internet connectivity has led to a troubling lack of access to information for everyday Iranians as their country descends into conflict.

The reduction in internet speeds comes after an anti-Iranian government hacking group with potential ties to Israel claimed that it hacked Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's government, said on Twitter/X that officials in Tehran had restricted internet access to ward off additional cyberattacks.

On Wednesday, Iran's fears came to fruition. My colleague Dan Milmo reports:

An Israel-linked hacking group has claimed responsibility for a $90m (£67m) heist on an Iranian cryptocurrency exchange.

The group known as Gonjeshke Darande, Farsi for Predatory Sparrow, said on Wednesday it had hacked the Nobitex exchange, a day after claiming it had destroyed data at Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah.

Elliptic, a consultancy specialising in crypto-related crime, said it had so far identified more than $90m in cryptocurrency sent from Nobitex crypto wallets to hacker addresses. The hackers appear to have in effect “burned” those funds, rendering them inaccessible by storing them in “vanity addresses” for which they do not have the cryptographic keys, Elliptic said.

Iran has attempted to retaliate, but as with the wider war, it seems that Israeli attacks have been more successful and damaging. Israeli officials warned the country's residents that Iran is hijacking home security cameras that are connected to the internet to gather real-time intelligence on the ground, Bloomberg reports. Security professionals say hackers for Hamas and Russia have done the same. Home cameras may be a new front in the waging of war, but disrupting them does not seem as powerful as disrupting a central bank, as Israel has done.

Late Friday, Iran seemed to lift the internet blackout for some citizens, the New York Times reported, though even those who could access limited online services believed their connections were temporary.

PornHub, widely estimated to be the most-visited site for pornographic content in the world, returned to France on Friday after a three-week blackout.

The site's owner, Aylo, had rescinded access to the site protest of a new French law demanding adult websites verify users' ages with a credit card or identification document. PornHub drew a line in the sand on the issue and revoked access for a market of nearly 70 million rather than implement an age gate.

Since then, a French court has suspended the law while it considers compliance with the European Union's constitution, and so Pornhub is back online. But the quarrel between Paris and PornHub is the latest front in the debate over online age verification, which is heating to a boil across the globe.

The issue sits at the intersection of two driving forces of internet regulation that often conflict: keeping children safe online and preserving both privacy and freedom of expression. It's an area where lawmakers have been uncharacteristically prone to action, even in the US, where tech regulation is often as hands off as can be.

More than 20 states now have age verification laws on the books. PornHub has made itself unavailable in 17 of them. Texas, the second-most populous state in the US with 31m people, is the highest-profile example. The state legislature there passed a law requiring an ID to visit PornHub in September 2023. In March of the following year, the site went dark in the state, greeting would-be visitors with a banner calling the law “ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous”. In Louisiana, which has imposed age verification laws, PornHub is still available, but it has seen traffic there decline by 80%, which it attributes to the barrier of the ID requirement. The US supreme court heard arguments in January over whether these laws infringe on the constitutional right to free speech.

Research into the laws into the US have found that they are not effective in their stated goal. Online search data showed that people in states with age verification laws sought out porn sites that did not comply with local laws so as to circumvent the age gates as well as virtual private networks to hide their locations from internet providers.

The other battlefields over age verification concern social media bans for underage users. Australia, which has passed a law banning under-16s from social media, has been testing different technologies with which to enforce its prohibition but found them lacking.

The UK is the next frontier in the fight. The UK's system for verifying ages to keep pornography away from children, a provision of the Online Safety Act, will take effect in July. Will London be the next Paris or the next Texas?

Last week, Donald Trump debuted a mobile phone branded with his family name – “T1” etched into the gold case alongside an American flag – with a listed price of $500 and a pledge that it would be “proudly designed and built in the United States”. Specifically in Alabama, California and Florida. Its monthly service plan will cost $47.45.

The Trump phone will struggle to live up to those promises. Its makers have to abide by the same market forces as other phonemakers. Both cheap labor and electronics expertise reside in China. They do not in the US. There's a reason Apple's phones are labeled “Designed in California” – to take advantage of the caché and appeal of the US without suffering its labor costs.

Looking ahead, experts predict that Trump's own tariffs could cause the price of smartphones to spike by double or even triple digits. The electronics supply chain in the US is nowhere near developed enough to assemble a phone entirely domestically. Analysts at investment bank UBS warned in April that the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB of storage could rise by 79% from $1,199 to about $2,150, based on a total tariff of 145%. Apple itself seemed to concur with those assessments when it flew some $2bn worth of iPhones into the US before the tariffs on China went into effect.

There is already an example of a phone assembled – but not entirely made – in the US, the Liberty Phone. It costs nearly four times what Trump promises his will, nearly $2000. The Liberty Phone sources its motherboard from the US but still requires screens, batteries and cameras manufactured overseas, according to a Wall Street Journal interview with the CEO of Purism, which manufactures the device. Its operating system can only run basic apps such as a calculator and a web browser because it runs on PureOS, software of the company's own making, per the Journal.

The specs on the Liberty Phone are worse than Trump's T1, though the price is higher, making the president's device even less likely to appear on the market as announced. Some of the promised technical capabilities of the T1 would best those of the top-of-the-line iPhones, which cost nearly double what Trump has promised. The Verge put together a good list of which Chinese companies might manufacture the phone for Trump to white label.

Eric Trump, who is co-leading the venture with his brother Donald Jr, has acknowledged that the first batch of T1 phones will not be made in the US. “Eventually, all the phones can be built in the United States of America,” Eric Trump said last week. We'll see.

Road Town, Virgin Islands, 24th June 2025 – BloFin strengthens its position as a global leader in futures trading liquidity and slippage control, outperforming mid-tier competitors and matching the performance of top-tier exchanges.

BloFin Exchange has achieved a significant milestone in future market performance, establishing itself as a top-tier competitor in both liquidity and trade execution quality.

According to the latest official data collected via API monitoring from June 16 to June 19, 2025, BloFin's futures market depth and slippage performance position the exchange alongside long-established industry leaders such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit, further solidifying its reputation among global futures market participants.

Tier-1 futures liquidity achieved, with a top-two global ranking across depth metrics

In cumulative futures depth at both the 0.1% and 0.05% price deviation levels, BloFin ranked firmly among the top three global exchanges. Its liquidity performance not only outpaced all mid-tier platforms but also closely matched or exceeded several tier-1 competitors.



These results demonstrate BloFin's consistent capacity to support high-volume, low-slippage trading activity for institutional participants and large-volume retail users.

Whale-grade slippage control delivers execution quality on par with leading exchanges

In addition to liquidity depth, BloFin exhibited robust trade execution metrics under stress-tested conditions. The exchange delivered highly competitive slippage rates for both BTC and ETH futures, alongside a wide range of over 15 actively traded altcoins, including SOL, XRP, DOGE, PEPE, ADA, and TRUMP.



BloFin's slippage performance for major assets under two levels of simulated stress remained in line with top-tier platforms, confirming the exchange's ability to maintain price stability and execution efficiency in volatile or high-demand trading environments. Notably, BloFin also offered lower slippages for trending, volatile altcoins — an area where many mid-tier competitors face significant execution gaps.

A new global contender reshaping the futures trading landscape

BloFin's performance in this report affirms its standing as a rising leader in the global futures market. By delivering futures market depth and slippage control on par with tier-1 exchanges, BloFin strengthens its appeal to whales, institutional traders, and high-frequency participants seeking deep liquidity and reliable trade execution across both dominant and emerging digital assets.

As the exchange continues its expansion into key global markets and strategic event sponsorships, this achievement further enhances BloFin's credibility as a serious futures market contender.

 Blockchain's next leap is about intelligence. Predictive infrastructure anticipates demand, erases latency and enables new levels of trust and scalability. Blockchain can become proactive and invisible. 

Opinion by: Constantine Zaitcev, CEO of dRPC.

The future of blockchain won't be won by whoever offers the highest transactions per second. It will be won by whoever makes it feel invisible — by turning infrastructure into something so seamless and intuitive that users never have to think about it.

Predictive intelligence is what makes that possible. It's how we move from reaction to intention; from infrastructure that merely keeps up to systems that lead the way.

Infrastructure defines adoption. It's a blockchain reality often overlooked that continues to stifle the shift to a decentralized web. While most eyes remain fixated on throughput and transaction costs, the real friction point is latency: the lag that quietly erodes trust, drains resources and cripples user experience.

The fix doesn't lie in brute-force scaling. It lies in predictive intelligence, an anticipatory approach to infrastructure that transforms data into foresight and foresight into faster, leaner, more resilient systems.

Latency is the silent killer of Web3. It shows up in sluggish decentralized application (DApp) interfaces, transactions that stall at the worst moment and teams scrambling to scale infrastructure in real-time during a network surge.

Latency isn't only about speed. It's a symptom of rigid systems, where static remote procedure call (RPC) nodes serve traffic indiscriminately, regardless of user location or behavior. These nodes remain “always on,” even when idle, and lack the intelligence to respond dynamically to shifting demand patterns.

This rigidity creates cascading failures in moments of acute stress: during NFT drops, DeFi migrations or unanticipated traffic spikes. Teams overcompensate by throwing more nodes at the problem, incurring costs that balloon with every crisis. The result isn't just inefficiency; it's a loss of trust.

Users who experience lags and outages during critical interactions rarely come back. Developers, in turn, spend more time firefighting than building.

For too long, the dominant mindset in Web3 infrastructure has been reactive: scale when it breaks, patch when it fails. The traditional answer to latency has been to add more nodes, widen the highway and hope congestion clears.

But this approach is fundamentally flawed. It's financially unsustainable; keeping redundant infrastructure online around the clock drains budgets and rewards inefficiency. It's structurally rigid, as it treats every blockchain and every use case the same despite wildly different performance needs between, say, a high-frequency trading platform and a location-heavy GameFi network. 

Above all, it's too slow. By the time action is taken, the damage has already been done. Trust, once lost, doesn't scale back up so easily.

A different approach is emerging, one that replaces brute force with intelligence. Predictive infrastructure flips the model on its head. Instead of reacting to traffic, it anticipates it. Instead of scaling manually, it learns to scale itself.

Using historical traffic patterns and real-time metrics, predictive systems can allocate resources based on forecasted demand. That means infrastructure responds before the crisis hits, not after. Network activity in Asia during trading hours no longer needs to be served by a node in Frankfurt. A surge in GameFi users in Latin America can be absorbed seamlessly with no manual intervention. Idle nodes aren't left burning capital; they're turned off until needed again. 

An infrastructure layer that is dynamic, adaptive and cost-aware emerges.

This isn't about abstract technical upgrades — it's about developer freedom. When infrastructure can handle volatility on its own, engineers spend less time troubleshooting and more time building.

The knock-on effects ripple outward: better uptime, broader accessibility and, ultimately, DApps that don't just work — they thrive.

Predictive intelligence introduces not merely a performance boost but a philosophical pivot. It invites us to stop obsessing over raw throughput and start thinking in terms of intent. Not “How many transactions can we handle?” but “Which transactions matter most, and how do we prioritize them intelligently?”

This shift transforms infrastructure into a living-learning system. It makes the blockchain world faster and more competent — capable of allocating its energy where it matters most, reducing abandonment rates, cutting operating costs or enabling smoother onboarding for the following billion users.

If Web3 is to scale beyond its early adopters and into global relevance, it must embrace intelligence as its defining layer. Not just in contracts or governance — but deep within the infrastructure itself.

As organizations throughout the coffee value chain continue to call for more transparent and collective action for coffee sector sustainability, navigating the complex forest of sustainability initiatives remains a challenge.

Late last week, the International Coffee Organization (ICO) unveiled an expansive new map of the trees, compiling hundreds of sustainability initiatives within a slick new filterable and navigable database called the Coffee Sustainability Support Database (C2SD).

Formerly known as the Coffee Sustainability Initiatives Map, the relaunched database includes an improved interface with dedicated country views and program views.

The database launched with 440 sustainability initiatives involving more than 600 project-leading organizations and more than 170 donors. It also offers filtered lists and graphic insights into specific project types, goals, locations and status.

“We are very proud of the new Coffee Sustainability Support Database, which reflects our ongoing commitment to the ICO's mission of promoting the sustainable and inclusive growth of and by the global coffee sector,” ICO Executive Director Vanúsia Nogueira said in an announcement of the launch.

The C2SD came to life through a collective effort between members of the ICO's Coffee Public-Private Task Force and was supported by the International Trade Centre (ITC).

The platform is open for voluntary project submissions through an online form, while allowing for project updates following initial validation.

According to the ICO, the map can be used to scale up individual sustainability efforts by aligning with broader collective strategies, as well as to identify synergies, overlaps, and funding gaps. The group is planning to broaden the database to include projects from investment banks and development funds.

“Since its inception, the goal of the Coffee Sustainability Support Database has been to consolidate scattered information and make it accessible to key stakeholders,” Nogueira said. “This relaunch marks a major step forward in that mission, offering enhanced tools for decision-making, collaboration and strategic funding.”

WISe.ART Launches Mayte Spínola's “Galactic Christ” into Space Aboard SpaceX Mission Pioneering Space-Based Art NFTs and Digital Expression  



Geneva, Switzerland, June 24, 2025 –WISeKey International Holding Ltd (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a leading global cybersecurity, blockchain, and IoT company, today announces that WISe.ART, its secure NFT marketplace subsidiary has successfully launched Spanish artist Mayte Spínola's digital artwork El Cristo Cósmico (“The Galactic Christ”) into low Earth orbit (LEO) aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, marking another milestone in the company's strategy to expand the frontier of digital expression through space technology.

The launch occurred at 23:11 CET on June 23, 2025, placing a WISeSat satellite carrying Spínola's artwork into orbit. Tokenized as an NFT on the WISe.ART platform, the artwork is securely stored on the satellite using embedded hardware security modules and blockchain-based authentication protocols.

This mission is part of WISe.ART's broader initiative to pioneer the use of space as a platform for artistic and personal expression. By combining secure satellite technology, blockchain infrastructure, and NFTs, WISe.ART is enabling artists, creators, and public figures to engage with audiences globally and now, extraterrestrially.

“Space is not only the next frontier for technology, it is a new medium for human expression,” said Carlos Moreira, Founder of WISeKey and WISe.ART. “Through WISeSat and WISe.ART, we are giving artists and celebrities a secure and visionary way to project their work and messages from orbit.”

This is not WISe.ART's first milestone in space. In 2022, during a special ceremony at the NASDAQ headquarters in New York, WISe.ART minted and transmitted a space-based NFT featuring actress Brooke Shields, demonstrating the platform's early commitment to combining celebrity expression, secure blockchain, and satellite communications.

Mayte Spínola, one of Spain's most celebrated contemporary artists and founder of the Grupo Pro Arte y Cultura, shared her thoughts on the occasion: “Seeing my work orbiting Earth is deeply symbolic. It represents the union of art, science, and faith, transcending borders and reminding us that peace is a universal message.”

Technical details of the mission:

Major Ethereum validators controlling a significant share of the network's stake have begun testing OptimumP2P, a high-performance memory layer that could help address some of the network's limitations through its networking stack.

Kiln, P2P.org, Everstake, Blockdaemon, Infstones, Luganodes, and Ebunker are participating in the testnet for OptimumP2P, which has introduced a novel application of MIT-developed tech for Ethereum.

"The networking layer relies largely on traditional gossip approaches, which use a decentralized approach to propagate messages among nodes," Muriel Médard, Optimum co-founder and CEO, told Decrypt.

Médard is referring to "gossip" protocols in blockchain networks like Ethereum, where data such as new blocks, transactions, or blobs are shared through a peer-to-peer system. 

This happens when a node sends data to a few connected peers, who then relay it to others, continuing the process until the message reaches the entire network.

"A careful trade-off between these two effects lies at the heart of traditional gossip algorithms," Médard said.

Despite ongoing improvements to its execution and consensus layers, Ethereum faces a constraint and bottleneck: its networking layer. The way data is propagated between nodes introduces latency and bandwidth waste, especially as data sizes grow.

Currently, Ethereum shares data across nodes using Gossipsub, a protocol built on top of libp2p. But this system sends the same message to many nodes multiple times, leading to inefficiencies and slower propagation.

"If people gossip with too many neighbors, then they often hear the same message, which is wasteful of their time," Médard explained. "If they do not gossip to enough neighbors, then they will not have enough chances to hear new messages."

For Ethereum's bottleneck, OptimumP2P fixes the constraints by "making people gossip algebraic equations, not plain old gossip," Médard said. "The equations mean that you do not have to worry about old news; only new information is gossiped, in the form of equations."

Optimum utilizes a networking technology called Random Linear Network Coding, which combines multiple pieces of data into encoded packets. 

Each packet contains just enough information so that, once a sufficient number of unique packets are received, the original data can be reconstructed, even if some packets are missing.

Initial testing reveals substantial performance improvements over the current system.

Results show 10 times lower latency under high-traffic conditions, stable performance with messages up to 10MB versus Gossipsub's 4MB limitation, and zero message loss under stress scenarios.Combined, validators testing for OptimumP2P represent at least 14% of the total staking share across Ethereum, according to data from Rated Labs.

Optimum plans to deploy OptimumP2P on Ethereum's Hoodi testnet this summer, with potential expansion to other Layer 1 blockchains following initial implementation.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is stabilizing around $105,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday, following a 4.3% recovery the previous day. The rebound comes as global risk sentiment improves following a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a softer stance on crypto-related banking on Monday. Apart from this risk-on sentiment, institutional demand remained strong as corporations accumulated BTC in their reserves and fresh Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) inflows, suggesting a further recovery in BTC prices.

Bitcoin price recovered sharply on Monday, closing the day with a 4.3% gain, as news emerged that Donald Trump had announced a “complete and total” ceasefire between Israel and Iran, effectively pausing the ongoing 12-day war. 

Later on Tuesday, Donald Trump's Truth Social account posted that “THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT,” and called on both nations not to violate it, fueling the risk-on sentiment in the global markets.

Gains in crypto markets were also supported by improved risk appetite and rising expectations of a dovish Federal Reserve (Fed), which have pushed the 2-year Treasury yield further below the 4% mark.  

Traders now await the US economic docket, featuring the release of the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index. This, along with speeches by Fed officials, will drive the US Dollar and overall market sentiment.

The main focus is on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee at 14:00 GMT , which could offer hints about the future rate-cut path and influence risky assets such as Bitcoin.

The US Federal Reserve Board announced on Monday that “reputational risk” will no longer be a component of its examination programs in supervising banks. 

This news added fuel to the ongoing recovery of Bitcoin, as the “reputational risk,” also commonly known as Operation Choke Point 2.0, had previously prevented banks from providing custody services for crypto assets and financial services to digital asset companies. 

This policy shift and the Fed's more lenient stance on crypto-related banking could boost the wider adoption and acceptance of digital assets. However, the Fed still expects banks to maintain robust risk management to ensure safety and soundness, as well as compliance with laws and regulations.

Senator Cynthia Lummis says on her X account, “This is a win, but there is still more work to be done.” 



Bitcoin institutional demand starts the week on a positive note. Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, announced on Monday that it has added 245 BTC to its holdings. The firm currently holds 592,345 BTC. 

Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also purchased an additional 1,111 BTC, bringing the total holding to 11,111 BTC. Following the footsteps of the Strategy and Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group confirms the acquisition of 75 BTC, bringing its total holding to 1,728 BTC. 



According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $350.43 million on Monday, continuing its 10-day streak of gains since June 9.

Bitcoin price reached a low of $98,200 on Sunday and recovered sharply by 4.3% on Monday, surpassing the 50-day EMA and closing above $105,300. At the time of writing on Tuesday, it hovers at around $105,200.

If BTC continues its recovery, it could extend the rally toward its May 22 all-time high at $111,980.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart hovers around its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bullish momentum. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI should continue to move above its neutral level. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is hinting at a bullish crossover (the MACD line is close to crossing above the signal line), which, if completed, would give a buy signal.

However, if BTC faces a correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,188, it could extend the decline to retest its Sunday low of $98,200.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Japan's Financial Services Agency has proposed a rule change to bring crypto assets under the jurisdiction of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The proposal, to be reviewed on June 25, could pave the way for the listing of Bitcoin ETFs.

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $105,000 on Tuesday after a 4.33% gain on Monday, driven by easing geopolitical and regulatory concerns. Global risk appetite is increasing as the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, along with the Fed's softer stance on crypto-related banking, takes hold.

Tensions in the Middle East have taken the backseat after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran on Monday. Global markets, including cryptocurrencies, ticked up, boosting BTC's recovery above $105,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday.

Pi Network edges higher on Tuesday, holding above a crucial psychological and trendline support. The Pi Core team teases a potential Generative AI feature to be announced on Pi2Day, June 28.  

Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Bitcoin and crypto have rebounded after a major escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict sent prices spiraling amid fears of a “doomsday” scenario.

The bitcoin price has climbed back over $100,000 per bitcoin, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump's shock prediction of “massive” crypto investment.

Now, as the market digests a Congress game-changer expected to “unleash” trillions, bitcoin and crypto prices are braced for Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before lawmakers—coming after Trump suddenly flipped on firing him.

“Aside from any geopolitical updates, today's key event will be Fed chair Jerome Powell's testimony in Washington,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments.

Trump posted to his Truth Social account over night that the Federal Reserve board should “activate," forcing Powell, who he's branded “too late,” to cut rates by "at least two to three points," and "save the U.S. more than $800 billion per year.”

“I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over,” Trump added.

The Fed kept interest rates on hold again last week after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation.

“All eyes are on the Federal Reserve chair Jerome's testimony before Congress and Friday's PCE inflation print to determine how close the Fed may be to its long-awaited policy pivot,” Ray Youssef , the chief executive of NoOnes, said via email.

“The most bullish scenario would be confirmation of a Fed dovish policy pivot or a major de-escalation in global trade and geopolitical tensions, either of which could spark renewed interest in risk assets and push bitcoin towards retesting its all-time high.”

Expectations around an eventual Fed interest rate cut have been built up by crypto traders and influencers on social media.

“Buckle up,” one crypto trader posted to X alongside a hopeful prediction that “trillions” will flow in to crypto once the Fed eventually cuts rates—now priced at a 22% chance in July, up from just 10% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tracker.

Two Fed officials, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Austan Goolsbee, have this week joined Fed governor Christopher Waller admitting it may be time to lower interest rates.

“It is time to consider adjusting the policy rate,” Bowman told a gathering held in Prague, it was reported by Reuters, while Goolsbee reportedly said that Trump's trade tariffs have “not been what people feared."

Powell has pointed to the expected increase in inflation as a result of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs as reason to take a “wait-and-see” approach to adjusting interest rates.

Last week, Waller has said he doesn't expect Trump's tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.

“If you're starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don't wait,” Waller told CNBC.

This article was co-authored by India Tisbury, Solicitor Apprentice. 

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has recently announced the development of a statutory code of practice relating to the use of AI and automated decision-making for regulated firms. Developed in collaboration with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the initiative aims to strike a balance between supporting good practice and enabling innovation, while also safeguarding privacy. We consider the impact of this announcement for regulated firms.

Despite previous joint efforts between the FCA and ICO to encourage responsible AI adoption, current guidance for firms remains scarce, leaving many uncertain about where they stand. What is in place is, arguably, not fit for purpose. At present, the only tangible support available is from the ICO, in the form of guidance and a toolkit to help assess risks presented by their own AI systems - resources that many consider inadequate given the pace and complexity of AI developments.

The ICO has also published an analysis on how data controllership should be allocated across the generative AI supply chains. In contrast, the FCA has so far issued only high-level statements and exploratory discussion papers, outlining firms' potential responsibilities when deploying such technologies, but offering no practical tools or implementation frameworks.

This lack of comprehensive guidance leaves firms in a difficult position, potentially criticised for not using AI where it could have prevented harm, yet equally exposed to liability if AI adoption results in loss. This regulatory ambiguity creates a no-win scenario the FCA now appears ready to address.

Following a roundtable held with industry leaders in May 2025, the FCA has announced that it will develop a statutory Code of Practice for firms developing or deploying AI and automated decision-making systems, a move aimed at setting clearer expectations and reducing regulatory uncertainty.

Alongside this, the FCA is ramping up its AI Lab initiative, which will help firms to develop, test, and evaluate AI technologies in a controlled and supervised setting. In June 2025, the FCA also launched a new collaboration, giving firms the green light to trial AI in real-world (live) environments, in an attempt to speed up innovation.

The FCA's proposals mark a shift from abstract principles to practical support for firms dealing with AI implementation and a Code of Practice will be welcome news to many. Whilst the extent of the Code remains unclear, it is a decisive step toward regulatory clarity on AI. Firms will soon have a clearer rulebook for how to deploy AI in a compliant way. Of course, firms should also keep in mind that the Code of Practice will also provide further protection for consumers.

The FCA's AI Lab gives firms the opportunity to test and refine AI tools in a controlled environment, helping to identify potential risks and ensure systems are robust before deployment at scale. This will allow for faster adoption of AI, with the added reassurance of regulatory oversight and early intervention if needed.

Together, these developments suggest a more constructive and engaged regulatory approach, aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring that consumer protection, accountability, and trust in AI remain front and centre.

AI is a complex beast, but something we all have to embrace. It is not surprising that uncertainty and lack of familiarity are (according to the FCA) the main factors causing industry hesitation. There are, of course, benefits to AI, but these must be balanced with the risks. For example, uncertainty and lack of familiarity could lead to an increase in claims.

As we have explained previously, if a professional blindly follows AI recommendations and / or findings, without scrutinising what is being said, they risk overreliance, putting them at risk of claims. There is also the chance that many professional indemnity policies do not explicitly cover AI and so professionals are exposing themselves to coverage arguments.

We anticipate the Code of Practice will be published later this year. In the meantime, firms should continue to make the most of the resources signposted by the FCA to ensure  they are following existing guidance, minimising room for criticism.

We await with interest to see just how far the FCA's code of practice will go, how it might help or hinder AI usage, and what the impact will be for firms using AI.

If you've been anywhere near the internet in the last few years, chances are you've heard the buzz about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — those digital collectibles that have taken the art world, social media, and even pop culture by storm. But what exactly are NFTs, and why are people spending millions on pixelated images, funky animations, or even tweets? Well, to really get why NFTs are more than just a flashy trend, it helps to take a step back and dive into the origin of NFTs.

Understanding where NFTs come from isn't just a history lesson—it's like unlocking a secret door to how digital art, ownership, and creativity have been reshaped by the vibrant world of crypto culture. Knowing their roots gives you a clearer picture of why NFTs have sparked a whole new art movement, fueled by community, technology, and a dash of internet magic. So buckle up, because exploring the origin of NFTs is your ticket to joining one of the coolest conversations happening in the digital age.

NFT stands for non-fungible token, which sounds fancy but is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. “Non-fungible” basically means something unique—one of a kind. Imagine a rare baseball card or a custom pair of sneakers. You can't just swap it for another because it's special. That's what makes NFTs different from regular money or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are fungible—one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin.

At the heart of NFTs is the blockchain, a secure and shared digital ledger spread across thousands (or even millions) of computers worldwide. Here's why it's a big deal:

When you buy or sell an NFT, the blockchain updates this “digital notebook,” proving you own that unique digital item.

To understand the origin of NFTs, we need to rewind to the early days of crypto culture—when it wasn't just about digital money, but about big ideas like decentralization and digital ownership.

Decentralization means no single group or company controls the network. Instead, power is spread across many people. This idea excited internet rebels who wanted to take control away from banks and governments.

Digital ownership was the dream of owning something online that only you could claim—something rare, special, and truly yours.

Some early digital collectibles showed how fun and valuable digital ownership could be:

These projects proved that digital art and collectibles could be more than just files; they could be unique, tradable assets with real value.

Much of the early NFT magic happened in digital hangouts like:

These spaces weren't just marketplaces—they were creative hubs. Artists, coders, and collectors shared ideas, inspired each other, and pushed the boundaries of what NFTs could be.

So, while NFTs might look like a flashy new trend today, their origin lies in a passionate community that believed in a new way to own and share digital art. It's a story of culture, creativity, and connection as much as technology.

Once the tech-savvy crowd laid the groundwork, it didn't take long for artists to see the potential—and that's when things really started to get creative. The origin of NFTs as art began with a few pioneering projects that showed digital artwork could be rare, valuable, and collectible, just like a Picasso or a Banksy—except online, and sometimes animated.

Before NFT art made headlines at Christie's auctions, there were a few trailblazing projects that turned heads:

These projects helped shift NFTs from tech novelty to full-blown creative outlet.

In the traditional art world, artists often have to go through galleries, agents, or auction houses to sell their work—and those middlemen take a big cut. NFTs changed that. Now artists could mint (i.e., create) an NFT of their work, upload it to a marketplace like Foundation, OpenSea, or Rarible, and sell it directly to collectors with a few clicks.

What's cooler? Many platforms let artists earn royalties every time their NFT is resold, giving creators ongoing income—a major win that doesn't exist in most physical art sales.

Before NFTs, digital art had one big problem: anyone could right-click, save, and claim it as their own. There wasn't a clear way to prove who created it, who bought it, or whether a version was “authentic.”

NFTs flipped the script by using blockchain tech to:

With that, artists finally had a way to make digital art feel just as “real” and exclusive as anything hanging in a museum.

So while the origin of NFTs may have started in code and crypto chats, their evolution into a new form of art was a wild and wonderful leap—powered by innovation, a whole lot of memes, and a creative rebellion against the old way of doing things.

By the time NFTs were starting to feel like real art, things didn't just grow—they exploded. What began as a niche corner of crypto culture quickly snowballed into global headlines, eye-popping price tags, and celebrities minting cartoon apes like it was the new red carpet look. This boom phase is when the origin of NFTs went from underground tech to full-blown pop culture moment.

There were a few huge moments that blew the lid off the NFT scene:

These weren't just sales—they were signals that digital art had officially arrived, and that NFTs weren't just for crypto nerds anymore.

Behind every viral NFT sale was a platform that helped make it possible. These online marketplaces are the art galleries, auction houses, and community hubs of the NFT world—all rolled into one.

Some of the most important players:

These platforms didn't just make NFTs easy to buy and sell—they made them feel legit. With auction timers, trending tabs, and slick interfaces, they helped transform crypto art from “weird internet thing” to “I need this on my digital wall now.”

The NFT art boom wasn't just about money—it was a culture shift. Artists were empowered. Collectors became curators. Memes turned into million-dollar assets. It was chaotic, loud, inspiring—and totally internet.

And while this explosion built on the quiet groundwork laid in the early origin of NFTs, it also marked a moment when the entire world woke up and realized: oh, this isn't just hype. This is history being minted.
            




To really understand what made NFTs feel different—and why they became more than just digital files with price tags—you've got to look at the culture that built them. The origin of NFTs wasn't just about technology. It was about a vibe. A community. A movement that blended internet weirdness, creative rebellion, and crypto ideals into something totally new.

In the old-school art world, a few gatekeepers decided who got shown in galleries or bought at auctions. But crypto culture had no interest in that. Instead, it championed community-driven innovation, where artists and collectors hung out in the same Discord channels, collaborated on drops, and helped each other build.

It was grassroots. It was messy. It was magic.

One big idea kept pumping through it all: decentralization. That's just a fancy way of saying no central authority gets to make all the rules. This idea shaped everything from how NFTs were sold to how they were created.

This wasn't just art for art's sake—it was a rebellion against the middlemen. The blockchain didn't just store art; it freed it.

You can't talk about the NFT movement without talking about memes. Yes, actual memes. From laser-eyed frogs to pixelated punks, internet culture didn't just inspire NFT art—it became the art.

Why? Because crypto people love a good joke, a shared wink, or a meme that means more than it looks.

The origin of NFTs may have started with a few devs and artists tinkering with token standards, but the culture that followed? It turned the NFT space into a global gallery where internet jokes, social movements, and blockchain dreams collided in glorious, pixelated harmony.

If the origin of NFTs gave us the tools, it was crypto culture that gave us the flavor. And not just any flavor—think neon nacho cheese with a side of laser-eyed cats. The NFT movement didn't just rise out of a tech upgrade or a fancy financial model. It was fueled by wild ideas, tight-knit communities, and a deep love for the chaotic beauty of the internet.

NFTs weren't created in corporate boardrooms—they were born in Discord servers, Twitter threads, and late-night Zoom calls. Artists, developers, collectors, and crypto degens all showed up to build something weird and wonderful together.

It was like an indie music scene meets a startup ecosystem, except instead of guitars and pitch decks, people were trading generative skulls, animated JPEGs, and pixelated wizards.

At the heart of it all was a big, rebellious idea: decentralization. That meant no one person, company, or institution got to decide what art mattered or who could participate. The blockchain kept records of ownership, royalties, and sales—transparent and permanent.

This ethos empowered creators to:

It turned the art world on its head—and many artists loved every second of it.

Crypto culture has never taken itself too seriously. That's why memes, jokes, and absurd humor weren't just tolerated in NFT art—they were celebrated. The same crowd that invested in DeFi and debated tokenomics also dropped ETH on pixelated rocks and rainbow-haired apes.

NFT art absorbed the language and lore of the internet. It was self-aware, a little chaotic, and unapologetically weird—which made it all the more real.

So, while the origin of NFTs was about ownership and innovation, what really brought them to life was the culture: the jokes, the community hype, the rebellious spirit, and the shared belief that art doesn't have to be stuffy or serious to matter. It just has to mean something—to someone, somewhere on the chain.

If the origin of NFTs felt like a quiet crypto experiment in the basement, what came next was a neon explosion in the middle of the traditional art world's dinner party. Suddenly, galleries, auction houses, and legacy creatives had to reckon with pixelated punks selling for millions, GIFs being treated like Rembrandts, and artists minting wealth without ever setting foot in a gallery. The rules? Changed. The gatekeepers? Rattled.

One of the most beautiful things NFTs did? They leveled the playing field. Geography, status, and even language barriers shrank when the marketplace became the internet and the medium was blockchain.

It was the art world's version of “We're not waiting to be discovered—we're uploading our own spotlight.”

Of course, not all was pixel-perfect in paradise. As fast as the NFT scene rose, it attracted criticism from all sides. Some of the biggest:

And yeah, scams, rug pulls, and copy-minting didn't help the rep. For every heartfelt creator making magic, there was someone flipping derivatives of derivatives or trying to sell a stolen image.

But here's the twist: all art movements face backlash at first. Impressionists were mocked. Dada was chaos. NFTs? They're just the latest art-world rebel, shaking the frame a little (okay, a lot).

So whether you love them or love to roast them, one thing's clear: the origin of NFTs didn't just create a new art format—it lit a fire under an entire industry. And that flame's still burning, one mint at a time.

From quirky blockchain experiments to headline-grabbing art sales, the origin of NFTs has sparked a global creative movement that blends tech, culture, and pure imagination. What began in crypto circles is now reshaping how we think about art, ownership, and expression.

NFTs gave artists a new way to share and sell their work, let collectors become part of the story, and invited the internet's chaotic energy into the creative world. They're not just code or collectibles—they're digital artifacts of a new cultural era.

And the story's still unfolding. Whether you're here to collect, create, or just explore, the NFT space is open, weird, and waiting for your curiosity.

For most of its 18-year history, Semler Scientific marketed a single medical product that became a popular way for top Medicare insurers like UnitedHealth Group to detect artery blockages in older Americans.

But in its most recent earnings call, the device maker's focus on artery health gave way to a different strategy: “We are a bitcoin-first company,” Eric Semler, the company's chairman, declared in announcing a large purchase of the cryptocurrency. The company now claims to be the fourth-largest bitcoin treasury in the United States.

Semler's sudden shift toward digital currency speculation suggests that its long-running partnership with major health insurers was driven not by science or an enduring commitment to better health care, but by a singular desire to reach into a multibillion-dollar pot of federal money. Together, these companies had pledged to use Semler's device, called QuantaFlo, to detect artery disease early and head off its worst effects, such as amputation and untimely death. But as the money began to dry up, records and interviews show, so did their quest to track down the disease in communities nationwide.

Sweet taste perception influences dietary choices and metabolic health. The human sweet taste receptor, a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heterodimer composed of TAS1R2-TAS1R31,2, senses a wide range of sweet compounds — including natural sugars, artificial sweeteners and sweet proteins — impacting metabolic regulation beyond taste. However, the lack of three-dimensional structures hinders our understanding of its precise working mechanism. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the full-length human sweet taste receptor in apo- and sucralose-bound states. These structures reveal a distinct asymmetric heterodimer architecture, with sucralose binding exclusively to the Venus flytrap domain of TAS1R2. Combining mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, this work delineates the sweeteners recognition modes in TAS1R2. Structural comparisons further uncover the conformational changes upon ligand binding and unique activation mechanism. These findings illuminate the signal transduction mechanisms of chemosensory receptors in class C GPCRs and provide molecular basis for new-generation sweetener design.

Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have developed a gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease that could help protect the brain from damage and preserve cognitive function. Unlike existing treatments for Alzheimer's that target unhealthy protein deposits in the brain, the new approach could help address the root cause of Alzheimer's disease by influencing the behavior of brain cells themselves.

Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people around the world and occurs when abnormal proteins build up in the brain, leading to the death of brain cells and declines in cognitive function and memory. While current treatments can manage symptoms of Alzheimer's, the new gene therapy aims to halt or even reverse disease progression.

Studying mice, the researchers found that delivering the treatment at the symptomatic stage of the disease preserved hippocampal-dependent memory, a critical aspect of cognitive function that is often impaired in Alzheimer's patients. Compared to healthy mice of the same age, the treated mice also had a similar pattern of gene expression, suggesting that the treatment has the potential to alter the behavior of diseased cells to restore them to a healthier state.

While further studies will be required to translate these findings into human clinical trials, the gene therapy offers a unique and promising approach to mitigating cognitive decline and promoting brain health.

The study, published in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, was led by senior author Brian Head, Ph.D., professor of anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs research career scientist, and co-senior author Shanshan Wang, M.D. Ph.D., an assistant professor of anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine. The gene therapy technology was licensed by UC San Diego to Eikonoklastes Therapeutics in 2021. Eikonoklastes was granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA for the use of the patented gene therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

New research from the University of California, Davis, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Texas A&M University reveals that massive emissions, or burps, of carbon dioxide from natural earth systems led to significant decreases in ocean oxygen concentrations some 300 million years ago.

Combining geochemical analyses of sediment cores and advanced climate modeling, the study, published June 23 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlights five periods when significant decreases in ocean oxygen levels (by 4% to 12%) coincided with significant increases in levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Such oxygen-less, or anoxic, events are known for their detrimental effects on marine life and biodiversity.

Despite their roots in the deep past, the findings are relevant to the current global climate and its future. If events of a similar scale were to happen today, they would likely affect coastal areas that are important for fisheries and marine biodiversity.

"This is our only analog for big changes in carbon dioxide at levels comparable to what we're living in today, where we see doublings and triplings of the levels," said senior author Isabel P. Montañez, a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Davis.

What's different, though, is the source of the carbon dioxide. While carbon dioxide levels of long-past climates were influenced by natural systems like volcanic eruptions, human-produced and human-related carbon dioxide emissions strongly influence today's levels.

"We're creating a burp now and at a rate two, maybe three, orders of magnitude faster than in the past," Montañez said.

Sediment cores and deep climate modeling

In the study, the team used sediment cores sourced from a geological formation in South China called the Naqing succession. By analyzing the geochemical makeup of these deep-water cores, specifically carbonate uranium isotopes, the team chronicled Earth's environmental conditions from 310 to 290 million years ago.

"Through that analysis, we see these 'burps' not just in carbon dioxide but in the ocean's uranium isotope signature too," Montañez said. "They're totally aligned, and the size of those uranium spikes tell us about the magnitude of the ocean anoxia."

The team then used that information to inform leading-edge climate models, developed by the authors of this study, that are used to better understand ancient climates.

"It's a mathematical framework in which we put in all our proxy information and we run it hundreds of thousands of times on a supercomputer," Montañez said. "It basically best models what is most realistic given all the uncertainties, all the knowns, all the information that it's given."

Based on the modeling, the team found five instances of decreased oxygen in the global ocean by 4% to 12% from 290 to 310 million years ago. Each period lasted for roughly 100,000 to 200,000 years.

While the decrease in ocean oxygen doesn't appear to correlate to any known mass extinctions, it does align with pauses in biodiversity that can be seen in the geological record.

"We do see these pauses in biodiversity each time these burps happen," Montañez said. "It had an impact, most likely coastal regions were impacted the most."

Records of the past, lessons for the future

The Earth of 300 million years ago was vastly different than the Earth of today. For one, oxygen in the atmosphere was 40% to 50% higher than it is today. Despite the differences between past and present, the magnitude of the rises in carbon dioxide levels are similar.

That could be interpreted as a warning, according to Montañez.

"This is a huge discovery because how do you take an ocean sitting under an atmosphere with much more oxygen than today and permit this?" Montañez said. "The message for us is, 'Don't be so sure that we can't do this again with our current human-driven release of carbon dioxide.'"

Primates, birds, and elephants are all known to make tools, but examples of tool use among marine animals are much more limited. Reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on June 23, a team of whale experts has found widespread tool manufacture and usage in an endangered population of resident killer whales living in the Salish Sea -- part of the Pacific Ocean between British Columbia and Washington. The whales fashion tools from kelp and use them for grooming purposes.

"We found that southern resident killer whales regularly use lengths of bull kelp during social interactions, apparently as a tool to groom one another," says Michael Weiss (@CetaceanMike) of the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, WA. "To find that the whales were not just using but also manufacturing tools, and that these objects were being used in a way never before reported in marine mammals, was incredibly exciting."

Weiss and his team discovered this unexpected whale activity while conducting aerial observations of southern resident killer whales, which are a critically endangered whale population with fewer than 80 individuals left found in the Pacific Northwest. The team has been monitoring the whales since 2018 to learn more about their foraging and social behavior.

"While there are other killer whales around the world, the southern residents represent a genetically, ecologically, and culturally distinct population," says Weiss.

Through the high-resolution footage collected by their aircraft, the researchers found that the whales created tools by breaking off the ends of bull kelp stalks. They then pressed pieces of kelp against a partner and rolled the kelp between their bodies for long periods of time.

The researchers observed this behavior in whales across all social groups, both sexes, and all age classes. They found that whales were more likely to groom closely related whales or similarly aged partners. They also saw some evidence that whales with more molting or dead skin were more likely to engage in grooming, suggesting it may have a hygienic function.

"What I find most remarkable is that despite this apparently being a common behavior -- we see it most days we fly our drone over these whales -- it hadn't yet been discovered in this population despite nearly 50 years of dedicated observation," says Weiss. "To me, this demonstrates not just the power of new observation methods but also how much we still have to learn about these animals."

It remains unclear whether this grooming behavior is entirely unique to this population or more widespread among other whale populations and species. Regardless, the discovery opens new avenues for understanding tool use in marine mammals and demonstrates that tools can be used in a wide array of contexts, say the researchers.

"This finding highlights yet another way these whales' society and culture is unique and the importance of recovering the southern resident killer whale population," says Weiss.

This research was supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the Orca Fund, the Wild Fish Conservancy, the Rose Foundation for Communities and the Environment, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, and the Earthwatch Institute.

To Make Better Choices, Understand How Your Brain Processes Values

The brain weighs factors based on their importance to oneself and one's social world as part of a complex calculation that shapes behavior

By Daisy Yuhas

Much has been made of the power of habit. We're encouraged to make healthy choices our default and to understand the way that the brain sets certain tasks, such as our morning commute, on autopilot to improve our efficiency.

But what about our more intentional, conscious day-to-day choices? The decisions we ponder—over seconds or lengthy deliberation—rely in part on the value system, which weighs in on the subjective evaluations we make, tipping the scales toward one choice over another. “When we understand how the value system works, we can recognize many possible paths to our goals,” says Emily Falk, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania and author of What We Value.

As the book explores, many people feel frustrated when they find themselves making choices that run counter to their big-picture goals—things like exercising more, visiting older relatives or cutting back screen time. Falk introduces readers to the brain systems that calculate our priorities in the moment and the strategies for weighting those decisions toward what matters most to each person. In the process, she offers a compassionate framework for recognizing how we make choices and why change can be so challenging.

Scientific American spoke with Falk about how the brain sifts through options and how reflecting on our priorities can help align our behaviors with long-term aims.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

So how does the brain assign value?

When we're making a decision, the brain first identifies the different things that we might be choosing between.Then the brain's valuation system takes input from many other systems, including the ones that help us process emotions, think about ourselves, and help us understand other people's thoughts and feelings.

It integrates that information and assigns a subjective value to each option. Then we choose the one that we expect will be most rewarding. Finally, after we make the choice, the brain keeps track of how things went to see whether something we thought would be rewarding was as good as we predicted.

Ultimately, that valuation system provides a final common pathway in arriving at our subjective evaluations across very different things—whether relationship partners, food choices or financial decisions.

As just one example of factors that influence these value calculations, in January my colleagues and I published findings that showed people are more likely to share news stories with others when they reflect on why that article is relevant to themselves and their social worlds. And we've seen, in this and in past research, how that desire to share news relates to activity in the brain's self-reference and social cognition systems.

How might understanding these systems change the way people think about their choices or behavior?

We know that one important input for the value system is self-relevance, or how much something feels psychologically meaningful or close to oneself. And we tend to confound self and value. Neuroscientific research shows a deep intertwining of these self and values systems.

Sometimes that is good in terms of maintaining a coherent sense of self and a positive sense of self. The problem is that we may hold on to notions of what we did and who we are beyond the point when they are useful.

As another example, people prefer rewards that are close in time or instantly gratifying. Understanding how the brain works also highlights how other kinds of psychological [closeness or] distance work in a similar way.

Scientists have studied how the medial prefrontal cortex, which is important to both the value and self-relevance systems, handles multiple kinds of psychological distance in a similar way. For instance, people are more motivated to choose something when you expect the rewards will come sooner or involve something geographically close or people who feel socially close. But you can make rewards feel psychologically closer. Scientists have done that by asking people to imagine otherwise distant scenarios in concrete ways. You can vividly imagine how your future self will spend money in retirement as an incentive to save now or envision the transformative consequences for a specific child of donating to UNICEF to increase your giving.

In your research, you've looked at another strategy, what psychologists call values affirmation, and found it can help people make better decisions for themselves in the long term. Can you explain more?

Lots of research shows that when we are reminded of the things that are most important to us—“capital-V” values such as kindness or friendship and family—we are more open to changing our behaviors.

For example, in studies that our team has run, sedentary people are more likely to become physically active after being asked to affirm their values by identifying the most important ones on a list and then envisioning themselves in various scenarios that tap into those values. So if you choose friends and family, we might ask you to imagine a time in the future when you connect with a family member, and they help you with a challenge. When we look at brain activity, we see that when thinking about what matters most, core parts of the value and self-relevance systems become active.

We also find people are less defensive and more open to change after reflecting on their most important values. So if we have people do this type of values affirmation before we give them messages intended to coach them toward healthier choices—such as reminders to exercise—we see that the people who affirmed their values show more activity in the value and self-relevance systems in the brain than others who did not do that affirmation. And then when we follow our participants over the next month—sending out more value-reflection prompts and reminders to be active—the ones who showed that greater brain activation were ultimately less sedentary.

Why would thinking about family and friends change someone's inclination to exercise?

In many value affirmation studies, the value does not have an obvious connection to the behavior. Instead the idea is that thinking about what really matters to you helps you zoom out and consider the big picture. Affirming your values—by writing about what you care about most, choosing values from a list or imagining situations that involve those values—can ground you.

In addition, self-transcendent values, which connect you to something outside of yourself, such as friends and family or spirituality, are more effective than purely self-focused values at helping people make changes. People who connect with those self-transcendent values on a regular basis, and people who have a stronger sense of purpose, get health and well-being benefits that don't accrue when we focus on more self-focused values such as personal money, fame and power.

All of this suggests that people who keep their big-picture ideas and goals top of mind—for example, through regular reminders of their big-picture values—gain some advantages when it comes to decision-making, right?

Yes. Feeling purposeful means having a clear picture of what you're trying to do and why. It can be like a North Star that helps us think about the path from where we are now to where we want to be.

But it isn't just that some people are purposeful and others are not. People's sense of purpose fluctuates, on a day-to-day basis, around whatever their baseline is. This is helpful to keep in mind because it highlights that we can do things that might change how purposeful we feel on a given day and what benefits we get as a result. For example, day-to-day choices and physical health relate to purpose. Exercise, sleep, mood, connecting with other people and sense of purpose relate to one another in a web of wellness. When we actively choose to prioritize one of these, we can get benefits in lots of other areas for free.

Earth's innards are rumbling, and it's not indigestion.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Deep beneath Earth's surface are layers of soil, rock strata often embedded with fossils, gurgling magma, and—back up. Before your Journey to the Center of the Earth mission can get any further, you're going to have to get past flows of solid rock. 

The D” layer—located between layers of magma above and the liquid rock of the outer core below—has been mystifying scientists for decades. This is in part because if you were to plunge down 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles), you would be jump-scared by seismic waves that accelerate when they hit the threshold of the D” layer. It used to be thought the reason for this was the mineral perovskite, found in the lower mantle, morphing into a form known as post-perovskite close to the D” layer. But that still wasn't enough to explain the phenomenon. 

Geoscientist Motohiko Murakami wanted to investigate what could possibly be going on to cause the strange seismic wave acceleration known as the D” discontinuity. Because trekking to the core-mantle boundary (CMB) where the D” layer lies is obviously not an option, he led a team of researchers from Switzerland and Japan in running lab tests and computer simulations to find out what post-perovskite had to do with he unusual increase in seismic waves.

Post-perovskite crystals are anisotropic, meaning their physical properties are different when measured in different directions. They have two different types of textures—one comes from transformation (the phase transition from the perovskite phase to post-perovskite), and the other is a result of deformation (when post-perovskite crystals turn to face in the same direction). Murakami and his team found out that it isn't just transformation that causes the rumbling. It actually happens with deformation.

“The deformation-induced texture forms when crystals undergo plastic deformation, causing their orientations to align in specific directions. It is mainly produced by dislocation slip or creep,” Murakami said in a study recently published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment. 

How post-perovskite crystals are aligned determines their hardness, and the speed at which seismic waves move through them depends on how hard they are. Materials called perovskites can be created from any substances capable of being arranged into the same cubic crystal structure. Perovskite is a calcium titanium oxide mineral (CaTiO3), while post-perovskite is a form of magnesium silicate (MgSiO3) achieved at extremely high pressures. Its crystal structure is orthorhombic, meaning that the right angles of the cubes have unequal axes.

For post-perovskite crystals to align with each other, the axes all have to be in the same position. Murakami used MgGeO3 to create crystals analogous to post-perovskite. Like perovskite, MgGeO3 crystals deform easily when pressure is applied, so how they behaved would reflect was is going on over a thousand miles underground. The crystals were heated by a laser, compressed, and heated again to synthesize post-perovskite. They were then exposed to high-pressure sound waves, and the wave velocity was measured once those waves passed through the crystals.

It turned out that sound waves can experience a substantial increase in velocity when passing through aligned post-perovskite crystals. Researchers also discovered that the cause of this alignment—which determines the hardness of the material, and therefore the speed of sound waves in the lab and seismic waves deep in Earth—is convection. As hotter material rises, cooler material sinks, as it does in convective storms like hurricanes. 

Murakami thinks that convection of materials in the mantle (such as plumes rising and slavs sinking) is behind the deformation in the D” layer. This is the first time any evidence—even lab-based evidence—has been found for Earth's innards moving. 

“While previous theoretical work has suggested that anisotropy could explain the observed seismic discontinuities,” he said. “Our results, obtained through in situ measurements of post-perovskite velocities under high pressure, represent the experimental verification of this hypothesis, bridging the gap between theory and observation.”

Synonymous mutations are generally considered neutral, while their roles in the human genome remain largely unexplored. Here we use the PEmax system to create a library of 297,900 engineered prime-editing guide RNAs and perform extensive screening to identify synonymous mutations affecting cell fitness. Unlike recent findings in yeast, group-level analyses show that synonymous mutations diverge from nonsynonymous mutations in fitness effects yet exhibit similar phenotypic distributions relative to negative controls. Following rigorous quality control, only a small subset demonstrated measurable effects. For these functional mutations, we develop a specialized machine learning tool and uncover their impact on various biological processes such as messenger RNA splicing and transcription, supported by multifaceted experimental evidence. We find that synonymous mutations can alter RNA folding and affect translation, as demonstrated by PLK1_S2. By integrating screening data with our model, we predict clinically deleterious synonymous mutations. This research deepens our understanding of synonymous mutations, providing insights for clinical disease studies.

Ambitious international commitments have been made to preserve biodiversity, with the goal of preventing extinctions and maintaining ecosystem resilience, yet the efficacy of large-scale protection for preventing near-term extinctions remains unclear. Here, we used a trait-based approach to show that global actions—such as the immediate abatement of all threats across at least half of species ranges for ~10,000 bird species—will only prevent half of the projected species extinctions and functional diversity loss attributable to current and future threats in the next 100 years. Nonetheless, targeted recovery programmes prioritizing the protection of the 100 most functionally unique threatened birds could avoid 68% of projected functional diversity loss. Actions targeting ‘habitat loss and degradation' will prevent the greatest number of species extinctions and proportion of functional diversity loss relative to other drivers of extinction, whereas control of ‘hunting and collection' and ‘disturbance and accidental mortality' would save fewer species but disproportionately boost functional richness. These findings show that conservation of avian diversity requires action partitioned across all drivers of decline and highlight the importance of understanding and mitigating the ecological impacts of species extinctions that are predicted to occur even under optimistic levels of conservation action.

Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, with implications for ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services1,2. Human activity has led to widespread decline in the extent and structural condition of ecosystems and changes in community trait composition3. High functional diversity—the diversity of traits that describe an organism's ecological niche—has been associated with greater ecosystem functioning4,5, more reliable ecosystem service delivery6 and greater ecosystem resilience7,8. Therefore, changes in community composition could undermine the persistence of natural communities. Owing to the potential importance of functional diversity in supporting ecosystem function and resilience9, identifying effective measures for conserving functional diversity alongside species richness is paramount10.

Ambitious policies and substantial conservation resources have been dedicated to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by reducing the impact of threats11. Programmes designed to alleviate threats at a large scale, a strategy referred to as threat abatement12, are essential for the long-term persistence of species; however, it remains unclear to what extent they can avert imminent extinctions and functional diversity loss. Previous studies have rarely extended past isolated analyses of single threats and their impacts on species richness or broader syntheses of the coverage of conservation targets13,14. The main alternative to threat abatement strategies is direct management interventions such as breeding programmes and translocations. These measures can be effective15,16, particularly for rare species or those that are vulnerable to human pressures17. However, targeted recovery programmes, including ex-situ conservation and in-situ measures to boost species survival and success, are often prohibitively expensive18, limiting their application as a global conservation strategy17. Therefore, conserving bird diversity can probably only be achieved with a combination of large-scale protection through threat abatement coupled with targeted species recovery programmes15,19. However, the extent to which abatement can reduce the need for intensive management to boost species population and reproductive success remains unclear.

Here, we used a trait-based approach to evaluate how much biodiversity and associated ecological function could be protected in the near term, defined as the next 100 years, under different global conservation strategies. We assessed the probable success of strategies focusing on the abatement of current and future drivers of extinction and estimated whether shortfalls in efficacy can be countered through targeted species recovery programmes. We used a phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (PGLMM) to predict species extinction risk based on threats listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), accounting for non-independence geographically and across the avian tree of life. We quantified the importance of conserving unique species, which provide a disproportionate contribution to the global diversity of form and function in birds.

We projected expected bird extinctions for the next 100 years based on IUCN Red List threat data20. We fitted a PGLMM implemented in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that predicted species assignment to Red List category with 86.8% accuracy (Supplementary Analyses), using data on threat scope and severity and including random effects describing the spatial and phylogenetic relationships among species. We then stochastically projected species extinctions based on expected probabilities of extinction for each Red List category (see Methods).

In the baseline extinction scenario, we assumed that human activity and natural threats would continue to impact bird populations as currently listed. In this scenario, we predicted that 5.2 ± 0.2% (mean ± s.d.) of the 9,873 extant birds studied would go extinct in the next 100 years (517 ± 19 species) (Fig. 1); more than three times the recorded number of bird extinctions since 1500. This figure falls within the range of previously predicted bird extinctions, ranging from 226–589 species extinctions in the next 500 years21 to 669–738 species extinctions in the next 100 years22. Extinctions on this scale are expected to fundamentally alter the global bird assemblage, potentially reducing functional diversity23,24.

 a, Loss in species richness and functional richness under three scenarios: baseline extinction, partial abatement of all drivers of extinction and complete abatement of all drivers of extinction. Black points show mean loss across 1,000 iterations for each scenario, with variation in those points shown by their distribution (violin plots) and the individual values (grey dots). b, Diversity loss avoided under driver-specific complete abatement of six major drivers of extinction (circles represent the mean; error bars, 0.5 s.d.). Note that in some iterations, loss avoided could be negative, as more diversity was lost with driver-specific abatement than under the baseline scenario. The dotted diagonal line shows mean functional richness loss per species richness loss under complete abatement of all threats. Drivers above this line show greater avoidance of functional richness loss per species richness loss avoided relative to the mean across all drivers of extinction. Hunting, hunting and collection; climate, climate change and severe weather; invasive, invasive species, genes and disease; disturbance, disturbance and accidental mortality. Analyses based on 9,873 species (of which 2,087 species currently listed as Near Threatened or in threatened categories were modelled and could have reduced extinction risk in the abatement scenarios). A total of 1,000 iterations were run for each extinction scenario.

To quantify projected change in functional diversity in the world's avifauna (n = 9,873), we used published data on 11 continuous morphological traits that collectively capture bird ecological niches through their well-established association with diet, dispersal and habitat25,26,27. These traits were summarized using the first three axes produced by phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA), which explained 87.2% of variance in the dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1), providing an overview of global avian functional diversity (Extended Data Fig. 2; see Methods). We estimated functional diversity using probabilistic hypervolumes28, which can be applied to multidimensional data and have been shown to be less sensitive to extreme trait values than other methods, such as convex hulls29. We quantified the volume of trait space occupied by the current global avian assemblage (n = 9,873) as well as under future extinction scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 3). Under the baseline extinction scenario, functional diversity was projected to decrease by 3.2 ± 0.4% in the next 100 years relative to present-day functional diversity. This is probably a conservative estimate that only reflects loss in three-dimensional functional space and ignores internal erosion of the space23,30. Projected functional diversity loss varied between 2.4 ± 0.9% and 3.8 ± 0.4% when measured with two dimensions and four dimensions, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Threat abatement could prevent species extinctions and reduce functional diversity loss. However, it is unclear to what extent imminent biodiversity loss can be avoided, and what scale of action is required to prevent species extinctions and functional diversity loss altogether. Using our PGLMM model, we predicted how extinction risk would change under three management scenarios that reflect varying levels of threat abatement (see Methods and Fig. 2). Complete abatement involved removal of all direct drivers of extinction across the entirety of all species ranges; partial abatement involved removal of all direct drivers of extinction across at least half of all species ranges (threat spatial scopes downgraded to ‘Minority < 50%'); and minimal abatement involved the removal of all direct drivers of extinction across at least 10% of all species ranges (threat spatial scopes downgraded to ‘Majority 50–90%').

 a, IUCN Red List data20 on threat scope and severity were used to assign projected population decline over a 10-year period or three generations, according to previous publications83,43. Data on projected population decline for all species and all threats were used in an MCMCglmm to predict IUCN extinction risk category, using phylogenetic and spatial variables as random effects. NT, Near Threatened; VU, Vulnerable; EN, Endangered; CR, Critically Endangered. b, Four extinction scenarios were used: baseline, in which current, future and likely-to-return threats remained as listed by the IUCN20; complete abatement, in which threats were removed across the entirety of the species range; partial abatement, in which threats were removed from at least 50% of the species range; and minimal abatement, in which threats were removed from at least 10% of the species range. Rattus fuscipes (Rachel T Mason, CC0 1.0) and Quercus robur silhouettes from Phylopic. Globe silhouette from ClipSafari (Sev, CC0 1.0).

Under the complete abatement scenario, half of the biodiversity loss predicted under the baseline scenario could be prevented (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). However, an average loss of 2.6 ± 0.2% of species richness (254 ± 19 species) and 1.5 ± 0.3% of functional richness remained. Given that our model did not include Least Concern species (for which threat data are scarce), it could not predict assignment to the Least Concern category. However, in reality, threat abatement could result in full recovery to Least Concern. To evaluate the impact of this on projected diversity loss, we tested the effect of assuming a low extinction probability of 0.0001 for the Near Threatened category, equal to the expected for the Least Concern category (1 × 10−6 extinctions per species per year). We obtained similar estimates (241 ± 18 species extinctions; 1.4 ± 0.3% functional diversity loss; Supplementary Analyses), showing that lack of assignment of species to the Least Concern category under abatement scenarios did not notably affect our results.

Some extinctions were not preventable even with complete abatement; therefore, they were not attributable to current and future drivers of extinction. These extinctions could reflect particularly vulnerable species that have high extinction risk despite being affected by few threats, as well as species that were severely affected by past threats that can no longer be managed or abated. The model captured variation in species vulnerability to extinction that was not described by threats through spatial and phylogenetic random effects. The relevance of spatial and phylogenetic variables was supported by the fact that background extinction rates and extinctions owing to stochastic events varied by taxonomic group31 and across space32.

Deviations from expected extinction risk captured by spatial and phylogenetic variables could reflect fast or slow life history33, variation in overlap with areas of high human influence34 and isolation and connectivity35. These factors are expected to be important for explaining variation in both extinction risk and species recovery36,37,38 and often exhibit high degrees of spatial or phylogenetic correlation39,40,41. For example, island endemics are particularly sensitive to extinction because of their small and isolated ranges35, which may be captured through spatial random effects, and evolution of traits associated with increased extinction risk, such as flightlessness, which may be captured by phylogenetic random effects35. The Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor) is a Critically Endangered species that was predicted to be at risk of extinction even under complete abatement. Like many island species, it has a very small remaining population (60–70 individuals)42, and our analysis suggests that it is likely to go extinct without complementary measures such as habitat restoration or ex-situ conservation.

Our finding that even large-scale and ambitious actions leading to the removal of all present, future and likely-to-return threats will fail to prevent almost half of projected species extinctions challenges some of the key assumptions of global metrics used to track conservation progress. For example, the Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) metric43 is based on IUCN Red List data on threat scope and severity but assumes that complete threat abatement will allow the vast majority of species to be downgraded to Least Concern, an assumption that our findings did not support. Although those authors43 acknowledge that some species may require restoration to be downgraded to Least Concern, our results suggested that many species will require conservation measures in addition to threat abatement. Even when species are not affected by current or future threats, they may still be threatened with extinction. Although we did not explicitly test the reasons for ongoing declines, they could occur because of continued population decline (particularly in populations which are no longer self-sustaining), high vulnerability to stochastic events because of small population or range size, or reduced fitness as a result of severe population decline in the past44.

Partial abatement was somewhat effective at reducing avian diversity loss, preventing about one-quarter of projected losses (26 ± 4% of projected species extinctions and 26 ± 13% of projected functional diversity loss; Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). Species that are experiencing severe declines but are affected by few threats showed the greatest reduction in extinction risk under partial abatement. The green-faced parrot finch (Erythrura viridifacies) and the Saint Vincent parrot (Amazona guildingii) responded particularly well to partial abatement, with a reduction in extinction risk that was almost as great as the reduction in extinction risk under complete abatement. Although partial abatement prevented some losses, there was still a 3.9% decrease in species richness (385 ± 18 species) and a 2.3 ± 0.3% decrease in functional richness. Of the diversity loss that was attributable to the drivers of extinction (diversity loss under complete abatement), approximately half was prevented through partial abatement (50 ± 7% of species extinctions and 49 ± 26% of functional diversity loss). The minimal abatement scenario prevented only a small proportion of biodiversity loss (Extended Data Table 1). Using different traits to quantify functional diversity did not affect our conclusions (Supplementary Analyses), as we obtained similar results when we used pPCs constructed from three-dimensional scans of beak morphology45 and when the first pPC (largely describing variation in body size) was removed.

Protecting species from the drivers of extinction does not provide a comprehensive solution to biodiversity loss in the near future without additional measures such as targeted species recovery programmes, habitat restoration and prioritization of protection in important areas46. This finding is consistent with previous studies assessing biodiversity impacts of future conservation and mitigation scenarios. One study47 found that although it was possible to bend the curve of biodiversity loss with an integrated strategy, protected area management and expansion to avert the impact of habitat loss and degradation were insufficient to avoid more than 50% of projected biodiversity loss on average in biodiversity-rich regions. Similarly, another study48 predicted that in a 2015–2050 scenario of strong land use and climate change mitigation globally, rates of biodiversity loss would decrease but biodiversity would continue to decline. Threat reduction is an essential component of tackling the biodiversity crisis and is necessary to ensure that species with healthy, stable populations do not go into decline in the future15. However, it is not enough. The abatement scenarios explored here represented significant management efforts with optimistic assumptions about their impact and uptake. We assumed that the drivers of extinction, and the species declines caused by these drivers, could be halted immediately and that all drivers of extinction could be alleviated, including climate change, which arguably may be difficult to mitigate with site-based protection. Even in these ambitious and optimistic scenarios, we predicted that over half of the projected species extinctions and loss of functional diversity in the next 100 years would occur anyway.

Projected loss of functional diversity was not evenly distributed across functional space (Figs. 3 and 4). Areas of trait space with high pPC1 values (generally larger birds) were predicted to show the greatest proportional losses under the baseline extinction scenario. Complete abatement was predicted to reduce loss across functional space (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 4) but was less effective in a region of high pPC1 and pPC2 values, predominantly occupied by large aquatic predators (Extended Data Fig. 5).

 pPC1 is a descriptor of body size, pPC2 is associated with wing morphology and pPC3 is associated with beak and tail morphology (for trait loadings, see Supplementary Table 3). a,b, Predicted proportional decline in functional trait space occupation in the next 100 years under the baseline extinction scenario with respect to pPC1 and pPC2 (a) and pPC3 and pPC2 (b). c,d, Averted proportional decline under the complete abatement scenario for pPC1 and pPC2 (c) and pPC2 and pPC3 (d).

Species' traits shape their vulnerability to human activity, but different areas of trait space are affected by different threats49,50. As such, abatement of drivers of extinction could have differential outcomes for functional diversity. To test this concept, we focused on six drivers of extinction (Supplementary Dataset 1) and quantified the ‘maximum avoidable contribution' from each driver, describing the species and functional diversity loss avoided when the impact of current and future threats within each driver of extinction were completely removed, relative to diversity loss in the baseline scenario (see Methods). ‘Habitat loss and degradation' had the highest maximum avoidable contribution, as driver-specific complete abatement was projected to avoid 1.4 ± 0.2% species richness loss (141 ± 24 species extinctions) and 0.9 ± 0.5% functional diversity loss (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 2). Driver-specific complete abatement of ‘hunting and collection' was projected to avoid 0.4 ± 0.5% functional diversity loss (Fig. 1), almost half that of ‘habitat loss and degradation' despite requiring action for 591 species rather than 1,658 species. Other drivers of extinction had smaller maximum avoidable contributions (Fig. 1). The relative magnitude of maximum avoidable contributions among drivers was comparable when simulating driver-specific partial abatement and driver-specific minimal abatement rather than driver-specific complete abatement.

Although assessments of individual drivers on avian functional diversity exist13,14,51, assessments of multiple drivers simultaneously are rare and are important for quantifying the relative impact of different drivers of extinction on avian functional diversity. We found that driver-specific complete abatement of ‘hunting and collection' and ‘disturbance and accidental mortality' was projected to result in disproportionately high avoidance of functional diversity loss for the number of species extinctions avoided (Extended Data Fig. 6). As abatement of different drivers of extinction had different value for the preservation of functional diversity, we argue that it is necessary to consider functional diversity in conservation planning and prioritization.

To assess which species traits were vulnerable to drivers of extinction, we used a mixed-effects multi-response regression model of reduction in extinction risk under driver-specific complete abatement scenarios against values of three pPCs (see Methods). Reduction in extinction risk was quantified as the number of iterations in which species extinction was avoided in driver-specific complete abatement scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. A significant positive relationship was detected when abatement of a given driver of extinction reduced extinction risk in species with high values of a given pPC, and a significant negative relationship occurred when abatement of a given driver of extinction reduced extinction risk in species with low values of a given pPC (Fig. 4).

We found that the abatement of different drivers of extinction would benefit distinct morphologies. Birds with large body size (pPC1) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk when abating ‘hunting and collection' or ‘climate change and severe weather' (Fig. 4; PMCMC < 0.01 for both). Although extinction risk bias towards species with large body size is widely reported52,53, we found that this was not the case for all threats, as there was no evidence of bias with respect to pPC1 for other drivers of extinction49.

The bias in extinction avoidance with respect to wing morphology (pPC2) was variable across drivers of extinction. Birds with broader wings (those with low pPC2 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk under abatement of ‘habitat loss and degradation' (PMCMC < 0.01). By contrast, birds with slender wings (high pPC2 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk under abatement of ‘hunting and collection' (PMCMC = 0.08; values under 0.1 are treated as significant to give a one-tailed significance test of overlap with zero rather than the default two-tailed test). Our finding that extinction avoidance was more likely for species with broad wings (low values of pPC2) when abating habitat loss and degradation is consistent with recent studies that show that birds with a low hand-wing index (described by pPC2) are more sensitive to fragmentation54 and deforestation55.

The bias in extinction avoidance with respect to tail and beak morphology (pPC3) was also variable across drivers of extinction. Species with long tails and short beaks (low pPC3 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk following abatement of both ‘hunting and collection' and ‘invasive species, and disease' (PMCMC = 0.96 and PMCMC < 0.05, respectively (hunting and collection was not significant when insignificant variables were removed)), whereas species with short tails and long beaks (high pPC3 values) were more likely to experience a reduction in extinction risk following abatement of ‘climate change and severe weather' (PMCMC = 0.08). Reduced extinction risk following abatement of climate change and severe weather was associated with traits involved in thermoregulation56,57,58,59. Birds with large body size (pPC1) but also large beaks (pPC3) were more likely to avoid extinction when climate change and severe weather was abated. As a bird's beak also influences its trophic niche60, failing to mitigate species decline caused by climate change could have knock-on effects for trophic interactions. Variable extinction avoidance across functional trait space suggests that prioritizing threat abatement based on the magnitude of projected biodiversity loss alone is inappropriate. Reducing the impact of multiple drivers of extinction is necessary to ensure that diverse functional morphologies are conserved.

Even with ambitious action, large-scale threat abatement will not prevent all species extinctions and functional richness loss in the next 100 years. As such, targeted species recovery programmes will be needed, which we defined as in-situ and ex-situ measures to boost species survival and reproductive success that do not involve threat reduction. Here, we explored one possible approach, quantifying the benefits of preventing a small number of species extinctions targeted to reduce the loss of global functional richness. Using a metric of functional uniqueness that describes the probability of functional richness loss as a result of species extinction (Extended Data Fig. 7), we identified the most unique threatened species among the 9,873 bird species studied. Preventing the extinction of the most unique species (we tested scenarios protecting between 40 and 200 species; Fig. 5) was effective at reducing projected functional diversity loss. We found that preventing the extinction of the top 100 most unique threatened species avoided 68 ± 5% of projected functional diversity loss under the baseline scenario compared to the 26 ± 13% avoided by partial abatement of all threats for all species. By preventing the extinction of 100 species (1% of species), 2.2 ± 0.32% of functional diversity could be conserved if the most functionally unique threatened species were prioritized. This approach would require the avoidance of 37 ± 25 projected extinctions in the next 100 years. A previous publication17 reported that 21–32 bird species have been saved from extinction by conservation efforts since 1993, suggesting that this could be an achievable goal (although ten extinctions occurred despite management).

 Functional diversity loss avoided (as a percentage of projected functional diversity loss under the baseline scenario) from 1,000 iterations. Black points show mean loss avoided; violin plots show the distribution; grey points show individual values of loss avoided under each iteration. The number of unique threatened species that were prevented from going extinct (‘protected') varied between 40 and 200 unique threatened species at intervals of 20 species.

The most functionally unique birds spanned taxonomic and ecological groups, from the Sulu hornbill (Anthracoceros montani) of the southernmost Philippine islands61 to the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila) that patrols the Atlantic Ocean. Some were wide-ranging, like the southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora), and others are thought to only survive in one location, like Stresemann's bristlefront (Merulaxis stresemanni). Unique species included scavengers, such as the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), nectarivores, such as the yellow-bellied sunbird-asity (Neodrepanis hypoxantha), vertivores, such as the Madagascar serpent-eagle (Eutriorchis astur) and frugivores, such as the bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis). A full list of the top 200 most unique threatened birds is given in Supplementary Dataset 2.

Previous studies have found that functionally unique species are more likely to be threatened with extinction than less functionally unique species30,62. We provide evidence that conservation strategies for birds should prioritize functionally unique species, as has been proposed for other taxonomic groups63,64. In addition to their inherent value, functionally unique species are more likely to be used by humans for food, material and medicine; therefore, preventing the extinction of functionally unique species could be important for the delivery of ecosystem services65. Effective targeted recovery programmes that explicitly consider species uniqueness hold great potential for conserving global functional diversity as a complementary strategy to threat abatement.

Both large-scale protection from the drivers of extinction and targeted species recovery programmes will be needed to prevent avian extinctions and functional diversity loss in the next 100 years. Although not effective at preventing all biodiversity loss, threat abatement is essential for ensuring that species that currently have healthy, stable populations do not fall into decline15. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that conservation policy should not focus solely on large-scale protection from the drivers of extinction, given that even in ambitious scenarios, only half of the projected species extinctions and functional diversity loss attributable to these drivers of extinction could be avoided.

Reducing the impact of different drivers of extinction protected distinct areas of functional trait space. Abatement of ‘habitat loss and degradation' made the greatest overall contribution to avoided species extinctions and functional diversity loss, but management of ‘hunting and collection' and ‘disturbance and accidental mortality' prevented greater functional diversity loss proportional to the number of species projected to become extinct. Given that different areas of functional trait space were impacted by different drivers, consideration and abatement of all drivers of extinction is necessary to conserve functional diversity.

When completely or partially abating the drivers of extinction, functional richness loss was correlated with species extinctions, so reducing species extinctions is projected to reduce functional diversity loss. However, targeted species recovery programmes that focus on functionally unique species hold great potential for the conservation of functional diversity, while requiring conservation of relatively few species. By conserving the top 100 most unique threatened species, it may be possible to prevent more than two-thirds of the projected functional diversity loss through avoiding ~37 species extinctions. Although prioritization of recovery programmes offers great potential for protecting functional diversity, the ethical questions about prioritizing some species over others and the risks of overlooking ecosystem functions and services provided by other species, whether known or unknown, must be considered. If human activity continues to affect biodiversity as it is today, we project that in the next 100 years, we will lose more than three times the number of bird species as have been lost since 1500. It is, therefore, urgent that we decide which dimensions of biodiversity we wish to protect, consolidate their measurement and include them in every stage of conservation planning, monitoring and impact assessment.

We used data on species morphological and geographical traits, threats and phylogenetic relationships to conduct this study. Trait data for 11,003 extant bird species66 were obtained from AVONET26. Under BirdLife taxonomy, only 8% of species in AVONET have imputed data for one or more traits, and <5% of species have imputed data for more than one trait. For all study species, data on threats were obtained in June 2022 from the IUCN Red List20 using the function rl_threats in the package rredlist67 in R68. Bird species are reassessed every 4 years, causing a slight possible delay between species decline or recovery and reported change in extinction risk category69. Taxonomic discrepancies between AVONET and IUCN (n = 141 species) were reconciled using the function rl_synonym. One-to-one matches were found for all species; therefore, these taxonomic differences did not impact the results.

A maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree was constructed from the first 1,000 trees in a previous publication70 based on the Hackett backbone70,71. The authors70 included 9,993 species in their analysis; we refer to the species nomenclature and taxonomic treatments adopted in this study as ‘BirdTree taxonomy'. To enable analysis of functional diversity loss while accounting for phylogenetic covariance between species, differences between the BirdLife66 and BirdTree70 taxonomies were reconciled using the crosswalk provided with AVONET26 (Supplementary Analyses). This gave 9,879 selected synonym matches between BirdLife and BirdTree (89.9% of BirdLife synonyms and 98.9% of BirdTree synonyms). Repeating analyses with all BirdLife synonyms and non-pPCA had a small impact on the percentage of projected species extinctions and functional diversity loss but did not affect our conclusions (Supplementary Fig. 6). Five species treated as Extinct in the Wild and one species listed as Extinct by IUCN20 but not listed as extinct in the AVONET crosswalk (Zosterops conspicillatus) were removed from the analysis, giving a total of 9,873 species.

Functional diversity quantifies the diversity of functional traits within an assemblage, defined as the measurable characteristics of an organism that influence its ecological niche72,73. We used 11 continuous morphological traits extracted from AVONET26, including body mass and linear measurements of beak, wing, tail and tarsus. These traits collectively capture bird ecological niches through their association with diet, dispersal and habitat25,26,27. Using continuous morphological traits enables more fine-grained discrimination between species sharing the same ecological groups, thus providing more in-depth information about ecological variation between species than categorical traits60. As life history traits are more useful for explaining variation in species response to human activity rather than the ecological impacts of decline26, they were not included in functional diversity estimations. Trait data were log10 transformed and scaled to unit variance.

We used pPCA to reduce dimensionality. PCA produces axes that are mathematically uncorrelated but may be phylogenetically correlated if species trait data are non-independent owing to shared evolutionary history74,75. pPCA accounts for phylogenetic correlation between axes by removing phylogenetic covariance and calculating major axes of non-phylogenetic residual variation75. pPCA was carried out using the phyl.pca function in phytools76 based on covariance and using lambda to obtain the correlation structure, which was optimized using restricted maximum likelihood. The first three pPCs described over 80% of the variance in the dataset (87.2%). Adding more pPCs described comparatively less variation (see scree plots, Extended Data Fig. 1). We therefore used the first three pPCs to summarize variation in the dataset. Using the first two or four pPCs instead, or using alternative ordination methods, did not affect our conclusions (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 9).

We calculated global functional richness for the whole assemblage (9,873 species) using trait probability densities28. Firstly, a multivariate Gaussian probability distribution was fitted for each species (Extended Data Fig. 3), in which means were provided by pPC values derived from functional trait data26 and standard deviations were estimated using a bandwidth selector (Hpi.diag function from package ks77). Next, we took the sum of species probability distributions to obtain the community trait probability density (Extended Data Fig. 3). This was implemented through the TPDsMean and TPDc functions in package TPD78, with 50 divisions for each pPC. We calculated functional richness using the REND function in package TPD.

To predict how threat reduction affected projected avian diversity loss, we constructed a model of species extinction risk (IUCN Red List category20) with threats as explanatory variables and accounting for spatial and phylogenetic covariance (referred to as ‘the extinction risk model'). The extinction risk model allowed us to quantify the independent contribution of each threat to extinction risk, while considering that many species were affected by multiple threats (1,978 species out of 2,104 Near Threatened and threatened species with threats listed) and comparatively few were affected by only one (126 out of 2,104 Near Threatened and threatened species with threats listed). Overlooking non-independence between threats can result in misleading findings about the relationship between threats and extinction risk as well as patterns of bias in the impacts of these drivers across species assemblages79. Species vulnerability to extinction, and threat prevalence (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1), may be affected by where species live or their evolutionary history, so species data are not independent of one another80. We included phylogeny and spatial variables as random effects to account for non-independence among species owing to non-random baseline extinction rates80, as well as other factors influencing extinction risk and recovery, such as small population size32, that are not caused by population decline resulting from listed past, ongoing or future threats.

The extinction risk model was fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo multivariate generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm), predicting extinction risk for species that were listed by the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered. Threats have been described for 99% of species in these categories. MCMCglmms were fitted using the R package MCMCglmm81. We used 39 pseudo-continuous fixed effects, describing the expected percentage population decline over a 10-year period or three generations (from threat scope and severity data; see details below and Extended Data Table 3) caused by each threat under the second-level classification described by the IUCN82 (for example, ‘1.1 Housing & Urban Areas' and ‘1.2 Commercial and Industrial Areas'). Threats that affected ten or fewer species were grouped with other threats (Supplementary Dataset 1).

Threats were assigned an expected population decline (over a 10-year period or three generations) based on their scope (percentage of species range affected by a threat) and severity, following previous publications43,83 (Extended Data Table 3). If multiple threats were listed for the same threat category under the second-order classification listed by the IUCN82, the maximum expected population decline was used. For example, Acrocephalus familiaris is experiencing slow, continuous declines owing to the invasive species Schistocerca nitens across most of its range, but it is also experiencing rapid declines caused by Oryctolagus cuniculus across the whole of its range. For ‘8.1 Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases', A. familiaris was assigned an expected population decline of 24%, associated with rapid declines across the whole of its range (Extended Data Table 3). We took the maximum expected population decline for second-order threats where multiple third-order threats were listed, as not all second-order threats had information on third-order threats, and without further information, it was difficult to estimate the expected population decline from multiple third-order threats. Only 16% of species–threat combinations had more than one third-order threat listed, and when running the extinction risk model using the sum of expected population decline rather than the maximum, we found that this had minimal impacts on projected species extinctions. Threats expected to cause no decline or negligible declines across a majority or minority of a species' range had an expected population decline of zero and were effectively discarded.

Across all species, 11.58% of threat data were missing scope or severity values. Missing scope and severity data were imputed with missForest imputation (implemented through the R package missForest84) from threat type, scope, severity and timing, and incorporating phylogenetic data through eigenvectors85. Removing a similar proportion of values from complete data on threat timing, scope and severity to test imputation accuracy gave a mean accuracy of 82.5% (Supplementary Analyses). A total of 48 rows were also missing data on timing (needed for creating extinction scenarios; see ‘Extinction scenarios' section of the Methods), and these data were imputed in the same way as scope and severity.

Phylogeny, minimum latitude, maximum latitude and centroid longitude were included in the model as random effects (Supplementary Analyses and Supplementary Fig. 1), where centroid longitude describes the longitude of the midpoint of species ranges. Spatial variables were obtained from AVONET and had been calculated from species' breeding and resident ranges, including areas where the species was coded as extant and either native or reintroduced26. Centroid latitude was not informative in explaining variation in extinction risk86 (Supplementary Fig. 1) and therefore was not included as a random effect. In total, 17 species with incomplete spatial information were excluded from the extinction risk model. Species with missing spatial information were either Possibly Extinct, had no known breeding or resident range, or their range data had been redacted to protect them from trafficking risk26. A total of 22 species had no threat data listed and were not included in the extinction risk model. The final model was fitted for the remaining threatened and Near Threatened species (n = 2,087).

For fixed effects, Cauchy-scaled Gelman priors were used (with an expected value of zero), as is recommended for ordinal regressions87. For phylogenetic random effects, we used a chi-squared prior (expected covariance of 1, degree of belief of 1,000, mean vector of 1 and covariance matrix of 1), as this best approximates a uniform distribution, giving an uninformative prior81,88,89. For spatial random effects, we used parameter-expanded priors (expected covariance of 1, degree of belief of 1, mean vector of 0 and covariance matrix of 625), as they are often less informative than the default inverse-Wishart prior90. As it is not possible to estimate the residual variance with an ordinal response variable (extinction risk), the residual variance was fixed to 1 following previous work90. The model was insensitive to alternative prior specification (Supplementary Figs. 10–14). MCMC chains were run for 103,000 iterations, with a burn-in of 3,000 iterations and sampling every 100 iterations. Model convergence was assessed by parameter traces produced through the plot function in package MCMCglmm81. Non-significant fixed effects were removed iteratively, removing the least significant fixed effect, rerunning the model and repeating until only significant fixed effects remained. Significance was assessed using the pseudo P value (PMCMC), estimated by MCMCglmm81. The pseudo P value is calculated as the probability that the posterior is greater or less than zero, whichever is smaller, multiplied by two91. A significance threshold of 0.1 was used, giving a one-tailed significance test that the posterior distribution overlaps with zero, rather than the default two-tailed test. The final model structure was:

where X1.2 is the expected percentage population decline (Extended Data Table 3) owing to IUCN second-order threat ‘1.2 Commercial and Industrial Areas' and so on. X10.1 grouped threat impacts from X10.1, X10.2 and X10.3, as each threat affected fewer than ten species (see Supplementary Dataset 1 for threat codes, threat descriptions and model parameter estimates). We expected most threats to have a positive posterior mean, indicating that species affected by these threats had higher extinction risk; however, ‘2.2 Wood and pulp plantations' and ‘10 Geological events' (including X10.1, X10.2 and X10.3) had a small, negative posterior mean. Our model estimates the independent contribution of each threat to extinction risk; therefore, although it may appear that wood and pulp plantations and geological events are contributing to decline when combined with other threats, our model suggests that, in general, species threatened by wood and pulp plantations and geological events have slightly lower extinction risk.

Model accuracy was assessed as the proportion of species for which the category listed by the IUCN20 matched the category that most frequently (across iterations) had the highest probability.

We used the extinction risk model to predict the probability that species belonged to each Red List category; then, using the expected probability of extinction for each Red List category, simulated extinctions that are likely to occur in the next 100 years. We used an approach explicitly incorporating uncertainty in model estimates and stochasticity in realized extinctions given extinction probabilities.

The extinction risk model returned 1,000 posterior estimates (1,000 iterations) of the probability that each species belonged to each extinction risk category (Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered). Posterior estimates were extracted from the model using the function predict2 from the postMCMCglmm package92. All Least Concern species and 39 Near Threatened or threatened species that were missing spatial or threat data (species not included in the extinction risk model) were assigned a probability of 1 of belonging to their Red List category as currently listed by the IUCN. Species classified as Data Deficient (n = 41) were conservatively assigned to the Least Concern category. For many classes, Data Deficient species are likely to be at higher risk of extinction than data-sufficient species93; however, this is not the case for birds94. Given that Data Deficient species make up a very small percentage of total species (0.4%), uncertainty over their extinction risk was expected to have a negligible impact on projected diversity loss.

An overall probability of extinction was then calculated for each species (equation 1):

where \({{ex}}_{p,s}\) is the probability of extinction in the next 100 years for species s according to the posterior estimation p; ex100c is the assigned probability of extinction in the next 100 years of a species in IUCN extinction risk category c; and \({{cat}}_{p,c,s}\) is the probability that species s belonged to IUCN extinction risk category c according to posterior estimation p or, for species not included in the extinction risk model, a probability of 1 for their Red List category as currently listed by the IUCN and a probability of 0 for all other Red List categories. Values of ex100c were based on previous work24,29,95 and set to 0.999 for Critically Endangered, 0.667 for Endangered, 0.1 for Vulnerable, 0.01 for Near Threatened and 0.0001 for Least Concern.

Estimates of \({{ex}}_{p,s}\) were converted to a binary outcome of extinct or extant using the R function sample, in which the probability of being assigned extinct was \({{ex}}_{p,s}\). For each scenario, we report the mean and standard deviation in the number of extinctions across 1,000 iterations as a percentage of the total number of species included in the study (9,873 species). Functional diversity loss was estimated by removing species projected to go extinct, calculating functional diversity across species predicted to be extant and comparing to the functional diversity of the full assemblage (9,873 species).

We estimated projected loss in species and functional diversity in the next 100 years under a baseline extinction scenario and three threat reduction scenarios: complete abatement, partial abatement and minimal abatement. Under the baseline scenario, we used the extinction risk model to predict the probability that species belonged to Red List categories, assuming that the impact of all threats remained as currently listed by IUCN20, following the method for predicting extinctions outlined above. Under the complete abatement scenario, predictions were obtained after setting the expected population decline to zero for all threats with a timing of ‘Ongoing', ‘Past, Likely to Return' and ‘Future'. The expected population decline of threats with a timing of ‘Past, Unlikely to Return' was retained as they cannot be prevented but could still contribute to extinction risk through extinction lags (although predictions were similar if expected population decline for these threats was set to zero; Supplementary Table 6). Under the partial abatement scenario, threat impacts were altered to simulate removal of threats across at least 50% of species ranges by reassigning expected population declines for threats with a scope of ‘Whole (>90%)' or ‘Majority (50–90%)' to the decline expected for a scope of ‘Minority (<50%)' (Extended Data Table 3). Under the minimal abatement scenario, threat impacts were altered to simulate the removal of threats across at least 10% of species ranges by reassigning expected population declines of threats with a scope of ‘Whole (>90%)' to expected decline for a scope of ‘Majority (50–90%)'. Least Concern species were not included in the extinction risk model, given that this is the lowest risk category and, by definition, could not show a reduction in extinction risk under abatement scenarios.

We used Cohen's D to quantify the effect size of the difference in means of diversity loss under each threat reduction scenario, divided by their pooled standard error. We do not report P values, as the sample size (number of iterations) could be increased easily, reducing standard error and giving significance even with very small differences in means, leading to type 1 errors.

To determine the bird morphologies with the greatest extinction risk, we plotted the loss in density of trait space occupation under the baseline scenario using trait probability densities. We constructed a community probability distribution by taking the sum of species probability distributions, in which each species probability distribution was given a weight between 0 and 1,000, and describing the number of iterations in which they did not go extinct under the baseline scenario. The resulting community probability distribution was rescaled to show absolute rather than relative change in the density of occupation of trait space. For each cell, we compared the density of occupation of the whole assemblage to the density of occupation in iterations of the baseline extinction scenario. The loss in density was calculated as a percentage of the density of trait space occupation in the full assemblage for which all species had a value of 1,000, indicating no extinction (Extended Data Fig. 4). Areas of trait space with high loss in density (approaching 100%) were predicted to have a high risk of extinction.

To determine the bird morphologies with the greatest reduction in extinction risk under complete abatement of all threats (protection in Extended Data Fig. 4), we plotted the density of trait space occupation under the complete abatement scenario using trait probability densities, whereby all species were given a weight according to the number of iterations in which extinction was avoided in the complete abatement relative to the baseline scenarios. We also plotted the loss in density of trait space occupation that was not avoided, as a proportion of density loss under complete abatement. For plotting loss in density under the baseline scenario, loss in density averted under the complete abatement scenario and loss in density not averted under the complete abatement scenario, pPCs were divided into 100 bins to provide high plot resolution. To facilitate visualization, this process was carried out in two dimensions (two pPCs at a time).

We aimed to assess the independent contribution of six major drivers of extinction to projected avian diversity loss. Threats in the extinction risk model were grouped into six ‘drivers of extinction': ‘habitat loss and degradation', ‘hunting and collection', ‘climate change and severe weather', ‘disturbance and accidental mortality', ‘invasive species and disease' and ‘pollution' (see Supplementary Dataset 1). Geological events and threats described as ‘other' were grouped into an ‘Other' category. Although these other threats were included in the model of extinction risk and their impact was accounted for when assessing the impact of all drivers of extinction together, we did not assess their impact individually.

We projected species and functional diversity loss under driver-specific complete abatement scenarios in which the impact of threats in a given driver of extinction with a timing of ‘Ongoing', ‘Past, Likely to Return' and ‘Future' were removed by setting their expected population decline to zero. The ‘maximum avoidable contribution' was calculated as the difference in predicted species and functional diversity loss between the baseline scenario and the driver-specific complete abatement scenario.

We used Cohen's D to quantify the effect size of the difference in means of diversity loss under the baseline and driver-specific complete abatement scenarios, divided by their pooled standard error. As before, P values were not reported.

To determine the severity of functional richness loss under a given driver of extinction in relation to the number of species projected to become extinct, we used a linear mixed-effects model to describe the functional richness loss avoided, using the number of species extinctions avoided and the driver of extinction (categorical) as explanatory variables. Model iteration was used as a random effect to account for non-independence in calculated differences in functional diversity loss and species extinctions from baseline to threat reduction scenarios. The dredge function from the MuMin package96 was used to identify the best model from all combinations of explanatory variables and an interaction between species extinctions and driver of extinction. The best model included the number of species extinctions avoided and the driver of extinction but not the interaction between species extinctions avoided and the driver of extinction.

We aimed to find whether abatement of different drivers of extinction could avoid extinction in different regions of trait space. We constructed a multi-response MCMCglmm with the three pPC values for each species as response variables (including all 9,873 species studied) and the number of iterations in which extinction was avoided under driver-specific complete abatement for each driver of extinction as explanatory variables, accounting for phylogenetic covariance. Pollution was not included, as a driver-specific complete abatement of pollution had a negligible impact on functional richness loss. The residual structure was allowed to vary for each response variable. Random effect priors were provided as a diagonal matrix, with an expected covariance between response variables of zero and expected variance within response variables of 1. The degree of belief parameter for the random effect prior was 2 (ref. 97). The expected value of fixed effects and the theta-scale parameter were zero, with a covariance matrix in which the expected covariance between fixed effects was zero and the expected variance within fixed effects was 1 × 1010. Posterior distributions were plotted, and a significance threshold of 5% overlap with zero was used (PMCMC = 0.1).

To identify the potential value of preventing the extinction of the most functionally unique threatened species, we calculated functional uniqueness for all species (Extended Data Fig. 7). For each species, we calculated the proportion of the density of the community probability distribution that was occupied by the species probability distribution for each grid cell in which the species probability density was greater than zero. We calculated the mean proportion for each species across grid cells in which the species probability distribution was greater than zero, giving greater weight to cells in which the species distribution had greater probability (higher density). The maximum uniqueness possible was 1, indicating that a particular species' probability distribution had no overlap with the probability distribution of any other species included in the analysis. Uniqueness tended towards a lower limit of zero, indicating that the species probability distribution had high overlap with many other species probability distributions, and many other species occupied the same area of trait space.

We then identified the most unique and threatened (listed as Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered) species as potential targets for action. We compared functional richness loss in the baseline scenario with functional richness loss when extinctions of the most unique threatened species were prevented. We explored the consequences of avoiding extinction for the top 40–200 most unique threatened species (in intervals of 20 species). A total of 1,000 posterior estimates were obtained for each extinction scenario.

Red dotted line indicates elbow after which adding additional phylogenetic principal components would explain little additional variance (n=9873 species).

Shown on 2-dimensional plane with respect to a, pPC1 and pPC2, and b, pPC2 and pPC3 with trait loadings (also see Supplementary Table 3). BD = beak depth, BLC = beak length (culmen), BLN = beak length (nares), BW =beak width, HWI = hand-wing index, KD = Kipp's distance, LL = tarsus length, M = body mass, S = first secondary length, TL = tail length, WL = wing length (n=9873 species). All silhouettes from Phylopic. Panel a left to right: Apteryx (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Mellisuga helenae (Steven Traver, CC0 1.0), Troglodytes hiemalis (Andy Wilson, CC0 1.0), Pteroptochos castaneus (Ferran Sayol, CCO 1.0), Pelecanoides urinatrix (Louis Ranjard, CC BY 3.0), Gallirallus australis (there was no silhouette of Atlantsia rogersi so a silhouette of Gallirallus australis was used instead, T. Michael Keesey, CC BY-SA 3.0), Spheniscus humboldti (Juan Carlos Jerí, CC0 1.0), Larus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Diomedeidae (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Struthio camelus (Darren Naish and T. Michael Keesey, CC BY 3.0), Buceros (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Leptoptilos javanicus (T. Michael Keesey, CC BY-SA 3.0). Panel b left to right: Apteryx (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Pelecanus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Ramphastidae (FJDegrange, CC0 1.0), Spheniscus humboldti (Juan Carlos Jerí, CC0 1.0), Mellisuga helenae (Steven Traver, CC0 1.0), Buceros (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Apus apus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Struthio camelus (Darren Naish and T. Michael Keesey, CC BY 3.0), Phasianus colchicus (Mattia Menchetti, CC0 1.0), Menura (T. Michael Keesey, CC0 1.0).

When species removal is biased with respect to species traits (principal component values) functional richness loss is greater. Shown in one dimension for simplicity, functional richness was calculated in three-dimensional trait space composed of the first three phylogenetic principal components.

Loss in density of morphospace was calculated using the baseline extinction scenario, and averted loss in density of morphospace was calculated using the complete abatement scenario.

Plotted for a) pPC1 and pPC2, and b) pPC2 and pPC3. Grey shows areas where no functional diversity loss was projected, or where no functional diversity loss was avoided under complete abatement (only three pixels in panel a and two pixels in panel b). Analyses based on 9873 species (of which 2087 species currently listed as Near Threatened or in threatened categories were modelled and could have reduced extinction risk in the abatement scenarios). 1000 iterations were run for each extinction scenario. All silhouettes from Phylopic. Panel a left to right: Apteryx (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Mellisuga helenae (Steven Traver, CC0 1.0), Troglodytes hiemalis (Andy Wilson, CC0 1.0), Pteroptochos castaneus (Ferran Sayol, CCO 1.0), Atlantisia rogersi (there was no silhouette of Atlantsia rogersi so a silhouette of Gallirallus australis was used instead, T. Michael Keesey and HuttyMcphoo, CC BY-SA 3.0), Pelecanoides urinatrix (Louis Ranjard, CC BY 3.0), Spheniscus humboldti (Juan Carlos Jerí, CC0 1.0), Larus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Diomedeidae (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Struthio camelus (Darren Naish and T. Michael Keesey, CC BY 3.0), Buceros (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Leptoptilos javanicus (T. Michael Keesey and Vaibhavcho, CC BY-SA 3.0). Panel b left to right: Apteryx (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Pelecanus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Ramphastidae (Federico Degrange, CC0 1.0), Spheniscus humboldti (Juan Carlos Jerí, CC0 1.0), Mellisuga helenae (Steven Traver, CC0 1.0), Buceros (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Apus apus (Ferran Sayol, CC0 1.0), Phasianus colchicus (Mattia Menchetti, CC0 1.0), Menura (T. Michael Keesey, CC0 1.0), Struthio camelus (Darren Naish and T. Michael Keesey, CC BY 3.0).

a, Number of species extinctions avoided under driver-specific complete abatement against functional richness loss avoided (% of functional richness of full assemblage) as described by a linear mixed effects model including number of species extinctions avoided and driver of extinction as fixed effects, and iteration number as a random effect. b, Intercepts of linear mixed effect model of number of species extinctions avoided against functional richness loss for each driver of extinction showing the proportional impact of each direct driver of extinction given the number of species extinctions. Habitat = habitat loss and degradation, Hunting = hunting and collection, Climate= climate change and severe weather, Invasive = invasive species and disease, Disturbance = disturbance and accidental mortality. Pollution was not included as it made a negligible contribution to functional richness loss (see Extended Data Table 3) (n = 5000, 1000 iterations for each extinction scenario).

Functional uniqueness describes the proportion of the community probability distribution that was composed of the species probability distribution. Proportions were summed across cells in which the species probability distribution was greater than 0, with a weight proportional to the probability of species occurrence in that cell, indicated by the height of the species probability distribution.

The von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL) is an E3 ligase substrate receptor that binds proline-hydroxylated hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1α, leading to its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. By using protein arrays, we identified a small molecule that binds the HIF1α-binding pocket on pVHL and functions as a molecular glue degrader of the neosubstrate cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1) by recruiting it into the VHL–Cullin–RING E3 ligase complex and leading to its selective degradation. The CDO1-binding region involved in VHL recruitment was characterized through a combination of mutagenesis and protein–protein docking coupled with molecular-dynamics-based solvation analysis. The X-ray structure of the ternary complexes of VHL, CDO1 and degrader molecules confirms the binding region prediction and provides atomic insights into key molecular glue interactions.

New research has cast doubts over suggestions an incestuous social elite ruled over the ancient people of Ireland more than 5,000 years ago.

Researchers examined the evidence from burials of individuals at the Newgrange prehistoric monument in Ireland -- a large circular mound containing a chamber where cremated and unburnt human remains were placed, the discovery of which led to speculation that those buried there must have been from an elite class or a royal family.

In 2020, the DNA analysis of a bone skull fragment found in the chamber, however, suggested that at least one of the individuals buried there was the result of a relationship between two siblings or a parent and child, and was also distantly related to others buried in the chamber.

It is believed that only particular individuals were buried in the chamber and therefore they must have held a 'special' position in society. The assumption was that if an individual born of incest was placed in the chamber, that this practice must have been 'accepted' by society, possibly because it was 'common' among a ruling elite.

A research team, including the University of York and University College Dublin, however, have now shown that there is no corroborating evidence in nearby settlements, dietary practices, or trade, that an elite existed either economically or socially.

Researchers now believe the society at the time was more equal, based on the fact that they appeared to share and exchange resources, as well as live in similar dwellings.

Professor Penny Bickle from the University of York's Department of Archaeology, said: "The evidence all points to a much more collective ethos. There are not wide disparities in diet, houses are relatively flimsy, and all similar to each other.

"There are no large settlement systems or trade mechanisms, and we also don't see production of craft on the scale that we see in other ancient societies such as in Ancient Egypt, where incest was thought to be practiced by the ruling elite.

"We can only begin to understand these monuments and tombs if we examine the social lives or the communities that built and use them, and when we start to do this, this idea of a 'social elite' or a form of royalty starts to appear less likely."

Older than Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza, Newgrange is believed to have been built by a farming community that prospered in the Boyne Valley, County Meath, some 5,000 years ago. Newgrange was rediscovered in AD 1699 and its interior had been heavily disturbed prior to its modern excavation in the 1960s, and so researchers question whether this was even the original burial place of the skull fragment, referred to as NG10, dated to 3340 -- 3020 BC.

The genetic clustering in passage tombs, such as at Newgrange, typically reflects very distant biological relationships -- like second cousins or great-great-great-grandparents -- rather than close familial ties. To establish if the tombs were reserved for an elite, researchers say they would expect much closer genetic ties than they have seen at Newgrange.

It is more likely that these tombs were places that reflect family, work, and other social relationships, rather than the mark of an elite family group.

Associate Professor Jessica Smyth, from University College Dublin, said: "People were definitely being selected for burial in passage tombs -- the whole community does not end up in these monuments. However, we don't know the reasons behind this selection, and why they were thought to be special.

"Unlike today, bodies don't tend to be buried 'whole' or 'intact' in this time period. Before they end up in megalithic monuments, bodies are broken down, sometimes cremated and even circulated around their communities."

As so many of the dead found in these passage tombs were broken down and mixed with cremated remains, and possibly moved around to different places in the landscape, it is not clear the people who placed NG10 fragment in Newgrange knew who they were in life or who the parents of this individual were, casting further doubt on how 'special' the individual might have been.

Professor Penny Bickle said: "It is by no means clear that the monument was the first burial site of NG10 and the tomb grew in stages, so tracing who this individual was is a very difficult task indeed. As it stands the incestuous origins of NG10 is a one-off compared to all of the DNA data we have for Neolithic Ireland.

"There are still many questions to solve here, but building this picture means looking at the monument together with the society that was built up around it, and from this, we get a step closer to understanding a community that was much more inclusive and equal than previously thought."

The research is published in the journal Antiquity.

Google Chrome's web browser for Android devices is finally catching up to the notable design change that Safari made with the 2021 introduction of iOS 15: It's offering a way to move the address bar to the bottom of the screen.

The company announced on Tuesday that the latest version of its Chrome for Android browser will now allow users who prefer the modernized experience, designed to be easier to use on mobile devices, to set their address bar at the bottom of their screen instead of the top. The feature was previously available on Chrome for iOS, following Apple's lead in the space.

Having learned from Apple's prior challenges, Google is not forcing the change on all its users, however. Instead, it's adding a new feature that lets users configure the address bar's location to their liking.

To move the address bar to the bottom of the screen, long-press on the bar and then select the option to move it to the bottom. You can also configure the location of the address bar in Chrome's Settings menu.

Users often prefer this option, as it places the address bar closer to where they're holding their phone, allowing them to type more comfortably.

When Apple first rolled out the update, some users rebelled against the change, complaining that the placement of the bar, which initially floated atop the page's content, was problematic as it made some websites nearly unusable. The bar would block out various elements that users needed to tap on, they said, which required them to swipe the bar down and out of the way. Others simply didn't like the change.

In response to user feedback, Apple moved the bar to the bottom, below the page content, and made it an optional choice as opposed to the default.

Google is approaching the design update in the same way by allowing users to make the decision. 

The company said the feature will begin to appear on Android devices starting today and will roll out to all users over the weeks ahead.

It can report real and frame generated FPS at the same time

Steam's new in-game overlay performance monitor is in a public beta, allowing users to see the real FPS, including with DLSS and FSR frame generation, and today I'll show you how to install and configure it. On my Steam Deck and recent Linux gaming PC experiment, I use MangoHud to display live performance stats while I play; in fact, a version of it comes ready to go on Steam Deck. But there is a new means to monitor your performance, and it comes directly from Valve.First, what fresh features does this new monitor bring to the table? As you would expect, it reports the same as every other performance monitor:

But with Steam's new in-game performance monitor, we can also see when DLSS / FSR frame generation has been enabled. Yes, the new Steam performance monitor can detect frame generation technologies and provide us with both the DLSS/FSR framegen-enhanced FPS and the baseline FPS in one-second intervals. With this, we can see, at a glance, the FPS boost provided by frame generation. If we are not using any form for frame generation, then we only see one set of FPS values. If frame generation is in use, we get both sets of FPS counters.

Does the new performance monitor work in Linux? Yes, it does! I just tested it with my Bazzite setup, currently in the lounge, ready for a quick gaming session. So, how can you get this working with your setup? I've detailed all the steps that you will need to do to get this working on your Windows and Linux gaming PC.

1. Click on Steam and Settings.



2. Click on Interface and under Client Beta Participation select “Steam Beta Update”.



3. Restart Steam for the change to take effect.



4. Click on Steam and Settings.

5. Scroll down to “In Game” and the right side of the window will update.



6. Scroll down the In Game section to Overlay Performance Monitor and select Show performance monitor. Change the drop down value to your requirement. I chose the top left of the screen.



7. Under Performance detail level, select your required level of detail. I chose to show everything!



8. Unless you are blessed with excellent eyesight. Change the text scaling level and the background opacity. The further up the scale, the larger the text, the darker the background.



9. Close the window and start your chosen game. The new performance overlay will appear.



Why did I mention changing the text scaling level? Because on my first go, the text was incredibly hard to read!

Firm explains that a combination of cushioned ABS shell and internal metal frame makes this device its toughest Mini PC yet. But don't try this at home.

Mini PC specialist Geekom has shared a video which shows its latest IT15 model being subjected to unnatural levels of violence. We are accustomed to seeing devices, particularly portable ones, being dropped, crushed, and splashed as part of standard endurance testing. However, this cute little machine, packing up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 Processor 285H processor, endures torture like being spun in a washing machine, being hit by a sledgehammer, extremes of heat and cold, and the indignity of being dragged along the road by a motorbike. The PC survives intact, but with a few grazes, and we see it boot up at the end of the video.

Expand the tweet above to see the video. At the start of the video, the Geekom IT15 is inexplicably carried in a reinforced aluminum flight case, lulling it into a false sense of security, perhaps. Then the horror begins.

A 1.8-ton car runs over the little 0.46-liter NUC-style device at least twice. It is then hung up by a thread and walloped with a baseball bat. Geekom's digital assassins were intent on whacking the IT15 some more, so they also sledgehammered it as it sat beneath two concrete blocks.

The punishment continued as the IT15 torturers decided to drag the little machine along a tarmac road, pulled by a motorbike at high speed. Just when you think it might end, seeing the device being carried carefully on top of a stack of books, it gets “dropped from height” down concrete steps. Someone in the Geekom team seemed to have then remembered that tests of devices enduring cold and heat were typical ruggedness assessment fare, so we saw the device chilled by sub-zero gases and then subjected to a blowtorch.

After such rough treatment, the IT15 might be due a clean, right? But throwing a mini PC in a washing machine for a “violent spin” probably isn't advisable – so they did just that. It was a dry wash program, and not for too long, though.

At last, the pummelling of the Geekom IT15 does actually come to an end, and we get a close-up of all its battle scars. Your local used mobile phone emporium might refer to this as ‘Condition A minus.' After taking it from the washer and plugging it into power and a monitor, the IT15 appears to have weathered all the abuse without affecting its computing ability. The probably inadvisable penultimate caption of the video proudly declares, “It just won't break,” which some will see as a challenge.

We reached out to Geekom regarding its extreme testing of the IT15 to ensure it was genuine. Our contact insisted that the video showed “serious testing,” and that a lot of the product's rugged nature is due to the ABS shell, which is “cushioned and, together with the sturdy internal metal frame, is particularly robust.” Actually, the firm's official product pages include some durability claims, such as the device being able to “withstand 200kg of force without deformation,” and the all-metal frame and base adding to its strength.

Beyond being tough, other notable specs of the IT15 include the device's compact size, and its decent expandability options (an extra M.2 2242 SSD slot, and room for a 2.5-inch SATA drive), plus it offers a broad selection of modern ports for its size.

Geekom's recently launched IT15 is currently available direct, or from its Amazon store. We note that there's a $200 coupon available on Amazon US at the time of writing, which brings the top Intel Core Ultra9 285H, 32GB RAM, plus 2TB SSD storage configuration down to $999.

Anthropic has scored a major victory in an ongoing legal battle over artificial intelligence models and copyright, one that may reverberate across the dozens of other AI copyright lawsuits winding through the legal system in the United States. A court has determined that it was legal for Anthropic to train its AI tools on copyrighted works, arguing that the behavior is shielded by the “fair use” doctrine, which allows for unauthorized use of copyrighted materials under certain conditions.

“The training use was a fair use,” senior district judge William Alsup wrote in a summary judgment order released late Monday evening. In copyright law, one of the main ways courts determine whether using copyrighted works without permission is fair use is to examine whether the use was “transformative,” which means that it is not a substitute for the original work but rather something new. “The technology at issue was among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,” Alsup wrote.

“This is the first major ruling in a generative AI copyright case to address fair use in detail,” says Chris Mammen, a managing partner at Womble Bond Dickinson who focuses on intellectual property law. “Judge Alsup found that training an LLM is transformative use—even when there is significant memorization. He specifically rejected the argument that what humans do when reading and memorizing is different in kind from what computers do when training an LLM.”

The case, a class action lawsuit brought by book authors who alleged that Anthropic had violated their copyright by using their works without permission, was first filed in August 2024 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.

Anthropic is the first artificial intelligence company to win this kind of battle, but the victory comes with a large asterisk attached. While Alsup found that Anthropic's training was fair use, he ruled that the authors could take Anthropic to trial over pirating their works.

While Anthropic eventually shifted to training on purchased copies of the books, it had nevertheless first collected and maintained an enormous library of pirated materials. “Anthropic downloaded over seven million pirated copies of books, paid nothing, and kept these pirated copies in its library even after deciding it would not use them to train its AI (at all or ever again). Authors argue Anthropic should have paid for these pirated library copies. This order agrees,” Alsup writes.

“We will have a trial on the pirated copies used to create Anthropic's central library and the resulting damages,” the order concludes.

Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment.

The lawsuit, Bartz v. Anthropic, was first filed less than a year ago; Anthropic asked for summary judgment on the fair use issue in February. It's notable that Alsup has far more experience with fair use questions than the average federal judge, as he presided over the initial trial in Google v. Oracle, a landmark case about tech and copyright that eventually went before the Supreme Court.

Prior to this, there had only been one summary judgment decision issued in an AI copyright case. In Thomson Reuters v. Ross, a judge found that the AI startup Ross's training on materials from the Thomson Reuters-owned legal research firm Westlaw was not fair use—but that case is already headed to an appeals court. In almost all of the ongoing copyright lawsuits, the AI company defendants are attempting to lay out “fair use” arguments, so Alsup's decision will almost certainly play a large role in how these cases are argued going forward, especially cases where piracy isn't a factor. Fair use advocates are already celebrating this as a win.

“Judge Alsup's ruling should be a model for other courts assessing whether Gen AI training on copyrighted material is fair use,” says Adam Eisgrau, the senior director of AI, Creativity, and Copyright Policy at the tech trade group Chamber of Progress. “He found it is clearly transformative and affirmed that the purpose of copyright is to promote competition and creativity, not protect monopoly revenue streams.”

Still, this is in many respects a truly split ruling, as Alsup heavily emphasized within the summary judgment that piracy was not legally excusable. “The downloaded pirated copies used to build a central library were not justified by a fair use,” he writes. “Every factor points against fair use.”

During the discovery process of the lawsuit, Judge Alsup learned that Anthropic relied partially on downloading vast amounts of materials from pirated databases like Books3 to amass books to train AI tools like Claude. He offers details into the process in the summary judgment, noting that Anthropic cofounder Ben Mann downloaded the entirety of Books3 back in winter 2021, and didn't stop there: “Anthropic's next pirated acquisitions involved downloading distributed, reshared copies of other pirate libraries. In June 2021, Mann downloaded in this way at least five million copies of books from Library Genesis, or LibGen, which he knew had been pirated. And, in July 2022, Anthropic likewise downloaded at least two million copies of books from the Pirate Library Mirror, or PiLiMi, which Anthropic knew had been pirated,” Alsup writes.

Anthropic is not the only AI company accused of piracy in AI copyright lawsuits. In Kadrey v. Meta, another hotly contested copyright lawsuit brought by authors, plaintiffs' lawyers have forcefully argued that Meta's acquisition of books from pirate libraries like LibGen was not legal nor shielded by the fair use doctrine.

The lowest statutory damage for this type of copyright infringement is $750 per book, and Alsup notes that Anthropic's pirate library consisted of at least 7 million books, which means Anthropic faces billions in potential court-imposed penalties. There is no trial date set yet.

Gaming GPU suffers from an identity crisis.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and Radeon RX 9070 XT are two of the best graphics cards currently available on the market. However, Redditor Fantastic-Ad8410 has been blessed with a Frankenstein AMD Radeon GeForce RTX 9070 XT, combining the best of both worlds.

The Redditor was experiencing problems with his Asus TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition graphics card, leading him to return it to Micro Center for a replacement. Although the replacement GPU's packaging is labeled for the Asus TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition, the actual card inside features a shroud marked with both AMD Radeon and GeForce RTX branding. This unusual hardware issue appears to be a manufacturing mistake by Asus, directly stemming from the company's production line.

Manufacturers often reuse designs across different graphics cards to save time and resources, especially within the same sub-brand. The TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition and TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition belong to the same TUF Gaming lineup, so it's normal that both models share identical designs. The TDPs for the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (300W) and Radeon RX 9070 XT (304W) are very similar, allowing Asus to use the same TUF Gaming cooler responsibly to cool both graphics cards adequately.

Essentially, the AMD Radeon GeForce RTX 9070 XT combines the backplate of the TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition with the top fan shroud of the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition. In the Redditor's case, a factory mix-up likely occurred, with an unattentive employee grabbing the wrong part.

It is not the first time Asus has experienced an assembly mistake. About a month ago, Redditor Blood-Wolfe purchased a TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition, but received a graphics card with a Radeon-branded top fan shroud instead. It suggests such errors are relatively common with Asus TUF Gaming graphics cards.

Unfortunately, the AMD Radeon GeForce RTX 9070 XT will perform identically to the Radeon RX 9070 XT, as the issue is purely cosmetic. The Reddit user is considering whether to return the graphics card. Although it doesn't hold the same value as a misprinted banknote or trading card, it remains a very unique sample (one of two known cases), and perhaps a dedicated collector might be interested in buying it in the future.

Meanwhile, Reddit users humorously suggest that the two owners should meet and swap shrouds. Jokes aside, at least this was a human mistake at the assembly line, and both owners received genuine graphics cards, unlike one unlucky victim involved in an assembly line theft who was given a pile of backpacks inside a sealed box instead of a GeForce RTX 5090.

Science fiction becomes reality.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


This super tiny drone, put together by a team from China's National Defense University of Science and Technology, is akin to something out of a spy movie. The team, based in Hunan Province, China, recently shared a new drone they have developed, which is small enough to fit between your fingers. It's as small as a mosquito, and it looks like one, too.

This pesky little spy device first buzzed on our radar shortly after its debut on CCTV state TV channel CCTV 7. This was picked up by the South China Morning Post, which highlighted Liang Hexiang, a student, showing off the tiny drone by holding it in between his fingers. This tiny mosquito-sized drone was designed specifically to help with information reconnaissance, essentially making it a spy drone.

There are several iterations of the design, but we get a good look at two in particular. Both have a long body with wings attached. One has just two wings, while the other has four and is controllable using mobile devices, such as a smartphone. It's not clear exactly what hardware is onboard and what sort of data it can collect, but it's safe to say the hardware is incredibly small and likely limited in capacity.

Remote technology like this isn't just used for spy-related tasks. They can also be resourceful tools for recovering people and equipment from dangerous areas without risking additional bodies. Drones like the ones featured here can be highly flexible and useful in various military applications.

Another key component in using remote devices like these is power. The unit needs to have enough charge to perform its task and bring itself back, or otherwise transmit the data it recorded before it completely dies. So far, there is no confirmation that the Chinese military is actually using these in the field. It appears to be a research project at this time.

If the thought of an extra tiny mosquito drone piques your interest, you should check out this custom 3D-printed winged VTOL drone. Both of these projects demonstrate how a little ingenuity can result in an incredible final design.

Whether biking with mates, sunbathing at the beach or relaxing on your balcony, a good wireless speaker is your best friend. Every year, when the temperatures go up, so does demand for these convenient devices with sales peaking just before summer kicks in. Among all models available, there's one that always stays in front: the Anker Soundcore 2 portable Bluetooth speaker. And it is currently the #1 best-selling portable Bluetooth speaker on Amazon.

The Anker speaker currently retails at an all-time low of $29, which is a whopping 26% off its standard list price of $40. The price point is hard to beat for a device that has already won over more than 20 million people worldwide and holds a stellar 4.6 out of 5 stars from over 133,000 customer reviews.

See at Amazon

This speaker has 12 watts of total output power so your music will sound loud and clear indoors or outdoors. The 70 Hz frequency response provides that even deeper bass notes sound astonishingly clear particularly when combined with Anker's proprietary BassUp technology. This feature is combined with a patented spiral bass port and boosts low frequencies for a punchier sound on your favorite songs.

With its IPX7 waterproof protection, this speaker is resistant to rain, dust, snow, and even accidental spills. You can take it to the beach, pool or on a hiking trip without worrying about water damage.

But our favorite part is the battery life: It can play for a massive 24 hours of continuous music, far outlasting most of the other speakers on the market. This means that you can use it all day long and all night without needing to constantly find an outlet. The speaker also has wireless stereo pairing as a preference, meaning that if you have two newer Soundcore 2 speakers, you can pair them to one source for a bigger and more immersive stereo sound.

At this price point, no wonder this speaker remains at the head of the top-seller lists year after year.

Federal judge William Alsup ruled that it was legal for Anthropic to train its AI models on published books without the authors' permission. This marks the first time that the courts have given credence to AI companies' claim that fair use doctrine can absolve AI companies from fault when they use copyrighted materials to train large language models (LLMs).

This decision comes as a blow to authors, artists, and publishers who have brought dozens of lawsuits against companies like OpenAI, Meta, Midjourney, Google, and more. While the ruling is not a guarantee that other judges will follow Judge Alsup's lead, it lays the foundation for courts to side with tech companies over creatives.

These lawsuits often depend on how a judge interprets fair use doctrine, a notoriously finicky carve-out of copyright law that hasn't been updated since 1976 — a time before the internet, let alone the concept of generative AI training sets.

Fair use rulings take into account what the work is being used for (parody and education can be viable), whether it's being reproduced for commercial gain (you can write “Star Wars” fan fiction, but you can't sell it), and how transformative a derivative work is from the original.

Companies like Meta have made similar fair use arguments in defense of training on copyrighted works, though before this week's decision, it was less clear how the courts would sway.

In this particular case, Bartz v. Anthropic, the group of plaintiff authors also brought into question the manner in which Anthropic attained and stored their works. According to the lawsuit, Anthropic sought to create a “central library” of “all the books in the world” to keep “forever.” But millions of these copyrighted books were downloaded for free from pirate sites, which is unambiguously illegal.

While the judge granted that Anthropic's training of these materials was a fair use, the court will hold a trial about the nature of the “central library.”

“We will have a trial on the pirated copies used to create Anthropic's central library and the resulting damages,” Judge Alsup wrote in the decision. “That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages.”

There was a lot to love about X-Men '97‘s continuation and evolution of the iconic X-Men: The Animated Series when its first season rolled out last year, but perhaps one of the best was the reminder to X-fans who's primary experience with the character had been in adaptation, rather than in the comics, that Cyclops has always been one of the best X-Men characters. Marrying people's memories of Scott from the original show with the huge development the character underwent throughout the 21st century was a key part of updating him for X-Men '97–and now you can get some insight as to how it all happened in the series' expansive new artbook.

See at Amazon

Published by Abrams and written by James Field, X-Men '97: The Art and Making of the Animated Series dives into the early days of Marvel Television's decision to revive one of its most legendary cartoon series for a modern age. Featuring insight from creatives at every level of making the series, from head of Marvel TV Brad Winderbaum to artists and producers, the book also includes hundreds of new, never-before-seen concept art, storyboards, and early design concepts for how the team updated the '90s aesthetic of the show, while incorporating elements of comics designs and evolutions from across the X-Men's entire history.

It's a perfect pickup for anyone who's in the long haul waiting for the show's highly anticipated second season, but for now, io9 has an exclusive first look inside the book for you to check out below, with insight on the earliest days of bringing X-Men '97 to life, as well as an exclusive look at the book's section on Cyclops. Want to learn just how long it took to get Scott's optic-blast-fuelled superhero landing right? Look no further!

X-Men '97: The Art and Making of the Animated Series hits shelves July 1, and is available to preorder now.

Noctua's next-generation NF-A12x25 G2 120mm fans are finally available for purchase. The latest high-performance fans are available on Amazon for $34.90 each or $64.90 for a twin pack. A follow-up to the original NF-A12x25 fans, which launched back in 2018, the second-generation model made its first appearance at this year's Computex trade expo as part of a collaboration with Asus. The two companies jointly launched the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition GPU, which featured three NF-A12x25 G2 fans.

Noctua NF-A12x25 G2: Available at Amazon for $34.90The second-gen NF-A12x25 120mm fans from Noctua are currently available for purchase on Amazon.



The new NF-A12x25 G2 is essentially a smaller version of the NF-A14x25 G2 140mm fans, which debuted last year. Noctua continues to use its patented Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) for the fan construction, which is said to offer high tensile strength and low thermal expansion characteristics compared to traditional thermoplastics. Apart from the redesigned fan blades, the fan hub has also been optimized with a special pattern allowing the G2 to offer better airflow performance compared to the original NF-A12x25.

The fan is available in three versions: a standard PWM model with speeds of up to 1800 RPM, an ultra-quiet LS-PWM model that tops out at 1100 RPM, and an Sx2-PP set that includes two fans. The two fans in the set are intentionally offset by 50 RPM, a design choice that is said to improve push-pull performance and help reduce acoustic interference when multiple fans operate side by side.

According to the company, the new NF-A12x25 G2 fans can be used in a range of scenarios, including general case ventilation and more demanding tasks, such as cooling heatsinks or water cooling radiators. In internal testing, Noctua reports that the G2 model performed 3.5°C better than the original NF-A12x25 at a 200W heat load on a 120x49 mm radiator, with both fans operating at similar noise levels. When tested with the NH-U12A heatsink under the same thermal load, the G2 offered a modest improvement of about 1°C under identical acoustic conditions.

Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 PWM Sx2-PP: Available at Amazon for $64.90

The Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 120mm fans can be purchased as set of two which saves $4.90. The set is currently available on Amazon. 

In case airflow scenarios, the G2 fan is said to deliver around 9% more airflow than its predecessor at the same pressure drop. Additionally, the updated model can operate approximately 1.5 to 3.5dB quieter in certain conditions while maintaining comparable thermal performance, particularly when used on radiators.

These new fans come with a variety of accessories including pre-installed anti-vibration pads, an anti-vibration gasket for a tighter seal on radiators, mounting screws, anti-vibration rubber mounts, a PWM Y-splitter cable, a PWM extension cable, and a low-noise adapter cable. Noctua will also offer a six-year warranty on its new NF-A12x25 G2. The company has plans to launch an all-black ‘Chromax' version of the fan, which is expected to happen next year.

If you own a PC or a Mac, you might catch yourself longing for additional screen real estate, especially if your laptop has only a 13-, 15-, or 17-inch display. Doubling your screen area or expanding your workspace without lugging around a big traditional monitor can prove to be quite a hurdle.

Luckily, the introduction of ultra-portable lightweight monitors has made this easier than ever before and the devices are quickly becoming an Amazon bestseller. The KYY portable 15-inch monitor, for example, has sold over 10,000 units in less than a month.

You can now get this portable monitor for just $69, down from its normal price of $130. That's a 46% discount and an all-time low for this model on Amazon.

See at Amazon

KYY portable monitor is a 15.6-inch Full HD 1920×1080 screen that offers excellent and clear images thanks to its high-quality IPS display. The monitor features a 178-degree wide viewing angle which ensures that you get precise color and clear details from just about any direction. HDR technology enhances the image quality, and films look rich and immersive. The display also features blue light reduction and a flicker-free display.

It features two USB Type-C ports and a Mini-HDMI port which makes it extremely easy to connect with any number of devices. As long as your laptop, smartphone, or gaming console has Thunderbolt 3, USB Type-C, or HDMI, the KYY monitor will be compatible. It supports most PCs (Windows 11 Pro and older), Macs, phones, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

What's great is that this monitor is just 0.3 inches thick and weighs only 1.7 pounds so it fits easily into any bag. Whether you're traveling or setting up a temporary office, this monitor is easy to carry and quick to set up. No drivers are required: just plug it in and you're ready to go. The screen also has two built-in stereo speakers and a 3.5mm audio port so that you can enjoy your favorite videos or music without the need for any external accessories.

If you want a bigger screen for your laptop (or phone, or console), this monitor delivers excellent value and performance.

Amazon announced on Tuesday that it is expanding its Same-Day and Next-Day delivery services to over 4,000 small cities and towns across rural U.S. This expansion will bring its fast Prime delivery service to millions of customers in places such as Asbury, Iowa; Fort Seneca, Ohio; Lewes, Delaware; North Padre Island, Texas; and Sharptown, Maryland.

The e-commerce giant plans to invest more than $4 billion to triple the size of its delivery network by 2026. Amazon has recognized a growing demand for faster delivery from rural customers, who often have limited options when shopping online.

By increasing its investment in Same-Day and Next-Day delivery, the company aims to create more jobs in rural communities, with an estimated 170 positions at delivery stations, along with additional driving opportunities.

Amazon also reported that the number of items delivered the same day or the next day in the U.S. has increased by over 30% compared to the same period last year. In 2024 alone, the company delivered more than 9 billion items using the faster delivery services.

This announcement comes as Amazon prepares for its Prime Day event, which will last 96 hours from July 8 to July 11.

Microsoft wants everything to be an Xbox, but the problem with its ongoing ambition to rebrand every gaming-capable device as a pseudo gaming console is so few devices look like an Xbox. The next step on Microsoft's wacky, winding road to regaining hardware supremacy is a $400 bundle that includes a Meta Quest headset with a unique colorway, an Xbox controller, and a few months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for game streaming. If you were looking to dip your toe into VR, the $300 Quest 3S is still your best option, and the bundle adds enough to make it worth the extra Benjamin. Just know that the Quest 3S' displays don't offer everything you truly want for a big picture VR gaming experience.

Meta first hinted at a Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition in 2023, around the time it offered users a native Xbox app for Meta Quest to enable easier game streaming. The $400 Xbox Edition Quest 3S doesn't let you play any of your Xbox games natively. All it truly provides is access to Microsoft's streaming service, an extra Xbox controller, and the ergonomic Elite Strap that may help you game for longer without suffering a potential bout of neck strain.

Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition

The Xbox edition bundle is a great deal, plus the headset looks better in black. You just won't have the best displays for game streaming.

Pros

Cons

Microsoft and Meta opting for the Quest 3S rather than the Quest 3 makes the bundle cheaper, but it's less effective for game streaming. I've become very intimate with the Quest 3S since it hit the scene last year, and it's what I usually suggest to anybody who wants to try VR without breaking the bank. However, the $500 Quest 3 has a wider, 110-degree horizontal FOV (field of view) compared to the 3S at 96 degrees. The more expensive headset also uses better-looking pancake lenses compared to the older and lesser-quality Fresnel lenses on what's normally a $300 headset. While they both have the same internal specs and performance, there's a clear visual quality difference between both VR headsets. If you were planning to buy a VR device mainly to do game streaming on a giant, virtual display, I would normally suggest you go for the one that will help your games look their best.

The Quest 3S lenses are equivalent to what was on the Quest 2, and the resulting image quality is slightly more grainy than what you get on a Quest 3. The Fresnel lenses combined with limited FOV can result in blurred images around the periphery of the display. This can make some text on notes in a game like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nearly indecipherable unless you're directly looking at that memento directly in front of you and from close up. It's not unplayable, but it could make some games potentially annoying.

While Game Pass is easily one of the best game streaming services available, the Quest 3S makes streaming pitfalls a little harder to navigate. Chief among them is lag. Games on Quest stream at 1,920×1,080 resolution, and Xbox Cloud Gaming suggests you have at least 20 Mbps internet speeds and a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. Anything less, and you'll experience input lag and blurred visuals. On the Quest 3S screens, any loss of visual clarity is so glaring that normally beautiful titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 appear like a pixelated mosaic. Speaking of Clair Obscur, you need very stable gameplay to hit those tight dodge or parry timings. I'm already terrible at hitting a parry, so suffering a team wipe because of lag is worse than agonizing.

If you don't own a controller that pairs well with Quest 3S, the Xbox Edition has a fair amount of value for what you get. The Elite Strap—which offers better comfort than the default headband—normally retails for $70. The controller's suggested retail price sits at around $65. Three months of Game Pass Ultimate would set you back another $60. Overall, you save $95 compared to buying everything separately, though you'll need to spend $20 per month later to maintain access to game streaming. If you were buying outside the bundle, you could get a $400 Quest 3S with 256GB of storage compared to 128GB. If you plan to use your headset for game streaming—whether through Xbox or Steam Link to hit up PCVR titles—you won't have many issues with running out of storage. Most games on the Meta Store don't take up much space either, so you should feel safe sticking with the smaller storage option.

Beyond a good deal, what you really want from this special edition are the Xbox colors. Black and green are far more striking than the bland white of the last several Meta Quest headsets. The neon accents help sell it as a “gamer device,” enough that it shouldn't stick out standing shoulder to shoulder with your typical Razer PC gaming gear. The stock-standard Xbox controller is an oldie but goodie, and the green accents added to the joysticks lend it a little extra flair without being too overt.

Outside of Apple with its $3,500 Vision Pro, Meta is one of the few players still interested in doing large-scale, cheap VR/XR headsets. In the same vein, Game Pass is still one of the best deals in gaming, though it has become more expensive as of late. Now that hardware like the Xbox Series X and individual games cost more, streaming is starting to appear more enticing. Even then, Microsoft has promised a whole “family” of new hardware devices that includes an Xbox-branded handheld PC made by Asus. In that case, Microsoft is reengineering its Windows operating system to provide a more console-like experience. That can't be the case with a Meta Quest that uses the company's own Horizon OS. Until we see where Microsoft next takes us on its grand gaming journey, we'll probably see even more devices that look a little more like an Xbox.

When Eventual founders Sammy Sidhu and Jay Chia were working as software engineers at Lyft's autonomous vehicle program, they witnessed a brewing data infrastructure problem — and one that would only become larger with the rise of AI.

Self-driving cars produce a ton of unstructured data from 3D scans and photos to text and audio. There wasn't a tool for Lyft engineers that could understand and process all of those different types of data at the same time — and all in one place. This left engineers to piece together open source tools in a lengthy process with reliability issues.

“We had all these brilliant PhDs, brilliant folks across the industry, working on autonomous vehicles but they're spending like 80% of their time working on infrastructure rather than building their core application,” Sidhu, who is Eventual's CEO, told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “And most of these problems that they were facing were around data infrastructure.”

Sidhu and Chia helped build an internal multimodal data processing tool for Lyft. When Sidhu set out to apply to other jobs, he found interviewers kept asking him about potentially building the same data solution for their companies, and the idea behind Eventual was born.

Eventual built a Python-native open source data processing engine, known as Daft, that is designed to work quickly across different modals from text to audio and video, and more. Sidhu said the goal is to make Daft as transformational to unstructured data infrastructure as SQL was to tabular datasets in the past.

The company was founded in early 2022, nearly a year before ChatGPT was released, and before many people were aware of this data infrastructure gap. They launched the first open source version of Daft in 2022 and are gearing up to launch an enterprise product in the third quarter.

“The explosion of ChatGPT, what we saw is just a lot of other folks who are then building AI applications with different types of modalities,” Sidhu said. “Then everyone started kind of like using things like images and documents and videos in their applications. And that's kind of where we saw, usage just increased dramatically.”

While the original idea behind building Daft stemmed from the autonomous vehicle space, there are numerous other industries that process multimodal data, including robotics, retail tech, and healthcare. The company now counts Amazon, CloudKitchens and Together AI, among others, as customers.

Eventual recently raised two rounds of funding within eight months. The first was a $7.5 million seed round led by CRV. More recently, the company raised a $20 million Series A round led by Felicis with participation from Microsoft's M12 and Citi.

This latest round will go toward bulking up Eventual's open source offering as well as creating a commercial product that will allow its customers to build AI applications off of this processed data.

Astasia Myers, a general partner at Felicis, told TechCrunch that she found Eventual through a market mapping exercise that involved looking for data infrastructure that would be able to support the growing number of multimodal AI models.

Myers said that Eventual stood out for being a first mover in the space — which will likely get more crowded — and based on the fact that the founders had dealt with this data processing problem firsthand. She added that Eventual is also solving a growing problem.

The multimodal AI industry is predicted to grow at a 35% compound annual growth rate between 2023 and 2028, according to management consulting firm MarketsandMarkets.

“Annual data generation is up 1,000x over the past 20 years and 90% of the world's data was generated in the past two years, and according to IDC, the vast majority of data is unstructured,” Myers said. “Daft fits into this huge macro trend of generative AI being built around text, image, video, and voice. You need a multimodal-native data processing engine.”

Human sexuality is on a spectrum, and when it comes to fulfilling sexual desires of all kinds, there should be a sex toy for everyone. That's the best part about sex tech—there's always something interesting popping up on the market. Groove Thing is the latest, launching as a Kickstarter today, and the company markets it as the “world's first internal music player.”

It blends high-fidelity audio of your favorite songs with internal vibrations. As a sex toy reviewer and former college radio DJ, I was immediately game. The company sent me a prototype version to test ahead of the Kickstarter launch—this isn't a full review because it's a preproduction unit, and WIRED doesn't like to make definitive statements on crowd-funded products until the company starts shipping to customers. Groove Thing is a new company, and like all Kickstarter launches, there's a risk it can't deliver. That said, this internal music player is in a class of its own.

Groove Thing

When I opened the package, I immediately understood why Groove Thing's PR team kept calling it the “Ugly Box,” because the hardware was ugly, crude, and unrefined. Sex tech has come such a long way, and people expect their toys, whether they're vibrators, dildo, or butt plugs, to be aesthetically pleasing. But this is a prototype, so I'll give it a pass. The company assures me the final version will look better and slightly different from what I received.

There's the main speaker with a dial on the side, as well as a round puck and two small speakers on top. There are also two internal attachments: one for vaginal use and the other for anal use. These attachments adhere to the puck and are then inserted into the body. Neither of these internal pieces was made of body-safe plastic (the final product will be), so Groove Thing included a big bag of condoms and lube packets so I could safely test the system. I didn't care for the shape of the butt plug, so I stuck to the G-spot stimulator. From the looks of the bulbous head, I knew it was the best fit for me, in comfort and stimulation.

Per the instructions, I plugged the Groove Thing into the wall (yes, you need to be decently close to an outlet), paired it to my phone via Bluetooth, and inserted the condom-wrapped G-spot vibrator into me. The attachment connects to the speaker, too, which means fussing with a cable.

As the instructions suggested, I tried the introductory playlist. With Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, and Dua Lipa, I knew it wouldn't do much for me. But what I discovered during that brief foray into commercial pop was that music with bass was essential to really experiencing what the creators of the Groove Thing had intended.

As the instructions for the Groove Thing emphasize over and over, this isn't a device designed to get you off or even necessarily give you an orgasm. Instead, the focus is on listening to your favorite songs while enjoying the ride or, more specifically, the sensations from feeling the bass and percussion of that music inside you. For me, those songs came from post-rock bands like Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. However, as much as I can listen to those bands on repeat for hours, I can't say that feeling the bass inside me was particularly enjoyable.

While I did explore a handful of songs and experimented with different volumes to feel varying intensities inside me, done via the dial on the Groove Thing, it didn't take long for me to lose interest. You just lay there while the vaginal (or anal) attachment bounces against your G-spot (or P-spot) to the beat of whatever song is on. The motor is also quite noisy, which I found distracting. This could be ironed out with the finished product.

While it's not something for me, I can see how this type of sex toy, which emphasizes musical pleasure, could be enticing for others. I have a mildly unhealthy obsession with music, but there's a difference between that and wanting to feel your favorite song in your vagina or butt. I've never considered it, and now that I've experienced it, I don't care much for it. It doesn't help that the final MSRP is expected to be $275. That's a lot of dough for a product that doesn't even get you off.

If music and sex are intimately intertwined for you, the Groove Thing might pique your interest. But let's make one thing clear—this is hardly the first internal music player. Plenty of others exist, like Ohmibod's Freestyle G music vibrator, Lovehoney's Juno Music-Activated Vibrating Butt Plug, or the Lovense Vulse. Groove Thing will say its vibrations are more dynamic, and maybe that's true, but not enough for me to keep the tunes going.

Sony's alleged monopolistic practices have cost Dutch consumers around €435 million ($505 million) since 2013, according to campaigner research.

Dutch PlayStation gamers are up in arms about what they call the unfair 'Sony tax.' Their collective anger has been mobilized today in a class action suit against Sony, alleging monopolistic practices. In brief, legal representatives of the 'Fair PlayStation' campaign say that “consumers pay an average of 47% more for these digital versions than for exactly the same game on a physical disc” (machine translation used), as Sony leverages its monopoly on digital sales.

Research undertaken by the Dutch collective indicates that Sony has been “exploiting its dominant position in the console market for at least ten years,” with things made much worse by barring other app stores from the platform. It concludes that “at least 1.7 million Dutch PlayStation owners pay too much for digital games and in-game content.” In total, Dutch consumers have thus had to shell out €435 million ($505 million) more than they should have done since 2013, according to campaigners.

Wherever you live, though, new PlayStation 5 releases are expensive, and typically arrive at $69.99 in the U.S., for example. While Sony can easily control game pricing in its digital store, competing sellers of physical game media releases will often race to cut the margins they enjoy per game to aim for the volume market. This kind of healthy competition is being eroded by the introduction and promotion of the digital-only versions of consoles.



Lucia Melcherts, chair of Stichting Massaschade & Consument, speaking as a representative of the 'Fair PlayStation' campaign, points out that many gamers have spent very large sums on buying games for the PlayStation. She reckons that Sony is taking away the magic as it “unilaterally imposes new conditions and demands more money without offering anything in return.” That sounds like Sony is boiling the frog. The water got a little hotter in April, with Sony hiking prices of a wide range of its products as recently as April.

The way that Sony could implement such price hikes illustrates the boldness of its alleged monopolistic behavior in 2025. Melcherts asserts that the purported 'Sony tax' has come about as the firm “can now afford to make decisions without having to worry much about what competitors, developers, or consumers are doing.” This contrasts with how the digital-only console revolution was sold. With digital distribution reducing costs for the entertainment business, cheaper content was often implied. However, that doesn't work with walled-garden systems that block competing digital stores.

In summary, the 'Fair PlayStation' campaign alleged that Sony is making double the margin on its digital sales, is enjoying the position of a monopolist with 80% of the Dutch console market, and maintains artificial walls around its on-console store. Sony's restrictive practices aren't good for developers and publishers, either.

The first legal hearing is scheduled for later in 2025. Ultimately, the consumer action group hopes that the Dutch courts will uphold their claims and force Sony to open the sale of digital PlayStation content for other providers.

Portable power stations have surged in popularity in recent years, becoming essential gear for a range of situations—whether you're facing winter power outages or heading outdoors for summer adventures like camping. In contrast to standard power banks, this device offers enough juice to run small appliances like mini fridges as well as more energy-intensive electronic devices.

The Bluetti power station, especially in this deal, takes it a notch higher by offering a 100W solar panel, and makes it a great investment if you're considering going green with off-grid power. Currently, Amazon is offering the Bluetti EB3A power station with 100W solar panel included at a record low price of $299, down from $599. Having the solar panel added is a big plus which allows you to harness the energy of the sun and charge your devices no matter where you are.

The Bluetti EB3A is a compact portable power station that includes a compact 268Wh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery to provide safe, stable, and reliable power. It has two 600W AC outlets with a surge capacity of 1200W, thus it can be used with a wide range of devices from laptops and phones to appliances and even delicate devices like desktop computers.

One of the highlights of the EB3A is that it supports ultra-fast charging. Where other competitors require utilizing their large power bricks to charge, the EB3A can be charged at 350W using a single cable. You are also able to combine solar and AC charging to reach 80% state of charge in 30 minutes. The onboard MPPT controller can accept up to 200W of solar input so you can upgrade with additional solar equipment in the future if desired. Using the 100W solar panel included, you can charge the EB3A from 0% to 80% using solar power in about 2.6 hours.

Bluetti EB3A is also a reliable uninterruptible power supply that can seamlessly shift to battery power in the event of grid failure: This is valuable in protecting sensitive electronics from data loss or destruction in unplanned outages. The power station is also equipped with many output ports such as USB-A, USB-C, and DC which are able to support most devices you might want to charge.

What's more, its small and lightweight size make it easy to carry whether to a camp or picnic or just for power backup at home.

For just $299, this is a smart investment for anyone who must stay charged up.

The best electrolyte powders can vary from person to person and situation to situation. If you're running a marathon in a hot, humid climate, you might want to reach for an electrolyte drink mix with a higher sodium content than, say, a severely dehydrated hungover person just trying to get their headache to go away (in which case, a lower sodium content will be fine). We spoke with experts and tasted powders galore to narrow down your hydration options, like our top pick, Liquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier ($23).

Overall, you want to find something with a good balance of electrolytes, sugar, and carbohydrates. And make sure you're drinking water on a daily basis—no magic powder is going to help if you're just plain thirsty.

Be sure to check out our related buying guides! We've got recommendations for the Best Protein Powders, Best Greens Powders, and Best Fitness Trackers.

Liquid I.V.

Amazon (Regular, 16 Servings)

Amazon (Sugar-Free, 14 Servings)

Amazon (Immune Support, 14 Servings)

Amazon (Kids, 16 Servings)

Liquid I.V. has been a staple in my household for years. I love using it at music festivals—it helps my ragged throat feel better, my dry nostrils feel better, and my pounding head feel better. And when I inevitably run out of ice on day three, it helps my water taste better, too. I have yet to try a flavor that I actively disliked. They're sweet but not too sweet, and the packets are easy to open. This powder has a solid mix of ingredients in concentrations that aren't too high, making it a reliable option to reach for in day-to-day life.

Skratch Labs

Amazon (20 Servings)

Sktratch Labs (20 Servings)

This hydration mix may as well be candy. But it's delicious in a very juicy way. It's way higher both calorie-, carb-, and sugar-wise than other hydration powders on this list. But it doesn't bother my stomach despite those higher ingredient concentrations, and it's easy to drink a lot of, whereas some other powders are a bit of a slog once you get the first few gulps down. It's high in carbohydrates, which translated to a boost in energy while working out that I noticed after just a few minutes, and it's also a bit higher in sugar content than some others I tried. This is a good powder for athletes that are quickly running through their body's stores.

SaltStick

Amazon (60 Servings)

If you need electrolytes fast or you simply don't want to guzzle down a bottle of water, these electrolyte tablets are what you're looking for. SaltStick electrolyte chews taste really good. They're sweet, salty, and candylike, immediately making you produce a bunch of saliva. (Which is good, since the company recommends letting the chews melt in your mouth for optimal electrolyte absorption.) They're available in large pill bottles as well as small five-serving packets, making them ideal for when you truly need electrolytes on the go. The balanced sodium and carbohydrate content makes these a good option for when you're working out intensely and need to re-up your electrolytes every 30 minutes.

Electrolit

Amazon (8 Servings)

Electrolit has nursed me through many a hangover, and I like every flavor I've tried. I wish it didn't have artificial coloring, but otherwise it's great (and editor Kat Merck agrees with that sentiment, having tried it as well). The packets are on the larger side, and a $12 box has only eight of them. But darn if I don't like it anyway. It does have a balanced mix of sodium, carbohydrates, and sugars, making it a good option for rehydration outside of intensive exercise. I find that the pleasant flavor and higher sodium and carb content help my hangovers go away quickly in comparison to just drinking plain water (or something with higher sodium content, which can taste a bit abrasive when my head is spinning).

Celsius

Amazon (14 Servings)

Walmart (14 Servings)

Celsius is known for its (frankly delicious) energy drinks, but the manufacturer makes caffeine-free hydration packets too. The packets were frustrating to open sometimes, but upon mixing with 16.9 ounces of water, they're tasty. This formula is distinctly saltier than others I tried. It's sugar-free, and I appreciate the low price. It does contain artificial sweeteners, and it's on the lower end of the sodium and carbohydrate scale. It'll give your water a little bit of a boost, but if you want to really replenish lost electrolytes, something else might be a better option.

Bodyarmor

Amazon (15 Servings)

Bodyarmor has a few different caffeinated flavors, with 95 milligrams of caffeine per serving. There are caffeine-free options, too. The resulting color is basically neon, and the flavors are concentrated enough that I found them most palatable when mixed with nearly 30 ounces of water. They're also quite salty—this powder made me thirsty long after it was gone, which could be a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it. I don't love the mix of ingredients—it has a high sodium and potassium content, but it's very low in carbohydrates, so pair this drink with a snack if you can.

Thorne

Amazon (30 Servings)

Thorne (30 Servings)

Thorne Daily Electrolytes are darn easy to drink. They're super sweet, thanks to the inclusion of stevia, but the flavors are pleasant and dissipate quickly. My favorite was the watermelon flavor, which I could happily guzzle all day long. I found the sweetness to be refreshing rather than overly sticky, and the colors were pleasant too. The manufacturer recommends using at least 12 ounces of water per stick, but it tasted the best to me if I dissolved it in around 18 to 20 ounces. I also liked that the calories were negligible—I don't have to worry about meeting my deficit as much as I do with some other packets.

Shaklee

Shaklee (20 Servings)

I quite liked the light blood-orange flavor I tested of these caffeine-free electrolyte packets, as well as the fact there are no artificial colors or off-tasting chemical notes. (There's also a raspberry melon flavor, but I can't vouch for that one.) They're 20 calories each, sweetened with cane sugar, and have added potassium nitrate and beet powder for cognitive function. The science is actually decent on this, but subjectively, the jury is still out. I drank a packet while writing this and some other guide updates, and while I did feel sufficiently hydrated, I don't think I'll be winning a Pulitzer anytime soon. One packet is enough for 8 ounces of water, though more often than not I used 16 ounces and could still taste enough of the flavor. In fact, the only thing I don't like about these is that Shaklee is an multilevel marketer. One of the oldest, in fact—around since the 1950s. If that doesn't bother you, you can buy directly online without a rep, and your purchase is FSA and HSA eligible. —Kat Merck

DryWater

DryWater (15 Servings)

My favorite part about DryWater's electrolyte powders is how nuanced the flavors are. They're not overly sweet or flavorful—they're still a bit sweet, but they taste more like enhanced water and less like an entirely different beverage altogether. They're quite fruity, but in a “real fruit” way—probably because they're made with real fruit. If you want assisted hydration without the zip and tang of typical sports beverages, this is what you're looking for. It doesn't have a remarkable carbohydrate or sugar content, but there are added vitamins and minerals that make this fine to drink on a daily basis if you just want a bit of a hydration boost when you're not exercising intensely.

Klar

Klar (28 Servings)

Sure, Klar's got electrolytes, adaptogens, and additives like B-vitamins and ginseng, but this is a powdered energy drink, plain and simple. One packet mixes with 16 ounces of water and contains 150 mg of caffeine— more than the average cup of coffee and more than twice Bodyarmor's packet—and you will definitely feel it. The taste won't win any awards, as it's sweetened with stevia, and that's definitely the predominant flavor of all the varieties (blood orange, cactus pear, pineapple ginger, “tidal wave”), but if you're used to energy drinks, this is a cheaper, more multifaceted way to get your fix at just under $2 per packet. —Kat Merck

Electrolyte Powders 101: What to Look For and How to Choose

TL;DR Don't choose something with ultra-high amounts of sodium, carbohydrates, or sugar unless you need to based on your exercise levels or a sweat test.

Amy Brownstein, a registered dietitian nutritionist at MyNetDiary, says electrolytes are minerals that exist naturally in your body. These include magnesium, calcium, chloride, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous. Electrolyte powders usually contain these, as well as sugars and carbohydrates which can help a little bit with the absorption of the electrolytes.

Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist, says humans usually lose sodium when working out or spending time in hot temperatures and also that carbohydrates are important to help replenish and preserve muscle glycogen stores to prevent fatigue, especially if you'll be active for more than 30 minutes. Basically, if you're working out a lot and not replenishing lost carbs, you'll feel fatigued much faster—and that's especially true for intense workouts or long sporting events, in which case she recommends re-upping carbohydrates every 30 to 45 minutes. Sugars like glucose serve similar purposes, helping to replenish muscle glycogen as well.

If you're just looking for supplements for day to day life or to soothe your hungover brain, you don't need as much sodium or carbohydrates. Brownstein says to choose a powder within the context of your daily habits and diet; Most people already consume the recommended 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, so if you're not depleting sodium stores with intense exercise, you probably don't need a powder with a high sodium content. The same can be said for sugar.

Ultimately, the best way to figure out exactly what you need is by getting a sweat test done to analyze the contents of your sweat. But short of doing that, your best bet is to choose a powder that lives somewhere in the middle of ingredient concentration—unless you're sweating a ton, working out in high heat, or training in high altitudes. Brownstein adds that if you notice white, chalky residue on your skin or clothes after working out, you might need to up your sodium intake.

When it comes to synthetic dyes, Balls says that it comes down mostly to personal choice. Luckily, if you want to avoid these ingredients, many of our recommendations omit them.

To avoid stomach upset, Balls mentions that you might want to look for powders that are lower in magnesium (which can have a laxative effect in high amounts). She also mentions that calcium and iron can interfere with the absorption of one another, so choose a powder that has balanced, lower amounts of those two supplements. Brownstein mentions that high sugar and sodium content can upset some peoples' stomachs, too, and that you should read the labels to make sure you're not over-supplementing (or over-caffeinating). If something contains 100 percent of your daily recommended zinc content, for example, you want to make sure you're not also taking a multivitamin with the same amount of zinc.

Per Heather Gosnell, a pediatrician, sodium is the key ingredient for effective rehydration. She also says a little sugar and carbohydrates help your body absorb water but to avoid high-sugar drinks.

Balls says to look for a powder that includes the key electrolytes lost: sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. She says, if possible, to avoid drinks with artificial sweeteners.

Hallie Zwibel, director of the Center for Sports Medicine at New York Institute of Technology, adds that “in addition to causing upset stomach and reduced fluid absorption, repeatedly consuming high sugar foods and beverages can lead to diabetes, as well as potential weight gain.” He also said, “While electrolyte packets can help replenish essential minerals lost through sweat, they should not replace daily water intake.”

Is It Better to Just Drink Plain Water?

Brownstein says that checking the color of your urine is a solid indicator of how hydrated you are. (Very light to pale yellow is normal; amber to dark yellow is potentially dehydrated; completely colorless is potentially over-hydrated.)

Gosnell says for most people, water and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables provide all the hydration and electrolytes you need. She adds, “Electrolyte drinks are helpful after intense exercise or heat exposure but avoid high-sugar options. For everyday hydration, simple water and healthy foods are best.”

Balls adds that if you're sweating a lot or are physically active for more than 30 minutes, plain water won't be as beneficial to promote optimal hydration status. She also reminds us that a balanced diet can help with lost electrolytes—as can drinking dairy or soy milk, or just using plain old table salt to replenish lost sodium.

And to keep things simple, Heather Jaeger, head of nutrition at MyFitnessPal, says she recommends the “3H” method to know when to reach for a hydration powder: "If you're active for an hour or more, exercising in hot conditions, or working hard enough to sweat, that's when electrolytes can really support rehydration and recovery.”

Are Electrolyte Powders Safe for Everybody?

You should always talk with your doctor before changing your diet or taking a new supplement.

Gosnell says that hydration solutions and powders are safe for most healthy adults when used as directed, but for children and those with medical conditions, consult a doctor first. She adds, “If you have health concerns or severe dehydration, seek medical advice before using electrolyte drinks.” Brownstein adds that, over time, unnecessarily high sodium concentrations can contribute to high blood pressure and can potentially contribute to other problems, so avoid ultra-high sodium concentrations unless you're exercising intensively.

How We Tested and What's Up Next

I drank each powder, dissolved in water following the packaging instructions. I tested these powders over the course of a few weeks in my day-to-day life, including while working out and while hungover. I looked for adequate nutrition (per my conversations with dietitians), convenient packaging, and good taste.

We're testing hydration and electrolyte powders from Only Hydration, LMNT, Gatorade, DripDrop, and Nuun Sport.

Everyone wants to filter out blue light. Whether through your glasses, laptop, or smartphone, companies have hopped on the bandwagon to integrate blue light blockers to cut the wavelength from reaching your eyes. The claim is to help improve sleep and reduce eyestrain, even though studies have yet to find these blockers effective.

TCL is one such company. It has been manufacturing phones and tablets with its “Nxtpaper” LCD technology for a few years, and the third generation in the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G smartphone is good enough to block 61 percent more blue light than a normal tablet to “protect your eyes and reduce eye fatigue.” I've used this $250 Android phone for more than a week, and I don't think the claims hold up, but I've still come to enjoy the matte paperlike screen. Don't buy it for the blue-light blocking promises; buy it because the matte screen looks and feels nice.

The 60 XE's main attraction is the Nxtpaper matte LCD. It has a pleasing paperlike texture and isn't reflective. Colors are a smidge more muted than phones with OLED screens, and text and app icons can appear a little fuzzy—I only really noticed this when comparing it side by side with another handset.

The phone's back has a similar matte texture, though with a marble pattern for a luxe look, complete with a glossy, round camera module. A friend said it looked “fancy," though I find it teeters on tacky. I don't mind the marble pattern, but the camera module isn't symmetrical and feels a little out of place. Still, it doesn't look like any other $250 smartphone. That's a plus.

Back to the Nxtpaper display, though. On the right edge of the phone is the Nxtpaper switch, and flicking it up lets you choose from three display modes: Color Paper Mode, Ink Paper Mode, and Max Ink Mode. I'll get to what these modes do, but I want to point out that the switch feels cheap and has a slight rattle. Switching modes also takes a beat—it plays a little tune and animation each time, and I can't find a way to disable this. (You can at least set it so that it enters a specific mode when you flip the switch instead of having to choose every time.)

Standard mode

Ink Paper Mode

Color Paper Mode desaturates and softens the colors, almost like a color E Ink ebook reader. Ink Paper Mode strips away all color and goes black and white, and the color temperature of the screen is less blue. This is still an LCD, but to my eyes, it's better than Android phones that try to use E Ink. You get a similar paperlike reading experience and a matte screen, but unlike the Minimal Phone or the Boox Palma 2, it's not frustrating or slow. The 120-Hz screen refresh rate and decent onboard CPU make it perform like a normal phone.

I've enjoyed switching to either of these modes when I'm reading, whether through Chrome, Google News, or even doomscrolling through Bluesky. I usually turn it off and use the standard mode when swiping through Instagram Reels, though nothing's stopping you from watching videos in these modes if you prefer the desaturated look.

Max Ink Mode is much more extreme. It limits background app processes and power consumption while turning your phone screen black and white. You also get a special homescreen—four fixed apps that you can't change at the bottom (Phone, Messages, Contacts, Settings), and then you can add eight apps of your choosing. You'll get notifications from these apps, and them alone. This mode is designed to be used for large bouts of reading, say in the Kindle app, and if that's what you end up doing, it greatly extends battery life to several days. Again, a mode like this makes way more sense than buying a Boox Palma 2, because it gets very close to the experience of an E Ink screen, without the annoyingly slow refresh experience.

But there is one big problem with TCL's Nxtpaper tech: it's hard to see in direct sunlight. Don't get me wrong, it's not that you can't use the phone outdoors. In shady areas or even on cloudy days, I didn't have much trouble reading the screen. But with the sun directly overhead, it's nearly impossible to read. The company says this has been addressed with its Nxtpaper 4.0 generation, but that's a hardware change, so you'll only see it in new TCL phones and tablets with Nxtpaper 4.0 technology.

The good news is that the 60 XE is a solid budget Android phone. The MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor and 8 GB of RAM deliver decent performance, though you'll see some stutters here and there and occasional choppy animations. My benchmark scores put it slightly ahead of the $200 Moto G 2025, but my real-world experience was much more positive as the 60 XE is nowhere as stuttery as the Moto, likely due to the increased RAM.

The 5,010-mAh battery feels like it should last longer—I routinely hit around 30 to 25 percent by bedtime with average use, though you can extend it with Max Ink Mode. There's no wireless charging, but this phone has all the accouterments you'd want, from a microSD card slot for expandable storage and NFC for contactless payments to a headphone jack. The phone feels a little slippery and top-heavy, so I recommend finding a case to be safe, though I've dropped it a handful of times and luckily don't see any scratches on the glass screen.

It'll work with every major US carrier and is exclusively sold unlocked on Amazon, a nice break from many other TCL phones that are locked to a carrier in the US. Speaking of, I didn't have any issues with the 5G connectivity, but I did get some comments about call quality. I didn't have trouble hearing others, though I wish the call volume could get louder, but a few people struggled to hear me via the phone's speaker mode. I tested this with some friends, who didn't have any issues, so it's hard to say if it's a network problem or the caller's hardware.

That leaves the camera, which isn't terrible for a $250 phone. Quality heavily depends on the lighting, and even indoors during daylight, you'll probably want to turn on Night mode to avoid a blurry photo. The 50-MP main can struggle with high-contrast scenes, and colors don't look super accurate, but the results are passable. No problems scanning QR codes, at the very least.

The biggest drawback is software updates. This phone runs Android 15, and TCL is only promising one Android upgrade to Android 16 at some point in the future. No more Android features after that, though it'll get a total of two years of security updates. It's not significantly worse than other phones at this price, but Motorola now offers two Android upgrades for its Moto G phones. TCL should do better.

I'd buy a CMF Phone 2 Pro ($279) over the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G, as it looks better, has stronger performance, and nicer cameras. But the pleasing matte screen has this calming quality that I've come to enjoy over the past week, and I like the ability to switch to even less saturation or monochrome if I'm reading a lot. If you've eyed something like the Boox Palma 2 for some time, I think you'll have a much nicer experience with this TCL.

Waymo robotaxis can now be hailed in Atlanta via Uber. The two companies, which already offer the “Waymo on Uber” service in Austin, said on Tuesday the commercial service will initially cover about 65 square miles in Atlanta.

The launch, if successful, is poised to propel the businesses of both companies. Uber, which has locked in partnerships with 18 autonomous vehicles companies, said it has an annual run-rate of 1.5 million mobility and delivery AV trips on its network. Meanwhile, Waymo said it provides 250,000 paid robotaxi rides every week across Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco.

The addition of Atlanta to that list should push those numbers up.

Waymo's fleet in Atlanta is in the “dozens” and will eventually be expanded over time, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. The companies have previously said the fleet shared between Atlanta and Austin will grow to the hundreds.

The “Waymo on Uber” service is a hybrid of sorts where robotaxis and human-driven vehicles intermingle. Uber users can set their preferences in the app to increase the chances of being matched with a Waymo. 

That structure differs from the other markets where Waymo operates. In those cities, riders use the Waymo One app to hail robotaxis.

When an Uber user is notified they've been matched with a Waymo, they can choose to accept or switch to a human-driven ride. Once the robotaxi arrives, riders will use the Uber app to unlock the vehicle, open the trunk, and start the trip.

Robotaxi rides will cost the same as an UberX, Uber Comfort, or Uber Comfort Electric driven by a human, the companies said.

The “Waymo on Uber” service splits the responsibilities of owning and operating a fleet of driverless vehicles. Uber handles the charging, maintenance and cleaning of the autonomous vehicles, as well as managing access to the robotaxis via its app. Meanwhile, Waymo monitors the tech and the autonomous operations, including roadside assistance and certain aspects of rider support.

Last September, Uber and Waymo announced plans to offer a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025 as part of an expanded partnership. In March, the companies started offering the “Waymo on Uber” robotaxi service in Austin. Waymo has more than 100 robotaxis in its commercial fleet in Austin, according to the company.

Earlier this year, Eric Antonow was in a coffee shop with his family when he felt the familiar, twitchy urge to reach for his phone. He patted his pockets for relief—the cool, thin slab was still there. He joked to his family that, like an addict jonesing for a hit, he would one day need a medical-grade solution to detox from his phone. Opioid addicts had methadone. iPhone addicts would need … methaphones.

“It was a joke, but I got two laughs from my two teenagers, which is gold,” Antonow says. “I was like, ‘I'm going to commit to the bit.'”

Antonow, a former marketing executive at Google and Facebook, has been committing to bits for half a decade, making what he calls “mindless toys.” His online shop features projects like a “listening switch” to indicate when one is paying attention, and a vinyl for silent meditation, with 20 minutes of recorded silence on each side (record player not required).

So within days of his latest joke, he had enlisted ChatGPT to mock up an image of a gadget in the shape of a phone, without all of the contents: a translucent rectangle that one could look at, or through. From that original generative sketch emerged a more realized design: a 6-inch slab of clear acrylic with rounded corners, like the iPhone, and green edges that resembled glass. Antonow placed an order for samples, and started an Indiegogo campaign for the Methaphone: to “leave your phone without the cravings or withdrawal.”

The first Methaphones were sold for $25 through a crowdfunding campaign.

The dilemma of the smartphone is that we all want to use our phones less, but few of us actually do. Apple and Google offered a few life preservers in 2018, in the form of self-regulation tools like screen time limits, but most of that went out the window during the pandemic years when screens became a window into the outside world. Now, a person hoping to reclaim their attention is trapped between two unappealing choices: downgrade to a minimalist “dumb phone,” or surrender to the dopamine drip-feed of infinite content. Either way, the phone wins.

In response, a cottage industry has emerged to offer detachment tools. There are apps with symbolic names, like Freedom and Focus, that block distracting content. Startups like Brick and Unpluq offer physical NFC “keys” to lock and unlock addictive apps. (Unpluq's cofounder, Jorn Rigter, says people use the device equally to block social apps, like Instagram, and work apps, like Slack, which have become just as sticky.) There's Yondr, a lockable pouch to prevent phone use in courtrooms and concert halls. And there's a growing lineup of “dumb phones,” some at premium, postmodern prices.

You can buy stickers that look like app icons.

Unlike those solutions, the Methaphone doesn't do much of anything. It's more of a statement: ceci n'est pas un phone. But in a culture of technological excess, the project has resonated widely, like Ozempic in an epidemic of screen obesity.

In May, when the first batch of Methaphones arrived, Antonow sent them to a dozen friends to get their reactions. One recipient was Catherine Goetze, who quickly posted a video about the Methaphone to her 400,000 followers on TikTok. In the video, Goetze is standing in line at a San Francisco boba shop, hunched over just like everyone else—but instead of scrolling her phone, she's scrolling … a slab of clear acrylic. Commenters went wild with speculation. Was it a Nokia prototype? A Black Mirror trailer? Within five days, the video had more than 53 million views.

After Goetze's video, Antonow says the Methaphone “massively sold out.” (He had initially ordered a run of 100 units, sold as a limited release, for $25.) While he plans to restock, he says the future of the Methaphone is less about individual purchases than larger-scale experiments—say, a restaurant that offers a Methaphone on the menu so that people can dine without distractions. Phones are more than just portals to other people, they're portals to another dimension. “So the counterbalance also needs to be more important than just, ‘Oh, I need to remember not to use my phone at the table,'” he says.

Anna Lembke, an addiction researcher at the Stanford's School of Medicine and the author of Dopamine Nation, agrees. “Our phones have really become like pacifiers,” she says. “We keep them close to our bodies, we touch them countless times a day.” A tool like the Methaphone, she suggests, could help short-circuit the habit loop: You still go through the motions, but without the payoff. She compares it to a smoker using a zero-nicotine vape: “The ritual remains, but the hit is gone.” (She adds that this is not, in fact, how methadone works.)

Antonow isn't the first to parody phone addiction. The NoPhone, launched in 2014, is a plastic brick that bills itself as “a fake phone for people addicted to real phones.” It now comes in three flavors: Original (no screen, no battery, no charger, $20), Selfie (with a mirror, $23), and Air (an empty bag, yours for $9).

Antonow has recently taken his own design further: He now sells the Methaphone with an optional sticker pack featuring “analog apps,” like Walk, Read, See Friends, and Daydream. Each one turns the blank screen into a low-tech reminder that life exists outside the rectangle.

Antonow sent me a Methaphone of my own. It arrived in a paper sleeve along with illustrations for use: to doomscroll in bed, to avert boredom while drinking alone, even floating in a pool. (Naturally, it's waterproof.) Antonow encouraged me to treat it like a set of rosary beads—something to touch instead of my phone, whenever the impulse struck.

One morning, I brought it with me to a coffee shop. When I felt the familiar itch to pull out my phone, I reached for the Methaphone instead. I let my thumb graze its surface mindlessly and waited for someone—anyone—to ask what I was doing. No one did. Everyone else was glued to their own screens, too deep in their digital loops to pay me any attention. I looked through the clear screen of the Methaphone and surveyed the world I had long been ignoring. Then I slipped it back into my pocket for good.

Nearly seven months after the fatal shooting of an insurance CEO in New York drew widespread attention to health insurers' practice of denying or delaying doctor-ordered care, the largest U.S. insurers agreed Monday to streamline their often cumbersome preapproval system.

Dozens of insurance companies, including Cigna, Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare, agreed to several measures, which include making fewer medical procedures subject to prior authorization and speeding up the review process. Insurers also pledged to use clear language when communicating with patients and promised that medical professionals would review coverage denials.

While Trump administration officials applauded the insurance industry for its willingness to change, they acknowledged limitations of the agreement.

"The pledge is not a mandate," Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said during a news conference. "This is an opportunity for the industry to show itself."

Oz said he wants insurers to eliminate preapprovals for knee arthroscopy, a common, minimally invasive procedure to diagnose and treat knee problems. Chris Klomp, director of the Center for Medicare at CMS, recommended prior authorization be eliminated for vaginal deliveries, colonoscopies, and cataract surgeries, among other procedures. Health insurers said the changes would benefit most Americans, including those with commercial or private coverage, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care.

The insurers have also agreed that patients who switch insurance plans may continue receiving treatment or other health care services for 90 days without facing immediate prior authorization requirements imposed by their new insurer.

But health policy analysts say prior authorization — a system that forces some people to delay care or abandon treatment — may continue to pose serious health consequences for affected patients. That said, many people may not notice a difference, even if insurers follow through on their new commitments.

"So much of the prior authorization process is behind the black box," said Kaye Pestaina, director of the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Often, she said, patients aren't even aware that they're subject to prior authorization requirements until they face a denial.

"I'm not sure how this changes that," Pestaina said.

The pledge from insurers follows the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot in midtown Manhattan in early December on the way to an investor meeting, forcing the issue of prior authorization to the forefront.

Oz acknowledged "violence in the streets" prompted Monday's announcement. Klomp told KFF Health News that insurers were reacting to the shooting because the problem has "reached a fever pitch." Health insurance CEOs now move with security details wherever they go, Klomp said.

"There's no question that health insurers have a reputation problem," said Robert Hartwig, an insurance expert and a clinical associate professor at the University of South Carolina.

The pledge shows that insurers are hoping to stave off "more draconian" legislation or regulation in the future, Hartwig said.

But government interventions to improve prior authorization will be used "if we're forced to use them," Oz said during the news conference.

"The administration has made it clear we're not going to tolerate it anymore," he said. "So either you fix it or we're going to fix it."

Here are the key takeaways for consumers:

1. Prior authorization isn't going anywhere.

Health insurers will still be allowed to deny doctor-recommended care, which is arguably the biggest criticism that patients and providers level against insurance companies. And it isn't clear how the new commitments will protect the sickest patients, such as those diagnosed with cancer, who need the most expensive treatment.

2. Reform efforts aren't new.

Most states have already passed at least one law imposing requirements on insurers, often intended to reduce the time patients spend waiting for answers from their insurance company and to require transparency from insurers about which prescriptions and procedures require preapproval. Some states have also enacted "gold card" programs for doctors that allow physicians with a robust record of prior authorization approvals to bypass the requirements.

Nationally, rules proposed by the first Trump administration and finalized by the Biden administration are already set to take effect next year. They will require insurers to respond to requests within seven days or 72 hours, depending on their urgency, and to process prior authorization requests electronically, instead of by phone or fax, among other changes. Those rules apply only to certain categories of insurance, including Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.

Beyond that, some insurance companies committed to improvement long before Monday's announcement. Earlier this year, UnitedHealthcare pledged to reduce prior authorization volume by 10%. Cigna announced its own set of improvements in February.

3. Insurance companies are already supposed to be doing some of these things.

For example, the Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to communicate with patients in plain language about health plan benefits and coverage.

But denial letters remain confusing because companies tend to use jargon. For instance, AHIP, the health insurance industry trade group, used the term "non-approved requests" in Monday's announcement.

Insurers also pledged that medical professionals would continue to review prior authorization denials. AHIP claims this is "a standard already in place." But recent lawsuits allege otherwise, accusing companies of denying claims in a matter of seconds.

4. Health insurers will increasingly rely on artificial intelligence.

Health insurers issue millions of denials every year, though most prior authorization requests are quickly, sometimes even instantly, approved.

The use of AI in making prior authorization decisions isn't new — and it will probably continue to ramp up, with insurers pledging Monday to issue 80% of prior authorization decisions "in real-time" by 2027.

"Artificial intelligence should help this tremendously," Rep. Gregory Murphy (R-N.C.), a physician, said during the news conference.

"But remember, artificial intelligence is only as good as what you put into it," he added.

Results from a survey published by the American Medical Association in February indicated 61% of physicians are concerned that the use of AI by insurance companies is already increasing denials.

5. Key details remain up in the air.

Oz said CMS will post a full list of participating insurers this summer, while other details will become public by January.

He said insurers have agreed to post data about their use of prior authorization on a public dashboard, but it isn't clear when that platform will be unveiled. The same holds true for "performance targets" that Oz spoke of during the news conference. He did not name specific targets, indicate how they will be made public, or specify how the government would enforce them.

While the AMA, which represents doctors, applauded the announcement, "patients and physicians will need specifics demonstrating that the latest insurer pledge will yield substantive actions," the association's president, Bobby Mukkamala, said in a statement. He noted that health insurers made "past promises" to improve prior authorization in 2018.

Meanwhile, it also remains unclear what services insurers will ultimately agree to release from prior authorization requirements.

Patient advocates are in the process of identifying "low-value codes," Oz said, that should not require preapproval, but it is unknown when those codes will be made public or when insurers will agree to release them from prior authorization rules.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) include targets for safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), which are critical in preventing cholera, a persistent health threat in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) launched a global strategy titled Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030, which aims to reduce cholera-related deaths by 90% and eliminate cholera in up to 20 countries by 2030. However, the effect of disparities in WASH access on the unequal cholera burden across geographic regions remains poorly understood.

In a new study published in the KeAi journal Global Transitions, a team of Chinese researchers evaluated the impact of WASH access on cholera and the unequal burden across 89 low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017 under the UNSDG framework.

Safe WASH are the only long-term and sustainable solutions to effective prevention and control of cholera. Evaluating the impact and attributable burden of WASH on cholera can help cholera-affected areas formulate targeted control strategies tailored to the specific conditions of each country, as outlined in the GTFCC's Global Roadmap."

Wanqi Wen, first author of the study from Sun Yat-sen University

Notably, the proportions of piped water and sewer/septic sanitation negatively relate to cholera, while harmful effects on cholera were noted for proportions of surface water and open defecation. Corresponding author Hualiang Lin, also from Sun Yat-sen University, emphasized that this research highlights the need for maintaining and increasing access to safe WASH in cholera-affected countries.

"Regional disparities in WASH access further contributed to unequal cholera burden. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 25.77 % of cholera were attributed to the high proportion of unimproved drinking water, much higher than 9.09 % in Northern Africa and Western Asia," explains Lin. "Our findings offer comprehensive information for implementing targeted, local-level control approaches to end cholera globally."

The authors also emphasize that their estimates of WASH-related prevention fractions offer actionable reference points for countries implementing UN SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and the GTFCC's 2030 Roadmap. "Achieving universal access to improved sanitation could reduce cholera risk by 32.98 % in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 7.47 % in Central and Southern Asia," says Lin. "Scaling up safe WASH access is not just a development goal—it's a core requirement for eliminating cholera."

Despite medical advances, infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses are still among the most common causes of death worldwide. What role could fructose play in such diseases? A research group led by Ina Bergheim from the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Vienna has now been able to prove for the first time that monocytes, important immune cells in the blood, react more strongly to bacterial toxins after fructose consumption - but not in a positive way. Specifically, the concentration of receptors for certain bacterial toxins increases, making the body more susceptible to inflammation. The study was recently published in the journal Redox Biology.

In two independent randomised studies with healthy adults, the researchers investigated how the consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages affects the immune response compared to beverages with glucose. In addition, they conducted experiments with isolated monocytes and cell culture models to investigate the molecular mechanisms.

The scientists were able to observe that the intake of fructose, in contrast to the intake of glucose, led to an increase in the concentration of Toll-like receptor 2 in monocytes. Toll-like receptor 2 regulates the immune response, among other things. The higher concentration was accompanied by an increased sensitivity of the monocytes to lipoteichoic acid, a bacterial toxin.

The concentration of receptors for such toxins in the body increased, which means that the inflammatory response increased."

Ina Bergheim, study leader, University of Vienna

Specifically, pro-inflammatory messengers such as interleukin-6, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were increasingly released.

"These findings make an important contribution to understanding how individual food components and fructose in particular can influence the immune system," says Bergheim. "They indicate that even short-term, high fructose consumption in healthy people can influence the immune system and increase inflammation."

Future studies should clarify the long-term effects of chronically increased fructose consumption on the immune system and susceptibility to infection, particularly in risk groups with, for example, type II diabetes mellitus or fatty liver disease, which is associated with metabolic dysfunction. "Sugar, especially the fructose in sugary drinks and sweets, has long been suspected of increasing the risk of developing metabolic diseases - this needs to be investigated," says Bergheim.

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis identifies a possible way to slow or block progression of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in people over age 50. The WashU Medicine researchers and their international collaborators implicated problems with cholesterol metabolism in this type of vision loss, perhaps helping to explain the links between macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease, which both worsen with age.

The new findings - identified using human plasma samples and mouse models of macular degeneration - suggest that increasing the amount of a molecule called apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the blood fixes problems in cholesterol processing that lead to cellular damage in the eyes and other organs. Various methods of dialing up ApoM could serve as new treatment strategies for age-related macular degeneration and perhaps some forms of heart failure triggered by similar dysfunctional cholesterol processing.

The study appears June 24 in the journal Nature Communications.

Our study points to a possible way to address a major unmet clinical need. Current therapies that reduce the chance of further vision loss are limited to only the most advanced stages of macular degeneration and do not reverse the disease. Our findings suggest that developing treatments that increase ApoM levels could treat or even prevent the disease and therefore preserve people's vision as they age."

Rajendra S. Apte, MD, PhD, senior author, the Paul A. Cibis Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at WashU Medicine

In macular degeneration, doctors can see cholesterol-rich deposits under the retina during an eye exam, according to Apte. In early stages, vision might still be normal, but the deposits increase inflammation and other damaging processes the lead to the gradual loss of central vision. In the most common type, "dry" macular degeneration, the cells in the central part of the retina can be damaged, causing a type of neurodegeneration called geographic atrophy, which is similar to what happens in the brain in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Dry macular degeneration can turn into "wet" macular degeneration, in which abnormal blood vessel growth damages vision.

Geographic atrophy and wet macular degeneration are advanced forms of the disease that are accompanied by vision loss. Although some approved therapies for advanced disease are available, the disease process itself is not reversible at that stage.

In recent years, evidence has emerged that ApoM can serve as a protective molecule with known anti-inflammatory effects and roles in maintaining healthy cholesterol metabolism. With that in mind, Apte and co-senior author Ali Javaheri, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, were interested assessing whether reduced ApoM levels, which fall with age, could be involved in the dysfunctional cholesterol metabolism that is at the root of multiple diseases of aging, including macular degeneration and heart disease. They showed that patients with macular degeneration have reduced levels of ApoM circulating in the blood compared with healthy controls. And past work by Javaheri, a WashU Medicine cardiologist, showed that patients with various forms of heart failure also had reduced levels of ApoM in the blood.

This study revealed that ApoM is a key component in the "good cholesterol" pathways that mop up excess cholesterol - the bad kind that tends to drive inflammation - and clear it from the body through the liver.

Apte and Javaheri's research suggests that when ApoM is low, cells in the retina and heart muscle can't correctly metabolize cholesterol deposits and have a hard time getting rid of these accumulating lipids. When these lipids build up, it leads to inflammation and cellular damage.

To see if they could reverse the harmful effects of low ApoM, the researchers increased ApoM levels in mouse models of macular degeneration, using genetic modification or plasma transfer from other mice. The mice showed evidence of improved retinal health, improved function of light-sensing cells in the retina and reduced accumulation of cholesterol deposits. The researchers further found evidence that ApoM triggers a signaling pathway that breaks down the cholesterol in cellular compartments called lysosomes, which are known for playing important roles in disposing of cellular waste.

The researchers also found that ApoM must be bound to a molecule called sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to get the beneficial effects of ApoM treatment in the mice.

Apte and Javaheri are working with Mobius Scientific, a WashU startup company that is working to harness this knowledge of the role of ApoM in macular degeneration to develop new approaches to treating or preventing the disease. Apte and Javaheri worked with WashU's Office of Technology Management (OTM) to launch Mobius Scientific in 2022.

The findings also could have implications for future interventions that raise ApoM in patients with heart failure.

"One of the exciting things about this collaboration is realizing the links between retinal pigment epithelial cells and heart muscle cell, which are both vulnerable to low ApoM," Javeheri said. "It is possible that the interaction between ApoM and S1P is regulating cholesterol metabolism in both cell types. We look forward to exploring strategies to increase ApoM in ways that could help the eye and the heart maintain healthy cholesterol metabolism over time and stave off two major diseases of aging."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of death from cancer in the United States (US) and the most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide. CRC refers to cancer in the colon or rectum, the two parts that make up the large intestine. In the US, deaths from CRC in people under 55 have been increasing since the mid-2000s, highlighting the need for effective treatments. 

New data published in The Journal of Immunology, reveal that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy improved overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with CRC. CIK cell therapy uses the patient's immune cells to target and destroy cancer cells. Patients who received CIK cell therapy with chemotherapy or surgery showed improved outcomes regardless of whether they had early or advanced stages. 

"For advanced colorectal cancer, the prognosis has been rather pessimistic, and patients at stages II-III face a relatively high risk of recurrence and metastasis following surgery, with limited treatment options for these patients. CIK cell therapy could enhance the survival of patients with CRC compared to traditional therapies," said Dr. Yi Zhang, Director of the Biotherapy Center at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, who led the study. 

Despite the positive outcomes of CIK cell therapy, some patients do not respond to the treatment. Researchers analyzed blood samples from patients to determine whether any biomarkers could predict who would respond well to CIK cell therapy. They found that CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels in a patient's blood could indicate whether they would benefit from CIK cell therapy. CEA is expressed in some CRC patients who undergo surgery and is considered an indicator of poor prognosis and disease recurrence. These results could pave the way for a simple blood test administered before treatment, which could improve patient survival. 

The long-term effects of CIK cell therapy for CRC patients had not been understood until now. The promising results of our study will hopefully facilitate the widespread adoption of cell therapies for treating malignant tumors, including CRC."

Dr. Yi Zhang, Director of the Biotherapy Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University

This retrospective study followed two groups of patients after they received treatment. The CIK group that received CIK cell therapy with chemotherapy or surgery and the control group that received chemotherapy and/or surgery. Patients were enrolled in the study from 2008 to 2014 and were followed through January 2020. Researchers monitored both the time between the first treatment and when a patient's disease worsened (progression-free survival) and the time between the first treatment and death (overall survival). Comparing the results of progression-free survival and overall survival within the CIK group, researchers investigated different biomarkers in patients' blood that may be most relevant to predicting survival. 

The researchers plan to continue this work by investigating the effects of combining CIK therapy with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in the treatment of CRC and by conducting prospective clinical studies to establish CIK cell therapy as a treatment for CRC.

Researchers at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine have found that semaglutide, a popular diabetes and weight-loss drug, may lower the risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Dementia, a condition that slowly makes it harder for people to remember things and think clearly, occurs when brain cells are damaged and their connections stop working properly. This damage, which worsens over time, can be caused by various modifiable factors, including obesity, T2D, cardiovascular diseases, traumatic brain injury and stroke.

According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 6 million people in the United States are diagnosed with dementia, and it causes more than 100,000 deaths each year. Encouragingly, research indicates that 45% of dementia cases could be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors.

The study, published today in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (DOI 10.1177/13872877251351329), suggests T2D patients taking semaglutide had a significantly lower risk of developing dementia compared to other antidiabetic medications. These results were more profound in women and older adults.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLP-1R) molecule that decreases hunger and helps regulate blood sugar in T2D, is also the active component in the diabetes and weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Semaglutide has shown a broad range of benefits, including reductions in cardiovascular diseases.

The research team-led by biomedical informatics professor Rong Xu-analyzed three years of electronic records of nearly 1.7 million T2D patients nationally. The researchers used a statistical approach that mimics a randomized clinical trial.

They found patients prescribed semaglutide had a significantly lower risk for Alzheimer's disease-related dementia, compared to those who had taken any of seven other anti-diabetic medications, including other types of GLP-1R-targeting medications.

"There is no cure or effective treatment for dementia, so this new study provides real-world evidence for its potential impact on preventing or slowing dementia development among at-high risk population," said Xu, who also directs the School of Medicine's Center for AI in Drug Discovery and is a member of the Cancer Genomics Epigenomics Program at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Although their findings potentially support the idea that semaglutide could prevent dementia, the study's limitations restrict the researchers from making firm causal conclusions, she said.

Our results indicate that research into semaglutide's use for dementia prevention will need to be further investigated through randomized clinical trials."

Democratic state attorneys general led by those from California, New York, and Massachusetts are pressuring medical professional groups to defend reproductive rights, including medication abortion, emergency abortions, and travel between states for health care in response to recent increases in the number of abortion bans.

The American Medical Association adopted a formal position June 9 recommending that medical certification exams be moved out of states with restrictive abortion policies or made virtual, after 20 attorneys general petitioned to protect physicians who fear legal repercussions because of their work. The petition focused on the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology's certification exams in Dallas, and the subsequent AMA recommendation was hailed as a win for Democrats trying to regain ground after the fall of Roe v. Wade.

"It seems incremental, but there are so many things that go into expanding and maintaining access to care," said Arneta Rogers, executive director of the Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice at the University of California-Berkeley's law school. "We see AGs banding together, governors banding together, as advocates work on the ground. That feels somewhat more hopeful — that people are thinking about a coordinated strategy."

Since the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022, 16 states, including Texas, have implemented laws banning abortion almost entirely, and many of them impose criminal penalties on providers as well as options to sue doctors. More than 25 states restrict access to gender-affirming care for trans people, and six of them make it a felony to provide such care to youth.

That's raised concern among some physicians who fear being charged if they go to those states, even if their home state offers protection to provide reproductive and gender-affirming health care.

Pointing to the recent fining and indictment of a physician in New York who allegedly provided abortion pills to a woman in Texas and a teen in Louisiana, a coalition of physicians wrote in a letter to the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology that “the limits of shield laws are tenuous" and that "Texas laws can affect physicians practicing outside of the state as well."

The campaign was launched by several Democratic attorneys general, including Rob Bonta of California, Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, and Letitia James of New York, who each have established a reproductive rights unit as a bulwark for their state following the Dobbs decision.

"Reproductive health care and gender-affirming care providers should not have to risk their safety or freedom just to advance in their medical careers," James said in a statement. "Forcing providers to travel to states that have declared war on reproductive freedom and LGBTQ+ rights is as unnecessary as it is dangerous."

In their petition, the attorneys general included a letter from Joseph Ottolenghi, medical director at Choices Women's Medical Center in New York City, who was denied his request to take the test remotely or outside of Texas. To be certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, physicians need to take the in-person exam at its testing facility in Dallas. The board completed construction of its new testing facility last year.

"As a New York practitioner, I have made every effort not to violate any other state's laws, but the outer contours of these draconian laws have not been tested or clarified by the courts," Ottolenghi wrote.

Rachel Rebouché, the dean of Temple University's law school and a reproductive law scholar, said "putting the heft" of the attorneys general behind this effort helps build awareness and a "public reckoning" on behalf of providers. Separately, some doctors have urged medical conferences to boycott states with abortion bans.

Anti-abortion groups, however, see the campaign as forcing providers to conform to abortion-rights views. Donna Harrison, an OB-GYN and the director of research at the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, described the petition as an "attack not only on pro-life states but also on life-affirming medical professionals."

Harrison said the "OB-GYN community consists of physicians with values that are as diverse as our nation's state abortion laws," and that this diversity "fosters a medical environment of debate and rigorous thought leading to advancements that ultimately serve our patients."

The AMA's new policy urges specialty medical boards to host exams in states without restrictive abortion laws, offer the tests remotely, or provide exemptions for physicians. However, the decision to implement any changes to the administration of these exams is up to those boards. There is no deadline for a decision to be made.

The OB-GYN board did not respond to requests for comment, but after the public petition from the attorneys general criticizing it for refusing exam accommodations, the board said that in-person exams conducted at its national center in Dallas "provide the most equitable, fair, secure, and standardized assessment."

The OB-GYN board emphasized that Texas' laws apply to doctors licensed in Texas and to medical care within Texas, specifically. And it noted that its exam dates are kept under wraps, and that there have been "no incidents of harm to candidates or examiners across thousands of in-person examinations."

Democratic state prosecutors, however, warned in their petition that the "web of confusing and punitive state-based restrictions creates a legal minefield for medical providers." Texas is among the states that have banned doctors from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth, and it has reportedly made efforts to get records from medical facilities and professionals in other states who may have provided that type of care to Texans.

The Texas attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment.

States such as California and New York have laws to block doctors from being extradited under other states' laws and to prevent sharing evidence against them. But instances that require leveraging these laws could still mean lengthy legal proceedings.

"We live in a moment where we've seen actions by executive bodies that don't necessarily square with what we thought the rules provided," Rebouché said.

An article published in the journal Nature Metabolism presents an experimental drug that stimulates adipose tissue cells to produce heat through a process known as thermogenesis, thereby promoting weight loss. In animal tests, the compound prevented fat accumulation in response to a high-fat diet, treated existing obesity, and reversed associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance. Preliminary results from clinical research indicate that the substance is safe and may have beneficial metabolic effects on humans.

We observed weight loss and improved blood sugar levels in obese volunteers who participated in the phase 1 clinical trial. But this result isn't conclusive because it was a small group, and the objective was to assess whether the compound is safe and well tolerated. We intend to start phase 2 of the study later this year, which is designed to test its effectiveness in treating obesity."

Carlos Escande, researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Montevideo, Uruguay, and coordinator of the study

The experimental drug, currently called SANA (short for "salicylate-based nitroalkene"), is a derivative of salicylate, a chemical compound with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties found naturally in plants and used to make drugs such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). According to Escande, his group initially sought to develop an anti-inflammatory drug. To this end, they tested several chemical modifications to the salicylate molecule.

"We wanted the precursor used to be as safe as possible. Salicylate is the drug that's been known the longest, and many people consume its derivatives daily. However, we observed that instead of protecting against inflammation, the molecule we synthesized protects against diet-induced obesity," says the researcher.

Two different models were used to test this effect in animals. In the first model, SANA was administered to mice alongside a high-fat diet, which prevented any weight gain. Meanwhile, the animals in the control group gained between 40% and 50% of their body weight over eight weeks. In the second model, treatment began after the animals were obese. After three weeks, the mice had lost 20% of their body mass. There was also a reduction in blood sugar, improved insulin sensitivity, and a decrease in fat accumulated in the liver (a condition known as hepatic steatosis for which there is still no effective pharmacological treatment).

The next step was to investigate the mechanism of action of the substance. Nine Brazilian researchers collaborated on this task: Marcelo Mori, Pedro Vieira and Larissa Menezes dos Reis from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP); William Festuccia and Luiz Osório Leiria from the University of São Paulo (USP); and Juliana Camacho-Pereira, Marina Santo Chichierchio, Gabriele Barbosa, and Leonardo de Souza from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). This stage was supported by FAPESP through three projects (20/04159-8, 21/08354-2 and 22/11234-1).

The experiments showed that SANA specifically targets adipose tissue, activating thermogenesis through an unconventional mechanism. It can therefore be considered the first in a new class of anti-obesity drugs. It does not affect the central nervous or digestive systems or appetite.

As the authors explain, thermogenesis is typically mediated by a protein called UCP1, which is found within mitochondria (the organelles that generate energy for cells). UCP1 is activated in certain situations, such as exposure to cold. It then interferes with the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular fuel. This causes the energy generated by cellular respiration to dissipate as heat. However, this is not the case with SANA. The new drug causes adipocytes to use creatine, a compound formed by three amino acids (arginine, glycine, and methionine), as an energy source to produce heat without involving the UCP1 protein.

"We conducted tests with UCP1-deficient mice [genetically modified to not express the protein] and proved that SANA activates thermogenesis in these animals, even in the absence of UCP1 and under thermoneutral conditions, that is, without exposure to cold," says William Festuccia, a professor at the Biomedical Sciences Institute at USP.

According to the researcher, the observed impact on body temperature is small and does not pose a significant health risk. "Older thermogenic agents, such as dinitrophenol, have an effect on the mitochondria of the entire body, causing a large increase in temperature and overloading the cardiovascular system, which needs to increase blood pressure for blood to reach the periphery and dissipate heat. But in the case of SANA, there's only action on the mitochondria of adipose tissue," he explains.

In experiments coordinated by Marcelo Mori at the Institute of Biology at UNICAMP, it was confirmed that SANA acts on enzymes involved in the so-called "creatine futile cycle," a thermogenic mechanism in which the amino acid compound is repeatedly converted into phosphocreatine and back into creatine, consuming ATP and releasing energy as heat.

"The fact that it's a small molecule and acts through a totally different mechanism allows SANA to be combined with other substances already used in the treatment of obesity, such as GLP-1 analogs [semaglutide and similar]," says Mori. "When we reduce food intake, our body tends to slow down its metabolism. To avoid this plateau effect, it'd be interesting to combine a molecule that inhibits appetite with another that promotes caloric expenditure."

Mori adds that although GLP-1 analogs are effective in combating obesity and controlling blood sugar, they also tend to promote lean mass loss, which is particularly problematic for the elderly. "That's why it's important to have alternatives," he concludes.

Published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, a University of Minnesota research team demonstrated that measuring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater continues to accurately predict COVID-19 infections in a community. 

Between January 2022 and August 2024, the research team examined the correlation between symptomatic COVID-19 in healthcare employees and levels of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - in wastewater. They found that SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater accurately predicted subsequent COVID-19 case counts the following week in the community.

We learned during 2020 that rising SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater provided a two week heads up of coming COVID visits to hospitals and clinics. This ongoing work demonstrates the continued importance of wastewater surveillance to public health planning for our state's hospitals and clinics."

Timothy Shacker, MD, professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and an infectious disease physician with M Health Fairview

The University of Minnesota continues to monitor COVID-19, influenza, RSV, mpox and measles in the wastewater through its Wastewater Surveillance Study. The research team suggests that future work focuses on integrating wastewater surveillance with other epidemiological data sources to develop real-time decision-making frameworks that support public health responses to emerging outbreaks.

This work was supported through a contract with the Minnesota Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A new clinical trial found that taking a popular diabetes and weight-loss drug once weekly significantly improves blood sugar and leads to substantial weight loss in adults with Type 1 diabetes who use automated insulin delivery systems.

The results were published today in the journal NEJM Evidence.

Semaglutide is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor agonists. Sold under the trade names such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus, the drug was initially developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, helping to manage blood sugar levels.

The 26-week, double-blind study involved 72 participants across four medical centers, including Oregon Health & Science University. Researchers found that 36% of patients taking semaglutide met all three key health goals - improved blood glucose levels, reduced time spent in low blood sugar and at least 5% weight loss - compared to none in the placebo group.

Semaglutide helped more people reach their blood sugar and weight goals without decreasing blood sugar."

Andrew Ahmann, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University's School of Medicine, and co-author on the study

Those on semaglutide lost an average of about 18.5 pounds over six months in the study and saw modest improvements in average blood sugar levels (A1C) and the amount of time blood sugar stays in a healthy range, without a higher risk of dangerous low blood sugar or serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis.

While semaglutide is already approved for Type 2 diabetes and obesity, its use in Type 1 diabetes remains investigational. This is the first randomized clinical trial to show that the medication may also be effective in Type 1 diabetes in patients already using automated insulin delivery.

Viral Shah, M.D., of the Indiana University School of Medicine, is senior author on the study. In addition to Shah and Ahmann, other co-authors include Halis Akturk, M.D. and Janet Snell-Bergeon, Ph.D., of University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Davida Kruger, D.N.P., M.D., of Henry Ford Health, Anuj Bhargava, M.D., of Iowa Diabetes Research, Giorgos Bakoyannis, Ph.D., of Indiana University School of Medicine, and Laura Pyle, Ph.D., of the University of Washington.

The research reported in this publication was supported by Breakthrough T1D, Clinicaltrials.gov number NCT05537233.

New research reveals that what men eat, especially a Mediterranean diet or ultra-processed foods, can make a real difference to sperm quality and fertility potential.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers in Italy evaluated the role of the Mediterranean diet (MD) and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) on sperm parameters.

Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after one year of regular, unprotected sex. It affects 15% to 25% of couples, or around 186 million individuals worldwide. Besides, male infertility is often multifactorial, involving genetic factors, lifestyle habits, environmental factors, and medical conditions. Lifestyle factors could negatively affect sperm parameters and overall reproductive health. Adherence to healthy diets, including MD, is associated with improved seminal parameters.

However, the associations between male fertility and UPFs are less well-defined. The optimal intake of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, particularly from food sources, plays a vital role in spermatogenesis. The MD adequately provides these oligo-nutrients. However, UPFs are industrially produced and contain ingredients not found in natural foods (e.g., additives, refined sugars). As such, UPFs lack essential vitamins, fiber, and minerals. UPFs also disproportionately derive calories from carbohydrates (mean 17.4% of total calories), compared to proteins (3.8%) or lipids (8.1%). Increasing literature also links UPF consumption to elevated risks of non-communicable diseases and cancer.

Importantly, while adherence to the MD has been linked to better semen parameters and reproductive capacity, high UPF intake may negatively affect sperm quality.

In the present study, researchers examined the role of MD and UPFs on sperm parameters. Participants were males aged 18–60 attending an Italian Hospital for semen analysis between September 2022 and April 2024. Semen was collected three to seven days after sexual abstinence; semen pH and volume, sperm concentration, cell viability and morphology, and total sperm count were evaluated.

Further, plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and testosterone were measured. The MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire evaluated MD adherence. UPF intake was assessed using the 24-hour Food Recall Questionnaire. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine differences between continuous variables, whereas Fisher's exact or chi-squared test was used for discrete variables.

Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlations between variables. Further, multivariate analyses compared semen parameters strongly associated with UPF intake and MEDAS scores. Logistic regression was performed to assess the associations between ordinal and continuous variables and sperm count ≥ 39 million per ejaculate, and to estimate the corresponding odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The study also excluded individuals with conditions or behaviors known to affect fertility, such as those taking certain medications, those with chronic illnesses, or those engaging in high levels of physical activity (more than 3 hours per week).

Representative scheme summarizing the possible mechanistic influences of dietary patterns on spermatogenesis. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) likely has a direct positive effect on the different cell populations of the seminiferous tubules due to its composition rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and oligo-elements. In parallel, MD may positively influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by enhancing testis sensitivity to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or by reducing negative feedback at the central level. Ultra-processed food intake negatively influences testis function, both because it is inversely related to MD adherence and due to the reduced content of protective factors. Green and red arrows indicate, respectively, positive and negative effects.

The study included 358 males, with a mean age of 34.6 and body mass index (BMI) of 24.4 kg/m². The mean MEDAS score of the sample suggested average MD adherence. MEDAS scores had a significant positive correlation with seminal parameters and a negative correlation with percentage of calories from UPFs (%Kal-UP) and serum LH and FSH levels.

Conversely, %Kal-UP was negatively correlated with all seminal parameters. The MEDAS score and %Kal-UP were not associated with BMI or age, and the correlations between MEDAS or %Kal-UP and semen parameters remained significant after controlling for BMI and age, indicating that these associations are independent of these confounders. Sperm parameters were significantly different across categories of MD adherence, with mean values of total sperm count, progressive motility, sperm viability, and sperm concentration increasing with MD adherence. Meanwhile, FSH levels were lower in individuals with moderate or high MD adherence compared to those with low adherence.

Testosterone and SHBG levels did not differ significantly across MD adherence categories. Since discrete categories of UPFs were unavailable, an unbiased stratification was performed by increasing quartiles of %Kal-UP (Q1–Q4). There was a significant decrease in mean values of total sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive motility, and percentage of sperm with typical morphology from Q1 to Q4.

Notably, individuals in the low MD adherence category and those in Q4 of %Kal-UP exhibited significantly lower values of sperm parameters compared to those in the high adherence category and Q1 of %Kal-UP. Furthermore, participants were stratified into two categories based on FSH levels: normal (<8 IU/mL) and high (>8 IU/mL) for the multivariate analysis.

Among participants with normal FSH levels, the mean values of total sperm count, sperm concentration, percentage of immotile cells, and percentage of progressive motile cells showed a significant decline with increasing quartiles of %Kal-UP. By contrast, individuals with high FSH levels showed no effects on these parameters by %Kal-UP quartiles.

A significant increase in total sperm count and concentration was noted with higher MD adherence, but only in individuals with normal FSH levels. Moderate and high MD adherence categories were associated with a significantly lower risk of low sperm count. On the other hand, Q3 and Q4 of %Kal-UP were associated with a significantly higher risk of total sperm count < 39 million per ejaculate. However, when high FSH levels (≥8 IU/mL, indicative of primary testicular impairment) were included in the analysis, FSH emerged as the dominant predictor of reduced sperm count, and dietary associations became less pronounced.

The authors note that the cross-sectional and observational nature of the study prevents any causal inference. Additionally, UPF intake was estimated from a single 24-hour recall, which can introduce error, and hormonal data were available only for a subset of participants. As a result, findings should be interpreted with caution and validated by further research.

In summary, the study demonstrated significant correlations between MD adherence and UPF intake and seminal parameters. The findings underscored an interplay between plasma FSH levels, MD adherence, UPF intake, and seminal parameters. With high FSH levels, reflecting primary testicular impairment, the dietary pattern had mild or null associations with seminal parameters.

Likewise, UPF intake had fewer associations with sperm parameters. In contrast, with normal FSH, suggestive of preserved testicular function, greater MD adherence was associated with a better seminal profile, while UPF intake showed an opposite association. These findings support the role of dietary interventions as potential modifiable risk factors for managing male infertility, particularly in men with preserved testicular function.

Women who experience complications during pregnancy face a higher risk of stroke in the following decades according to research published in the European Heart Journal today (Tuesday).

The study, which included data on more than two million women over more than 40 years, found an increased risk for women who had diabetes or high blood pressure while pregnant, a preterm delivery or a baby with a low birth weight.

Researchers say these common pregnancy complications could act as an early signal for cardiovascular problems in the future, meaning women could receive help early in life to lower their risk of stroke.

A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, starving brain cells of oxygen and leading to possible cognitive and physical disabilities.

The study was led by Professor Casey Crump from the Department of Family & Community Medicine at UTHealth Houston, USA. He said: "We know that pregnancy is a 'natural stress test' that may reveal higher cardiovascular disease risks long before cardiovascular disease actually develops.

"Up to one-third of all pregnancies are affected by one of these complications. However, the long-term cardiovascular risks for these women remain poorly understood and so are often not considered in their routine clinical care."

The researchers used data from a Swedish national cohort of all 2,201,393 singleton pregnancies between 1973 and 2015. Around 30% of the women (667,774) experienced at least one of the following complications: preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks), a baby born small for their gestational age (among the smallest 10%), high blood pressure during pregnancy including preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure) and pregnancy diabetes (high blood sugar).

Researchers also gathered data on which women went on to experience a stroke in the following years up to 2018 and compared rates of strokes between women who had pregnancy complications and women who did not.

The risk of stroke was almost doubled for women who had high blood pressure (not preeclampsia) or high blood sugar during pregnancy. For women who had a preterm delivery, the risk of stroke was around 40% higher, for women with preeclampsia, the risk was around 36% higher, and for women whose babies were born small for their gestational age, the risk was around 26% higher. Risks were even greater in women who experienced two or more of these complications.

The increased risks were generally highest in the first 10 years after delivery but continued throughout the women's lives even 30 to 46 years after pregnancy. However, for women who had pregnancy diabetes, the increased risk became even higher over time.

The researchers also compared the risk of stroke between sisters in the cohort, who share similar genetic and environmental risk factors for stroke, but they found that this did not fully account for the link between complications during pregnancy and the risk of stroke.

To our knowledge, this study is the largest ever to examine multiple pregnancy complications in relation to long-term stroke risks in the same cohort of women. Also, it is the first to assess whether families might share factors that predispose both to adverse pregnancy outcomes and stroke, but shared familial factors did not appear to explain our findings.

These pregnancy complications share some common features, including placental abnormalities and inflammation, that may potentially affect the structure or function of small blood vessels. Those changes in the small blood vessels sometimes progress further after pregnancy, and this could be one factor in the women's higher risk of stroke.

Both women and their doctors should now recognise that pregnancy complications are an early signal for future stroke risk. This can help us identify high-risk women long before they suffer a stroke or other cardiovascular disease. Women who experience these complications need support to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. These interventions should be implemented as early as possible, followed by long-term monitoring to reduce their stroke risk across the life course."

Professor Casey Crump, Department of Family & Community Medicine, UTHealth Houston

In an accompanying editorial Dr. Abbi Lane from the University of Michigan, USA, said: "Stroke is a major cause of death and disability that may be preceded by distinct risk factors in women vs. men. Understanding earlier life, sex-specific stroke risk factors can help identify high-risk individuals who can be targeted for preventive intervention. The study presented in this issue of European Heart Journal by Crump and colleagues addressed this critical need by rigorously defining the associations between adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and stroke. APOs were not rare; 30% of women had experienced at least one APO. All APOs were significantly associated with stroke over 46 years of follow-up […].

"Perhaps more attention should be paid to the psychological and emotional toll associated with APOs. […] Not only does the complicated pregnancy/birth itself cause stress, but the psychological and/or medical sequelae of the APO can last for months or years. […] Managing medical and neurodevelopmental disorders can lead to months or years of emotional, logistical, and financial strain for parents.

"Effects of psychosocial stress may manifest to eventual stroke via two potentially overlapping pathways: direct physiological effects and poor coping behaviours. There are direct physiological

responses to stress that are also early events in the development of overt stroke risk factors. […] High stress is linked to unfavourable effects on lifestyle and coping behaviours, including

smoking, worse medication adherence, poor diet, low physical activity, and higher body weight.

"Interrupting the cascade from APO to stroke might involve a multifaceted approach to control blood pressure and address modifiable lifestyle habits that influence physical and mental health soon after APOs.

"As APOs occur in ∼30% of parous people and stroke is ∼90% preventable, implementing a multicomponent, preventive intervention aimed at modifiable stroke risk factors soon after delivery seems like an obvious win."

Endoscopies could be replaced by far less invasive capsule sponge tests for half of all patients with Barrett's esophagus, a known precursor to esophageal cancer, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital and Queen Mary University of London.

The capsule sponge test is easier to administer and could be carried out by nurses and at GP practices, reducing the burden on NHS resources.

Esophageal cancer is difficult to treat, with fewer than one in five patients surviving for five or more years following diagnosis, a figure that has barely changed over the past three decades. At the same time, the number of people diagnosed with the disease has increased four-fold since the 1970s.

One of the known risk factors for esophageal cancer is a condition known as Barrett's esophagus, characterised by changes in the shape and structure of cells in the lining of the food pipe (the esophagus). At first, these cells change to resemble those in the lining of the intestines, but over time they can change to a pre-cancerous state known as dysplasia.

Dysplasia may be low-grade or high-grade. Patients with low-grade dysplasia have around a one in 10 chance of developing esophageal cancer, but this risk doubles to one in five for high-grade dysplasia. Dysplasia can be treated without surgery, and treatment greatly reduces the risk of future cancer.

Barrett's esophagus is usually diagnosed after a patient reports symptoms such as persistent heartburn and receives an endoscopy, an invasive procedure that involves passing a camera down into the stomach. However, there are long waiting times for initial endoscopy investigations on the NHS.

Patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus will be monitored to look for dysplasia or early cancer, undergoing regular endoscopies – often 10 or more over their lifetime. Catching the cancer early increases the chances of successful treatment and when the treatment can be performed down the endoscope as a day-case without requiring chemotherapy or an operation.

Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, Director of the Early Cancer Institute at the University of Cambridge and honorary consultant gastroenterologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital, who specializes in Barrett's esophagus, said: "It's extremely important to monitor patients so that we can catch the dysplasia and prevent it developing to cancer – and if someone is unfortunate enough to develop cancer, we can catch it early and treat it.

"But the chances of Barrett's progressing to cancer are low, and endoscopies are not very pleasant procedures. Added to that, endoscopies are not always a reliable way of spotting early cancers and can depend on the skill of the person doing the endoscopy and the equipment being used. What we need is an alternative surveillance method that's less invasive, easier to administer and more reliable."

In recent years, Professor Fitzgerald and colleagues have developed the capsule sponge as an alternative to the endoscope. It involves the patient swallowing a pill connected to a thread. The pill dissolves in the stomach to release a sponge, which, when drawn back up, lightly scrapes off some of the cells in the esophagus.

Samples from the capsule test are stained with a chemical and examined under a microscope. Pathologists look for two key markers – 'red flags' that suggest the cells are pre-cancerous. These are: abnormalities in a protein (known as p53) that helps to prevent tumours developing; and cells that appear abnormal or irregular when examined under a microscope ('atypia').

Most of the research to date on the capsule sponge has focussed on diagnosing Barrett's esophagus. But now, Professor Fitzgerald and her team have turned their attention to monitoring it more effectively with this device.

In research published today in The Lancet, Professor Fitzgerald and colleagues looked at whether it was possible to use the capsule sponge to stratify patients with Barrett's esophagus according to their risk and use this information to determine how they are monitored. Those at highest risk would be seen urgently to see if they need treatment and those at moderate risk would continue to receive endoscopies, but those at lowest risk could continue to be monitored without the need for another endoscopy.

The team recruited 910 patients from 13 hospitals across the UK, all of whom had been diagnosed previously with Barrett's esophagus, and who were undergoing surveillance.

The patients were administered the capsule test, and based on the result, were assigned to one of three groups: high risk, moderate risk, or low risk. All patients also received an endoscopy, and their capsule sponge results were compared with their endoscopy results.

Around 15% of patients were classed as high risk, meaning that they had abnormal p53 and/or atypia. 38% of these patients were found to be at a pre-cancerous stage. Patients with both markers were at the highest risk – 85% of these patients were at a pre-cancerous stage.

Patients with neither of the two markers, but whose Barrett's esophagus was over a certain length and who met other risk factors related to age and sex, were classed as moderate risk.

Over half of the patients (54%) were classed as low risk. These were patients who had neither of the two markers and did not meet other risk factors related to age and sex. Endoscopy revealed that just two of these 495 patients – 0.4% - had a high-grade dysplasia that needed follow-up (and there were no cancers).

Our findings suggest that the capsule sponge could help stratify patients with Barrett's esophagus by risk and that half of them will fall into the low-risk group. Given that the risk of these individuals progressing to dysplasia and then to esophageal cancer is so low, it should be safe to replace their usual endoscopy with the capsule sponge."

Professor Peter Sasieni from the Cancer Research UK Cancer Prevention Trials Unit, Queen Mary University of London

First author Dr W. Keith Tan, Honorary Registrar in Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Addenbrooke's Hospital said: "Our ability to identify patients at low versus high risk using the capsule sponge – which may be as accurate as the current gold standard, endoscopy – is a great step forward. The capsule sponge can be administered easily and quickly by nurses with only limited training required and will not need to take up precious endoscopy resources, which may be better for patients and more cost-effective for the NHS."

Professor Fitzgerald, who is also a Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge added: "We are very excited by these results, which could lead to a test that is much more accessible and less operator dependent to improve standards for monitoring for patients with Barrett's across the NHS and beyond."

The study was supported by Cancer Research UK, Innovate UK, NHS England Cancer Alliance, and Medical Research Council, with infrastructure support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre.

Chief Executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell, said: "Survival rates for esophageal cancer have remained unacceptably low for decades, with fewer than 20% of patients surviving for five or more years after diagnosis. Early detection is vital if we are to change this grim statistic.

"The Cancer Research UK–backed capsule sponge represents one of the most promising breakthroughs in early detection we have seen to date. These new findings bring us closer to transforming the way we diagnose and ultimately treat this disease. If adopted widely, this innovative approach could spare significant numbers of people from discomfort and invasive endoscopies. By bringing this more accessible alternative into community care, we have the potential to save more lives."

Duncan Cook, aged 57, a plumbing and heating engineer from Cambridge, participated in the research. For almost 20 years, Duncan has had regular endoscopies to monitor his Barrett's esophagus. He welcomed the results.

"I have a busy job and being able to have the sponge instead of an endoscopy would be much easier and save a lot of time.

"The first time I had the sponge, I was a bit nervous. It's quite a big pill to swallow, but it's much better than going for endoscopies. The sponge test is faster, you don't need sedation for it, and you don't need to find someone to come with you to drive you home after. I was able to have the test done and go right back to work after."

The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, set to be built on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, will bring together clinical excellence from Addenbrooke's Hospital and world-leading researchers at the University of Cambridge, including Professor Fitzgerald's work, under one roof in a new NHS hospital. It will enable the development and discovery of more non-invasive devices like the capsule sponge, to detect cancer earlier, and save more lives.

As experts sound the alarm over Avian Intestinal Spirochaetosis, new research reveals growing risks to global food security and why protecting both animal and human health has never been more urgent.

Review: Avian intestinal spirochaetosis: an emerging zoonosis. Image Credit: Mai.Chayakorn / Shutterstock

In a recent review in the journal Animal Diseases, researchers collated and discussed nearly 100 prior publications to enhance our understanding of Avian Intestinal Spirochaetosis (AIS), a disease primarily affecting poultry but caused by Brachyspira species that also infect swine.

Stealthy invasion: Brachyspira drills through intestinal mucus using corkscrew-like motion and whip-like flagella, then anchors between gut cells to create a destructive "false brush border" that blocks nutrient absorption.

Despite its devastating economic burden, the disease and its causative agent (Brachyspira spp.) remain largely understudied. While AIS specifically refers to avian infection, other Brachyspira species are responsible for related diseases in swine.

Alarmingly, recent reports have sparked growing concern over AIS's zoonotic (human-infecting) potential, with scientific awareness of zoonotic potential increasing rather than a documented surge in cases and ongoing research into its public health implications. There is currently no commercially available vaccine or standardized treatment for the disease, and standard antibiotic therapies are facing growing limitations due to resistance and regulatory restrictions.

This review synthesizes traditional and cutting-edge research on AIS, focusing on its causes, diagnosis, transmission, and treatment options. It provides examples of human infections, highlighting the disease's human outcomes. It finally identifies gaps in the literature and ongoing research (including a recombinant vaccine candidate tested in layer chickens) that may help nip AIS in the bud, thereby preventing the next significant global zoonotic outbreak.

Dietary weak spot: Layer hens fed wheat-based diets showed 30% higher B. intermedia colonization than those eating sorghum or barley—revealing farm feed choices directly impact vulnerability.

The growing global demand for meat-based food products has had an unintended, yet scary, consequence – a surge in gastrointestinal diseases among livestock, especially birds. Larger poultry farms and higher densities have been shown to increase the frequency of disease transmission, resulting in outbreaks that rapidly spread across adjoining farms.

Less prevalent than their respiratory counterparts, some gastrointestinal diseases, such as Avian Intestinal Spirochaetosis (AIS), are highly disruptive, with outbreaks causing devastating economic loss (~£18 million annually in the UK alone).

AIS is a chronic bacterial infection in poultry (particularly in layer and breeder hens) caused by the colonization of the host's lower gastrointestinal tract, especially the caeca and colon, by Brachyspira spp. (primarily B. pilosicoli, B. intermedia, and B. alvinipulli).

AIS results in chronic diarrhea, poor egg quality, delayed laying turnaround, weight loss, and increased mortality, particularly in layer and broiler breeder hens. Despite these impacts and the growing global burden of AIS, the disease and its causative agents (mainly these three Brachyspira species in birds) remain underreported and poorly understood.

Hidden human damage: Infected people's gut biopsies show spirochetes clinging to colon cells like "fringes," often with telltale eosinophil surges and distinct "pseudoappendicitis" symptoms that mimic other bowel diseases.

Transmission vectors include not only direct contact but also wild birds and rodents, which play a significant role in disease spread and pose biosecurity challenges.

Significantly, humans can also contract Brachyspira infections through close contact with, or the consumption of, infected meat. The resultant colonic spirochaetosis is characterized by a range of gastrointestinal symptoms, most often chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rectal bleeding, and sometimes weight loss.

Many cases are asymptomatic, but the risk is higher among immunocompromised individuals or those in environments with poor hygiene. Severe outcomes, including ulcerative colitis, invasive spirochetemia, and rarely death, are also reported, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Disease diagnosis relies on traditional microbiology or newer molecular (genetic sequencing) techniques. Unfortunately, recent bans on antibiotic use in poultry rearing and the rising drug resistance in AIS strains hinder treatments, exacerbating disease spread and necessitating a better understanding of its epidemiology.

Mechanism of in vivo intestinal colonization by Brachyspira spp

Kitchen-counter fighters: Olive oil waste ("alperujo") fermented into feed cut chicken infections by half in trials, while cinnamon extract (cinnamaldehyde) blocked Brachyspira growth in lab tests—offering pantry-shelf alternatives to antibiotics.

The present review aims to synthesize and elucidate current scientific knowledge on AIS by collating outcomes from over 95 publications across four scientific repositories (Google Scholar, PubMed Central, PubMed, and CAS) to unravel the disease's epidemiology, human and veterinary impacts, thereby informing future research efforts and policy reform.

It highlights the limitations of conventional prevention strategies while revealing ongoing intervention development that may turn the tide on AIS in the future. Finally, the review discusses colonic spirochaetosis and the bacteria's zoonotic potential. It underscores the need for improved surveillance and integrated approaches to animal and human health to prevent widespread AIS-associated panic and economic loss.

The present review identifies and highlights several key points regarding Brachyspira spp. and their associated infections:

Overall, the review highlights AIS as a rising economic, agricultural, and public health threat.

AIS is emerging as a significant veterinary and zoonotic issue. The ongoing global intensification of poultry farming, alongside recent antibiotic restrictions, has increased disease risk and transmission potential. While conventional diagnostics and antibiotic therapies have limitations, advances in molecular detection, probiotic interventions, and a new recombinant vaccine offer hope.

However, further field validation and regulatory support are needed. Spirochaetosis remains an underreported and understudied disease. When considering its zoonotic potential, a ‘One Health' approach, integrating animal and human surveillance strategies, is imperative. Coordinated research, veterinary practice, and public health policy efforts are essential to contain AIS and protect poultry production and human well-being.

When U.S. Soccer first introduced Pride number kits in 2017, Tierna Davidson hadn't yet received her first senior team call-up.

So, as a young queer fan and youth National Team player, Davidson watched the USWNT and USMNT suit up in jerseys that celebrated her community.

“It felt really appropriate for the team,” Davidson said. “The team has historically always been a beacon for the queer community and to wear the numbers just felt really fitting. ... I think they were probably one of the first sports teams to do that. I feel like I hadn't seen that in sports before.”

It wasn't long until Davidson got a chance to wear the number herself. After winning an NCAA title later that year with Stanford, the defender earned her first cap in January 2018. She started the first six games of the year before Pride month rolled around, and made her seventh appearance in the June international window.

She remembers the special moment, the moment she got a chance to showcase the rainbow-styled number on the back of her jersey. It also came with a victory in a 1-0 win against China PR in Sandy, Utah.

“It just felt so important to be able to represent myself, to be able to represent other queer individuals, and be able to celebrate that,” Davidson said. “But also just to feel the gravitas that the queer community has in our team and the importance we all felt to represent them. I think especially at the time I first wore the Pride jersey, there was a lot of representation on the team, so it was just fun, almost a community builder. It was like a Pride party on the field.”

U.S. Soccer National Teams have kept up the tradition of wearing the jerseys during Pride month, which embraces the different identities and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals.

Every June, USMNT defender Tim Ream's phone blows up after the team wears the jerseys for the first time each year. Within hours of the final whistle, he's getting texts asking, “Can you save me one?” or “Can you have more made?” Not everyone who reaches out is a big sports fan, but the Pride numbers always catch their attention.

The messages demonstrate to Ream and his teammates one of the most beautiful aspects of soccer — that everyone belongs.

“I think everybody gets really excited about the uniqueness of the jerseys, but also the idea, the reminder to everyone that you know we all come from different walks of life,” Ream said. “We all have different ideas, and we may identify as one way or another, but we're all included. We are all together.”

Like Ream, former USWNT midfielder Samantha Mewis also donned the shirts in the inaugural year in 2017. Mewis felt like it was a “beautiful statement of support” from U.S. Soccer but also a tribute to the fans.

The jerseys also created a conduit for Mewis to have deeper, eye-opening conversations with those around her. She didn't understand some of the battles her teammates were facing with being accepted by their families.

“I remember feeling really moved by that and recognizing that it was going to be really important for me to be an ally and advocate for the celebration of Pride and advocate for the LGBTQ community,” Mewis said.

Mewis' support also extends to her older sister Kristie, also a former National Team player, who recently had a baby with her fiancé, Australian and Chelsea FC star Sam Kerr. Her sister,Samantha is uniquely aware of how much it matters.

“I know that community is going through a lot right now and have a difficult time with some of their human rights and generally just being pretty targeted,” Mewis said. “I think that especially right now, Pride is important to me ... they bring so much to the table, and they bring so much to our world.”

For Davidson, Pride means celebration, but it's also about protest.

According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than one in five hate crimes is motivated by anti-LGBTQ+ bias. She understands just how important it is to uplift and create a safe space for the collective group.

When U.S. Soccer first launched the rainbow numbered jerseys, it was not very common to find many in sports pushing that envelope, Davidson recalls. It was important then to promote that message, but the continual support now is even greater.

“Especially in these times that we're living in at the moment, where the future is a little bit uncertain for minority groups, I think it's really important that we maintain that representation, that we maintain that positive support of our community,” Davidson said. “And that no matter what we're still there to support and we're still there to include queer people in our community. No matter what community they might be getting tossed out of, we will always be there for them.

“I think that's so important for us to continue to put out, not just with the rainbows and with the numbers, but also with our actions.”

Entering the CONCACAF Gold Cup, it seemed all but certain that the U.S. Men's National Team's longtime starting goalkeeper Matt Turner would retain his position between the sticks, despite his lack of game time in recent years bouncing around the Premier League.

However, even though backups Patrick Schulte and Zack Steffen were both forced to miss the competition due to injuries, head coach Mauricio Pochettino has still opted to bench Turner, with 26-year-old New York City FC's Matt Freese handed the starting role in all three of the USMNT's group games.

The move has left Turner, who spent this past season on loan at Crystal Palace from Nottingham Forest, winning the FA Cup as backup to Dean Henderson, watching on yet again as his teammates have gone on to win three games in a row.

This decision has not gone down well with former USMNT star turned analyst Herculez Gomez, who recently admitted on Futbol Americas that he does not “understand why Matt Freese is playing.”

“If Matt Turner is the goalkeeper with the most international experience and the one thing that he has lacking right now is games, sharpness, why not give him these games, these minutes?” he went on to ask. “Matt Freese is fourth, fifth-best option you have right now, realistically, because Patrick Schulte is not here, Zack Steffen is not here, because insert goalkeeper who was there at the last camp isn't here.

“And you go to Matt Freese? I do not, for the life of me, know why he is starting in these games.”

What's more, Gomez added that if he were in Turner's shoes, he'd be wondering why he was still in camp, especially with a $9.1 million transfer to French side Lyon seemingly set to be completed this summer, as per ESPN.

Should Turner's move to Ligue 1 go through, he could soon take over as the starter if Brazilian Lucas Perri is pried away this summer, with Italian side Roma linked, via Tom Bogert. Alternatively, should Perri remain in France, Turner faces yet another tough battle for gametime, one which a solid summer could help.

“If I am Matt Turner, I'm thinking to myself, ‘What the hell am I doing here? Why am I not with Lyon right now? I could be helping my situation, helping myself win a starting position in case the starting goalkeeper they have right now doesn't get sold to Roma. I've gotta battle it out with him, get myself an edge. What am I doing at the Gold Cup backing this guy up?'” Gomez said.

But Gomez's issue wasn't just with Pochettino's decision to start Freese, but also with the NYCFC shot stopper's blunder against Haiti, where his misplaced pass all but handed Louicius Don Deedson a goal on a silver platter.

“This isn't club soccer, you should be expecting to deal with that, clear it out, put your foot through it or let it come across your body, play it the other way. But you cannot make that mistake, ” Gomez claimed.

He later added that "If you're a goalkeeper, it's the terrible thing about being a goalkeeper, those mistakes are going to be a goal. If I'm Matt Turner, I'm just besides myself that I'm not the starting goalkeeper in this competition, that Mauricio Pochettino is robbing me.

“As bad as you as think he's been, he's still the best option you have - and you're not giving him the minutes he desperately needs.”

It remains to be seen whether or not Pochettino will return to Turner for the knockout round, with the USMNT scheduled to take on Costa Rica in the quarterfinals on Sunday.

Awful Announcing

FIFA has come under scrutiny for the newly expanded Club World Cup for several reasons. It's not just the cash grab of the tournament and competitive quality, but also how the world soccer governing body has approached playing in the United States.

After FIFA President Gianni Infantino cozied up to Donald Trump in the Oval Office, FIFA's consistent anti-racism and anti-discrimination messages at international tournaments were conspicuous by their absence. After FIFA received backlash, it was displayed for one day to commemorate the “International Day for Countering Hate Speech.”

The decision to quietly shelve the messaging is reminiscent of the NFL choosing not to put an “End Racism” message in the endzone of the Super Bowl after multiple years of doing so.

The fact that both sports leagues have chosen to forego taking principled stands in the second Trump era has seen many commentators connect the dots to the Trump administration's crackdown on both DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies and immigration.

One of those commentators is former ESPN personality Jemele Hill. As part of her Spolitics focus on the crossover between sports and politics, Hill had pointed words for FIFA and Infantino in particular. She played a cut of his infamous speech proclaiming that he was Arab, African, gay, and disabled in an attempt to preach unity and inclusion. She compared it to ICE hovering over the Club World Cup in the United States.



“Considering that Trump and his administration have gone all-in on anything not white, male, heterosexual, or Christian under attack, perhaps Infantino decided that just for the Club World Cup, let's just let racism feel a little more at home. Since there is clearly widespread support for it in this presidential administration,” Hill said.

Hill noted that sports organizations have tended to support social justice causes when it has been politically and culturally convenient for them to do so, but back down when it comes to more than optics.

“I've long let go of any hope that leagues, teams, and other sports organizations actually care about making any real impact when it comes to social justice. They care about looking racist. They don't care about being racist. They care about performance and optics. Meanwhile the players that power their leagues are impacted by the social issues that they readily abandon when it's time to take a real stand. Surely Infantino isn't oblivious to the fact that the Club World Cup just as ICE is cosplaying as modern day slave catchers across this country,” Hill added.”

Despite the controversy, Jemele Hill doesn't think calls to boycott next year's World Cup in North America will have a significant impact, given the importance of sports in society, especially among those in power.

“Some have suggested that FIFA should withdraw next year's World Cup from the United States. But considering the World Cup has been in Qatar and Russia, I'm going to go out on a limb and say moral compass of a country isn't a high priority for them. Others have encouraged people to boycott the World Cup and the Club World Cup but I can't say I anticipate there will be any major needle moving in that direction because people love their sports. Which is the reason countries who are shaky when it comes to human rights and dictatorships love to use sports as a shield to cover up the ugliness they don't want the world to see. I'm Jemele Hill and I approved this message” she concluded.

Currently stealing the show for Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. Men's National Team at the CONCACAF Gold Cup, midfielder Malik Tillman may soon need to adjust his return flight to Europe.

The PSV star, 23, has long been linked with a return to the Bundesliga, having previously worked his way through the Bayern Munich academy before moving to the Netherlands on a permanent deal in the summer of 2024.

However, while a Munich move may be Tillman's dream, it's Bayer Leverkusen that is currently leading the chase for the former Rangers star.

It emerged on Monday that Erik ten Hag's side had pinpointed Tillman as the heir apparent to Florian Wirtz, who recently joined Liverpool for a fee which could reach $158 million, as per Florian Plettenberg.

Leverkusen are said to be considering triggering Tillman's release clause, with the Bundesliga runners-up planning further talks soon.

While Tillman is under contract with PSV through the summer of 2028, and the American played a pivotal role in their back-to-back Eredivisie title wins during his two seasons in the Netherlands, ultimately, the chances of him making the move to Germany are said to be high, according to Rik Elfrink.

However, should they decide to enter the race, Munich could yet bring Tillman back as the Bundesliga champions have the option to match any offers made for the USMNT star. Alternatively, as noted by Elfrink, should PSV hold on to Tillman for another season, the Bavarian giants could activate his buyback clause in the summer of 2026, worth €35 million.

Exactly how much Leverkusen would need to offer to convince PSV to part ways with their midfield maestro remains unclear. However, as per AD, the Dutch side is said to be seeking a fee reminiscent of the roughly $45 million they received for Cody Gakpo from Liverpool in 2022 to consider letting him go.

Alternatively, should Munich look to beat Leverkusen to Tillman's signature, either this summer or next, this would represent the culmination of a “dream” for the American.

“It is my dream to return to Bayern in the future, although I know they already have great players,” Tillman previously told ED. “I grew up in Bavaria, my mother lives there and quite a few people who have followed me for years. Many know some things by now regarding my contract at PSV.”

For the meantime, Tillman's focus will remain on the Gold Cup, where he has made the most of his opportunity to lead the USMNT's midfield in the absences of Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic.

With three goals in as many games for Pochettino's side, the Argentine has been left extremely impressed by the young star, commenting after their recent 2-1 win over Haiti, “What a player, no?”

“What a player that is showing this, all his talent and capacity,” the former Tottenham Hotspur boss said, as per ESPN. “Because this type of player, the talent that he has shown with every single game and then with the capacity without ball, the work ethic in the way that he really is aggressive, he recovered a lot of balls.

“He's always trying to help the deep press, chasing back, playing in different positions. He can appear like a No. 10 in training, between the lines, using the half space, but can be in the right or left side, wide. Or he can drop and play like a No. 8, No. 6. I think, 'What a talented player.' So pleased with him.”

Tillman and the USMNT will return to action in the quarterfinal against Costa Rica on Sunday.

Seattle Reign FC midfielder Ainsley McCammon has been called up to U.S. Under-19 and Under-18 women's National Team camp. The teams will come together from June 24-July 1 for a joint training camp at McCurry Park in Fayetteville, Georgia. All Players in Camp are Age-Eligible for 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

“"Ainsley's invitation to the U-19s as they build toward the 2026 World Cup is a tremendous opportunity. She continues to grow every day at our club, and being part of this team now sets her up to make an impact when it matters most down the road,” said Reign FC General Manager Lesle Gallimore.

The players from both age groups will be divided into two teams for the camp featuring players from both age groups. The joint camp is part of the Federation's U.S. Way philosophy which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the full U.S. Women's National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship. 

For the U-19s, 22 players were named with 20 born in 2006 and two born in 2007, while the U-18 roster also features 24 players, all born in 2007. McCammon is one of two NWSL players called up for the U-19 WNT camp. 

McCammon, who has appeared in seven matches for the Reign this season, attended the USA Futures Camp earlier this year and was called up for the FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup in 2024. She previously served as the captain for the U.S. U-17 WYNT during its run to the Concacaf U-17 Championship title and won the Concacaf U-15 Championship with the U.S. U-15 WYNT.

Alabama is one of just two collegiate programs to have a pair of players represented on the U-18 National Team training camp roster

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -  Alabama's Olivia Belcher and Maddie Padelski have been called up to the U.S. U-18 National Team Training Camp, the United States soccer organization announced Tuesday. The camp will host players from both the U-18 and U-19 age groups and will run from June 24-July 1 in Fayetteville, Ga. 

Players from both the U-18 and U-19 training camps will be intermixed and divided into two teams as all players at the joint camp are eligible for the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. Alabama and North Carolina are the lone collegiate programs to have two players named to the U-18 women's national team camp roster. Additionally, Padelski is one of seven players that earned a bronze medal with the United States at the 2024 U-17 Women's World Cup.

FIFA is throwing a gala to “celebrate” the Club World Cup at a venue on Wall Street in New York City – and attendees are being charged thousands of dollars to party with its President Gianni Infantino and, according to the co-organizers, FIFA World Cup stars.

The co-organizers Big Art (an international event management company) promoted the event on Instagram with an attached link to book tickets via a WhatsApp sales representative.

The representative described the event as “the official celebration of the FIFA Club World Cup finals.” The event promised a headline performance by the British popstar Rita Ora and “world class entertainment curated throughout the night.”

Ticket prices start at $1,000 per person for a silver category entry, rising to $2,000 for platinum entry and $3,000 for a black category entry. Promotion on Big Art's Facebook page said the “VIP event will gather Legends of the game, FIFA's top leadership and a handpicked guest list of international figures from business, fashion and culture.”

A sales representative said in their opening message on WhatsApp that Infantino will attend, before adding that Kaka, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Roberto Baggio will also be there. All four players have either been involved in sponsorship activations, or spoken positively about the tournament or attended games with FIFA during the Club World Cup.

The event is scheduled to take place on July 10, a day after the second semi-final and three days before the final.

A spokesperson for FIFA confirmed FIFA and Big Art are working together on a gala dinner and that FIFA is both attending and co-branding. It added that FIFA attendees are still to be confirmed.

The Big Art sales representative also said that this paid-for entry represented a “rare opportunity to align your brand with FIFA and engage directly with global decision-makers, influencers and icons from across the world.”

FIFA did not comment when asked by The Athletic what role it had in the pricing of the event, or whether it is appropriate for individuals or brands to spend thousands of dollars to engage directly with FIFA leadership.

FIFA said it would not receive any revenue from the event but had not replied by the point of publication about who the revenue will go to.

FIFA subsequently promoted the event on its website, without mentioning the prices, but said that the night “will begin with a cocktail reception, followed by a gala dinner featuring world-class cuisine, fine wines and high-end production befitting the truly historic and game changing tournament.”

Big Art have been contacted for comment.

Last month, the first ticketing packages for next summer's men's World Cup went on sale with the release of a collection of high-end hospitality options.

The initial release was limited to certain hospitality offerings involving several games packaged together, starting at $3,500 (£2,625) per person and climbing to an eye-popping $73,200 (£54,750).

 Contributor. 

In the U.S. men's national team's seemingly endless search for a No. 9 - aka a striker - the Americans hope they have found one in Patrick Agyemang.

It's not just because he has scored five goals in nine appearances since making his international debut in January. It is also the way he performs on the pitch. He is hungry going forward and to score.

Agyemang, 24, doesn't wait for the ball to be passed to him at his feet in the penalty area. He tries to make things happen, whether he is using his speed, soccer IQ or physicality.

Case in point:

In the USA's 2-1 victory over Haiti in its Group D finale in the Concacaf Gold Cup on Sunday, June 22, Agyemang was denied by goalkeeper John Placide in the 24th minute.

In soccer, it is sometimes better to have amnesia and forget about the past and worry about the future.

In the 75th minute, Agyemang had another opportunity. He latched onto a long feed from left back John Tolkin on the left flank. He raced into the penalty area and pulled Placide out of the net. Instead of ramming the ball into the empty goal, he put just enough momentum on it to roll safely into the lower right corner for what proved to be the game-winner and his second goal of the tournament.

“Me and John, we talked about that pass,” Agyemang told FOX Sports afterwards. “He played the ball perfectly for me. Once I saw the keeper come on, compose yourself, take your time and around the goalkeeper, and once I got there, just finished.”

According to OptaJack, Agyemang has scored five goals in his first nine international appearances, tying him Jozy Altidore for the sixth-fewest games needed to score five times for the USMNT.

"Patrick is doing a fantastic job for the team," USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said at the post-game press conference. "All that he gave to the team today and the previous games also, he's a fantastic striker. Still room to improve, but we are so happy with him."

Agyemang (pronounced Aaw-jee-mawn) has a great feel-good backstory, taking a path that not many national team players have followed.

The son of Ghanaian parents, he began his college career at a Division III school - Eastern Connecticut State University. Most high-profile players will attend Division I schools right off the bat, climb through a club's academy or go to Europe at a relatively young age.

The 6-foot-4, 196-lb. striker recorded 30 goals and added 10 assists in his first two seasons at Eastern Connecticut, while earning D-III All-American honors. He also was named Little East Conference player of the year as a sophomore. Agyemang transferred to the University of Rhode Island (Division I) and connected for 19 goals and 12 assists in his final two seasons as he wound up on the MAC Hermann Award Watch List.

He was chosen by Charlotte FC as the 12th overall selection of the 2023 MLS SuperDraft. Not seeing much time with the first team (182 minutes total) as a rookie, Agyemang scored 10 goals in only a dozen matches for Crown Legacy FC (MLS NEXT Pro).

With some seasoning and a year of professional soccer under his left, Agyemang enjoyed a breakout sophomore season in 2024, pacing Charlotte FC with 10 goals. Not many MLS teams can say that their top goal-scorer is a U.S. citizen.

Agyemang's production caught the eye of Pochettino, who called him into January camp and for a pair of international friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica. He acquitted himself well, scoring once in each of those contests.

In his debut match against Venezuela on Jan. 18, Agyemang demonstrated how lethal he can be. A pass from Matko Miljevic was deflected into his path on the left flank.

“Once that ball breaks through, I'm like 1 v 1. My best position,” Agyemang said. “I love it. I see the keeper come on. I step into it. I love getting the shot off my left foot. And I knew I was confident to strike it through."

And into the back of the net in the 39th minute.

“I don't think many defenders like running with me, and I take advantage of it," he added.

Four days later on Jan. 22, Agyemang came off the bench to give the Americans some 90th-minute insurance in a 2-0 win over Costa Rica in Orlando, Fla. He became the 12th player to score in both of his first two USMNT caps, and the first since Ricardo Pepi in 2021.

Agyemang and his teammates will face the Costa Ricans again, this time in Minneapolis in the Concacaf Gold quarterfinals on Sunday, June 29. This encounter, however, won't just a friendly but in the quarterfinals of the Concacaf Gold Cup.

“The Gold Cup is a tough tournament,” Agyemang told FOX Sports. “I think with our squad we know our quality, and as long as we put the effort and the heart into it, we let our play show.”

Agyemang is far from perfect. He has struggled holding onto the ball and his passing isn't always spot on, which is important for someone with his height who also can be a target payer. So, he still has some work to do.

The bottom line, however, for a striker is the top line of the scoreboard, a in putting the ball into the back of the net.

The USMNT hasn't had two players who can put the ball away on a consistent basis since the Landon Donovan-Clint Dempsey era of more than a decade ago. They finished their national team careers with 57 goals apiece.

Strikers and forwards, especially on the USMNT, can come and go, and run hot and cold, whether it is through injury, form or a coach's preference. Their prime-time years usually run from 22 to 30, although there are exceptions of the age spectrum (see Lionel Messi, who turned 38 on Tuesday, June 24, and Cristiano Ronaldo, 40, as two prime examples).

As we have learned this year, strikers can live a fragile existence.

Here are just five recent examples of their rollercoaster life:

* Ricardo Pepi, 22, who has turned into a lethal presence for PSV Eindhoven (17 goals in 28 matches across all competitions. He was an obvious choice to play this summer but was sidelined with a serious knee injury in January. He hasn't played since.

* Folarin Balogun, 23, was selected to the Gold Cup roster, but had to be pulled due to an ankle injury. He missed two months with a dislocated shoulder while performing for Monaco in French Ligue 1.

* Josh Sargent, 25, who has filled the net for Norwich City in the English Championship (he tallied 15 goals this season), hasn't scored for the national team since a 4-0 win over Cuba in 2019. He didn't do much in the Concacaf Nations League in March and was left off the Gold Cup roster by head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

* Haji Wright, 27, who connected for a goal at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, has an Achilles injury and he was sent home during the tournament. His next game will be for Coventry City later this summer.

* Damion Downs, 20, also incurred an injury during the tournament and wasn't available as a substitute in the Haiti match. He competes for FC Köln in the Budesliga.

Christian Pulisic, who is not playing in the Gold Cup, is a forward and the team's best attacking option. The A.C. Milan standout is much better suited as a player, not a target man, who can run at the opposition and set up teammates for assists or score goals himself.

Besides, the more options Pochettino or any national team has up front, the better.

To borrow a baseball phrase about pitching, you can never have enough dangerous forwards on your roster.

On June 24, 2025, it is difficult to predict whether Agyemang, or any other No. 9 will be on the USMNT roster for next year's World Cup.

It likely will come down to whether they are fit and in form, healthy and whether Pochettino feels like he is best suited for the team.

So far, so very good for the Charlotte FC forward.

If Patrick Agyemang can stay healthy, keep up his production for club and country and improve and hone his skills through the next year, we just might see him on the U.S. roster for the 2026 World Cup.

FIFA Club World Cup

Nicolas Jackson's Club World Cup ban has been extended to two matches after FIFA reviewed his red card tackle on Ayrton Lucas during Chelsea's 3-1 defeat against Flamengo.

The Senegal international's studs-up tackle in the 68th minute at Lincoln Financial Field prompted a straight red card, ensuring that he would be suspended at least for Chelsea's final group match against Esperance de Tunis in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

After the match Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca questioned whether Jackson's red card was justified, but following a review of the tackle FIFA has upgraded his punishment to two games — meaning he will miss Chelsea's last-16 match should they qualify from Group D.

Jackson apologised to his Chelsea team-mates for the tackle in the dressing room after the match, and later issued a public apology on Instagram to supporters.

He was not involved in Chelsea open training at Subaru Park on Monday, with Maresca explaining that he only wanted players available to face Esperance to be involved in the session.

ATLANTA — Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-20 Women's National Team training camp to be held from June 24 – July 1 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.

The upcoming camp functions as part of the Federation's U.S. Way philosophy which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the full U.S. Women's National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

This roster is made up of players who were born in 2005 and were not part of the team that competed at the 2025 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship in Costa Rica. As players born in 2005 are too old for the next FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2026, this training camp serves as an opportunity for them to continue developing within U.S. WNT programs with hopes of moving along the pathway to U.S. U-23 WNT and beyond.

University of New Mexico assistant coach Karley Nelson will run the camp. Nelson was on the coaching staff for the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup Team that finished third in the tournament.

Seven players on this roster have played for the USA in a FIFA Youth Women's World Cup: Valentina Amaral, Mia Bhuta, Charlotte Kohler, Melina Rebimbas, Victoria Safradin, Sammy Smith and Taylor Suarez. Suarez also competed at the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Colombia.

Midfielder Amy Lopez, a Dallas, Texas native, is the only professional on the roster as she plays in Liga MX Femenil for Chivas de Guadalajara.

The squad features 17 players from the U-20 WNT's training camp in May, and 17 colleges are represented. Ohio State, TCU, and Virginia each have two players on the roster, and Stanford has four: Smith, Bhuta, midfielder Shae Harvey Kohler. Harvey also represented the USA at Concacaf World Cup Qualifiers for the U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team in 2022.

Goalkeepers (3): Valentina Amaral (Wake Forest; Oviedo, Fla.), Cecilia Cerone (Princeton; Dallas, Texas), Victoria Safradin (Virginia; Eastlake, Ohio)

Defenders (7): Hailey Baumann (Wisconsin; South Lyon, Mich.), Kennedy Bell (Maryland; Charlotte, N.C.), Ava Bramblett (Ohio State; Noblesville, Ind.), Bella Gaetino (UNC; Dexter, Mich.), Cameron Patton (TCU; Austin, Texas), Sammy Smith (Stanford; Boise, Idaho), Kaelyn Wolfe (Penn State; West Chester, Pa.)

Midfielders (8): Mia Bhuta (Stanford; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Ella Carter (Virginia; Leesburg, Va.), Shae Harvey (Stanford; Hermosa Beach, Calif.), Amy Lopez (Chivas de Guadalajara; Dallas, Texas), Isabella Najera (Michigan State; St. Charles, Ill.), Melina Rebimbas (Alabama; Warren, N.J.), Kiera Staude (Georgia; Atlanta, Ga.), Taylor Suarez (Florida State; Charlote, N.C.)

Forwards (6): Katie Collins (South Carolina; Gallatin, Tenn.), Isabella Diorio (TCU; Homer Glen, Ill.), Faith George (USC; Laguna Hills, Calif.), Charlotte Kohler (Stanford; Woodside, Calif.), Amanda Schlueter (Ohio State; Union, Ky.), Olivia Woodson (Auburn; Richmond, Va.)

The US men's national team continue their quest for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup crown on Sunday when facing Group B runner-up Costa Rica in the quarterfinals.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's roster includes 15 MLS players, giving veterans and rising stars alike the opportunity to impress. The 2025 Gold Cup serves as the program's last tournament preparation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the US will co-host alongside Canada and Mexico.

The USMNT rebounded from a four-match winless streak heading into the tournament and have won three in a row in their quest for an eighth Gold Cup title. Only Mexico (nine) have won more.

While it wasn't all smooth sailing, the USMNT won three straight matches to top Group D. Following a 5-0 victory over Trinidad & Tobago, Pochettino's side grinded out a pair of one-goal wins against Saudi Arabia and Haiti.

Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang has scored twice, including the match-winner against Haiti. He's second on the team in goals scored behind Malik Tillman (three).

New York City FC goalkeeper Matt Freese has conceded just once, while right back Alex Freeman (Orlando City) has started every match. Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake) and Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps FC) continue to impress in midfield.

Costa Rica narrowly finished second in Group A – a single goal separating them from first-place Mexico after the sides played to a 0-0 draw.

Miguel Herrera's side opened the tournament with a wild 4-3 victory over Suriname; a Manfred Ugalde penalty kick in second-half stoppage time was the difference. The Ticos then overcame the Dominican Republic, 2-1, with Ugalde again converting from the spot – his third PK of the tournament – and Josimar Alcócer scoring the winner five minutes from full time.

New York City FC forward Alonso Martínez has also scored and started each match, while Ariel Lassiter (Portland Timbers) made one substitute appearance before reportedly fracturing his hand.

ATLANTA (June 20, 2025) – Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp in Commerce City, Colorado that will run from June 23-July 2. From June 23-June 26, the camp will run concurrently with the U.S. Women's National Team so U.S. head coach Emma Hayes and her staff can observe trainings. The U-23s will also attend the USA vs. Ireland match on June 26 at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park. The U-23s will stay in Denver to train after the USWNT leaves for Cincinnati and then Washington, D.C. to finish its slate of matches.

The U.S. U-23s are coming off a pair of games in late May and early June in Germany where it split matches with its German counterparts as each team won one game by a 2-1 score. Nine players on the roster for Colorado were in Germany, but four additional players who were with the U-23s last month – goalkeeper Angelina Anderson, defenders Jordyn Bugg and Lilly Reale and midfielder Sam Meza -- will be with the senior USWNT in Colorado.

The U-23 programming in Colorado is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team.

“Players from the Futures Camp in January and the two U-23 camps this year, in LA and Germany, are now getting senior team call-ups and that's what we want to see,” said Hayes. “It doesn't mean that some of these players won't be in with the 23s down the line, or that some U-23 players who haven't been called up yet to the full team won't get their chances, but this is the kind of symbiosis we want between programs. We want to do what's best for the players to give them National Team exposures so they are as prepared as possible for '27, '28 and even '31.”

Goalkeepers (3): Emmie Allen (Bay FC; High Point, N.C.), Mia Justus (Utah Royals FC; Lakewood, Ohio), Madison Prohaska (Seattle Reign FC; West Chester, Ohio)

Defenders (8): Lauren Flynn (Utah Royals FC; Arlington, Va.), Heather Gilchrist (Florida State; Boulder, Colo.), Emily Mason (Seattle Reign FC; Flemington, N.J.), Quincy McMahon (San Diego Wave; Highlands Ranch, Colo.), Makenna Morris (Washington Spirit; Germantown, Md.), Ayo Oke (CF Pachuca; Lawrenceville, Ga.), Jayden Perry (Portland Thorns FC; Trabuco Hills, Calif.), Evelyn Shores (UNC; Atlanta, Ga.)

Midfielders (7): Maggie Graham(Houston Dash; Atlanta, Ga.),Taylor Huff (Bay FC; Mansfield, Ohio), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; Roswell, Ga.), Ally Lemos (Orlando Pride; Glendora, Calif.), Yuna McCormack (Florida State; Mill Valley, Calif.), Sally Menti (Seattle Reign FC; Seattle, Wash.), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.)Forwards (6): Emeri Adames (Seattle Reign FC; Red Oak, Texas), Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; Edina, Minn.), Simone Jackson (Orlando Pride; Redondo Beach, Calif.), Giana Riley (Florida State; Manteca, Calif.), Jaedyn Shaw (North Carolina Courage; Frisco, Texas), Riley Tiernan (Angel City FC; Voorhees, N.J.)

The U.S. U-23 WNT roster features players that span five birth years from 2006 to 2002, which is the age cut-off for players to be a part of the U.S. U-23 WNT this year.

This U-23 camp will be led by Yolanda Thomas, who is an assistant coach with the 2024 NWSL Champion Orlando Pride.

Heimo Schirgi's first big job in soccer was as head of operations for UEFA, the largest and most influential of the global game's six geographic confederations. Part of that job involved planning and managing the UEFA Champions League, the largest and most influential club soccer competition in the world.

So when Schirgi moved into his current job as FIFA's chief operating officer for the World Cup, he brought with him the knowledge that the Champions League, for all its prestige and gravitas, also had one weakness: its field was limited to the 55 soccer-playing countries of Europe.

“You have all these club competitions on a confederation, continental level, right?” he said. “But you don't have it on a global level. You never had clubs from South America competing against European clubs in a serious tournament with high stakes.

“I'm personally interested how the rest of the world's clubs are going to fare. There's only one way to find out.”

 Soccer 

Thieb Delaporte-Richard says he wanted the “spirit” of Los Angeles and surrounding areas to be reflected in the official poster for the World Cup in L.A.

That one way is the FIFA Club World Cup, which kicked off in the U.S. 10 days ago. And while the tournament has many flaws, it has gone a long way toward answering Schirgi's curiosity. Europe, it seems, isn't so dominant after all.

Paris Saint-Germain, the reigning European champion, lost to Botafogo, currently eighth in Brazil's Serie A. Iconic English club Chelsea was beaten handily by Flamengo, another Brazilian team. Mexico's Monterrey played Inter Milan, the Champions League runner-up, to a draw. Real Madrid, Europe's most decorated club, tied Al Hilal, which finished second in the Saudi Pro League.

And Spanish power Atlético Madrid, which made the round of 16 in the Champions League, didn't even make it out of the group stage.

Those results may still prove to be little more than a stumble on the way to an all-European final four. Or not. And that uncertainty, Schirgi insists, is why the Club World Cup was created.

 Soccer 

Paris Saint-Germain loses in an upset to Botafogo in a FIFA Club World Cup that so far has been hampered by low attendance and hot weather.

“Our sport is a sport where underdogs have a genuine chance, right?” he said. “It's not just the money game. We know that club soccer is at a very high level.”

The real winners through the tournament's first 34 games have been Latin American teams: Five of the six South American clubs entered Monday unbeaten, as did Mexico's Monterrey. And if there's been a big loser, it's arguably been Major League Soccer, which has shown it's not ready to play with the big boys.

Although the U.S. league made history when Inter Miami beat Porto 2-1 in a group-stage game, marking the first time an MLS club has beaten a European team in a competitive match, the league's other two entries — LAFC and the Seattle Sounders — combined for just two goals and were shut out three times in their first five games, all losses.

But if the first Club World Cup has proven to be surprisingly entertaining, even compelling, there have been a few hiccups. Attendance was hurt by several early weekday kickoffs and high admission prices, which forced FIFA to essentially start giving away tickets. The average announced attendance of 36,043 through the first 34 games was matched by nearly as many empty seats.

Just one game has sold out; six others drew fewer than 14,100 fans.

The weather has also proven difficult with several players complaining about the heat and humidity. It was so bad in Cincinnati last Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's substitutes watched the first half on TV in the dressing room. And it's only going to get worse. Temperatures are expected to top 100 degrees on Tuesday in New Jersey, where Porto plays Al Ahly, and an excessive heat warning has been issued in Philadelphia, where Chelsea and Esperance de Tunis meet.

High 90s temperatures are also forecast Tuesday for Nashville, Tenn., and Charlotte, N.C., where afternoon games are scheduled. That, however, will serve as a wake-up call for next summer's World Cup, which will be played in similar conditions.

Perhaps the most complex problem FIFA faces in attempting to make the Club World Cup a significant quadrennial event, however, is the crowded fixture schedule. The World Cup will expand from 64 to 104 games next summer. Recent years have seen tournaments such as the Nations League added to the international calendar while club competitions including the Champions League, Europa League and Club World Cup expanded.

Others, such as the Leagues Cup, were created out of whole cloth.

As a result some players have played more than 70 matches for club and country in the last year. The fixture schedule has become so packed that the only place left to accommodate a monthlong tournament such as  the Club World Cup was the traditional early summer break between one European season and the next.

FIFPRO, the global union representing soccer players, has cited scientific research in its call for a mandatory four-week break each year. FIFA, the Club World Cup organizer, responded by offering a $1 billion prize-money purse to get teams to play through that break.

 Sports 

Members of the Italian soccer team Juventus visited President Trump in the Oval Office. A team spokesperson later said the visit ‘carried no political agenda.'

“With the introduction of the new Champions League format and the new Club World Cup, which extends for over a month, the workload on teams and players has increased significantly,” said Giuseppe Marotta, chairman and chief executive officer of Inter Milan. “However these competitions also represent a huge opportunity in terms of visibility and revenue. For this reasons, they must be safeguarded.

“Adjustments should instead be made to the rest of the calendar to lighten the overall load.”

Marotta suggests shortening league schedules, which means diminishing domestic competitions while giving more power to the likes of FIFA and UEFA. That could be a slippery slope, one that would make the world's game less local and more global.

But if the Club World Cup follows the trajectory of the Champions League, Schirgi thinks that's a trade worth making.

“The beginnings of the Champions League, it was not always this huge, great event,” he said. “There is a lot of growth that needs to happen and a lot of education. We are super excited that we are part of history.”

President Donald Trump dropped the f-bomb while expressing how frustrated he is about Israel and Iran violating a ceasefire.

by Unfiltered Soccer

TOPICS:

Prior to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, in one of the most controversial decisions in U.S. Soccer history, then-Head Coach Jürgen Klinsmann elected not to bring star player Landon Donovan.  The decision was largely down to a 4  1/2 month sabbatical that Donovan took from soccer ranging from the end of 2012 through March of 2013.   It was a decision that Donovan openly disagreed with and, on the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer, the former 4-time U.S. Men's Player of the Year was asked if him and Klinsmann ever attempted to resolve their differences over the disagreement.

“At the end of 2014 – October 10th... 10/10, ironically - I had a sendoff game in Hartford with U.S. Soccer,” said Donovan.  “When I got there, Jürgen and I sat in a bar and we just talked.



"We said our piece and I didn't agree and, you know, he thought he was doing what was best for the team and whatever. And then he said at one point - this was really interesting - he's like, ‘you know, and I journaled everything that happened during all of this time. And I kept notes on everything that happened and I'm happy to show you.' And I was like, huh? It was really interesting.  The takeaway was, he knew what he was doing. It was very calculated. And he was making sure he took notes because he either had to justify it to somebody, or he felt like he, you know... you only take notes with things or keep recordings of things when you're kind of scared about what the outcome could be. So it was interesting.”

Adding to the tension following Klinsmann's decision in 2014 was a tweet posted by his son, Jonathan, who at the time was a goalkeeper on the USMNT's under-18 team which read “HAHAHAHAHAHAH DONOVAN HAHAHAHAA I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE UNTIL MY PHONE NOTIFIED ME'' followed by four laughing emojis and an additional ''HAHA.''  Donovan noted that Jürgen brought this up during their meeting.

“I give [Jürgen] credit for sitting down.  He also, you know, apologized for his son being obnoxious during that time.  And then look, my choices were, on the field when I got subbed off - I think it was the 40th minute or so - I was still upset with him. I still, you know, I didn't want to give him any time, but you also don't want to make a bigger deal out of it. And so we had like one final handshake and that was that.”

Donovan's former USMNT teammate and current co-host on Unfiltered Soccer, Tim Howard, has been an outspoken critic of Klinsmann's time as U.S. Head Coach.  He took exception with Klinsmann's claim that he believed he was doing what was best for the team.

“In a decision where a legendary player who still has so much to offer that team going into a major tournament could never, ever be making a decision - let me quote him – ‘that's best for the team,' without asking the senior players on that team for their opinion,” said Howard.  “So, you can read between the lines, but you won't have to. The senior players on that team were never asked for their opinion. So, it's impossible, impossible as a manager to make a decision that's best for the team without gaining that knowledge before the decision.”

The 2014 U.S. team advanced out of the group stage of the World Cup before losing to Belgium, 2-1, in the round of 16.

Must-win

In an ideal world, this game would've carried absolutely no consequences with it.  In that ideal world, we would've had not only six points but top spot in the group already in the bag.  But that's not the world we've created.

Instead, it's Flamengo who are in that enviably ideal position after their rather comprehensive 3-1 win over Chelsea on Friday.  They play LAFC at the same time as this game, and the result will matter not one jot.  They will finish top of the group and play the runners-up from Group C in the Round of 16.

If we do beat Tunis — and we're definitely going with “if”, based on Friday's performance — our reward will be a matchup against the winners of that group, most likely Bayern Munich, with either Boca Juniors or Benfica finishing runners-up.  Bayern could technically still finish second, should they lose to Benfica in their last game (played before our game).  Boca play semi-pro Auckland City, who shipped ten (10) to Bayern and six (6) to Benfica.  Ouch.

Granted, a draw would do us just fine as well, so I guess as long as we don't lose, we get to at least play one knockout round game.

ES Tunis team news: Espérance de Tunis are the dominant force in Tunisian football and one of the best teams on the continent as well, having won the CAF Champions League in 2018 and 2019.  They qualified for the Club World Cup on the strength of their continental ranking, and are one of the four African teams in the tournament.  They lost to Flamengo, 2-0, in their opener, but then beat LAFC, 1-0, to set up this showdown for a place in the last 16.

That goal was scored, appropriately enough, by Youcef Belaïli, their leading goalscorer and overall most dangerous player, who briefly played in Ligue 1, even, with Brest and Ajaccio just a few years ago.  Unfortunately for them, Belaïli is suspended after getting booked in each of their first two games.  Last year's top scorer, former Palmeiras youth player Ricardo Rodrigues is another threat.

(For what it's worth, Tunis appealed the yellow that was given to Belaïli for simulation against LAFC by referee Anthony Taylor.)

Either way, experienced head coach Maher Kanzari is ready to shock the world.

“We are prepared and we have to fulfil the expectations of our technical team, of our fans, of the Tunisian public. It will be a historical game. We will be well prepared, especially mentally. Everyone is waiting for this game and we are really proud of what we have achieved so far.”

-Maher Kanzari; source: AFP

Chelsea team news: Enzo Maresca tried a tactical experiment against Flamengo, which crashed and burned.  Thankfully, we've had practically no opportunity to train under the heat dome oppressing the Philadelphia area, so perhaps we'll go back to something a bit more tried and true (for better or worse).

That said, at this point, having started mostly our usual first-teamers in the first two games, Maresca has little choice but to rotate for this one regardless of anything else.  So let's hope we see something coherent at the very least.

‘Tomorrow, we will do some rotation because the ones who played two games are quite tired to play again. So we will make rotation, and we will see if there is a chance for those who haven't played as much.”

“It's almost impossible to train a full session because of the weather. We are trying to save energy for the game; this morning's session was very short, just plan for tomorrow, that's it. No more than that. It's not easy with these temperatures, but we will give our best tomorrow to get to the next stage of the competition.”

Nicolas Jackson is suspended after setting a new club record for receiving the quickest red card as a substitute (four minutes!), while Reece James and Levi Colwill have been dealing with illness and had been held completely out of training over the weekend.

MIAMI GARDENS, FL — Lionel Messi could only look down and shake his head in disappointment. Inter Miami's match Monday night in the FIFA Club World Cup didn't end the way it should have for the club. But there's still reason to celebrate.

Inter Miami jumped out to a 2-0 lead, but had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Brazilian club Palmeiras at Hard Rock Stadium to end the group stage in the Club World Cup — the night before Messi's 38th birthday.

Inter Miami nearly won Group A. They were so close. Still, they advanced to the Round of 16 in the tournament thanks to the draw. Inter Miami is the only Major League Soccer club to advance to the Club World Cup knockout rounds, as both Los Angeles FC and the Seattle Sounders have been eliminated.

The next matchup is a juicy one, too. 

Messi and Inter Miami will face his old team Paris Saint-Germain — the club he left two years ago to join Major League Soccer and play the twilight of his career in the United States. They'll meet on June 29 in Atlanta. 

The draw was as disappointing as it was heartbreaking: Paulinho scored in the 80th minute, and Mauricio tied the match in the 87th minute for Palmeiras. 

It spoiled an early birthday present for Messi. Tadeo Allende scored in the 16th minute, and Luis Suarez doubled the lead in the 65th minute for Inter Miami. 

But they could not hang on. 

USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights from both Club World Cup Group A matches:

Pepê (not to be confused with the longtime Portugal international of the same name) scored an equalizer in the 89th minute.

Moments after Pepê's goal, the Inter Miami and Palmeiras game ended with a 2-2 tie, thus ending the Club World Cup hopes of both FC Porto and Al Ahly. — Jim Reineking

Lionel Messi could only shake his head in disbelief. Palmeiras' Mauricio tied the match in the 87th minute, and Inter Miami will be unable to win a group in the Club World Cup. If this match ends in a draw, both clubs will still advance to the Round of 16.

This one isn't over just yet. Palmeiras' Paulinho scored in the 80th minute to trim Inter Miami's lead to 2-1. Inter Miami is still in great shape to advance, and can even allow another goal in this match to reach the Club World Cup round of 16. But they have at least 10 decisive minutes left to secure victory.

Luis Suarez delivered another stellar pass, this time to Messi, who was unable to apply the finish in the 73rd minute. Suarez has been substituted out so Inter Miami can prioritize defense to end this match.

The fans at MetLife Stadium are getting their money's worth with this one.

Meanwhile, Al Ahly is making sure the Portuguese club doesn't advance to the Club World Cup knockout round.

Mohamed Ben Romdhane's powerful shot in the 64th minute found the back of the net as the Egyptian club has its fourth goal of the game after entering Monday night's play without having scored in its previous two games.

As things currently stand, Inter Miami and Palmeiras would both advance. — Jim Reineking

Inter Miami is about 30 minutes away from winning their group at the FIFA Club World Cup. Luis Suarez dribbled past several defenders, doubled Inter Miami's lead with his left foot in the 65th minute. Talk about turning back the clock.

Blink and you'll miss a goal!

That's three goals in a four-minute span at MetLife Stadium, as FC Porto's Samu Aghehowa headed home an equalizer in the 53rd minute. He was assisted by teammate Fábio Vieira on a cross following a corner kick. — Jim Reineking

Messi headed the possession so he could fire away, aimed and sailed his shot over the net in the 58th minute. Messi is looking to impose his presence in this match. Meanwhile, in the other match, both sides have traded a series of goals in the second half.

The action is coming fast and furious at MetLife Stadium.

Immediately after FC Porto tied it on William Gomes' shot, Wessam Abou Ali headed home his third goal of the game. Abou Ali's hat trick goal came on a cross from teammate Mohamed Hany. — Jim Reineking

FC Porto's William Gomes scored a banger of a goal to tie up the game in the 50th minute.

Porto desperately needs to score goals — and for Inter Miami to hold onto its lead — if it has any hopes of advancing in the Club World Cup. — Jim Reineking

Inter Miami's Tadeo Allende had another chance at a runaway goal, but his finish was wide of the left post. It was a stellar pass from Luis Suarez. And it was a great of a chance as any for Inter Miami to double their lead in this Club World Cup match.

Lionel Messi winded up for his first shot of the game in the 49th minute, but it was a slow left boot that was saved by the Palmeiras goalkeeper.

The first yellow card of the match goes to Lionel Messi. He pushed a Palmeiras player after losing possession, but it was an apparent response to his teammate Telasco Segovia being aggressively challenged without a foul considered.

During the first minute of first-half stoppage time, a foul inside the 18-yard box by FC Porto's Fábio Vieira helped Al Ahly retake the lead moments before halftime.

Wessam Abou Ali buried the free kick and now has scored both of Al Ahly's goals as the Egyptian powerhouse keeps its Club World Cup hopes alive. — Jim Reineking

Palmeiras' Facundo Torres missed a major opportunity with a left boot in the 32nd minute. The former Orlando City player was unable to convert just wide of the right post.

FC Porto is doing its part to help the Inter Miami cause.

Moments after Wessam Abou Ali scored Al Ahly's first goal of the Club World Cup, Porto tied it up. 18-year-old phenom Rodrigo Mora evened up the score in the 23rd minute to give his club a chance at advancement (Porto needs a win, coupled with an Inter Miami win and goal differential tiebreaker edge).

A Porto win pushes Inter Miami in the Club World Cup knockout round, regardless of the result of Inter Miami's game with Palmeiras. — Jim Reineking

Inter Miami has struck first with Tadeo Allende's runaway goal in the 16th minute. Allende had a wide open lane to convert the opportunity, with just a goalkeeper in his path, after a clearance by Luis Suarez. The score happened shortly after Al Ahly took a 1-0 lead against Porto in the other match.

Al Ahly needs to win and get some serious help from Palmeiras against Inter Miami.

The Egyptian club got on the scoreboard first at MetLife Stadium against FC Porto, as Wessam Abou Ali slipped a shot past Porto 'keeper Cláudio Ramos in the 15th minute.

This is Al Ahly's first goal of the Club World Cup. — Jim Reineking

Luis Suarez to Noah Allen, who found Messi in prime position. But the Argentine World Cup champion was unable to handle the possession in the penalty area in the 10th minute. Even though Messi fell to the pitch, a penalty was not called after he collided into a Palmeiras defender.

An early save from Inter Miami's Oscar Ustari, who has been crucial in the club allowing just one goal through two matches in the Club World Cup.

Inter Miami and Palmeiras play at 9 p.m. ET (10 p.m. in Argentina and Brazil). The Porto-Al Ahly match also begins at the same time.

The Inter Miami-Palmeiras match is available on TBS and TruTV in English, and available to live stream on DAZN. The Porto-Al Ahly match is also available to live stream on DAZN.

The odds aren't in Inter Miami's favor for this one, according to BETMGM.

Yes, Messi is in the Inter Miami starting lineup for the match.

Messi experienced some right thigh discomfort in the second half of Inter Miami's 2-1 win over FC Porto last Thursday in Atlanta, but he finished the match. Messi also practiced with his Inter Miami teammates before the Palmeiras match.

Messi will turn 38 on June 24, just hours after Inter Miami faces Palmeiras.

How's this for a juicy Club World Cup storyline? It's possible Messi could face one of his former teams in the knockout stage. Group B has been decided Monday, before Group A will be settled.

Paris Saint-Germain has won Group B after a 2-0 win over MLS side Seattle Sounders, while Atlético Madrid's Antoine Griezmann scored in the 87th minute to push Brazilian side Botafogo to Group B runner-up.

It's a disappointing result for Botafogo, which upset PSG 1-0 in their second group-stage match. But both teams will advance.

The 2025 Club World Cup is reaching the end of the group stage with clubs moving on to the Round of 16. On Monday, Paris Saint-Germain emerged from Group B along with Botafogo, as Atlético Madrid did not score the necessary goals to reach the knockout round.

Then on Monday night, Lionel Messi and Inter Miami nearly fell apart completely against Palmeiras, but did enough to finish second in Group A.

PSG is on to the Round of 16 after shutting out the Sounders to win Group B. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored in the 35th minute to ensure that the Champions League winners wouldn't be blanked for the second consecutive match after losing 1-0 to Botafogo on Thursday. Achraf Hakimi added a score in the 66th minute, converting a Bradley Barcola pass threaded between defenders. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma did not have to make a save in the match. Seattle is the second MLS team eliminated from the tournament, joining LAFC. PSG will face Inter Miami in the knockout round on Sunday (12 p.m. ET, DAZN) in Atlanta.

Despite winning Monday's match, Atlético Madrid will not advance to the Round of 16. The Rojiblancos needed to win by three goals or more to move on from Group B. Instead, those spots will be taken by Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain. The match's lone goal didn't come until the 87th minute when Antoine Griezmann scored off a cross through several defenders from Julian Alvarez. Both clubs missed scoring chances early on with Atlético Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak making.a stretching save to deny Jefferson Savarino in the 10th minute. Alvarez also missed a close shot wide left just before the half. Atlético Madrid got the one goal despite outshooting Botafogo 23-7.

This match was a shootout in every sense of the word. But in the end, neither club made it into the next round. Al Ahly entered the locker room at halftime up 2-1, but then the two teams traded three straight goals in a three-minute span early in the second half in wild fashion — which tied the match up 3-3. Then, after Al Ahly jumped ahead again in the 64th minute, Pepê tied it up again with a huge goal from outside the box in the 89th minute to force the draw.

It looked like Inter Miami was going to roll into the knockout stage as winners of Group A, thanks to two early goals Monday night. Tadeo Allende scored first in the 16th minute on a breakaway, and Luis Suarez followed suit in the second half with a solo goal of his own after weaving past two defenders. But in the final 10 minutes of the match, Palmeiras surged back. They snuck one in in the 80th minute, and then Maurício buried one in the back of the net in the 88th minute to even the match.

Though Miami made it into the Round of 16 regardless, the late collapse wasn't great — and it set up a battle with European champions PSG in the next round, something they nearly avoided. Palmeiras, now the winners of Group A, will get fellow Brazilian club Botafogo on Saturday (12 p.m. ET, DAZN) in Philadelphia.

This belongs to Pepê, who completed a wild match with his deep goal against Al Ahly.

Infantino and council to decide if Iran can play in Mexico

Fifa is facing new questions over the increasingly fraught World Cup next year, with the issue of how to treat Iran while the country is involved in a conflict with the co-host the US.

There are no provisions within Fifa's regulations to prevent Iran from playing their group matches in the US, despite the country being subject to military action by the Trump administration and Iranian citizens being under a travel ban that prevents them from entering the country. The ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

Iran, who faced USA in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, qualified in March for their fourth consecutive World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A could Iran avoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico.

If Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Should they go further – and they have never reached a World Cup knockout game – they would then play in the US.

Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president, Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend.

Infantino and the Fifa Council will have the final say on inclusion in the competition and the makeup of the draw, but the organising committee for Fifa competitions will be expected to have input. The committee has members from Canada, Mexico and Iran, and its chair is Uefa's president, Aleksander Ceferin. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow.

Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a “general principle” that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.

The 2021 U.S. Open champion clarifies her relationship with the Spanish tennis star

David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty; Carlos Alvarez/Getty

 Tennis fans will have to wait a bit longer for a new power couple. 


 Despite dating rumors swirling around Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, the two are just friends. While speaking to the BBC in a video published on Monday, June 23, Raducanu, 22, reacted to the buzz, saying that she is “glad the internet is having fun and we're providing some entertainment for everyone.”


 The theory that the BBC described as “melting tennis social media last week” came about after the U.S. Open announced the mixed doubles pairs — which also includes the all-American pair of old friends Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe and current tennis couple Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa — on June 17.

 The 2021 U.S. Open champion then explained how the platonic pairing came about. “He asked me earlier on in the year,” she recalled. “I was very surprised and honored and obviously very excited.”


 Though she had to ask her coach for the go-ahead, Raducanu said, “Of course I was going to say ‘yes.' ”


 Alcaraz, also 22, will look to add a mixed doubles trophy to his five Grand Slam victories. The Spanish player, ranked No. 2 overall, attained his most recent Grand Slam win in the longest ever French Open final of all time against his rival, Italian world No. 1 Jannik Sinner. 


 The pair of young aces, meanwhile, go way back to the summer of 2021, according to Raducanu. "We both started getting to know each other when I had that little run at Wimbledon and he had the five set [match] in the first round,” she shared. “Ever since we've stayed in touch.”


 Raducanu and Alcaraz, both 18 at the time, ended up exiting the tournament early on but reunited later that summer at the U.S. Open where Raducanu won, becoming the youngest major champion since Maria Sharapova in 2004.

 Reflecting on her future mixed doubles partner's success, the Brit said, “He's done so well obviously and continued winning. It's been amazing to see.”


 Injuries, however, have plagued Raducanu's own success. A wrist and ankle surgery in 2023 gave the current No. 38 ranked player lots to overcome, dropping her to a ranking of 289 at the time. 


 Despite a back injury Raducanu has been steadily climbing up the rankings and will make her U.S. Open mixed doubles debut with Alcaraz, when the tournament starts playing in New York City on Aug. 19.

The road to Wimbledon is in full swing as tennis stars in both the men's and women's draws ramp up their preparations for the All England Club. Carlos Alcaraz and Tatjana Maria clinched grass-court titles at the HSBC Championships, and their Queen's triumphs are sure to send them to SW19 brimming with confidence.

There was a surprise winner at the Halle Open over the weekend as the unseeded Alexander Bublik continued his red-hot form with a win over Daniil Medvedev in the final. Now, British attention turns to Emma Raducanu, who is back in action at the Eastbourne Open this week as she aims to get fully up to speed. With plenty to keep on top of, follow Express Sport's live tennis updates below...

Emma Raducanu explained that some bad news received this week prompted her to cry after her victory over Ann Li.

The British No. 1 was visibly emotional after her win on the grass courts of Eastbourne.

Asked about the moments after the final point, Raducanu explained: “I received some pretty bad news so I would like to keep it personal if that's okay, but it was difficult and very emotional at the end and probably just a release of different emotions.”

It's an excellent victory for Billy Harris over a fellow Brit.

He defeats Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-4 and progresses to the next round in Eastbourne.



Billy Harris currently has the better of Cameron Norrie at Eastbourne.

Harris has just broken in the second set and leads 6-4 4-3.

Emma Raducanu broke Ann Li three times in the deciding set and wins 6-7 6-3 6-1 in a fantastic victory.

Visibly emotional after the match, she progresses to the second round in her final tournament before Wimbledon.

Emma Raducanu has broken Ann Li in the deciding set of their Eastbourne clash.

The British star lost the first set 7-6 before taking the second 6-3.

She has now broken early in the third set and is serving to go 3-1 ahead.

Eyebrows were raised when Lois Boisson was not handed a Wimbledon wildcard.

The French star reached the semi-final of the French Open earlier this month despite being ranked 361st in the world.

Forced to go through Wimbledon qualifying, she was beaten in three sets by Carson Branstine.

Harriet Dart came within a whisker of a huge win over reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova before suffering a painful loss in Eastbourne.

The 28-year-old was 5-4 up and 40-15 ahead in the deciding set, but she somehow lost the match 3-6 7-6 5-7 with a flurry of points going to her opponent in the closing stages.

Jodie Burrage fared better on Court 2 as she saw off Moyuka Uchijima 6-3 6-2.

Emma Raducanu is now underway on Centre Court, and she is tied 3-3 with Ann Li in the opening set.



Former Grand Slam champion Conchita Martinez has warned Andy Murray about the scale of the commitment that comes with being a full-time tennis coach.

Murray recently spent six months working with Novak Djokovic, and now the Scot it back on the market he has been tipped to team up with Emma Raducanu.

But Martinez wants him to know what he would be getting into.

She told BoyleSports: "Emma is still young, so there is still time. She's doing great with Mark Petchey and Nick Cavaday, but we should ask Andy if he would like this experience.

"To be a coach and to be able to do the job right, it's a huge commitment. When I took the job with Mirra [Andreeva], I knew that I needed to be close to her full-time.

"It would be dependent on Andy and what he's up for doing. He could be a coach or maybe as support for a few weeks, who knows."

Andy Murray will get a statue at Wimbledon to commemorate his legacy as the first British player to win the men's singles title since Fred Perry.

He achieved glory at the world's most prestigious tournament in 2013 before repeating the feat three years later.

It saw him become the first British champion in 77 years, with Perry the last player to do it way back in 1936.

The BBC has stuck with many of the usual suspects for this year's line-up of Wimbledon pundits - but a handful of big names have missed out.

Clare Balding will lead the presenting team and take charge of the afternoon coverage after Isa Guha kicks things off in the morning and before Qasa Aslom heads up Today at Wimbledon in the evening.

All England Club stalwarts John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Pat Cash, Tracy Austin and Annabel Croft are set to join Balding and Guha in the studio to provide their hot takes on the action.

There are also a number of recognisable names in the commentary box including Andrew Castle, Andrew Cotter, Jo Durie, Anne Keothavong, Nick Mullins and Todd Woodbridge, among others.

And the BBC have snapped up even more tennis heroes to aid with their radio coverage as Marion Bartoli, Kim Clijsters, Laura Robson, Greg Rusedski, Naomi Broady, Daniela Hantuchova and Leon Smith all made the cut.

Despite the long list of experts set to appear at Wimbledon, there are also some high-profile absentees from the BBC's list including Johanna Konta, Nick Kyrgios and Ash Barty.



Emma Raducanu has praised Wimbledon organisers for dealing with a threat to her safety after police notified the Brit about the latest twist in her stalker ideal.

A man was given a retraining order by authorities after following Raducanu to multiple events and causing her emotional distress.

He has since been caught and blocked from attempting to buy tickets for Wimbledon, where Raducanu will play next week.

She told BBC Sport: "Wimbledon did an amazing job. I got a notification and the police contacted me and assured me that everything was okay.

"I feel okay, I feel comfortable and safe. I've had great protection whenever I've been at these events recently."

Venus Williams is planning another high-profile tennis appearance at 45 years old.

The veteran has announced that she will share the court with Madison Keys at the Charlotte Invitational - an exhibition event scheduled to be held this December.

Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz are also due to appear.

Williams remains tight-lipped on the prospect of retirement despite a long period of inactivity.

Her last competitive appearances came at Indian Wells and the Miami Open last year.

Carlos Alcaraz is mentally stronger than Jannik Sinner in the big moments, according to Rafael Nadal's uncle, Toni.

There is not much separating the two young guns battling for top spot in the modern era as Novak Djokovic winds down his tournament schedule.

But Alcaraz landed the most recent blow with a stunning comeback victory over Sinner in the French Open final.

Nadal told Gazzetta dello Sport: "I think the Spaniard [Alcaraz] is mentally a little superior in the decisive moments, while the Italian [Sinner] is better at imposing a very high pace without making mistakes.

"But when it's the key moment, between the two of them, maybe Carlos is a little superior."



Coco Gauff brought fans crashing back down to earth after Wimbledon and the WTA posted her hitting a mid-air trickshot during her preparation for Wimbledon.

Gauff was a picture of elegance in the snap as she looked back at the ball after hitting a leaping tweener.

But she admitted that the reality was not quite as glamorous as it appeared.

Over the top of the picture, she wrote on her Instagram story: "Don't be fooled, this went in the bottom of the net."

There are a number of Brits in round-of-32 action across the men's and women's draws at the Eastbourne Open today.

Here is a list of matches involving home favourites, with play scheduled to get underway at around 11am (BST)...

George Loffhagen vs Reilly Opelka

Harriet Dart vs Barbora Krejcikova

Nuno Borges vs Jack Pinnington Jones

Jodie Burrage vs Moyuka Uchijima

Ann Li vs Emma Raducanu

Sonay Kartal vs Jelena Ostapenko

Billy Harris vs Cameron Norrie

Jacob Fearnley vs Flavio Cobolli

Mingge Xu vs Peyton Stearns

Former Wimbledon quarter-finalist Daria Kasatkina has criticised the WTA for downgrading the Eastbourne Open from a WTA 500 to a WTA 250 event.

Kasatkina won in Eastbourne last year but she was defeated by Lulu Sun in the first round of her title defence on Monday.

Beforehand, on the diminished number of ranking points on offer, she ranted: "That sucks, honestly. I don't understand this decision.

"I think Eastbourne is one of the oldest tournaments we've got on tour. It's a tournament with big history. As I remember, it was always a 500, so it's a very nice tournament, and I just didn't see the reason to downgrade it to a 250."



Emma Raducanu was giddy with laughter when theories about a romance with Carlos Alcaraz were put to her this week.

The duo, who are both 22, are set to pair up in mixed doubles at the US Open later this season.

And eyebrows were raised when Raducanu turned up to watch Alcaraz from the stands at Queen's.

During an interview with BBC Sport, Raducanu was made aware of fans on social media insisting that she and Alcaraz are 'destined for each other'.

Giggling, she replied: "I'm glad the internet is having fun and we're providing some entertainment for everyone."

British lucky loser Billy Harris continued his love affair with the Lexus Eastbourne Open on Tuesday when he defeated countryman Cameron Norrie 6-4, 6-4 to reach the second round.

Last year, Harris advanced to his maiden ATP Tour semi-final at the grass-court event, defeating then-World No. 49 Flavio Cobolli en route. Twelve months on and the 30-year-old outplayed Norrie to earn his first Top 100 victory since Cobolli. Harris will next meet Italian Mattia Bellucci.



Earlier, eighth seed Nuno Borges earned his second tour-level grass-court win with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win against British wild card Jack Pinnington Jones. The Portuguese star has now recorded 20 tour-level wins for the second consecutive season and will next meet Jenson Brooksby. The American lucky loser defeated Francisco Comesana 7-6(6), 6-4.

Reilly Opelka survived a scare against British qualifier George Loffhagen to maintain his impressive grass-court season. The American fired 19 aces, according to Infoys ATP Stats, en route to a 7-6(6), 3-6, 7-6(1) victory in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Opelka reached the semi-finals in ‘s-Hertogenbosch earlier this month. The No. 72 in the PIF ATP Rankings meets #NextGenATP Czech Jakub Mensik in the second round.

Also on Tuesday, James Duckworth defeated Aleksandar Vukic 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1 and Marcos Giron downed Luciano Darderi 6-4, 7-5.

Eight years after winning the Australian Open juniors, Carson Branstine and Bianca Andreescu face each other in Wimbledon qualifying -- older, tougher and ready to win.

ROEHAMPTON, London -- Carson Branstine remembers the moment she would be lifelong friends with Bianca Andreescu. The first time they traveled together was at the 2017 Australian Open -- Branstine had just switched nationality from the U.S. to Canada -- and on their first night in Melbourne, the two 16-year-olds went on a snack run.

The following morning, Branstine opened the fridge to find the Brie she had carefully selected was already gone. Andreescu 'fessed up' to its theft immediately. A week later, the pair left Australia as the girls doubles champions, having defeated Maja Chwalinska and Iga Swiatek in the final.

"We're ultra-accountable with each other," Branstine said with a laugh after upsetting No. 1 seed and Roland Garros semifinalist Lois Boisson 6-2, 6-7(1), 6-4 in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying. Her reward? Eight years after bonding over Brie, Branstine will have to play her childhood friend for the first time.

Andreescu, who advanced 6-2, 6-1 over Laura Pigossi, said that they had joked about the possibility two weeks ago in 's-Hertogenbosch, where they reunited as doubles partners for the first time at tour level.

"The universe gave us exactly that," she said. "We both want each other to do well, but tennis doesn't give a s---."

The pair are overflowing with praise for each other. 

"I love that girl," Branstine said. "We'll go to the grave together for sure. Bianca has one of the best hearts on tour, and I'm so blessed to call her one of my best friends."

Andreescu responds in kind.

"She's one of those friends where, when we're together, it's like nothing ever happened," she said. "She's just the funniest person ever. She's super easygoing -- I know on the court she might not seem that way! She's a perfectionist, just like me."

Branstine and Andreescu have wound up at Roehampton this year after taking very divergent paths -- with one unfortunate common thread -- following their standout junior careers. Andreescu delivered a spectacular breakthrough season in 2019, winning the US Open as a 19-year-old but has been unable to play a full season since due to a host of injuries and illnesses. She's currently ranked No. 147 and playing Wimbledon qualifying for the first time since 2018.

Branstine went to college instead -- three of them, in fact: the University of South Carolina, the University of Virginia and Texas A&M -- but injuries prevented her from even taking to the court at the first two.

"I've taken more than five years off with injuries, total," Branstine said. "Even as a junior. I think the last time I played a full schedule was when I was 15 years old. I was playing through something all my life."

Since graduating in 2023, Branstine has enjoyed one of her longest spells of good health -- something she ascribes to "taking ownership of everything." She did her own research and discovered what worked for her body -- and what didn't.

"Unfortunately, I had to not listen to a lot of people and learn on my own," she said. "I found a secret formula in a way, because I think I'm one of the best athletes on tour. I can run fast, I can lift heavy weights and I'm pretty mobile for how tall I am. My physicality, I'm up there with anyone."

Ranked No. 197, Branstine's win over Boisson is the second time in three weeks that she's upset a No. 1 seed in the first round of a tournament. On her WTA main-draw debut in 's-Hertogenbosch, she ousted defending champion Liudmila Samsonova 6-4, 5-7, 6-1 for her first Top 20 win. She says she enjoys coming into matches as the technical underdog -- knowing she has the game to take anyone down.

"We're not in Paris anymore," she said of facing Boisson, the darling of Roland Garros last month. "We're on grass. It's different. I'm very confident in myself. Maybe not everyone knows me, but I think I can beat anyone out there."

Branstine's self-belief draws on both her Top 5 junior success and the setbacks she's overcome. Late in college, she doubted whether she could keep playing. She started exploring other paths -- shadowing a family lawyer and signing with two modeling agencies as a “little side hustle.”

But Branstine has the grit of someone who's resolutely proud of being self-made. Reluctant to take money from her parents, she used her modeling income to get her tennis career off the ground instead.

"I came into the sport with no sponsors, no coach, no base," she said. "Just me, myself and I. My first tournaments back [in 2023], I went to Monastir with no training and no muscle. I won two W15s in a row, so I had to keep going."

This week, Branstine and Andreescu are taking different approaches again when it comes to how they're seeking success. Andreescu is focused in her pursuit of a zen attitude, particularly when it comes to the surface.

"I have this mindset of being one with the grass," she said. "It's a living thing, so I'm trying to be in touch with my spirituality in that sense. Touching the grass, speaking to it. No getting upset with it. I try to do that in practice and implement it in my matches. I think it's helping for the most part. It gives me faith in myself and in the grass."

By contrast, Branstine favors a more hard-nosed approach -- self-imposed ultimatums. She told herself she would quit if she didn't make Roland Garros qualifying this year. Her next goal is to break the Top 100 next year.

"It's not healthy for everyone," she said. "But it works for me."

With a place in the final round at stake, the stakes are real -- and the Brie's not up for grabs.

Eight years after winning the Australian Open juniors, Carson Branstine and Bianca Andreescu face each other in Wimbledon qualifying -- older, tougher and ready to win.

Wimbledon has its pristine grass courts primed for next week and Bernie Tomic, whose first big breakthrough came in London 14 years ago, is back!

Well, sort of.

As a sextet of Aussies begin their bid to qualify for the world's most prestigious tournament on Monday night, the one-time prodigy is preparing for his first tour level match in more than four years.

The Queenslander will not be at Wimbledon this year mixing it up with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and company after narrowly missing the cut-off for the qualifying event that is played a few kilometres from the main stage at Roehampton.

But rather than sitting on his heels hoping for some peers to withdraw from Wimbledon qualifying, the one-time boy wonder picked up his racquets and headed for the sun in Spain.



Tomic has been the target of much derision and criticism during a career that dates back to 2008. A degree of it has been deserved but a portion has also been unfair.

But for a player who has been called out for tanking at times — the 28 minute blink-and-you-miss-it nightmare in Miami back in 2014 was a nightmare — the grizzled veteran deserves a nod for getting back to work.

Far away from the big stages of sport, Tomic has been cracking in on tour backwaters in a bid to break back into the top 100 and return to the grand slam stages in Melbourne, Paris, London and New York.

An opportunity awaits to take a significant step towards that mark on the grass courts of Rafael Nadal's home island of Mallorca this week after the 32-year-old qualified for his first ATP Tour level event since the Australian Open in 2021.

From big-time boasts about his ability and earnings to losing motivation and hitting the “party zone” in his mid-20s, Tomic has regained his fitness and is becoming tougher to beat.





Over the weekend he defeated Jasper De Jong, a Dutchman ranked 93 who recently won a round at the French Open, and then Aleksandar Kovacevic, an American who sits at 77, to qualify for an event where the winner pockets $162,000.

The prize is a first round meeting against his compatriot Rinky Hijikata, a hard-working Aussie ranked 88 who reached the last 16 at the US Open a couple of years ago.

If the Gold Coaster happens to win that match, he will jump to a spot just outside the top 200, which would put him in the frame to play in qualifying for the US Open in New York in late August.

A slot back in the Big Apple, the city where dreams are made and broken, would be fitting for a tennis player who has ridden the rollercoaster of the sport for much of his life.



THE RISE AND FALL OF BERNARD TOMIC

Any Aussie unaware of the Queenslander's topsy-turvy career would have to have their head in the sand given Tomic's propensity for headline grabbing behaviour during his career between the baselines and beyond it.

It started way back in his early teens when, while indisputably a phenomenon in junior ranks, he reeled off the big names in the sport in declaring the track he felt he was on.

“I still need to find the serve of Ivanisevic and the groundstrokes of Federer. I'm halfway there with the mind of Sampras. I've already got the heart of Lleyton,” he told Inside Sport.

“I love all the competition in tennis, the battles, the winning, coming back when no-one thinks you can, like Lleyton. Even when I'm not playing for a few weeks when I have a holiday, I feel so hungry to come back and win tournaments.”

That interview was back in late 2006, not long after he had won the prestigious Orange Bowl junior event in Florida. 

Not long after Pat Rafter, John Newcombe and Tony Roche watched him in a junior match at the Australian Open, a year prior to Tomic becoming the youngest player to win the event in 2008. 

Blessed with beautiful touch and the brain to work the angles on court, he also won the boys event at the US Open in successes that inspired sponsors like Nike and Head to sign him, while also earning him representation from behemoth agency IMG.



This journalist first talked to Tomic in 2008 after a narrow loss in a Futures event in Gippsland to Nick Lindahl, another talent who was later banned for seven years on match fixing charges.

Tomic was chatty and happy to discuss his hopes. His dad John? Less so, judging by an interaction on returning to the club house afterwards. That one did not make the headlines but other altercations did over the years following as his son strove for greatness.

Tomic's best run at a grand slam came at Wimbledon in 2011 when he became the youngest player since Boris Becker in 1986 to reach the quarterfinals. There he fell to Novak Djokovic in four sets. 

Later that year he played alongside Lleyton Hewitt in an epic Davis Cup tie in Rose Bay in Sydney against a Switzerland team featuring Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.

He won the Sydney International in 2013 along with other ATP Tour titles in Italy, China and Colombia. He reached quarterfinals at Masters events and finals at ATP 500 level.

In January, 2016, he peaked at an ATP ranking of 17. That ranking is not as high as many, including Tomic, predicted. But during a golden period, he broke into the top 20 and featured in second weeks of grand slam tournaments. 

For all the critics who have dumped on Tomic, it is worth reiterating he was the 17th best tennis player in the world at a point in time on merit. He has played 37 grand slam tournaments. It is a decent career.





As to the controversies? Man, oh man. Where to begin? How about back in 2009 at Wimbledon when his agent told Hewitt he was not good enough to hit with Tomic, who was just 16?

Or the time where his dad blasted Tennis Australia officials for scheduling a night match past his bedtime? That, to be fair, was at the minor end of some of John Tomic's sins.

Tomic was pulled up three times in one day by Gold Coast police for traffic breaches and was placed on a Good Behaviour Bond for other incidents while driving flashy cars in the Sunshine State.

He carried Davis Cup teams at times and was dumped on other occasions for a poor attitude. He pissed it up big-time in Miami and got himself arrested, teed off at a journalist after a poor US Open loss, berated Hewitt and got into a war of words with Nick Kyrgios.

Tomic tanked matches, was booed off courts and received some hefty fines. As recently as last August, he was heckling rivals from a grandstand after a Challenger tour loss. 



To suggest he has had a colourful career would be an understatement. 

But even after all the drama, when journalists bumped him into at events, he would be quick to ask about someone's kids, or make a quip about something that had happened on court.

Was he treated unfairly while at the top? Even Tomic was not prepared to go that far in a recent chat on tennis podcast The Changeover when assessing how his career has been covered, particularly at a time when it seemed he was in court as often as he was on court.

“I mean, the Australian media is probably the worst media in the world. Don't get me wrong, I did stuff, for sure, that did provoke it. I wasn't the smartest guy in the town,” he said.

“The media, at the end of the day, want to sell papers. No-one's going to wake up and want to read something good about someone. They want to read something bad and stuff. So if they have any … any sort of little flame to pick on, they can, because they know that's going to sell. 

“Obviously I did stuff that was, for sure, not right. I didn't do a lot of things on court that were wrong with referees and this … but I would let go sometimes and tank and not be there. I'm sure many players have done some stuff throughout these last 10 years. 

“I probably didn't do it the right way … and they did pick on me a little bit of the time, the media, but it's not like I have an issue with them.”



ENTERING THE “PARTY ZONE”

What went wrong? In his recent chat with The Changeover, Tomic highlighted a few threads that will scarcely surprise as his ranking plummeted to beyond the 1200 mark in 2023.

Injuries were a factor. The 28-minute nightmare in the Miami Masters against Jarkko Niemennen followed a hip surgery in 2014 that required three months rehabilitation.

He endured wrist and back problems in 2016, issues that have derailed more accomplished players than himself including Juan Martin del Potro, a rival whose talent he clearly rates.

And there was burnout, which will surprise no-one. Tomic admits he did not have the maturity to deal with the fame, the expectations and the commitment in his early 20s.

“I sort of let go. I just lost the hunger,” he said. 

“How can I say it? Obviously I worked really hard when I was young. I missed my childhood, whatever, but then it got to the stage where, how can I say it, I didn't feel fulfilled. Even winning on the court, I just wanted to be normal. The travelling? Man, it destroyed me at 24. 

“Now compared to who I was 10 years ago. I see things differently and react differently (but) tennis is a very isolated, very tough sport. You're travelling on your own. You've got to give up your whole life. You're not surrounded by a team (and) you're on your own. You lose. You're on your own. You go back to the room, feeling bad, being alone, away from friends, away from family.”





From free-wheeling in fast and furious cars in his early 20s, by the time Covid-19 hit Tomic was committed to the circuit. The problem for his career was that it was the party circuit.

“I didn't train a lot, honestly, from 26 to 28. During the Covid period, I partied heaps. There was nothing to do except party, you know,” he told The Changeover.

“There was nothing to do. And prior to those two years, I was already, like, mucking around partying. So it was like a three year party zone. 

“(But then) I was like, ‘Okay, I've got one more shot at tennis. I better get back.' It took me like, a year, and a year and a half to get my fitness back. I would play a match and I was, like, dead.”



THE LONG ROAD BACK

For a bloke who was burned out and candidly admits he is past his prime, Tomic understands why people might be asking why he is out on back blocks grinding away.

It has been a while since his infamous “counting my millions” quote after an Aussie Open qualifying loss, but the 32-year-old has earned more than A$10 million in prize money, and also have benefited from lucrative sponsorships and appearance fees earlier in his career.

Partying can be expensive and so, too, the lifestyle associated with being a tennis player. 

But Tomic had a realisation. He may not love it, but he was damned good at tennis and it is the only life he has ever really known.

Over the past 12 months Tomic has bounced from the US to South America and back to America. He has played matches in Calgary and Noumea, Pune and Mexico City.

And it has been tough. While Tomic is adamant the top 10 in his prime were better — he played the Big 4 and other big names in prime time outings — he says the depth is stronger than ever on the tour, with rivals ranked down to the 500s outstanding in their own right.

Changes in the amount of points offered at lower levels have made it harder to climb back to where he wants to get to, which is the top 100. That would give him entry back into grand slams and the top tier events on the tour.





“Tennis has become part of my life ever since I was seven. Obviously I had a dad that pushed me extremely hard and that's one of the reasons I got there, in a sense,” he said.

“But when you look at this whole picture, now that I'm 32, it's a purpose. It still gives me something to do. Without tennis, I don't know what I would do. 

“I'm sitting about 200 in the world, or whatever, and my goal is to be top 100 and … and then I can retire. It's more of a statement, that sort of thing, so let's see if I can do it. 

“But the whole sort of sense (that) you've got to find your purpose, something that gets you going now that you're older, you want something to give. And it's about tennis.

“It's the only thing I'm good at. I've been good at it for almost three decades, so it gets me going. I can still play decent. I'm not in my prime like I was … but that's why I'm challenging myself to get back there one more time. And then (I can) retire happy (and) guilt free.”

Can Bernie get back? De Jong and Kovacevic, the blokes he beat on the weekend, will be playing at Wimbledon next week, and so too will Hijikata and much of the Mallorca draw headed by American star Ben Shelton and Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Making the jump from 200 to 100 is as tough as coming back from beyond 1200 a couple of years back to get to where he is now. And a bad back that flares on occasion will make it tougher. But if he can continue a winning run this week, Tomic Mark II will be on his way.

The announcement of the mixed doubles teams for the upcoming US Open, which will feature Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz playing together, sparked speculation about the nature of their relationship (currently a friendship) between the British and Spanish tennis stars. 

Interest grew even more after Raducanu, 22, was seen in the stands at Queen's Club, watching Alcaraz's Centre Court match against Roberto Bautista. Raducanu, currently competing at the WTA 250 event in Eastbourne, spoke to the BBC and lightheartedly addressed her pairing with Alcaraz.

When asked about humorous fan accounts on social media claiming the two are “meant to be,” she couldn't help but laugh. One fan post even joked that Alcaraz's loss in the Doha quarterfinals was due to being distracted by Raducanu's injury. “I hadn't heard that one,” she said about the speculation. “But I'm glad the internet is enjoying it. It's great that we're keeping people entertained.”

Raducanu also shared the backstory behind their US Open partnership with a touch of humor, noting that she didn't give Alcaraz, 22, an immediate answer, something that Alcaraz confessed recently in an interview.

“I had to make him wait a bit,” she said, according to the Daily Express. “Naturally, I wanted to say yes right away, but I needed to get approval from my team first. I couldn't just decide on my own. I had to check with my coach and do things properly.”

During the interview with the BBC, Raducanu opened up about how her friendship with Alcaraz developed back in 2021. “That was the year we both made big moves at Wimbledon,” she said. “I think he had a five-set win in the first round, maybe against Uchiyama. Then he had a great run at the US Open, especially that win over Stef [Tsitsipas] in the third round. I remember wanting to follow his progress because he always played the day before I did.

“We've stayed in touch ever since. It's been incredible to watch him keep climbing, and what's even cooler is that we were already talking and friends before either of us had achieved anything big,” she added.

Rather than hold a traditional mixed doubles event in 2025, the USTA has decided to move its mixed doubles event, with the competition now being held in the pre-tournament fan week. While the move has its own controversy, tennis' biggest (singles) stars have embraced the change.

Sixteen teams will take part in the event, which will be a best-of-three sets, first-to-four games format, with a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a full third set. With a $1 million prize on the line, the teams will play on August 19th and 20th during Week 1 of the US Open.

Lois Boisson was unable to repeat her French Open heroics, suffering a shock elimination in the first round of qualifying for Wimbledon.

The third Grand Slam of the season begins at the All England Club on Monday, and hopefuls are bidding to run the gauntlet of the qualifying tournament at nearby Roehampton this week. But Boisson, who stunned the tennis world to reach the semifinals at Roland Garros as a wildcard, will not make her Wimbledon debut after being dumped out in the first round.

The clay specialist was the No. 1 seed in the qualifying tournament thanks to her huge rise from 361st to 65th in the WTA rankings as a result of her epic run in Paris. But the French No. 1 was exposed on grass by the world No. 197, Canada's Carson Branstine on Tuesday.

In windy conditions, the 22-year-old was playing the first grass court match of her career, and she was beaten in three sets 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4.

Brastine was complimentary about her opponent when speaking to the press after the one-hour, 53-minute battle. The Canadian said: "She's an incredible player. She fights for every point. Her result at the French Open speaks for itself. I'm proud of myself."

Boisson defeated WTA No. 3 Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva on her thrilling run to the final four in Paris before she was routed in straight sets by eventual champion Coco Gauff.

Despite her breakthrough performance in the French capital, Boisson was denied a wildcard for the main draw at Wimbledon – a decision heavily criticized in her homeland – and she will have to settle for watching the tournament from home.

Julien Benneteau, France's Billie Jean King Cup captain, bemoaned the decision by Wimbledon organizers not to grant Boisson a wildcard ahead of her qualifying exit, although the former world No. 25 recognized that rules had been followed.

He told RMC: "The English don't give a damn about Lois Boisson. They do what they want. They didn't break any rules, that's why it's not unfair.”

“Lois Boisson is unlucky: there are a lot of young English players who are coming up, and they've prioritised that. Before giving out wildcards, the English also look at your past on grass. Whether it's at Wimbledon or in previous tournaments on grass.

“Lois Boisson has never played on grass, so for them, when we say she's the new star of world tennis, that she's reached a semi-final… For Wimbledon, it's nothing for the moment. And it's not pejorative.”

You have all these things going on, you're traveling, you're taken out of your element every single week.Sometimes the thing that keeps you sane is going to a good restaurant.

Many players view food as fuel for the body, a mentality that can extend off court too. And with weeks of travel and back-to-back events, it's easy to fall into a routine of plain chicken, endless pasta, and sushi platters.But speaking to Tennis.com in Paris—land of croissants, quiche, and steak frites—Pegula shared why she makes space to enjoy the moment, one meal at a time.“Yeah, that's really hard. I think it's a little bit different in tennis… Like, we're traveling every single week,” Pegula explained. “It's really hard to try and be super strict every single week.”“I do think maybe we cheat a little bit more than other sports. It's 'cause (food) is, like, the only thing we have!” she added with a laugh.“You have all these things going on, you're traveling, you're taken out of your element every single week.

Today's top tennis players are a far cry from the beer-and-cigarettes champions of decades past. From gluten-free to sugar-free, many follow extreme diets year-round.Pegula prefers to find a middle ground—one that prioritizes performance without sacrificing joy.“I'm not overly strict… It's not like there is a certain window where you could be strict,” she said. “If you want to be strict you'd be strict 11 months out of the year, and that's just kind of insane.“I try not to be too hard on myself… I think it's better just to keep a little bit of a balance.”She adds that her own nutrition rhythm shifts with the tennis calendar, tightening up before and during big events, and easing up afterward.“Definitely I try to be stricter during tournaments and like lead-up time. Then maybe after, if you have a few days and want to kind of cheat or do something really bad, then I feel like that's the time.”

Pegula, who lives in South Florida, also revealed that where she plays can shape what—and how strictly—she eats. When she's in Europe, for example, she gives herself more flexibility thanks to different food regulations and fresher ingredients.“I'm a little less strict in Europe because I feel like the food is a little bit cleaner,” she said in Paris.“When I'm home I try not to do a lot of dairy. I'm usually gluten-free. I'm not severely allergic, but I do feel better when I don't eat it. In Europe it definitely doesn't affect me as much so maybe not as strict in that sense."I think you just have to keep a good balance. Like I said, we travel every single week.”🍟 Q: Is there any meal you just can't resist?JESSICA PEGULA: I love French fries, which is not good in Paris. Not good (smiling).

The Winston-Salem Open has awarded its first 2025 main draw wild card to Stefan Dostanic.

The Wake Forest standout helped lead the Demon Deacons to the 2025 NCAA Team Championship and recently secured an automatic wild card into the 2025 US Open main draw by winning the 2024-25 American Collegiate Wild Card Playoff at the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Florida.

“I love Winston-Salem and I would say this is a home tournament to me now,” Dostanic said upon receiving his wild card. “I've seen so much great support from the city and the fans being at Wake these past few months, and I couldn't be happier to get this wild card.”

Dostanic competed as Wake Forest's No. 1 for the 2025 spring season, culminating with a dominant showing in the NCAA tournament that saw the Demon Deacons capture the 2025 team national championship. Dostanic previously played for the USC Trojans before transferring to Wake and is a native of Southern California.

The 2025 Winston-Salem Open will represent Dostanic's ATP main draw debut and come at a critical time as he prepares for his Grand Slam debut at the 2025 US Open.

“We're thrilled to award our first wild card to Stefan,” said Tournament Director Jeff Ryan. “He's shown an amazing level of tennis this year leading Wake Forest to a national championship, and this will be an amazing opportunity to highlight a rising talent with a meaningful connection to our local community here in Winston-Salem.”

The full Winston-Salem player entry list will be announced in mid-July. Tickets for the 2025 Winston-Salem Open are on sale now, with the event set to run from August 16-23 at the Wake Forest Tennis Complex.

EASTBOURNE, England (AP) — Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova saved two match points on British opponent Harriet Dart's serve before rallying to win her opening match Tuesday at the grass-court Eastbourne Open.

Dart was 40-15 up on serve leading 5-4 in the decisive third set of a rain-affected round-of-32 match that second-seeded Krejcikova went on win 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-5.

It was just the second victory this year for the 17th-ranked Krejcikova, whose season didn't start until May because of a back injury.

The 29-year-old Czech player came to Eastbourne for her final warmup before beginning the defense of her Wimbledon title next week. She lost in the first round at her previous grass-court event at Queen's Club in London.

Emma Raducanu, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, dropped the first set on her way to a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-1 win over Ann Li of the United States. The seventh-seeded British player next faces Australian teenager Maya Joint, who on Monday eliminated Ons Jabeur, the two-time Wimbledon beaten finalist from Tunisia.

Sofia Kenin, the fourth-seeded American, lost her opening match 6-4, 6-4 against Kimberly Birrell, the 77th-ranked Australian.

COLLEGE PARK, Maryland—Where do high-performance tennis coaches come from? What makes them even choose to become coaches? How does one learn to be a coach? Team sports such as baseball, basketball, and football have linear career paths, akin to a corporate ladder. But it's not so clear in tennis.We're quite familiar with the coach who was once a pro, such as Grand Slam champions Juan Carlos Ferrero and Conchita Martinez, or the many one-time Top 200 players who work with active pros. There are also tons of ex-college players, as well as longstanding instructors and one-time hitting partners who naturally evolve into the coach role.Then there's the distinct journey taken by Ali Agnamba and Oliver Akli. For nearly 25 years, Agnamba and Akli have been the primary high-performance coaches at the Junior Tennis Champions Center. Located in College Park, Maryland, less than a mile from the University of Maryland campus, the JTCC has been the training ground for dozens of college players, as well as such pros as Frances Tiafoe, Hayley Baptiste, Robin Montgomery, and Denis Kudla.

There are also tons of ex-college players, as well as longstanding instructors and one-time hitting partners who naturally evolve into the coach role.Then there's the distinct journey taken by Ali Agnamba and Oliver Akli. For nearly 25 years, Agnamba and Akli have been the primary high-performance coaches at the Junior Tennis Champions Center. Located in College Park, Maryland, less than a mile from the University of Maryland campus, the JTCC has been the training ground for dozens of college players, as well as such pros as Frances Tiafoe, Hayley Baptiste, Robin Montgomery, and Denis Kudla.

The 20-year-old Montgomery, who reached a career high of No. 95 in the world this June, began working with Agnamba when she was six. In 2021, while still working with Agnamba, Montgomery won the US Open junior girls' singles and doubles titles.“He shaped me but did it in a way that let me become who I am as a person and a player,” said Montgomery, who continues to communicate frequently with Agnamba while also working extensively with USTA head of women's tennis Kathy Rinaldi.Kudla commenced his training time at JTCC when he was 10, trained with Akli all through his formative years and spending frequent time with him over the course of his 16 years as a pro. Ranked No. 3 in the world as a junior, Kudla turned pro in 2010, and reached a career high of No. 53 in 2016. He credits Akli for creating a long-term vision of a playing style in a way that balanced passion, work, and the underrated aspect of frequent humor.“He laughed all the time and was always in good spirits,” said Kudla. “That was huge for a kid to have a rigorous developmental plan and also have fun with it.”

They brought in a great work right work ethic right away from day one, and the creative mindset to look for solutions . . . to be disciplined and give your best every day. Vesa Ponkka, JTCC president on coaches Agnamba and Akli

Like anyone in any job, Agnamba and Akli carry deep memories of where they came from and what factors have shaped their attitudes. In their case, it began in Togo, a nation with a population of just over nine million and scarcely a trace of significant tennis tradition.“We learned tennis by ourselves,” said Agnamba. “We were hitting, watching and studying while playing with club members.” From childhood into adolescence, Agnamba and Akli were used to playing with just three tennis balls for months at a time, earned tips as ball boys for members of a local club, and devoted themselves to the study of strokes, tactics, psychology, fitness, equipment and all else that helps one learn the game.Thousands of miles from regions where even moderately ranked juniors are swiftly given multiple frames, it was a big day when each was put on a free list. That happened in the mid-‘90s, around the same time Agnamba and Akli represented Togo in Davis Cup play (collectively they played 12 matches). By that time, Agnamba and Akli had both played a few local pro events.“We were young when we moved [to the U.S.],” said Agnamba, “and realized very quickly that we were not eligible to play college tennis, and then we didn't have enough funding to start playing at some of the pro events around the country. So, you make a judgment. I couldn't become a great player but I could become a great coach.”“They brought in a great work right work ethic right away from day one,” said Vesa Ponkka, JTCC president, “and the creative mindset to look for solutions . . . to be disciplined and give your best every day.”

Many times, Agnamba and Ali have told their students about their journey. The vivid contrast with the American tennis culture provided students with a rare perspective about how fortunate they are to have the chance to learn the game in a country with vast resources.“It was amazing to hear what they went through,” said Kudla, praising the humble qualities Agnamba and Ali instill in their players. “We always like to use the analogy that each practice and each match is like your own puzzle,” said Montgomery. “And I think since [Agnamba] had that freedom growing up, was self-taught and really close with Oliver, they helped each other grow and learned to give the player space.”Along with that, Agnamba and Ali are always seeking new instructional tactics. “When I'm teaching at first, I want to make sure they're enjoying it,” said Akli. “I want them to leave the court wanting to come back.”“You're trying to make them comfortable at the beginning,” said Agnamba, “and then when you show them that you care enough, you can start to slowly implement some of the things on them.”

“In lots of other places, players are over-coached,” said JTCC vice president Megan Moulton-Levy. “They're told too many things to do. They're not allowed to be creative on their own. The court is your ultimate canvas, and you're an artist, so you can create and problem-solve.”According to Moulton-Levy, one of Agnamba's great assets is his ability to help a player make a change in a way so subtle that the player's confidence is never broken. This is yet another contrast to environments where a player is frequently reminded of one shortcoming after another. “As a teenager, he just tried to bring out the best in me,” said Montgomery.Then there's Akli, praised by Moulton-Levy and Kudla for his sharp strategic and tactical mind. “He just saw the big picture and applied that to our game plans,” said Kudla. “We had a lot of trust and success with him.” Kudla retired earlier this year and is currently coaching Reilly Opelka. From motivation to laughter, the lessons he learned from Akli continue to echo.“There's a level of consistency that's been there for 22 years,” said Moulton-Levy. “They are the backbone.” According to JTCC CEO Ray Benton, “With Ali and Oliver, there's a strong sense of humility and an appreciation of giving back.” It adds up to a distinct brand of coaching wisdom, one puzzle piece at a time.

 Mallorca is a breeding ground for talent. Famously, the small Mediterranean island has produced some of the biggest names in tennis this century, from Carlos Moya to Rafael Nadal. But it can also count an international basketball star among its ranks in Rudy Fernandez. 

 The former Portland Trail Blazer and Denver Nuggets player on Sunday visited the Mallorca Championships presented by ecotrans Group, where he met the grass ATP 250 tournament's top seed, Ben Shelton. 

 After greeting each other on the tennis court, the No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings Shelton took the lead and invited his guest to a few rallies. The American was surprised by Fernandez's ability with racquet in hand. 

 “He's a better tennis player than I was expecting,” admitted Shelton after challenging Fernandez, who also represented Real Madrid and Joventut Badalona in the Spanish basketball league. “He told me that he plays golf sometimes with Rafa [Nadal], so maybe something has rubbed off from Rafa because his forehand is pretty good.”

 But the challenges did not stop there. After knocking up on the courts of the Mallorca Country Club, it was then Shelton's turn to show off his skills with a basketball under the watchful eye of a crowd of fans who were following the showdown between the two stars. 

 “It was fun, Rudy is a really nice guy, I'd never met him before,” continued Shelton. “I knew about him. There aren't many Spanish players who have played in the NBA. He played in the Spanish league and also for Portland and Denver, so it was great to meet him.” 



 Shelton did not back down from the challenge and proved to be just as handy with a basketball as Rudy Fernandez was on the tennis court. The American even provided his new acquaintance with an alley-oop, which Rudy duly dunked home. 

 “He's a great guy. He spends his summers in the USA. It was fun, really fun,” reflected Shelton. “I love playing basketball. It's fun, probably my second-favourite sport and I like watching it too.”

The French number one, now ranked 65th on the WTA Tour, was defeated after almost two hours of battle in the first grass-court match of her career, going down 6-2, 6-7, 6-4.

On a windy Court 1 in Roehampton, where qualifying for Wimbledon takes place, the 22-year-old Frenchwoman looked ill at ease on grass - a surface which differs greatly from her favoured clay.

Despite her stunning run at the French Open earlier in June, Boisson did not receive an invitation from the organisers of the next Grand Slam in the tennis schedule.

A wildcard in Paris, the player then ranked 361st in the world delighted the home fans by reaching the last four after defeating world number three Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva. She was then beaten in the semi-finals by American Coco Gauff, the eventual champion.

By virtue of her new ranking, Boisson was the top seed in Wimbledon qualifying.

Former doubles world No 1 Kristina Mladenovic has slammed “embarrassing” comments made by the likes of Carlos Alcaraz regarding the revamped US Open mixed doubles event.

Rather than hold a traditional mixed doubles event in 2025, the USTA has decided to move its mixed doubles event, with the competition now being held in the pre-tournament fan week.

Sixteen teams will take part in the event, which will be a best-of-three sets, first-to-four games format, with a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a full third set.

The decision was made to try and encourage more big names to take part, and that move has certainly worked.

ATP world No 2 Alcaraz pairs up with Emma Raducanu in arguably the most-talked-about pairing, with Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, and Jannik Sinner also all entered.

The Spaniard was asked about his partnership with Raducanu during his Queen's campaign and revealed his excitement for the upcoming tournament.

“I'm super excited about it,” said the 22-year-old. “I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament.

“I will try to bring my doubles skills. We will try to win, but obviously it's going to be really, really fun.”

Though the 22-year-old's comments have been celebrated by many, they appear to have drawn the ire of WTA star Mladenovic.

The Frenchwoman is a former world No 10 in singles, though she is best known for her doubles success, winning six women's doubles and three mixed doubles Grand Slam titles.

Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu's US Open hopes questioned in ‘weakest pair' verdict

And, in an interview with Eurosport France, the 32-year-old expressed her frustration.

“The communication alone is bad,” commented Mladenovic.

“When you hear Alcaraz or others say they're going to have fun while preparing for the US Open, it's embarrassing.

“A Grand Slam is neither preparation nor fun. It's years of sacrifice. When you're young, you dream of winning one, even in doubles.

“You don't want to see your sport turn into a gigantic spectacle, even if it will indeed bring in a lot of money.”

The winning pair will receive $1m in prize money, with the event being held from August 19-20; the main draw of the singles events will then begin on Sunday, August 24.

The event is set to be broadcast on TV and will likely encourage more fans to enter the site pre-tournament, when a string of exhibition events are usually held.

While recognising the potential financial benefits, Mladenovic has described the format change as “problematic.”

She added: “In terms of business strategy, it's a brilliant idea. It guarantees the US Open a much more lucrative third week in terms of ticket sales, on-site consumption, and, I imagine, TV rights.

“But from a sporting point of view, it's problematic because it touches on the essence of tennis. A Grand Slam is a competition steeped in history, in singles and doubles.

“And now, all of a sudden, the doubles become a super exhibition without anyone or anything having a say.

“There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam.”

World No 151 Taro Daniel has opened up on the harsh realities of life outside the tennis elite.

Daniel, 32, who hails from Japan but is based in Florida in the USA, has qualified for 11 Grand Slams, including Wimbledon on six occasions.

He is best known for reaching the third round of the Australian Open in 2022 after beating Andy Murray in round two, where he received £150,000 in prize money.

However, despite that memorable run, Daniel has faced financial issues during his career given the cost of hiring coaches and physios, as well as travel expenses, something that is a major problem for lower-ranked players.

And the 32-year-old has opened up on those monetary challenges which has seen him give up hobbies and other things he enjoys.

'When I was younger, I even wouldn't get the avocado on my Chipotle order because it's like three dollars more,' he told the Financial Times. 'When you try to save too much it ends up impacting people's games negatively.'

Daniel revealed how he couldn't afford to pay for avocado with his chipotle order 

Daniel opened up on how his prize money is quickly eaten up by various expenses and costs

Daniel failed to qualify for either the Australian or French Open earlier this year, but he has still racked up around £135,000 in prize money through various tournament performances. 

Nevertheless, that figure doesn't seem much when you take into account all the costs and expenses required for the life of a professional tennis player.  

'First of all, you're earning all of this money from foreign countries so they're going to take all the withholding taxes,' Daniel added.

'Tournaments cover your hotel room, but they don't cover your coach's hotel room. My credit card statement, it's at least $20,000 (£14,702) a month on just operational expenses of hotel, food, flights and not including the salaries I pay to my team.

'As a tennis player, you're like a small company but having all your employees travelling all the time. [It's] at least $100,000 (£73,518) per season for your basic level, not super experienced coach.'

The Japanese star continued: 'Ten years ago, when I started, a lot of players would travel alone because the standards were not as high. Now, it would be very rare for someone to travel alone to a Grand Slam, for example.  

'Everyone has a coach or trainer. They're probably right on the red-black line. Even in a Slam, you're not necessarily making money.'

Daniel will hope to qualify for Wimbledon this year which would guarantee him at least £66,000

Qualifying for Wimbledon takes place this week and if Daniel does manage to make it to SW19, it will not only be a fantastic career opportunity but also a chance to boost his earnings.

This is because there is a significant amount of prize money available at the tournament.

Those who are knocked out in the first round are guaranteed £66,000, while players who make it through to round two receive £99,000 and third round losers will even make £152,000.

Meanwhile, this year's £3million bounty for the Wimbledon winner will be the largest prize ever handed out in Grand Slam history.

Veteran Australian commentator Tony Jones will not be traveling to London for Wimbledon commentary as Channel Nine dropped him from its coverage. The reason behind this is the controversy he sparked with his comments at this year's Australian Open on Novak Djokovic.

Jones called the World No.6 “overrated” and a “has-been” during a live broadcast and this upset the 24-time Grand Slam champion who demanded an apology, boycotting his on-court interview with former player Jim Courier as a result of this. Jones did apologize and Djokovic moved on from the incident.

But now, Jones is again making headlines before Wimbledon, which starts on June 30. The Serb will be entering the tournament to chase his record 25th Grand Slam title. He was the finalist in the last two seasons, losing both matches to World No.2 Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic hasn't yet captured a Major since the 2023 US Open.

At this year's Melbourne Slam, after moving past Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, the 38-year-old handed the walkover to eventual finalist Alexander Zverev in the semifinal after he lost the first set due to an injury.

Then at the French Open, after strong performances one after the other, Djokovic couldn't go past World No.1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinals. He last lifted the Wimbledon title in 2022 by beating Australia's Nick Kyrgios.

Novak Djokovic will be aiming to tie the Wimbledon title tally with Roger Federer, who retired with eight of these trophies. Since 2018, Djokovic has reached the championship match of every Wimbledon, winning the titles from 2018 to 2022 and losing in the last two years to Carlos Alcaraz.

Djokovic ended his title drought by winning the Geneva Open this year, becoming the third man after Federer and Jimmy Connors to win 100 or more titles. It was his first title since last year's Paris Olympics win.

But before the ATP 250 event in the Swiss city, Djokovic lost his opening-round matches in both Monte Carlo and Madrid. Because of his campaign at Roland Garros, Serena Williams‘ former coach Patrick Mouratoglou considers Djokovic one of the contenders in the grass-court Major. He wrote on LinkedIn:

Next time you're asked if Novak can win a 25th Grand Slam, think about it, what did he just show us in Paris?

In the clay-court Major, Djokovic was breezing past opponents one after the other, winning his matches in straight sets before he was pitted against World No.3 Alexander Zverev, who took a set off him in the quarterfinals but the 2024 French Open runner-up ended up losing the match in four sets. In the semifinal, eventual finalist Jannik Sinner had to toil hard to knock him out and take a 5-4 lead in the head-to-head matchups.

After a shaky clay season, Novak made it all the way to the Roland Garros semifinals, beating top players like Zverev and pushing world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in a tight three-set match. Technically, physically, he's still at the level. Let's be clear: his tennis hasn't dropped. He's still capable of producing the precision, variation, and timing that made him one of the greatest players in history.

Many fans and tennis pundits think this year's Wimbledon is the last chance for Djokovic to win his 25th Major because it's the only Grand Slam tournament where he has reached the final since winning the 2023 US Open.

Djokovic will be making his 20th consecutive appearance in the third Major of the season. If he wins Wimbledon, he will become the second man to win 100 matches in two different Grand Slam events.

                                        French Open sensation Loïs Boisson lost the first grass-court match of her career to miss out on Wimbledon on Tuesday, ensuring there will be no repeat of her fairytale run to the semi-finals at Roland Garros.                

Issued on: 24/06/2025 - 15:25Modified: 24/06/2025 - 15:23

Shock Roland Garros semi-finalist Loïs Boisson was eliminated in the first round of qualifying for Wimbledon on Tuesday by 197th-ranked Canadian Carson Branstine.

The French number one, now ranked 65th on the WTA Tour, was defeated after almost two hours of battle in the first grass-court match of her career, going down 6-2, 6-7 (1/7), 6-4.

On a windy Court 1 in Roehampton, where qualifying for Wimbledon takes place, the 22-year-old Frenchwoman looked ill at ease on grass – a surface which differs greatly from her favoured clay.

Despite her stunning run at the French Open earlier in June, Boisson did not receive an invitation from the organisers of the next Grand Slam in the tennis schedule.

A wildcard in Paris, the player then ranked 361st in the world delighted the home fans by reaching the last four after defeating world number three Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Mirra Andreeva.

Boisson was then beaten in the semi-finals by American Coco Gauff, the eventual champion.

By virtue of her new ranking, Boisson was the top seed in Wimbledon qualifying.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Grand slam champions Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu have tennis fans watching both on and off the court.

Ahead of their mixed doubles debut together, the pair created a buzz at the recent Queen's Club Championships in London.

British tabloid newspaper The Sun has reported that the 2021 US Open champion was seen cheering on Alcaraz on two occasions during the tournament, before the Spaniard clinched the grasscourt title on Sunday AEST.

The report also claimed that the pair arrived at the venue within minutes of each other on both occasions, and that Alacaraz was seen at Raducanu's hotel.

Raducanu had been knocked out of the tournament in the quarter-finals earlier in the weekend.

This report, alongside the pair's friendly dynamic, has fuelled speculation that Alcaraz and Raducanu could be romantically involved.

The duo are set to compete together for the mixed doubles trophy at the US Open in August as part of a star-studded line-up of teams for the new-look format.

"I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me — I made that special request," Alcaraz told reporters earlier this month.

He then added, with a smile: "She's going to be the boss.

"I've known Emma for a really long time, and I have a really good relationship with her.

"We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really fun."

When asked about their partnership, Raducanu joked about making Alcaraz wait for her answer.

"Gotta keep them on their toes," she told media at Queens.

"I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play, but for me, when he asked me, I was going to say 'yes'. I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach."

The world No.2 Alcaraz is the favourite to take the title at Wimbledon when the competition starts on Monday, June 30, after his extraordinary come-from-behind win at Roland-Garros this month.

Despite rumours gaining traction, neither Alcaraz nor Raducanu has confirmed any romantic involvement.

When directly asked about the speculation in a recent BBC interview, Raducanu lightheartedly dismissed the talk.

"I'm glad the internet's having fun, and we're providing some entertainment for everyone," she said.

Raducanu previously dated Carlo Agostinelli, but ended their relationship last June.

When asked recently about dating, Alcaraz highlighted how being a professional tennis player makes it hard to meet and maintain a romantic relationship.

Alcaraz was previously linked to Spanish celebrity Maria Gonzalez Gimenez, though a relationship was never officially confirmed.

"I am single. I am looking for someone," Alcaraz said.

"It can be difficult as a tennis player to meet the right person because you are travelling all the time."

Both Alcaraz and Raducanu will kick off their campaigns for The Championships next week.

The BBC has stuck with many of the usual suspects for this year's line-up of Wimbledon pundits - but a handful of big names have missed out. The season's only grass-court Grand Slam tournament is less than a week away and fans are eager to get stuck into a high-stakes showdown in the south-west London sunshine.

For those who cannot make it to SW19, the BBC will keep them in the loop with wide-ranging coverage supplemented by an experienced team of presenters and a prestigious panel of tennis experts. Clare Balding will lead the presenting team and take charge of the afternoon coverage after Isa Guha kicks things off in the morning and before Qasa Aslom heads up Today at Wimbledon in the evening.

All England Club stalwarts John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Pat Cash, Tracy Austin and Annabel Croft are set to join Balding and Guha in the studio to provide their hot takes on the action.

There are also a number of recognisable names in the commentary box including Andrew Castle, Andrew Cotter, Jo Durie, Anne Keothavong, Nick Mullins and Todd Woodbridge, among others.

And the BBC have snapped up even more tennis heroes to aid with their radio coverage as Marion Bartoli, Kim Clijsters, Laura Robson, Greg Rusedski, Naomi Broady, Daniela Hantuchova and Leon Smith all made the cut.

Despite the long list of experts set to appear at Wimbledon, there are also some high-profile absentees from the BBC's list. There is no mention of Johanna Konta - the former world No. 4 who competed for Great Britain and was part of last year's studio coverage.

Australian star Ash Barty, who won Wimbledon in 2021 and retired the following year, appeared on the Beeb in 2024 but will not do so this summer after announcing the birth of her second child earlier this month.

And there is no place for the controversial Nick Kyrgios, whose inclusion as a BBC pundit and commentator last year was slammed by the then Women and Equalities select committee chair, Caroline Nokes, who said the broadcaster should 'hang its head in shame' for agreeing terms with the Aussie after he admitted to assaulting his ex-girlfriend.

Kyrgios has since hit back at his omission, telling The Guardian: "I know I'm a great commentator. All I've done for 20 years is play, study and breathe this sport. I also think tennis needs commentators who say things that not everyone says. It's unfortunate but it's probably their loss more than mine."

Emma Raducanu's doubles partnership with fellow tennis ace Carlos Alcaraz has already set tongues wagging, with reports claiming the pair could be an item.

The pair are set to team up for the US Open in August, but it appears their bond may go beyond the tennis court, after Emma was spotted supporting the Spanish star at the Queens Club Championships earlier this month.

According to The Sun, Emma was seen watching Carlos in action last Thursday and on Saturday - the day before he won the competition after beating Jiri Lehecka. 

Insiders claim the pair's bond has been 'the talk of Queens' with some asking whether there is 'something going on between them'.

The source added: 'He was apparently seen at her hotel last week and on Thursday and Saturday, when Emma went to support him, Emma's car arrived just minutes after Carlos got to Queens with his team.

'Inside they were seen laughing and joking with one another. They seem very happy and relaxed with each other.'

Another insider added: 'It wasn't just the tennis lot who were talking about it. People who worked for the BBC and other broadcasters were all gossiping about it.

'The only love being talked about was about Emma and Carlos.' 

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz for comment.

On Monday, Emma gushed about her new bond with Carlos, sharing they first became pals during her dream run at Wimbledon in 2021.

'He's so nice, very happy, amazing values and just a really positive light to be around,' she told the Mail.

'I've known him for years. Wimbledon 2021 was the first time I started getting to know him. He was always playing the day before me, I would see him win and then I would have motivation to win and get myself into that position too. 

'It was really cool to go through that tournament together and then I kept going through the US Open, we were staying in touch for the whole time and, yeah, it's nice. 

'We have a good relationship still. He's obviously overtaken me a lot, but it's nice that we have that from a while ago.'

The Mail had previously shared how Emma also has a close friendship with fellow teen tennis ace Benjamin Heynold.

He and Emma have known each other since the age of six and have represented Team GB together. 

Heynold, 24, is a student at the the University of North Carolina in the US and friends suggest that his long friendship with Emma may have turned to romance.

Raducanu split up with her Harrow-educated boyfriend, Carlo Agostinelli, last year.

Agostinelli, a former head boy of pricey private school Harrow, is the son of tycoon Robert Agostinelli, the co-founder and chairman of private equity firm Rhone Group.

The tennis star's year-long whirlwind romance with him was said to have been her most serious relationship yet.

She previously revealed that she wasn't allowed to date while growing up in Bromley, South East London, which made her resent her strict her parents, Ion and Renee Raducanu.

 'My parents were very much against [boyfriends] as it interfered with training,' she told The Times.

'When I was younger I wasn't even allowed to hang out with my girl friends.

'A lot of the time I was very resentful. But it made me very confident and comfortable in my own company, which is also a big strength.'

			Roger Taylor may have been a 1970s tennis star with Hollywood looks, but a player strike in 1973 almost tore his world apart

“Everyone fantasises about being James Bond,” says Roger Taylor, the square-jawed tennis star of the early 1970s. “It was every man's dream, wasn't it? This guy walks into a pub, and if somebody was a dishy one, well…”

Taylor tails off, but his meaning is clear. And he is right: for Englishmen of a certain vintage, nothing beats a secret agent with irresistible sexual magnetism. The difference, in Taylor's case, is that he actually auditioned for the role.

In 1967 – the year remembered for the Summer of Love – Taylor was 25, a self-taught player who had grown up hitting with his mother on the park courts of Sheffield. “Tall, dark and handsome,” in the words of one broadsheet newspaper, he was the matinee idol of the British game. Like Jack Draper today, only more so.

Where Draper squeezes modelling assignments in between training sessions, Taylor went one better: he was talent-spotted by a screenwriter's wife while playing the final of Queen's. She referred him to the Bond franchise, who were then looking to replace the departing Sean Connery.

It might seem like a daft idea. A non-actor, taking on the biggest role in 1960s cinema? But then, that's exactly what would happen when George Lazenby – an Australian car salesman turned male model – succeeded Connery the following year.

In Taylor's case, you can still see the outlines of a striking figure, even as he approaches his 84th birthday. Sitting in front of us, in a back room at the same Queen's Club where he twice reached the final, he looks trim and fit, with a powerful left forearm that once used to punch volleys – and occasionally opponents, as we will see.

Today, Taylor struggles with his health. He has spent the last five years battling slow-moving prostate cancer, and was more recently diagnosed with another potentially fatal condition called amyloidosis. “I get breathless very easily,” he says, even though he still visits the gym several times a week.

But if we rewind to 1967, Taylor had the looks to carry a movie poster, with his broad shoulders, soulful eyes, and thick mane of jet-black hair. He also had that aforementioned casting call, which took place at a hotel near Park Lane.

“There was a room full of men,” Taylor recalls now, “and these two big guys, Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, had big cigars sticking out of their mouths. They're sitting at a table. And these other guys are coming, looking at me, creeping around me. I still haven't said anything, and they never asked me to say anything. I'd been working on that famous line in the mirror – ‘The name's Bond, James Bond' – but it never came out.”

Taylor was invited back for a second viewing, and told to bring his bathing trunks. But he ignored the summons. As he explains in his forthcoming autobiography, “Frances [his first wife] became very irate, saying the whole thing was absolute madness. She's a Scottish baptist and clearly didn't fancy becoming a Bond girl.”

This was probably the right move. Lazenby – who would later marry another tennis champion in Pam Shriver – spent nine months shooting On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and found the attention so overwhelming that he turned down a six-film follow-up deal, despite an attached million-pound bonus.

Meanwhile, Taylor joined the so-called Handsome Eight – a group of contracted stars that also included Australian icons John Newcombe and Tony Roche. His leading-man credentials surely contributed to that cheesy moniker, even if it fitted certain players more than others. “The Handsome Seven and Tony Roche” was one suggested alternative.

Taylor's decision to join the Handsome Eight could have cost him his Wimbledon career, but fortunately his timing was perfect. The following year, 1968, All England Club chairman Herman David ended the ban on professional participation, so he never missed a match.

Unlike most of his peers, Taylor also participated in 1973, the most controversial year in the All England's Club's history. This was the summer of the players' strike, and Taylor's decision to break the picket line explains the title of his new book: The Man Who Saved Wimbledon.

The strike was part of an ongoing power struggle between increasingly militant players and stubbornly old-fashioned administrators. When Niki Pilic received a nine-month ban for refusing to represent Yugoslavia in the Davis Cup, the nascent player union (the Association of Tennis Professionals, which still runs the men's tour today) instructed its members to boycott Wimbledon in response.

Taylor, however, was reluctant. As he writes in his book, “Wimbledon was part of my DNA and all the more important to me as British No 1 and flagbearer for the host nation … Mixing with some of the old guard who made up the bulk of the membership, eminent soldiers who'd fought in the war and risked their lives for their country, led me to question who was going to stand up for this great event and not be bullied into submission.”

More than 50 years later, the events of that summer remain fresh in Taylor's mind, and still bring a quaver to his voice. He becomes emotional during our conversation, especially when discussing the lack of appreciation he received from those in positions of power. He finds their betrayal harder to stomach than the aggressive stance of Stan Smith, the reigning Wimbledon champion who bearded him at Queen's Club after a match.

“Stan said, ‘Roger, if you don't boycott, you'll never play tennis again.' So I said, ‘Why not?' And he said, ‘Because we [the ATP] will be running the game.'

“I was in a terrible state. The phone was ringing: people were calling me to say ‘Don't play, don't play'. Next call: ‘Play, come on, play.' I was going backwards and forwards. I called the referee on the first morning to withdraw. Then I changed my mind 10 minutes later and called him back again.

“The hardest thing was when I saw them come back the next year, the other players, and the way the officials greeted them. I saw Tim Phillips, who was on the way to becoming chairman, put his arm around Donald Dell [a player-turned agent who had helped instigate the boycott]. I thought ‘Oh, I'm a piggy in the middle here.' They're not going to be able to say I did anything because they don't want to …”

Taylor tails off once again, but as before, his meaning is clear. The All England Club wanted rapprochement with the vast majority. As a result, they were never going to lionise him for his brave stand. While the AELTC did cover the £5,000 fine levied by the ATP, the costs of Taylor's resistance extended far beyond his bank account. In his book, Taylor quotes Jack Kramer – the champion-turned-promoter who formed the original professional tour – to the effect that “Roger had been a good player, but he never amounted to a thing after Wimbledon '73.”

To make Taylor's memories even more painful, he probably should have won the title that summer, but came unstuck in the semi-finals against two-time French Open champion Jan Kodes. Again, there was a frustrating subplot here, because bad weather forced the players off court with Taylor leading the deciding set 5-4.

“It was virtually dark at 10 minutes past seven,” he recalls now. “It was dull and damp, and in those days there was no cover, no roof, no lights. The crowd had mostly gone home, so we were thinking we'd be back playing the next day.

“But if you know Wimbledon, they were military people, so they just wanted our match to be finished, to keep the order of the week going. After 42 minutes, Captain Gibson – who was the referee – shouted ‘Taylor back on court, now.'” Kodes dealt with the sudden resumption better, won the next three games in a flash, and dominated Alex Metreveli in a straight-sets final.

As a working-class lad from Sheffield, whose father was a trade unionist and a steelworker, Taylor never felt accepted by the tennis establishment. In his book, he describes how Dan Maskell, the famous commentator and coach, had snubbed him as a teenager, preferring prospects with better-heeled shoes. Much later, he was devastated by the AELTC's refusal to grant membership to his son Greig, a promising player who never quite found his way in the game, and would later pass away at the tragically early age of 46.

“Wimbledon is like a cult,” says Taylor, before citing the story of the elderly committee member who dismissed the glorious career of three-time champion Fred Perry in seven condescending words: “Fred had a bad war, you know.” Taylor found this comment hard to swallow. He had known Perry well, while working in his sports stores as an ambitious young player, and felt a certain kinship with his fellow northern misfit.

Warming to his theme, Taylor adds that “I've been to cocktail parties where we're sitting by Centre Court, and one of the Wimbledon committee members is addressing all these people, and everyone is sitting there in awe. I played on that court, and they never mentioned me.”

Although Taylor would eventually be appointed Davis Cup captain for four years in the early 2000s, he has never enjoyed the visibility and profile that his achievements surely warranted. Perhaps he was just too blunt-speaking and stubborn for his own good – a quality that has earned him comparisons to his Yorkshire contemporary Sir Geoff Boycott.

Taylor certainly could be ornery, not to mention rough when necessary. This is the man who threw the most famous left hook in tennis history, flooring the notoriously objectionable Australian pro Bob Hewitt during a row in 1969.

“He came closer and closer,” recalls Taylor, whose only crime had been to defeat Hewitt in a tight three-setter. “It was in the locker-room in Berlin, which was like an old Western with these swing doors, and he came bursting through them.

“I said something like, ‘Well, if you touch me, it's on.' And he pushed me. Bang. And I missed the French Championships. I didn't break my hand but I had it in a bucket of ice that night and I couldn't play the semi-final the next day. Luckily I wasn't penalised in any way because everybody knew about him and I was defending myself really.”

Sounds like those Bond casting agents really did miss a trick.

The Man Who Saved Wimbledon: Roger Taylor's Official Biography, published by Pitch Publishing, £25, is out June 30.

The incident that took place at Washington State's Summer Con began after Alicia Hannah-Kim tapped the shoulder of the actor, who plays the antagonist sensei John Kreese.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



Cobra Kai star Martin Kove was escorted out of a convention in Washington state this weekend after he admitted he bit his former co-star's hand and then exploded at her and her husband when confronted about the assault, according to a report from local police.


	Longtime Cobra Kai star Kove, who portrayed sensei John Kreese in the Netflix series in a reprisal of his iconic villain in the 1984 classic The Karate Kid,  and Alicia Hannah-Kim, the show's Kim Da-Eun in seasons 5 and 6, were attending Washington State's Summer Con in Puyallup when the incident occurred.

	Kove and Hannah-Kim were at the TV fan convention and participating in fan-focused activities around the show, which premiered in 2018 and concluded in February after six seasons; it takes place 34 years after the events of The Karate Kid. Kove's role in that film as Kreese, reprised in its two hit sequels, instantly made him one of the iconic villains of the 1980s. 


	According to an incident report filed by a Puyallup police officer and obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, the biting occurred after Hannah-Kim approached her former co-star Kove, tapping him on the shoulder to get his attention. At that point, the report citing Hannah-Kim's account to the officer states, Kove began to bite her arm.


	“When Alicia did this, Martin Kove suddenly grabbed her arm and bit her upper arm so hard it nearly drew blood, and she yelled out in pain. Once Martin Kove finished biting her arm, he grabbed her arm again and began kissing it where he had bit her (Alicia had a very noticeable bite mark on her arm that was already turning blue and bruising),” the report states.

	











	At that point, Hannah-Kim found her handler and husband, Sebastian Roche, and the three went back to find Kove and confront him about the assault. When they found the actor, who had his son and an agent with him at the event, he “exploded on them, saying something to the effect of how dare they confront him, and he did not do anything wrong.” At that point, after the couple sought out the officer in the VIP area, Kove was brought to a back area away from the convention attendees. 


	Speaking with the officer, Kove admitted to biting Hannah-Kim, the report states, telling everyone present that it was done in jest and “he thought he was being funny.” Kove said that he and Hannah-Kim would “play fight all the time” on the Cobra Kai set. He did not think it was a big deal, the report states.


	Alicia went and told her handler and her husband Sebastian Roche, and they went to speak with Martin Kove about this incident. They told him how Martin Kove “exploded on them, saying something to the effect of how dare they confront him, and he did not do anything wrong.” 


	Hannah-Kim's arm, at this point, was growing more noticeably bruised, having worsened since the officer first spoke with her, the report states. When informed by his former co-star that what he did to her was illegal, Kove brushed it off, saying he was just “messing around.” His attitude sharply shifted after the officer explained the potential consequences of his actions, which amounted to assault. 

	











	“It was absolutely illegal and not only did he cross boundaries but he broke the law, and it was being investigated as an assault, and he could potentially be booked into jail or issued a citation for his unprovoked biting and kissing,” the responding officer wrote in the report.


	After Kove apologized in front of the officer, Hannah-Kim then asked to speak to the officer in private. She told him that she did not want to press charges against Kove but did want to ensure that the assault was documented in case Kove's behavior continues. She and her husband then provided handwritten statements on the incident.


	Kove was then escorted, along with his son, out of the convention. The officer indicated in his report that Kove reiterated that this type of play-fighting occurred frequently with the two on the Cobra Kai set as he was being removed from the event.


	Emails sent to Kove's talent agent and manager by THR on Tuesday seeking comment were not immediately returned.

Michael Cera let his fear of fame dictate his rule against franchises. The “Phoenician Scheme” actor has long voiced his aversion to celebrity, but the star is now revealing that he turned down a role in “Harry Potter” prequel franchise “Fantastic Beasts” because of it. 

“I don't even know if I was offered, I think I just declined to engage with it because I think it would be probably a six-year commitment or something. But also, I did sort of make a conscientious choice to limit my exposure a little bit, or just try and be a little more in control of it,” Cera said during the “Louis Theroux Podcast”. “And I felt like doing, especially little kids' movies, I had a big fear of doing things that I would get too famous.”

“Fantastic Beasts” stars Eddie Redmayne as an expert on magical creatures. Jude Law plays a young Albus Dumbledore who enlists his help to defeat Gellert Grindelwald, as played by Johnny Depp and later Mads Mikkelsen for the third film amid Depp's firing. The franchise was announced in 2016 to consist of  five films; only three have been released, with features in 2016, 2018, and 2022. Law said in 2024 that the other franchise installments are most likely “on hold.” 

 










Meanwhile, Cera has “changed” his mind “a little” about franchises in his career now. 

“I think I've outgrown that particular feeling, but I think that's what that was at that time,” he said. “But if a franchise came along now and seemed interesting, I don't think on the grounds of it being a franchise I would storm out of the office or anything.”

Cera previously told The Guardian that by age 19, he contemplated stepping away from Hollywood for good due to his “overwhelming” rise to fame after “Juno” and “Superbad,” both of which were released in 2007. “I didn't know how to handle walking down the street,” Cera said. “Fame makes you very uncomfortable in your own skin, and makes you paranoid and weird. There were lots of great things about it, and I met a lot of amazing people, but there's a lot of bad energies, too, ones that I was not equipped to handle.”

Cera even turned down hosting “Saturday Night Live” in an effort to tame his celeb status. “There was a point where I wanted to stop taking jobs that would make me more famous,” the actor said. “I was kind of having a bit of a crisis. I was really not enjoying the level of heat. I really didn't know if I was going to keep being an actor.”

Bailey, who has accused DDG of domestic violence, currently has sole custody of the child they share while filming a movie in Rome.

	Rachel Scharf



DDG is asking a judge for permission to visit the son he shares with Halle Bailey in Rome, where the 25-year-old singer and actress is filming a movie and has sole custody of the child amid domestic violence claims against her rapper ex-boyfriend.


	A lawyer for DDG (Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr.) made the request during a Tuesday (June 24) hearing in Los Angeles court, where Bailey won temporary sole custody of their 18-month-old son, Halo, last month after accusing the 27-year-old Twitch rapper of physically attacking her multiple times in the child's presence.


	Bailey now has Halo with her in Rome for two months while she films a movie. DDG's attorney, Larry Bakman, told Judge Latrice A.G. Byrdsong on Tuesday that the rapper wants to go to Italy and see Halo at the end of this month, with his mother supervising the visits.




			Trending on Billboard		







	A lawyer for Bailey, Jeremy Lane, responded that he's fine with DDG seeing Halo but wants the visits to be supervised by a professional monitor rather than the rapper's mother. Lane said DDG's mom has a history of “enabling” his alleged abusive behavior, including incessant posting on social media about Bailey and Halo.


	The judge said she thinks it's “reasonable” for DDG to visit Halo in Italy, but that she'd require an independent monitor due to Bailey's concerns. The judge also said that if these visits are permitted, she'll put in place an order barring DDG from posting about the child on social media during that timeframe.


	The lawyers are now looking into the availability of professional monitors in Rome, and they're set to return to court for further discussion of the matter on Thursday (June 26).


	DDG denies Bailey's domestic violence claims and has filed a competing custody case of his own, claiming Bailey is actually the abuser in their relationship and has repeatedly threatened self-harm as a means of emotional manipulation.


	Bailey says DDG is exaggerating and that while she has struggled with thoughts of self-harm in the past, her mental health is completely under control.


	Bailey has been awarded sole custody of Halo while the case plays out. A final custody arrangement for the child will be determined after a full hearing on the matter, which is currently on track to take place in late July in Los Angeles family court.


	Reps for Bailey and DDG did not immediately return requests for comment on Tuesday.

	A whistleblower complaint against Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove accuses the Trump administration official of instructing members of the Justice Department to ignore court orders that could have interfered with plans to transfer several planes of undocumented migrants to prisons in El Salvador. 


	Bove is currently a nominee to become a federal circuit court judge.


	According to a whistleblower complaint filed by former DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni and obtained by The New York Times, Bove stated during a March meeting that the Justice Department would need to consider giving a big “fuck you” to the courts if they attempted to interfere with plans to transfer migrants to a foreign prison known for its human rights abuses. 


	Reuveni represented the DOJ in three cases related to the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigration, and was fired after admitting in court — where he is required to tell the truth under questioning from a judge — that in April the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man residing in Maryland who had a protective court order barring his removal to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, along with hundreds of others, was sent to CECOT, a notorious maximum-security prison and propaganda production center built by El Salvador's authoritarian President Nayinb Bukele, a strauch Trump supporter. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Abrego Garcia's case was central to the widespread legal efforts to reverse the imprisonment and indefinite detention of those sent to El Salvador without due process. It was also the focal point of the Trump administration's efforts to stonewall the judiciary.

	











	According to Reiveni's complaint, “plans of DOJ leadership to resist court orders that would impede potentially illegal efforts to deport noncitizens” were formed weeks before the deportations took place. Reiveni also alleges the DOJ lied about its deportation agenda. 


	On March 15 — during a hearing over a restraining order against the deportations — Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign was asked by D.C. District Judge James Boasberg if he knew of plans to conduct removals under the Alien Enemies act “in the next 24 or 48 hours.”

	Ensign told the court that he didn't “know the answer to that question,” and requested some time to contact members of the administration to find out. The invocation of the Alien Enemies Act had been signed hours before, and during the 40-minute break granted to him by Boasberg the first two planes of migrants departed towards El Salvador. 


	But according to Reuveni's complaint, Ensign was present at a meeting that took place the day before in which Bove informed high-ranking DOJ officials that “the AEA proclamation would soon be signed and that one or more planes containing individuals subject to the AEA would be taking off over the weekend — meaning Saturday, March 15 and Sunday, March 16.” 


	According to the complaint, Reuveni “reasonably believes Ensign's statement to the court that he did not know whether AEA removals would take place ‘in the next 24 or 48 hours' was false. Ensign had been present in the previous day's meeting when Emil Bove stated clearly that one or more planes containing individuals subject to the AEA would be taking off over the weekend no matter what.”


	The complaint suggests that Ensign's actions in court may have been part of an open effort by the DOJ to obstruct the courts, alleging that during the same March 14 meeting, Bove discussed the possibility that “a court order would enjoin those removals before they could be effectuated,” and suggested that the “DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you' and ignore any such court order.“

	When it became clear that the planes had taken off, Boasberg issued a written order demanding that any further flights be canceled, and that the planes already in the air be turned around. Reuveni — monitoring the hearing through a public line — texted his supervisor, Deputy Director August Flentje, a reference to Bove's “fuck you” comment, to which Flentje “acknowledged Bove's comment with a joke referencing the possibility that either he or Mr. Reuveni could be fired, impliedly for reporting up their chain of command concerns that a court order had been violated.” 

	











	The resulting court battle over the removals and allegations of legal misconduct by the administration saw the president and his allies repeatedly flout court orders — including an order from the Supreme Court to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. Reuveni's complaint alleges that he was told by both Flentje and Ensign that “the government was not going to answer the court's questions about anything that happened before 7:26 p.m. on March 15, and so not to provide information about when the flights took off.” 


	In April, when Reuveni was assigned to represent the government in Abrego Garcia's case he — as stated in his complaint — “candidly and truthfully informed the court, based on the evidentiary record, that Mr. Abrego Garcia's removal from the United States was a mistake. Later that evening, Mr. Reuveni refused directions from his superiors to file a brief misrepresenting those facts to the court.”


	Reuveni was put on administrative leave the next day, and fired within a week. 


	On Wednesday, Bove will face the Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing discussing his nomination to serve as United State circuit judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

	Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), ranking Democrat on the committee, told the Times that the complaint against Bove not only speaks to his “failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate[s] that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.”


	Why would Republicans install a judge who has demonstrated a willingness to tell the courts to “fuck off” in favor of a president's political goals, if not to help that president neuter the judiciary from within?

	The general consensus is that Pedro Pascal wasn't in the wrong for referring to J.K. Rowling‘s relentless spewing of anti-trans rhetoric as “heinous loser behavior” earlier this year. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, his own sister Javiera Balmaceda backed his stance, saying, “But it is heinous loser behavior. And he said that as the older brother to someone, saying that our little sister doesn't exist.” Pascal, whose sister Lux Pascal came out as trans in 2021, told the magazine that his drive to defend goes deeper than just family.


	“The one thing that I would say I agonized over a little bit was just, ‘Am I helping? Am I fucking helping?'” he said. It's a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen, and people will actually be protected. Listen, I want to protect the people I love. But it goes beyond that. Bullies make me fucking sick.”


	Pascal added that he felt for a moment like “that kid that got sent to the principal's office a lot for behavioral issues in public schools in Texas, feeling scared and thinking, What'd I do?” But the principle of his stance outweighed any external anxiety that might have accompanied the online spat.

	Elsewhere in the interview, Pascal is placed at the scene of his 50th birthday celebration. For his party at Stone Nest in London, the actor hired the trans, Grammy Award-winning DJ Honey Dijon to spin music throughout the night while he danced with his friends in a Protect the Dolls T-shirt. 

	











	In 2023, Pascal told Esquire about his connection with Lux, his younger sister. “She is and has always been one of the most powerful people and personalities I've ever known,” he said. “My protective side is lethal, but I need her more than she needs me.”

Follow all of our Sean Combs trial coverage


	After six weeks, more than 30 witnesses, several days of tearful testimony from three alleged sexual-abuse victims, sealed “freak-off” videos, testimony from Kid Cudi, and a courthouse cameo from Kanye West, the Southern District of New York rested its sprawling sex-trafficking and racketeering case against Sean Combs on Tuesday. 


	Prosecutors confirmed their final witness was Joseph Cerciello, the Homeland Security special agent who answered questions about charts documenting Combs' “freak-offs” with his ex-girlfriends and a rotating cast of male escorts. When Cerciello was dismissed, prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian they were finished, ending speculation that one of Combs' high-ranking, alleged co-conspirators might be called to the stand. The move set the stage for Combs' all-star defense team to take the lead. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said Monday that Combs had no plans to call any live witnesses and would simply introduce exhibits before resting.


	After jurors left the courtroom for lunch, defense lawyer Alexandra Shapiro asked the judge to step in and simply acquit Combs himself. She argued prosecutors had failed to prove Combs oversaw a racketeering conspiracy. Shapiro said there was only “thin proof” Combs' employees had any inkling about the true nature of Combs' freak-offs with his girlfriends, which were also known as “hotel nights” and “king nights.” She argued they simply didn't know “what went on with Combs and his girlfriends in the hotel room other than they used a lot of baby oil and Astroglide and drank alcohol and maybe did drugs.”

	











	Shapiro said Combs, his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, and a more recent ex-girlfriend, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, personally booked the escorts that they used for their highly choreographed sex marathons. Shapiro argued some evidence showed Combs and Jane went out of their way to hide the escorts from Combs' staff. “That's not the way co-conspirators act with each other,” she said, referencing a texts where Combs' chief of staff Kristina Khorram scolded Combs because she believed he hadn't been honest with her.

	











	Shapiro conceded some employees may have helped procure drugs for Combs, but she dismissed the amounts as “personal quantities.”

	Judge Subramanian reserved any decision on the defense motion to acquit. He then asked Combs if it was his decision to not testify. Combs stood upright and started by complimenting the judge. “I wanted to tell you, thank you. You're doing an excellent job,” he said. In a voice that seemed a bit husky, Combs answered affirmatively that he had been informed about his rights and had decided not to testify in his own defense. “That is solely my decision,” he said. “It's my decision, with my lawyers.”


	Recapping two decades of Combs' life, the government set out to prove to a New York jury how the “larger-than-life,” charming, and successful hip-hop mogul covertly used his billion-dollar empire as an alleged criminal enterprise, whose members engaged in acts of physical violence, threats, witness tampering, kidnapping, forced labor, bribery, and arson. 


	The alleged enterprise was sustained by a team of loyal, and sometimes terrified staffers. Together, these employees “carefully cultivated and guarded his reputation,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily A. Johnson said during opening statements on May 12. “They worked to get the defendant everything he wanted. He sometimes called himself the king, and he expected to be treated like one. He expected his inner circle to cater to his every desire, including his sexual desires.” 


	The 55-year-old Bad Boy founder has vehemently denied the criminal accusations and pleaded not guilty to five felony charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transportation to engage in prostitution. He faces life in prison if convicted.

	The crux of the SDNY's case revolves around Combs' alleged freak-offs, a term first introduced by Ventura in her bombshell lawsuit against Combs in November 2023. Prosecutors described freak-offs as highly choreographed, drug-induced sexual marathons with one of Combs' girlfriends and a male escort. Combs is accused of treating the days-long encounters as his own personal porn set, giving directions to his girlfriend and filming the sex acts.


	Even before opening statements, many of the case's central claims have been public knowledge due to Ventura's 35-page complaint. Beyond the alleged sexual abuse, Ventura detailed specific events throughout her decade-long relationship with Combs that kept her trapped in the “abusive” dynamic. Prosecutors labeled some of those events as criminal acts, including arson, bribery, physical assault, and drug distribution, among others. 

	











	Ventura was the anchor to prosecutors' case, the 38-year-old taking the stand in the first week due to her pregnancy and imminent delivery date. (Ventura gave birth to her third child, a boy, two weeks after testifying.) She alleged a then-37-year-old Combs pursued and wooed her when she was a 21-year-old signee to his iconic record label in 2007. The two entered into a whirlwind romance before Combs introduced her to his “fantasy,” watching her have sex with other men. Ventura said she came to know the encounters as freak-offs.


	Ventura alleged there were times when she tried to push back against Combs. But whenever she did, Ventura alleged Combs would stifle her music career, viciously beat her, kick her out of her own apartment, and threaten to leak explicit videos of her. Instead of focusing on making music, Ventura said her job was “basically a sex worker.”


	Another of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Jane, claimed Combs twisted her love for him and made her feel like a “sex robot.” Jane, who dated Combs from January 2021 until his September arrest, alleged that when she began telling Combs she no longer wanted to have what she knew as “hotel nights,” he'd become agitated and threaten to break up with her.


	When Combs began paying $10,000 a month for her rent, Jane claimed he would continually make references to his financial support — a looming reminder that he could yank it away at a moment's notice. Desperate for Combs' affection, Jane said she participated in nights of “debauchery” with Combs because she believed she would then get quality time alone with Combs as a reward.


	As their relationship deteriorated in the wake of Ventura's lawsuit, Jane claimed Combs once slapped, punched, kicked, and choked her in June 2024 before allegedly forcing her to take a pill and have sex with a male escort. “Is this coercion?” a taunting Combs allegedly asked Jane as he handed her the drug.


	Much of the government's case revolves around the accusations that Combs sex-trafficked both Ventura and Jane. Prosecutors allege Ventura was sex-trafficked through force and coercion, while Jane was allegedly sex-trafficked through fraud. 


	As part of the case, prosecutors produced evidence allegedly showing Combs transported male sex workers across state lines for the sole purpose of having sex with his girlfriends. Bank and travel records, as well as testimony from Jane and Ventura, detail at least 20 instances where Combs' companies paid for certain men to be flown from Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta to various cities, including internationally, where alleged freak-offs occurred sometimes just a few hours later. 

	











	Yet the specifics around the male escorts — including live testimony from male escorts Daniel Phillip and Sharay Hayes, a.k.a. the Punisher — was minimal compared to prosecutors' focus on the racketeering-conspiracy element of their case. 


	Through dozens of witnesses, including six of Combs' former assistants, hotel security guards, law enforcement officials, and a former executive at Combs' company, prosecutors broke down what they claim were the racketeering's predicate acts of arson, kidnapping, and bribery, among others, step-by-step.  


	Three of Combs' personal assistants between 2014 and last September were given immunity to testify how they were tasked in procuring a variety of drugs, including Ecstasy, prescription pills, cocaine, and tusi for Combs and hand-delivering it to him.  


	Musician Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, said he raced home in December 2011 when Combs' assistant Capricorn Clark frantically called to inform him that Combs had broken into Mescudi's Hollywood Hills home after Combs learned of Mescudi's fleeting romance with Ventura. Weeks later, after dodging Combs' calls and spending the holidays with Ventura, Mescudi learned that a Molotov cocktail was dropped in the driver's seat of his burned-out Porsche. 


	Clark cried as she alleged two kidnappings at the hands of Combs. She said Combs' security guard brought her to a dilapidated Midtown office building for five consecutive days to administer a lie-detector test after diamond jewelry Combs had on loan went missing in 2004. Clark said an unidentified, chain-smoking, beefy man told her she would be thrown into the East River if she failed the test. Clark said Combs later showed up to her door with a gun and forced her to accompany him to Mescudi's home. “He just said, ‘Get dressed. We're going to go kill this n—a,'” Clark recounted.


	Former InterContinental Hotel security guard Eddy Garcia testified that Combs' chief of staff Kristina Khorram hounded him over seeing a copy of the damning security footage of Combs attacking Ventura in a hotel hallway after a freak-off in March 2016. Garcia said he eventually played middle man to receive a $100,000 alleged bribe to deliver Combs the believed lone copy of the footage. 


	There was also Mia, Combs' personal assistant, who alleged her boss sometimes made her feel like a best friend but would randomly and sporadically sexually assault her. Unable to look up as she testified, Mia cried as she detailed how she still suffers from PTSD. After leaving Combs' orbit in 2016, Mia said she received an out-of-the-blue text from Combs' former longtime security guard, Damion “D-Roc” Butler, days after Ventura's lawsuit was filed. Over the next three months, D-Roc allegedly tried to put Mia in touch with Combs, offering to send her money.

	As prosecutors have rested, the defense now will take center stage. Early in the trial, they indicated to the court that they may need more than a week to present their case. As the trial went on, that timeline shortened, and by Monday, Combs' lawyers said they would need around one day and would not be presenting any witnesses in Combs' defense.


	If the defense rests its case by Wednesday, closing arguments are expected to begin Thursday, with jurors beginning deliberations as soon as Friday. Judge Subramanian has repeatedly told the jury, with assurances from both the defense and government, that he expects the trial to be wrapped by the July Fourth holiday. Combs' defense team likely wants to avoid antsy jurors rushing into a decision because of looming holiday plans.

He came to fame as a singer on 'Shindig!' and had top 10 hits with "Little Woman," "La La La (If I Had You)," "Julie, Do Ya Love Me" and "Easy Come, Easy Go."

	Bobby Sherman, the pop singer and Here Come the Brides actor whose image graced bedroom posters, lunch boxes and fan magazines as a heart-fluttering teen idol of the 1960s, has died. He was 81.


	Sherman's death was announced Tuesday by his second wife, Brigitte Poublon. It was revealed in March that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer.




	“Bobby left this world holding my hand — just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my Prince Charming,” she wrote.

	Discovered at a Hollywood cast party when he was 20, Sherman got a big break when he was signed as a regular vocalist for the ABC musical variety show Shindig! in 1964. He spent about 16 months on the program, which showcased the top acts and songs of the day, through January 1966.


	The blue-eyed, brown-haired Sherman had made his acting debut as a kidnapped son of a millionaire businessman on a 1965 episode of ABC's Honey West, then played a singing surfer in the mold of Frankie Avalon on NBC's The Monkees in 1967 before landing on Here Come the Brides.


	Sherman portrayed the youngest of three brothers, the shy, stammering logger Jeremy Bolt, on the 1968-70 Screen Gems/ABC show. A “Western with no guns,” it was loosely based on the Mercer Girls, who were brought to the boom town of Seattle in the 1860s to work as teachers, and inspired by the classic Stanley Donen musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954).


	Sherman's siblings on the series were played by Robert Brown and future Starsky & Hutch star David Soul, and his character enjoyed a romance with Candy Pruitt (Bridget Hanley). Joan Blondell portrayed Lotte, the saloon owner who looks out for the new women in town.

	











	“We had a lot of Bobby shows,” executive producer Bob Claver said in Jonathan Etter's 2015 book, Gangway, Lord! The Here Come the Brides Book. “Those were my favorites because I liked the character and all the rest of it. Bobby had a solid core of people that liked him, as they should have. He was an interesting actor.”


	With all that television exposure, Sherman's singing career took off, and he had million-sellers and top-10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969 and '70 with “Little Woman” — which peaked at No. 3 — “La La La (If I Had You),” “Julie, Do Ya Love Me” and “Easy Come, Easy Go.”


	It all made for a crazy schedule.


	“I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening [concerts] Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again,” he told The Washington Post in 1998. “It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.


	“I was disoriented — I never knew where I was, always had to be reminded. But, in all honesty, I must say I had the best of times because the concerts were great, the fans were great. It was the proverbial love-in, but it just zapped so much out of me.”


	In March 1971, Sherman guest-starred on an episode of ABC's The Partridge Family that served as a back-door pilot for his new series, Getting Together, in which he played a struggling songwriter. Up against CBS' All in the Family, it lasted just 14 episodes before being canceled.

	











	More recently, Sherman worked as an emergency medical technician who trained paramedics in CPR and first aid at the Los Angeles Police Academy. He also became a reserve police officer in L.A. and a deputy sheriff in San Bernardino County.


	“There's not a better feeling in the world than when you're responsible for saving someone's life,” he said. “It's real life — you can't say, ‘Take two.' It's now.”


	Robert Cabot Sherman Jr. was born in Santa Monica on July 22, 1943, and raised in Van Nuys. His father owned his own milk delivery service, Woodland Hills Dairy, that had him rising at 3:30 a.m. each day to reach his 1,000 customers.


	Sherman played guitar, piano, trumpet, trombone, French horn and drums while growing up, practicing in the soundproof room at home that his dad had built for him.


	After graduating from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys in 1961, Sherman was studying child psychology at Pierce College when a girlfriend took him to a cast party for The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965).


	He got up and sang with the band, then was approached by actors Natalie Wood, Jane Fonda and Sal Mineo, who said they would like to manage him and jumpstart his career. With Mineo's help, he recorded a song, then auditioned for Shindig! An hour later, he had an offer for 28 shows.


	On Shindig!, Sherman would cover such hits as “I'm Into Something Good,” “Have I the Right” and “She's Not There,” often accompanied by squeals from the adoring girls in the audience. (It was reported that all that screaming over the years led to Sherman suffering from hearing loss.)

	











	On Here Come the Brides, on which future Brian's Song screenwriter William Blinn served as head writer, Sherman scored high marks for his acting, especially when it came to his stammering.


	“I thought Bobby did a good job with it, he managed a find a balance,” Claver said in Etter's book. “The worst thing in the world you can give to an audience is, ‘Oh! Is he going to talk long?' and [have them] be uncomfortable, but he didn't do that.”


	Sherman also appeared on TV shows including The F.B.I., Emergency!, The Mod Squad, Ellery Queen, The Love Boat, Murder, She Wrote and Frasier. In 1986, he played a former musician who lives next door to a Latino family led by Reni Santoni in the USA sitcom Sanchez of Bel Air, but that show didn't last long.


	Sherman's autobiography, Still Remembering You, was published in 1996. Two years later, he returned to the concert stage after 25 years away to take part in a “Teen Idol Tour” with Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits and Davy Jones of The Monkees.


	In 1994, Dick Clark asked Sherman what motivated him to become an EMT.


	“When my two sons, Christopher and Tyler, were growing up, I had visions of them falling out of trees and off bikes, and I wanted to be prepared for any emergency, so I took first aid and just fell in love with it,” he said. “The more I learned, the more I wanted to know, and the next thing I know I'm an instructor.”


	In his spare time, he rode along on rescue calls with fire department paramedics.

	











	“On one call in Northridge, we were working on a hemorrhaging woman who had passed out,” Sherman told the Los Angeles Times in 1993. “Her husband kept staring at me. Finally, he said, ‘Look, honey, it's Bobby Sherman!' The woman came to with a start. She said, ‘Oh great, I must look a mess!' I told her not to worry, she looked fine.”


	He and Brigitte founded the Brigitte & Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in 2011. Survivors also include his sons and six grandchildren.


	Sherman was married to Patti Carnel from 1971 until their 1979 divorce. After they split, she married Soul, her ex-husband's co-star on Here Come the Brides, in 1980; they divorced in 1986.

'007 First Light' will be released next year, featuring a fresh take on Bond from 'Hitman' developer IO Interactive.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The first new James Bond under the complete ownership of Amazon MGM Studios will make his debut in 2026, and he is young, brash, has a robust origin story and a mysterious scar on his right cheek … and is a playable character.


	The future of the James Bond film franchise is still being written (Amy Pascal and David Heyman are hard at work on that), but the next chapter of James Bond the IP will begin next year, in what will be the first project to feature the iconic character since Amazon stunned the world by buying out control from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.

	In 2026, the Danish video game publisher IO Interactive will release 007 First Light, a new video game franchise starring a wholly original version of Bond. It's a big deal, not just because it is the first new Bond to be released under Amazon, and the first new version of the James Bond character since Daniel Craig starred in Casino Royale in 2006, but it will also be the first major James Bond game to be released in 15 years, since 2010's 007: Blood Stone (which featured a digital likeness of Craig as Bond).

	And it is being developed by IO, the publisher behind the Hitman franchise, one of the biggest pieces of video game IP in history.


	Hakan Abrak, the CEO of IO Interactive, tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview that the there is “a lot of pressure” to deliver, given both his studio's track record, and the legacy of James Bond the character.

	











	“Bond is a very cherished and important IP, and a lot of people have grown up with that,” he says. “It does mean a lot to a lot of people.”


	Of course video games, like films, take years to make, and First Light is no exception. The company announced its plans to develop the game in late 2020, so most of the game's progress has been with both Amazon and the Broccoli family's EON Productions as its partners. Abrak says that the change in ownership has had little impact on the game's development.


	“I think the most important thing to say here is that I'm really happy that the character and the story and all that is unchanged,” Abrak says. “We've been having a really good collaboration with MGM and with EON and now Amazon MGM, we've had a strong vision, both for the story and for the character, and what we wanted to achieve with this project, and how we want to touch people's hearts out there. That vision has been supported.”


	That means crafting an entirely new James Bond, one that will feel “right” to fans of the franchise, while also being fresh to younger consumers that may be more familiar with Agent 47 from Hitman.


	“It's very unusual for us to work on another IP, this is the first time,” Abrak says. “Because of our pedigree and our history, it's extremely important for us to put a part of ourselves into our creations. It's extremely important that we can put our fingerprints into it, because that just gets your creative juices going.”


	The result is a Bond that is young and brash, with a cutting sense of humor, but also an optimism and naiveté that might surprise fans of the franchise.

	











	“He is not a completely perfectly cut diamond from day one. He's not a Bond that is completely on top of his game yet, he's not very well versed in the tuxedos and martinis yet,” Abrak says. “It's something that he is being introduced to, this rough world of espionage.”


Hitman, in many ways, was the perfect test case. The protagonist of that franchise, Agent 47, is an assassin for hire, but the skills he uses certainly rhyme with what Bond is known for, even if there are some significant differences in tone and approach.


	“[Agent 47] is like a chess player. He's pre-planning his moves. So in making a game where the North Star is an impulsive young man, he's sometimes maybe reckless, there's definitely more action, there's definitely more systems for dialogue, systems for how you interact with with the environment and the world,” Abrak says. “Agent 47 is not a talkative type, he is more like a chameleon, whereas Bond is commenting on things, and a lot of things you feel through the joypad controller is through him, so he's also talking to you, to the player. So to get to understand his humor, his hopes, his demeanor, those things were different. It took some time for us to hit the British humor, going from the Danish humor to the British humor, and getting that right.”


	The first trailer for the game includes other Bond hallmarks, like an Omega watch with a surprise baked inside from Q, and a vintage Aston Martin DBS that appears in a playable car chase.


	Still, the pressure is on. When 007 First Light arrives next year, it will need to appease both the franchise die-hards and gamers hungry for a AAA title worthy of their time. Given the history of James Bond in the video game community going back to Goldeneye on the Nintendo 64, the pressure is real.

	











	“It's both heartwarming and encouraging when we teased that IO Interactive is going to have a swing at 007, that the community and fans out there were super excited,” Abrak says. “There's a lot of trust and belief in that, and obviously you don't want to let them down. You want to make sure that trust, that belief, is delivered upon.


	“There's been so many different interpretations, there's been so many different Bonds, and they have been keeping the IP attractive and relevant for 60-plus years,” he adds. “They all came with different things to the table, they all were relevant to their time, geopolitical, cultural things that we've been through the years, so they all had impact … It's a lot of pressure making something that's not just going to be mushy or forgettable. It's something where you need to take some chances. It's something where you need to make a bet for actually creating emotions in people.”

Brandon Flynn has been cast as the iconic actor in writer-director Guy Guido's 'Willie and Jimmy Dean,' based on a memoir by William Bast.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	The planned biopic focusing on James Dean‘s personal life has landed its lead actor.


Brandon Flynn, known for True Detective and 13 Reasons Why, has been cast as the late legendary actor in the feature Willie and Jimmy Dean, The Hollywood Reporter has learned exclusively. Writer-director Guy Guido's film is currently in development and is based on William Bast's 2006 memoir, Surviving James Dean.




	In his book, Bast described meeting Dean at the UCLA theater program at the age of 19 and wrote that the two men became roommates, close friends and eventually lovers. Bast claimed they kept their fling private to avoid hurting Dean's career while the rising star had relationships with female stars, with Bast remaining hopeful that he and Dean would soon live together again. Five years after meeting Bast, Dean died in a car accident in 1955 at the age of 24, with two of his signature films, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant, released posthumously.

	Guido's script is set from the first meeting between Bill Bast and Dean to the actor's death on Sept. 30, 1955. (Bast died in 2015 at age 84.) The film will focus on Bast and Dean navigating their evolving relationship and Bast coming to terms with being gay during the 1950s.


	“This is not a traditional biopic,” says Guido, who spoke to Bast back in 2011. “It's a tender and sometimes tragic story about two young men who found each other in a time and place where being seen — truly seen — came at a cost. Brandon Flynn brings both the fire and vulnerability this role demands. I couldn't imagine anyone more perfect to explore and play out the complexities of James Dean.”

	











	Adds Flynn, “James Dean is like the known unknown. His short life left behind just three films, a mountain of photographs and a cultural mythology we keep trying to decode. This script is a beautiful attempt at truthfully understanding who he really was — not just the icon, but the man.”


	Flynn is known for roles on such series as Ratched and Manhunt and for features including The Parenting and Hellraiser.


	The actor praises the Willie and Jimmy Dean script for humanizing Dean, rather than taking a sensationalist approach. “It highlights how Hollywood has historically forced LGBTQ people into performance, even in their personal lives,” Flynn continues. “This story dares to present James Dean as a man with real, complex relationships, and I think there's power in that truth.”


	Guido, who previously directed the Hulu feature Madonna and the Breakfast Club, has been meeting with potential producers. Kerry Barden and Paul Schnee of Barden/Schnee Casting Agency are leading the casting process as the film continues to search for performers to play the sensitive and intelligent Bast and his glamorous single mother, Bernice.


	Flynn is represented by Paradigm, Untitled and Schreck Rose.

					By Jesse Whittock 

International TV Co-Editor


Sherlock fans, look away now. The British super-sleuth won't be taking on new cases any time soon.


	Speaking at the Italian Global Series Festival (IGSF), Sherlock creator Mark Gatiss was downbeat on the prospects of a return for the BBC show either for TV or as a film, saying: “Going back is often very difficult.” 


	Hopes for a new season or film had increased after Sue Vertue from the BBC's producer, Hartswood Films, last year told Deadline there was a “future” for it, provided stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman would agree to a return.

	However, when asked today why another season had not been produced, Gatiss replied: “Because Benedict and Martin didn't want to do any more.”

	The series starred Cumberbatch as titular master detective Sherlock Holmes and Freeman as his sidekick, Dr John Watson, and was based on the novels of Arthur Conan Doyle. Gatiss himself played Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother. Launching on the BBC in 2010 and running for three four-part seasons, it ended with a special in 2016.


	Gatiss revealed he had pitched Cumberbatch and Freeman a Sherlock film during lockdown, “which they both like the idea of, but it has not happened.” 


	Taking this as a sign, he added: “It's important to acknowledge when a time is a time. Sometimes, it is there and then it stops, and there's nothing wrong with that. Going back is often very difficult.”


	Gatiss has previously said he would like to make a Sherlock film, but noted “trying to get everyone together is very difficult.”


From detective to ‘Doctor'


	Having previously written episodes of Doctor Who, another British TV staple whose future is up in the air, Gatiss was also quizzed on the sci-fi show's future. 


	“I don't think anyone knows what is going on with Doctor Who at the moment,” he responded, saying that “all I know is it's all about the Disney deal.” He noted that he hasn't written an episode since 2017, quipping: “I'm two Doctors down and once you're two Doctors down, you don't come back.”

	











	Gatiss was speaking during a wide-ranging masterclass ahead of the world premiere of his new detective series, Bookish, at the IGSF today. The chat ranged from how he began reading murder mystery books in his childhood – “I had German measles, and I got a Sherlock Holmes as a cheering-up gift and I never looked back” – to why he dislikes the term ‘cosy crime', which has been applied to his new show.


Bookish is about gay antique book store owner Gabriel Book, who solves crimes while living in a ‘lavender' marriage with a woman, Trottie (Polly Walker). Set in the post-World War II era that has fascinated Gatiss for years, it sees Book solve mysteries in London with the help of a young Inspector Bliss (Elliot Levey). Despite keeping a light tone, the show also addresses the darker facets of Britain in 1946 such as attitudes to homosexuality and post-war lawlessness. 


	Gatiss is the writer, creator and star, with ITV Studios-owned Eagle Eye Drama producing alongside its subsidiary, Belgium-based Happy Duck Films, for UKTV in the UK and PBS in the U.S. Earlier today, we revealed the latest batch of pre-sales for the show, which is being shopped internationally by Germany's Beta Film.


	“I wanted to make it about the post-war world and how dangerous and exciting it was,” he said. He called the tone “murder as a parlor game” that would act as “a great escape for people from the new world,” but added Bookish still has an edge. 


	“It's the puzzle people like, not about having something drenched in blood,” added Gatiss. “People have moved away from those serial killer stories, because they're so unpleasant, to a more genteel world, but I don't like the term cosy crime as that suggests there is no teeth to it, and there definitely is teeth to it.”


	The IGSF is running this week through Saturday (June 28).

What is the difference between sound and noise? 

The brains of hearing people normally do a pretty good job distinguishing between the sounds we want to pay attention to and all of the less important environmental noises all around us — and when you're on a video call and there's a dog barking or a truck beeping as it backs up, Zoom arguably does an even better job filtering those out. But when director Shoshannah Stern got sound designer Bonnie Wild to try on her hearing aids, what was striking to Wild was that, even as everything she heard was boosted, it also became tangled together. 

 










Stern and Wild were working on a sequence in Stern's new documentary “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore,” which traces Matlin's career as an actor, advocate for captions and deaf accessibility, and the many ways in which the deaf community has been able to spread a slightly better understanding to the hearing world over the course of Matlin's public life. But before the film dove into the nuances past Matlin's early career highlights, Stern knew that it was important for hearing audiences to understand how Matlin experiences the world. 

 








Related Stories Michael Cera Turned Down a ‘Fantastic Beasts' Meeting: I Didn't Want to Be ‘Too Famous' Seth Rogen Auditioned for Controversial ‘Gigli' Role: ‘I Saw Myself at the Oscars' If I Got It, but the Tape Would ‘End My Career' Today 

So in a section of the film about Matlin's family and early life growing up in an otherwise hearing family, the documentary set up a family dinner with Matlin and her two brothers and their families. It's a simple verite scene — just five pizzas, a comfy brown couch, and a golden doodle wandering in and out of frame. But Stern and Wild adjusted the sound so that hearing audiences would experience it from as close to Matlin's point of view as our current suite of editing filters and tools can get them. 

“Noise and sound are two different things. Sound is the process where there's understanding of meaning, [while with] noise, there's no meaning embedded in that. So when I use hearing aids, and Marlee uses hearing aids as well, I hear most things, right? But if I were to compare if it's sound or noise, they become jumbled,” Stern told IndieWire. “People think that [hearing aids] fix the hearing loss, but it doesn't fix the way the brain receives that information. So the brain still can't quite process some of the sound that it's receiving.” 

Wild's sound design mimics this throughout the sequence — forcing hearing audiences to try to sort out everything between an auditory hum, the crinkle of a water bottle, little bits of words with mouth sounds, and everything making noise as it's touched, scraped across the floor, or shuffled around as people move through the kitchen. 

 










“There's just so much work of processing the context clues and all the energy that's embedded in that. It's exhausting,” Stern said. “Hearing families never intend to isolate or exclude the deaf child. The system has told them, ‘Put hearing aids on them and then they will be normal and they'll have access to everything [and], yeah, they're going to have access to noise but not to sound yet. You can't understand this process until you walk in their shoes to understand what that's really like.” 

Giving all audiences a visceral understanding of what it's like to miss cues and, completely unintentionally, become isolated within a larger group conversation is an important touchstone for where “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” goes in telling Matlin's story, not only how her early experiences shaped her but the things she's still striving to build in her life and career. 

To accomplish that, Wild did careful surgery on the audience the documentary team shot on the day, moving syllables of words around and forcing hearing audiences to try to piece words that don't actually sound like words together. “Bonnie was like, ‘Yeah, I think we can do that,'” Stern said. “And when I heard that dinner scene, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, whoa. That's exactly how I hear.'” 

 










Adding to the audio trickery, the documentary received a grant to work with Dolby Atmos and Wild used it for the exact opposite of the kind of precise spatial audio sculpting that has been getting so much creative use in films like “Nope” and “28 Days Later.” Wild moved all of the sounds around so that they would be impossible to localize. 

“Like, if I hear a siren coming while I'm driving, I don't know where the siren is coming from, I just know that it's happening,” Stern said. “And sometimes the hearing aids decide what is most important, so in the scene, that plastic crunching sound you hear — sometimes my hearing aid zooms in on that kind of sound and amplifies it, and the voices are kind of diminished because the hearing aid decided that's less important. So the hearing aid then becomes controlling [of] me versus me controlling it.”  

So Stern and Wild made a big mess of the sound, throwing it everywhere so it's impossible to get a sense of diction — even the captions get in on the fun, coming in all over the frame in a very legible, but unhelpful way. The film chooses deliberate auditory chaos for the audience (and Matlin) to sort through. “It was a really cool experience working with Bonnie,” Stern said. 

 










And it was an important piece of sound design to cement the larger point the documentary wants to pursue, about Marlee Matlin and how the hearing world processes the experiences of our deaf counterparts. “I don't think you can fully understand her story until you understand how she experiences the world,” Stern said. “The system has been telling people like us and people all around the world what's best for us and how we should experience the world. If it was true for her, then what do you think it's like for every other deaf person in the world who is not an Oscar-winning actress?” 

“Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” is now playing in theaters.

EXCLUSIVE: Relative newcomer Xavier Molyneux has landed the title role in Bloodaxe, Prime Video's new historical drama series from Vikings creator Michael Hirst and his son, Horatio Hirst, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Amazon MGM Studios couldn't be reached for comment. 


Officially ordered in March, Bloodaxe chronicles the rise of one of history's most famous Viking warriors, Erik Bloodaxe (Molyneux), and his formidable wife, Gunnhild, Mother of Kings. As they fight for the throne of Norway, the land is torn apart by fierce rivals, shifting loyalties and bloody betrayals. With war looming and chaos consuming the kingdom, drawing in the ruthless kings of other Scandinavian countries and even a powerful English ruler, the stage is set for a thundering new Viking saga.

	











Bloodaxe is created, written and exec produced by Michael and Horatio Hirst and produced by MGM Television. Other exec producers include Steve Stark of Toluca Pictures label who, as head of MGM Television, oversaw both of the 2013-20 Vikings TV series, along with fellow franchise alum Morgan O'Sullivan, Arturo Interian, John Weber and Sheila Hockin.

	While the show shares creative lineage with the 2013-20 History series Vikings and the 2022-25 Netflix follow-up Vikings: Valhalla — all three are based on historical figures and produced by MGM Television — Bloodaxe is not directly related to those efforts. The new Norse saga takes place decades after the original series and decades before Valhalla. Production begins in Ireland at the end of July.

	











	A rising Australian actor currently based in New Zealand, Molyneux just wrapped his run on the iconic Australian soap Neighbours and also recently starred in Netflix's romantic drama Take My Hand. He is repped by Benchmark Creative Management in Australia and The Rosenzweig Group.

Jon Erwin, the director of “I Can Only Imagine” and the creator of the hit Biblical series “House of David,” is launching a new subscription service that will be the exclusive home of Season 2 of “House of David.”

Erwin is launching the subscription streaming channel Wonder Project, which shares the name of his independent, faith-based studio, via Amazon Prime Video. At launch, the service will provide access to over 1,000 hours of curated movies and TV series that fit the brand of “courageous stories, inspiring hope and restoring faith in things worth believing in.” Erwin intends to release other originals through the service as well.

Erwin will also release “House of David” Season 2 exclusively through the subscription service, with it then launching on Prime Video in the U.S. and globally at a later date. The show, about the fight between David and Goliath, was one of the top new shows last year on Prime Video, reaching 40 million viewers worldwide and hitting #1 in the U.S. on the service. Giving early access to the show for subscribers is a compelling offer.

The subscription service launches in Fall 2025, and “House of David” Season 2 will be available at launch. The service will be available on top of a Prime membership for $8.99/month. 

“At Wonder Project, we seek to entertain our growing audience with courageous stories that restore faith in things worth believing in. Great films and TV shows bring families, friends and communities together and drive meaningful connection in a world that is craving connection right now,” said Kelly Merryman Hoogstraten, Chief Executive Officer of Wonder Project. “As a mother, I can't wait to have this shared viewing experience in my own home — through a brand we can truly call our own.”

“We are blown away by the success of ‘House of David' and can't wait for audiences to be swept away into the epic action and drama of Season 2,” added Erwin, Founder of Wonder Project. “Our audience is underserved and craves a destination they can trust with exceptional originals and curated movies and TV shows. With the new Wonder Project subscription on Prime Video, we will be delivering all of that and more.”

“We're thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of the Wonder Project subscription on Prime Video. This exciting addition to our service reflects our commitment to providing diverse, meaningful content that resonates with our customers,” said Ryan Pirozzi, Head of Prime Video Marketplace. “This launch represents another step in our ongoing efforts to ensure Prime Video offers something for everyone, and we look forward to seeing how this new offering enriches the viewing experience for our customers.”

 










Prime Video already offers plenty of channels you can subscribe to for an added-on price, including other major streamers and niche services. But Amazon has ramped up its faith-based offerings in recent months, including also becoming the streaming home for Dallas Jenkins' “The Chosen.”

“The one thing that I would say I agonized over a little bit was just, ‘Am I helping?'” the actor said. 


							By

Pedro Pascal is looking back at calling author J.K. Rowling a “heinous loser” for her anti-trans views.  


	In April, the actor responded to a social media post by activist Tariq Ra'ouf, who criticized Rowling for celebrating the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's landmark ruling that trans women should not be recognized as women and that “sex” should legally mean biological sex.




	Rowling had posted, “I love it when a plan comes together,” and added to the critic, “I get the same royalties whether you read [my books] or burn them. Enjoy your marshmallows!”

	In the comment section of Ra'ouf's post, Pascal wrote, “Awful disgusting SHIT is exactly right. Heinous LOSER behavior.”


	For his Vanity Fair cover story published Tuesday, Pascal said his comment growing into a larger story made him feel like “that kid that got sent to the principal's office a lot for behavioral issues in public schools in Texas feeling scared and thinking, ‘What'd I do?'”


	“The one thing that I would say I agonized over a little bit was just, ‘Am I helping? Am I fucking helping?'” he added. “It's a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen, and people will actually be protected. Listen, I want to protect the people I love. But it goes beyond that. Bullies make me fucking sick.”


	Pascal's sister, Lux Pascal, came out as a trans woman in 2021. Pascal's sister Javiera defended her brother's comment about Rowling, telling Vanity Fair, “But it is heinous loser behavior. And he said that as the older brother to someone saying that our little sister doesn't exist.”

	











	At the time, Rowling defenders tried to argue that Pascal was “presumptuous with women” by referring to a viral clip of Pascal taking Vanessa Kirby's hand at last year's Fantastic Four panel at Comic-Con. 


	“What happened is we were both incredibly nervous going out in front of thousands of people who love this comic,” Kirby told Vanity Fair. “He wanted me to know that we were in this together, and I found it a lovely gesture and was very glad to squeeze his hand back.”


	Speaking further of bullies and Fantastic Four, Pascal says he's “getting an inkling of excitement” for The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which he stars in as Mister Fantastic. However he notes, “I'm more aware of disgruntlement around my casting than anything I've ever done. ‘He's too old. He's not right. He needs to shave.'” 


	He credited Robert Downey Jr. for being a support system: “He's just so immediately generous and inviting that you feel like you can be afraid, you can be hungry, you can be ambivalent.” 


	Meanwhile, Downey noted of Pascal to the publication that “Pascal's slow trajectory to becoming a household name who is on a wildly hot streak kind of reaffirms my faith in our industry.”

Martin Kove, the actor best known for playing the Karate Kid and Cobra Kai antagonist John Kreese, was made to leave a fan convention over the weekend after allegedly biting his co-star Alicia Hannah-Kim, according to People. Hannah-Kim filed an incident report with the police saying that when she met up with the Cobra Kai cast at Summer Con in Washington, she tapped Kove on the shoulder to greet him. Kove “suddenly grabbed her arm and bit her upper arm so hard it nearly drew blood, and she yelled out in pain,” per the report. “Once Martin Kove finished biting her arm, he grabbed her arm again and began kissing it where he had bit her.”

Hannah-Kim reportedly told her husband, actor Sebastian Roché, and the couple approached Kove to confront him about the incident. Kove “exploded on them, saying something to the effect of how dare they confront him” (per Variety), at which point Hannah-Kim got an on-site law enforcement officer involved. The officer noted in the report that Hannah-Kim “had a very noticeable bite mark on her arm that was already turning blue and bruising.” Kove allegedly “admitted to biting” his co-star but “said he did it out of jest.”

Hannah-Kim played another antagonist on Cobra Kai, Kim Da-Eun, who teams up with Kreese in the sixth season. Kove apparently told the officer at Summer Con he “thought he was being funny, and they play fight all the time on the set of Cobra Kai, and he did not think it was a big deal.” Hannah-Kim reportedly expressed to Kove that she was upset and physically hurt by his actions, which both she and the officer informed him were illegal; Kove allegedly “said that he did not mean for it to be perceived as illegal” and reiterated that “he was just messing around.”

Hannah-Kim declined to press charges, but requested the official report to have on the record. Kove and his son also declined to write a voluntary handwritten statement, and were then “escorted out of Summer Con” at the discretion of the Cobra Kai producer that was at the venue, per People. Neither actor has made any further public comment on the incident.

Paramore drummer Zac Farro has announced his debut solo album under his own name: Operator is out July 18 via Congrats. Leading the album is the new song “My My,” which goes down a country-folk route that differs from the pop-rock tint of both his side-project Halfnoise and Paramore. Give it a listen below.

“‘My My' is a personal song about witnessing a loved one try to let go of someone they care for deeply,” explained Farro. “That kind of silent pain. This song holds a lot of weight and captures those moments of reflection and processing that run throughout the album.”

After years of recording music under the moniker Halfnoise, Farro decided to record a new album under his own name after exploring “deeply personal” subjects in a new batch of songs, such as family issues, anxieties, and communication breakdowns. Operator spans nine songs, all of which were written by Farro. Joining him on the record are friends and Nashville musicians Josh Gilligan and Chancey Pierce.

Farro started the band Halfnoise mere days after he originally departed Paramore in 2010. His band has gone on to release five albums since then, the most recent of which, City Talk, came out in 2023. Although Farro eventually rejoined Paramore as a permanent member, in 2016, Halfnoise is still active to this day. As for Paramore, their sixth album, This Is Why, came out in 2023.

Last month, Thom Yorke finally released a studio version of his new song “Dialing In,” which he's been playing live for over five years, as part of the soundtrack for the upcoming Apple TV+ series Smoke. To bring the track to life with its own visuals, the Radiohead frontman has now tapped Weirdcore—his frequent collaborator with the Smile—to whip up a surreal music video with Smoke star Taron Egerton, in which scenes from the show melt together like burning celluloid. Check it out below.

The earliest live performance of “Dialing In” by Yorke dates back to 2019, although it used to go by the name “Gawpers” back then. According to a press release for Smoke, the previously unreleased track has since been “fine-tuned to underscore the show's themes even further.”

Smoke follows a detective (played by Jurnee Smollett) and an arson investigator (played by Taron Egerton) who are trying to catch a pair of serial arsonists wreaking fiery havoc across the Pacific Northwest. The Apple TV+ series premieres this Friday, June 27.

Yorke recently released Tall Tales, his new collaborative album with electronic producer Mark Pritchard. As for Yorke's work in the Smile, the band released two albums last year: Wall of Eyes and Cutouts.

	Last I saw Willie Nelson, on the Outlaw Music Festival tour, he gave well-earned solo space to son Lukas Nelson, who just released his first solo album. It's high time. Dude's a lifelong utility player — rock solid on guitar and vocals with the family band, while Willie circles the beat, and a team player with frequent Neil Young backing crew Promise of the Real. He's become a go-to duet partner, notably with fellow next-gen icon Sierra Ferrell. Ferrell's cameo on ­Nelson's new American Romance is “Friend in the End,” a song about a bond that can see us through darkness, until “the clouds blew south/And the rain thinned out/And the sky was all sunlight again.” It's a timely metaphor, and a good example of country's ability to mirror how ­America sees itself, accurately or wishfully.  


	Nelson has said the album title refers to his romance with the nation. The album's deepest song, “The Lie,” is a laundry list of cultural hogwash. “Come here, kid/Here's a story for you/You're defined by what you do/ No one ever made it stayin' home with the kids/And if you ain't winnin'/You ain't worth shit,” describing an American mindset that can turn a “simple soul” into a “spinning black hole.” But American Romance also celebrates national beauty, pride, and wonder. 

	











Hailey Whitters broadcast her storytelling skill on The Dream in 2020, and her knack for rebooting country clichés got sharpened on 2022's Raised. With Corn Queen, she supersizes it all into what should prove the most giddily virtuosic country album of the year. Stuart Duncan, Charlie Worsham, Justin Moses, and clawhammer guitar hero Molly Tuttle bring instrumental flash, and it serves songs that are poignant and hilarious by turns. When Tuttle and Whitters lean into the chorus of “Prodigal Daughter” — “Holy smoke and holy water/From doe-eyed girl to prodigal daughter/Did a devil's dance to a fiddle in a holler/This angel's hell on the heavenly Father” — it's as fun as an old-time fall-from-grace gets. Corn Queen shows how modern country can celebrate tradition without being a macho flex or a cultural bulwark. It can just be a playground: for camp cosplay, strutting your stuff, and partying with friends.

	Which doesn't mean Whitters can't go deep. She's a versatile writer, assisted here by Hillary Lindsey and Shane McAnally, among others. “Casseroles” is a weeper about a widower that interrogates how we care for grieving friends. “I Don't Want You,” with Charles Wesley Godwin, joins a mini trend in thoughtfully dysfunctional duets. But Whitters is most winning when the lyrical liquor flows — see “Loose Strings” and “Fillin' My Cup” — and “Shotgun Wedding Baby” is the mic drop here. Any family history that begins “Eighteen don't know shit from Shinola/Well thank God my daddy had Crown in his cola” has our unshakable respect.

Anderson East is another ­master craftsman, one whose concept of country leans into the old-school Southern R&B sounds Chris Stapleton reanimated in the genre's mainstream. With Dave Cobb co­producing, East really goes in on Worthy, paying matter-of-fact homage to Otis Redding against dukes-up Stax/Volt horn arrangements, or conjuring Roy Orbison (“Say I Love You”) in ­orchestral pop settings that might've pleased George Martin. The writing shines, with assists from Lori Mc­Kenna (“Chasing”) and Trent Dabbs, wingman on East's 2021 profound pandemic journey, Maybe We Never Die (he also co-wrote “High Horse” with Kacey Musgraves). In the vein of Jim Ford and Tony Joe White, East's voice is fully formed here, twining country rootstock with soul and gospel so tightly that the ­traditions feel inseparable, and ­rightly so.


	The head turner on Kelsey Waldon's haunting new album is “Falling Down,” a first-person character study of hard drinking that's a shade darker than Whitters' approach. “My wife is gone, and my kids are grown/And I don't talk to them no more,” Waldon sings with a plainspoken, gut-punching lilt. But Every Ghost is a survivor's journey, from the doom-scroll sorrow of “Nursery Rhyme” to “Lost in My Idlin',” a Hank Williams update with a tattoo-ready “wishin' I was fucked up in some honky-tonk” chorus. The set comes via John Prine's Oh Boy Records, and Waldon proves herself worthy of his truth-talking legacy. And for the rec­ord: Your American-flag decal still won't get you into heaven.

	After bombing three of Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend, President Donald Trump is now demanding that everyone just simmer down. It's hard to keep the peace when missiles are flying across borders, and Trump is learning firsthand that it takes more than simply posting online that a ceasefire is in effect to end military aggression. 


	Early Tuesday morning, Iran reportedly fired a barrage of missiles that struck an apartment complex in southern Israel, killing at least four people. The Iranian military later denied firing the munitions in violation of the ceasefire. Israel responded by striking a radar base north of Tehran. 


	Speaking to reporters outside of the White House, Trump said he was “not happy” with Israel and Iran.

	“We basically have two countries that are fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” he ranted. “[Iran] violated, but Israel violated it too. Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs — the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen — I'm not happy with Israel.”

	Last week, Israel launched a wave of surprise attacks targeting Iranian military officials and members of its nuclear program. Trump then entangled the United States in the conflict,  bombing major nuclear facilities in Iran on Saturday. Iran responded with a wave of intentionally ineffective missile launches against U.S. military targets in the region. 

	











	“CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT'S TIME FOR PEACE!” Trump wrote shortly after on Monday, adding that it “has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE […] for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!”


	Case closed, skirmish over, regional destabilization and global conflict averted … or so one would hope. 


	“THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!” Trump wrote Tuesday at one in the morning as reports circulated of escalating tensions between the two nations. Shortly after, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that the military would resume its offensive against Iran, and a wave of drone attacks was deployed against Iranian military bases — and planned for more.

	“ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!” he wrote on Truth Social at around six in the morning. About an hour and a half later, Trump wrote that “ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly ‘Plane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect! Thank you for your attention to this matter!” 


	According to Axios, the president had a decidedly terse conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, in which the Israeli leader said he was unable to cancel the ordered strikes against Iran, but agreed to scale them back. Trump spoke to Netanyahu in “an exceptionally firm and direct way,” a White House source told Axios. 


	“The president told Netanyahu what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire. The Prime Minister understood the severity of the situation and the concerns President Trump expressed,” the source added. 


	Throughout the Israel-Hamas war, the Netanyahu government has repeatedly been accused of violating ceasefire agreements and tanking peace negotiations. In May, Israel broke a ceasefire agreement with Hamas by launching a wave of surprise airstrikes and blockading the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza amid talks to extend a previously negotiated pause in hostilities. Over the course of the war, the United States, Israel's chief military and political ally, has refused to meaningfully press the nation to commit to a ceasefire, or penalize it for violating human rights law over the course of the war.

	Even as Trump attempts to coordinate a workable ceasefire between Israel and Iran, on Tuesday morning Israeli military forces reportedly opened fire on crowds of Palestinians — who remain in near-starvation conditions — waiting for humanitarian aid in central Gaza, killing at least 25 people. The massacre is the latest instance in a string of incidents that humanitarian groups say have resulted in hundreds of Palestinians being killed while awaiting scarce food and provisions under the control of the Israeli military.

The actor has conquered Broadway and blockbuster films, but now he's taking on a new challenge as the Hood/Parker Robbins in the new Marvel series 'Ironheart.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Anthony Ramos is officially entering his villainous era with his role in Marvel's new series, Ironheart.


	Having fallen in love with musical theater in high school, it wasn't until he got a scholarship to attend the American Musical and Dramatic Academy that he decided to take acting “to another level” and get “serious” about it as a career. “Once I got into school, it's cliché, but I was like a kid in a candy store,” the 33-year-old actor tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I was learning new things. I never did ballet before. I had never done a musical theater history class. I had never taken an acting class. It was my first voice lesson.”

	In just a few years after he graduated, Ramos made his Broadway debut as John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in the Tony-winning musical Hamilton. That same year, he landed his first onscreen role in two episodes of Younger.


	Now, a decade later, Ramos has made a name for himself in Hollywood thanks to his starring roles in Twisters, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and A Star Is Born and the film adaptations of Hamilton and In the Heights, just to name a few. However, there's one thing he had yet to accomplish prior to this year: a “real villain” role. But now he can say he conquered that with his role as the Hood/Parker Robbins in Ironheart, opposite Dominique Thorne.


	Below, Ramos opens up about his preparation to play the Hood, his experience doing voice work for the animated films The Bad Guys 2 and Bob the Builder, whether he wants to return to Broadway in the future, working with Ryan Murphy and Kathryn Bigelow on upcoming projects and his perfect day off work.

	











What was your initial reaction when you learned you were going to be joining the Marvel universe?


	The coolest part was being on a Zoom with Ryan Coogler, Chinaka Hodge, Kevin Feige, Zoie [Nagelhout]. Just being on the Zoom with them and talking to me about the project and teaching me the project and telling me, hey, there's this character called the Hood, this is what he does, this is kind of like what we're thinking for him. It was a surreal moment honestly. I was like, “Yo, am I really on a call with like Ryan Coogler, one of the greatest directors of all time, like Kevin Feige, he is Marvel, Chinaka is an incredible writer, Zoie is a great producer. Just on this call with some beast in the game. And they were showing me sketches of him from the comics, and they were like, “Obviously Parker Robins is in the comics and it's set in New York, but this was set in Chicago. And you're Puerto Rican, so that's different from the guy in the comics, which is fine, we don't care. He's still got the same powers, the hood is the hood, and we just want to explore what it will look like creating this character with you.” So I was just so excited! 


How did you prepare mentally and physically to take on the villainous role of the Hood/Parker Robbins?


	It is the first real villain [I've played], because we shot this in 2022. I had played kind of a bad guy in this movie called Honest Thief that I did with Liam Neeson and Jack Courtney back in 2018, but I never played like a Parker. Also just being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and knowing these are his powers: He levitates, he shoots magic bullets, he goes invisible. He does these things and just exploring what we can do with fight choreography, like how we could expand on his character. Again, moving the character from New York to Chicago, there's a massive Puerto Rican community, like making him from Humboldt Park. Just small things like that and really paying attention to what's already there and then seeing where there was a little bit of room to expand ‘cause it is a TV series and we do have a length of episodes to tell the story. 

	











Is there a specific scene as an actor you're most proud of and excited for viewers to see?


	There's one scene that comes to mind and Parker has his own layer, he has his own place where he works, and he's got this scene on his own with the kind of powers that be that gave him the hood, and he's feeling a bit confused and having this back and forth with this invisible person or whoever that gave him the hood that's not there, but he can feel it there. And he's confused by something that's just happened and he thought he had more control than he actually did, and it was a really cool scene to do. Pretty emotional and it was powerful. It was dope. 


Do you hope to do more with this character and even just Marvel overall in the future?


	I would love to expand with his character, knowing that Robert Downey Jr's coming back as Doctor Doom, and we know in the comics that those characters kind of overlap and stuff like that, so seeing if there's any possibility for any overlap with Doctor Doom would be really cool. Everything is real in the Marvel Universe, you never know what what they plan to do and how they plan to do it, but I'd love another shot to just expand on Parker a little bit. 


You also returned to voice Mr. Piranha in The Bad Guys 2, coming out later this year. Can you talk about your experience doing voice work for an animated movie?


	Animation is one of my favorite things to do in this world of acting and shit. It's just so much fun, because you go in there and you see some sketches of what they're thinking about the character looking like or they'll show you the sketch of a scene that's already written out, and they'll show you like a picture of them running out of the bank and then here's a picture of them jumping off of that building and then here's a picture of them hopping in the car and then here's where Mr. Piranha laughs. So you're only seeing pictures and photos, but you don't really know what it's going to come out like until after you put your voice down. And it's me and the director, and sometimes you get to do it with other actors if everybody's available to be there at the same time and you can feed off of each other. We had about one or two sessions for the second movie and you get to be in the room with everybody and everybody's just vibing, everybody's going back and forth and just riffing and shit that's not even on the script we're just coming up with. … Sometimes it's so hilarious, like I can't even believe where that just went, that just went so left, and then it makes it in the movie. … There's just these endless possibilities with animation, you can really just do anything you want. 

	











You're also voicing the iconic character Bob the Builder in the upcoming animated feature. How excited are you for that project?


	I was super honored and excited that they asked me to do it. I think that with Bob, it's been so many years where we haven't seen a newer version of this guy. I don't think there's ever been a movie about the village, so like I'm like, for the kids growing up, how can we create something that pays homage to the original, but do something that feels fresh where kids who are watching it feel like I'm watching something for the first time. And even want adults who are familiar with it to feel like, wow, this totally feels new, even though Bob the Builder, that IP, has been around for so many years. 


Having had so much success with Broadway as well as screen acting, do you have a preference and would you like to return to the stage in the future?


	I hope to return to the stage. I've been seeing quite a few shows lately, which has been really inspiring, you know, I feel like I always get this jolt of inspiration when I go to Broadway or just go see theater in general, like watching actors get on stage and give it their all for an hour and a half to three hours or however long the show is. There's nothing like it! Having done it and knowing what that feels like and then being able to just enjoy it and appreciate it as an audience member and appreciate it in a different way. And it motivates me to get back on stage, you know, I think there's no harder thing to do as far as in the entertainment business. I mean, I've never done stand-up comedy. I feel like maybe stand-up [would] be No. 1 on that list (Laughs), but a close second gotta be Broadway. Putting a Broadway show together and then doing it every night, eight shows a week, I've not done anything as tough as that still in my career. Ten years since I've been in Hamilton, and still I would say that and maybe one movie I shot in the middle of COVID because of the circumstances and having worn like a 30-pound spacesuit, and the movie never came out (Laughs). 

	











You also have several more projects in the works, including Ryan Murphy's The Beauty, and Kathryn Bigelow's currently untitled project. What has it been like working with these creative masterminds? 


	It was really a blessing to work with Kathryn, and she's one of the greatest directors of all time. She said something super awesome to me that I'll never forget. We finished a take and we were shooting in Iceland. I had just gotten off of an overnight flight, and they're like, “OK, we got to wait to see if you're gonna drive to the other side of the island or if you're gonna fly because we have to see if the weather conditions are good enough for you to fly.” And if you do fly, you're gonna go straight to set. If we drive, then you gotta shoot the next day. So I was like, “Oh shit!” I wasn't even expecting to go straight to set. I thought I'd shoot the next day, but nonetheless, the weather was good enough. We hop on this little nine-seater plane, go to the other side of Iceland, get off the plane, go straight to set, I change and then boom, we shoot this intense-ass scene. And I was so tired and I was so delirious, but I think the fatigue and delirium helped me in a way. My brother sometimes tells me, “Bro, sometimes when you're the most tired, you give me your best takes.” But Kathryn calls cut, and she's like, “That was one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my career.” I was like, “What?” I thought she was playing. She was like, ‘That was phenomenal. We got it!” I'll just never forget that look on her face. I didn't even watch playback or anything, but it was just really cool to get props from her like that. 

	











	Ryan's amazing! We just did the upfronts, and Ryan Murphy's mind is so incredible and his imagination just runs like far and wide. I text Ryan after the upfronts — they put together a trailer for the show, and we're still shooting it right now, so when you're in it, you have moments where you're like, “Yo, I feel like what we're doing is super dope but you don't really know, right?” — and I was like, “Ryan, I just wanna let you know I'm grateful for this role because truly this is some of the most fun I've ever had doing anything in my whole career and my life.” And he was like, “I really love you in this part, and I feel good about this show.” It's just cool to know he feels that way. He's so involved and it's just nice to be actually working with Ryan. 


If you have a free day off work, what's your perfect day off look like?


	You know what I like to do, honestly, I'll be traveling a lot. When I get days off, especially if I get a string of days, I'll be out. I live in Miami, you know, I'm shooting in New York, but any chance I get, I go back down there. If my friends are like, “Yo, let's go to whatever,” I'm like, “Alright, we out.” But also on days off, my family is opening a business in New York, a bar in Brooklyn, and so I help them with that. So it's cool to do something that's not acting sometimes too. Lately, we try to read these scripts for either a job that could happen or something that probably isn't realistic, but something that looks interesting. I'm writing a musical right now, too, any free days I get off, I try to work on that. 

	











It's been a decade since your first onscreen role in Younger, and you've accomplished so much since then. What have you learned about yourself during this time?


	There's never been a time that I didn't have a good time, but I especially make it a point to have a good time on set, because we get to play make believe, like this shit is all made up. And we have to put on these costumes and say these lines and do all this shit, and you get paid for it. And genuinely, I feel like going to work life stops when I'm there. Obviously it's still going, but it just feels like we're in another world now. I think when I first started, I was really scared too. I didn't go to film school. … But being inexperienced and just going for it, there are some parts that I miss about that too. I feel like I was super fearless back then, but I think that I'm kind of trying to bring some of that back now. … Just remember, just because you can say I've been here, you haven't been here. Like it's a new job, it's a new part, it's all new. It doesn't matter how long you've been doing it, every job is different, every day is different, every character is different. So it's like you gotta open yourself up to whatever is going on that day. But the one thing I think I have kept from when I started is that kind of openness. 


If you had to describe what makes Anthony Ramos, Anthony Ramos, what would you say?


	There's nobody on this planet that's like me. There's no one that talks like me, there's no one that walks like me. You can find similarities in different people, but at the end of the day, I'm me. What makes me me too is that because of God and my family, I was taught that whatever you do, you give it your whole heart. Approach it with grace, approach it with gratitude, you know, with humility in your heart, and just do your best to be your best. That's what makes me me, you know, I'm Anthony from Bushwick, from the projects, from 230 Grove Street, and there's only one me.

Robert Downey Jr. is singing Pedro Pascal‘s praises. Both actors are appearing in the next Phase of the MCU, with Pascal leading “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” as Reed Richards AKA Mr. Fantastic and Downey as Victor Von Doom AKA Doctor Doom for “Avengers: Doomsday.” Will they first square off in “First Steps”? Unclear. However, that didn't stop Downey from pointing to how Pascal is an inspiration for Hollywood as a whole.

“Pascal's slow trajectory to becoming a household name who is on a wildly hot streak kind of reaffirms my faith in our industry,” Downey told Vanity Fair. And it's true: Pascal really is everywhere. In addition to starring in “The Fantastic Four,” the actor appears in “The Last of Us,” “Materialists,” “Eddington,” and “The Mandalorian.”

And Pascal is also a newfound staple at Downey's own home, too. Pascal teased to VF that he (and presumably, his fellow “Fantastic Four” co-stars Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn) has been part of the “‘Avengers' cast ‘homework' day,” hosted by Downey, as VF reported.

Pascal said, “I don't know, I don't know,” when asked if he too was an Avenger, but it's evident that Downey at least is circling the wagons for the franchise given his return to the MCU. Downey was announced in 2024 as Doctor Doom after playing Iron Man for more than a decade. 

Pascal told VF that he was nervous about joining the acclaimed MCU franchise alongside so many icons…and fan opinions. Yet Downey eased the way for Pascal. 

“I'm more aware of disgruntlement around my casting than anything I've ever done. ‘He's too old. He's not right. He needs to shave,'” Pascal said, adding that Downey made him feel comfortable about his “Fantastic Four” role. “He's just so immediately generous and inviting that you feel like you can be afraid, you can be hungry, you can be ambivalent.” 

And Downey isn't the only MCU member who adores Pascal: “The Fantastic Four” star Vanessa Kirby, who plays Pascal's onscreen wife, said that Pascal has an “immense vulnerability” as an actor. “He doesn't have much armor, so he shows himself to you straight away,” she said of his inspirational acting techniques, “and you trust that person because he's revealing himself to you in this very brave way.” 

Director Spike Jonze (who is unaffiliated with Marvel….as of now), helmed an Apple ad with Pascal and summarized the actor's appeal: “I think that he's what we want in masculinity.” And given Pascal's meteoric rise to fame, that proves to be a fact.

Diego Luna let the president know exactly how he felt about his draconian immigration policy when he took over as a guest host on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Monday night. “Tonight, I want to address an important issue that is happening here in Los Angeles and all around the United States,” the Andor actor said in his opening monologue. “With everything going on in this country around immigration and authoritarian policies of Donald Trump, it is no small thing that a Mexican is hosting such an important show. It's a big deal and I really hope not to fuck it up.”

The actor then took some time to reflect on his own experience in Los Angeles, sharing that he first “stepped foot in the territory known as the United States” at 20 years old following the success of Y Tu Mamá También. He now even has an Angeleno son, he shared. But, he continued, “the people that lifted me up were mostly people that had left their countries to find a new life, or the sons and daughters of immigrants that had come here in order to work and build a healthy, enjoyable and dignified life, away from their place of origin.”

“A movement of that scale, that's not natural, not unless something is very, very wrong in the place you are coming from,” Luna continued. “Nobody leaves their land if it's not because their survival depends on it. Nobody leaves their past behind, just for fun. But you know what? All the people that I met shared an unspoken gratitude to this country, a country that opened its doors to them.”

Los Angeles, he continued, is “a powerful example of what's possible, of what can be achieved when we put empathy first.” The city has also become a lightning rod in the fight over Trump's immigration policy, as the president moved to deploy the National Guard to step in as ICE clashed with protesters earlier this month. California Governor Gavin Newsom is now sparring with Trump over this decision in court.

Luna then took a moment to laud the fact that “the multiple times that this country has had to rebuild itself, immigrants were always there to pick up the slack.” He specifically reminded audiences of the L.A. wildfires earlier this year, which saw “immigrant workers risk their lives to stop the flames.” He continued, “They are the ones who build this country, they feed it, they nurture and teach its children, they care for the elderly, they work in construction, hospitality, they run kitchens. They're technicians, merchants, athletes, drivers, farmers.”

“There are a lot of lies flying around about immigrants, but I'm sure you have more than one story that can attest to the contrary. Talk about it, share it. That helps. Today, they need to know that they're not alone,” he said. “These have been a dark few weeks. It is not acceptable nor is it normal to separate families. Violence and terror are not OK. Immigrants need to know that their struggle is yours as well.”

Giving everyone a masterclass in grace, Simone Ashley proudly stepped out to celebrate “F1: The Movie” on Monday (June 23). Simone attended the European premiere in London despite her role being cut from the final version of the film. 

The 30-year-old actress walked the red carpet solo at Cineworld Leicester Square, stunning in a gold Balmain gown. Simone's move depicts a graceful show of support for the project and her castmates.

Ashley had previously filmed scenes for F1, but does not have any speaking lines in the finished movie. 

Director Joseph Kosinski recently explained the change, telling People: “It happens on every film, where you have to shoot more than you can use. There were two or three storylines that ultimately didn't make it into the final cut. But Simone, she's an incredible talent, incredible actress, incredible singer, and I would love to work with her again.”

Ashley had been seen on set and was also photographed at a Miami promotional event for F1, appearing with co-star Kerry Condon and producer Jerry Bruckheimer.

The “Bridgerton” star doesn't believe in holding grudges. Speaking to ELLE earlier this month, Ashley said: “I have a very small part, but I'm grateful to be in that movie… I got to experience many Grand Prix. I don't think I'll ever do anything like that again.”

Director Kosinski, 51, also told Entertainment Tonight that he informed Ashley that her scenes would not appear in the final cut, and praised her professionalism and talent.

Ashley previously told Who What Wear that her role in F1 had been in the works long before her breakout on “Bridgerton”. 

She said, “I met for this movie, I think, before Bridgerton even came out. It's been a long time, and you know, it's Damson and Brad's movie. I'm just so grateful that I can be part of it.”

Though her scenes didn't make it to the screen, Simone Ashley's grace and support at the London premiere spoke volumes. She proved why she remains one of the industry's most beloved rising stars. 

Brad Pitt leads “F1: The Movie” as a retired Formula One driver making a comeback with a fictional team. 

The film, written by Ehren Kruger and produced in collaboration with real F1 stars including Lewis Hamilton, also features Damson Idris, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, Javier Bardem, Shea Whigham, and more.

“F1: The Movie” opens in theaters nationwide on June 27.

HGTV “Home Town” star Ben Napier is a loving father to two girls, but he admits he experienced one scary part of parenthood early on. Find out why Napier called it the “absolute scariest thing.”

A post shared by Ben Napier | Scotsman Co. (@scotsman.co)

In a June 2025 interview with Country Living, Napier shared some words of wisdom from his experience as a dad.

“I have two warnings and one piece of advice for first-time parents, things that were never told to me,” he explained, including what he calls the “scariest thing.”

“My first warning is — and I may sound like an idiot for saying it — the first night home from the hospital is the absolute scariest thing you will go through,” Napier said. “We had been in the hospital for two or three days, the baby had spent both nights in the nursery at the hospital — and it was great.”

He continued, “Then we came home that first night, and she cried all night. I was trying to let Erin sleep, sitting on the couch holding Helen, and as long as I kept moving, she wouldn't cry.”

Napier also admitted he didn't know too much about women's hormones. “Your wife has nine months of the craziest hormonal swings ever while she's pregnant — but then in my mind, it was like, ‘Alright, baby's here, hormone changes are over!' And that's not how it works.”

He shared, “I was unprepared for the next three to six months of hormonal changes that were going on. So if you're a boy who grew up in a house full of boys, just know: That's coming.”

As for his advice, Napier offered some solid tips about giving yourself grace when you have a baby.

“Then the advice is to just be gentle with each other,” he said. “Everyone — including the baby — is going to be out of whack.”

The HGTV star continued, “Be gentle with everyone. Yourself too. You're tired, and they're tired, and maybe you're hungry, and you're scared.”

Napier added, “But it's going to be okay. Everything is going to be all right.”

He also advised not to “read into what the world is telling you about, Oh, this is how you should raise your baby.” Napier explained, “Every baby is different and every family is different, and what works for yours may not work for theirs.”

Three Gen Zers leave their phones behind to find themselves — in Norway, as rookie dogsledders — in Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady‘s delightful documentary “Folktales.” The latest nonfiction film from the Oscar-nominated “Jesus Camp” directing duo premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, where Magnolia Pictures scooped it up for a domestic release. “Folktales” opens in New York on July 25 from Magnolia Pictures, with dates in Los Angeles and more cities to follow starting August 1, and IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer premiere below.

 










“Folktales” centers on teenagers converging at a Norwegian folk school in the gap year between high school and college, and with sled dogs in tow to help them on their existential coming-of-age. The documentary filmmaking team behind “Boys of Baraka” this time embedded themselves in the Arctic wilderness, to chronicle the charismatic and angsty Hege, Romain, and Bjørn Tore. It's another likely Oscar contender, a crowd-pleasing doc that will play well into the fall awards season.

Per Magnolia's description, “In Norse mythology, the three ‘Norns' are powerful deities who weave the threads of fate and shape humans' futures. Today, Pasvik Folk High School in northern Norway aims to produce a similar life-changing effect on its students. ‘Folktales' tells the timely and heartwarming story of teenagers who choose to spend an unconventional ‘gap year' learning to dog sled and survive the Arctic wilderness, in hopes of finding connection and meaning in the modern world. Guided by patient teachers and a yard full of heroic Alaskan huskies, they discover their own potential and develop deep relationships with the land, animals and humans around them. Through intimate verité storytelling and exhilarating cinematography, Ewing and Grady examine humans on the cusp of adulthood, finding themselves at the edge of the world.”

“We filmed six or seven people before school started, hedging our bets, just meeting people and going to their homes,” Ewing told IndieWire back at Sundance. “These three individuals all had something they were seeking, a specific reason they were going to the folk high school. They had road to travel. They were looking to change. We thought [these three] had the highest chance they might be different at the end than they were at the beginning.”

 










As for the 400 folk schools throughout Scandinavia that the filmmakers had to narrow down, “It's an August tradition in Scandinavia. It's a rite of passage,” Ewing. “Not all of them focus on the natural world or survivalist. You can study circus arts or Viking life. We were interested in the ones that focused on survival and bushcraft and dog-sledding. We visited five schools [in Norway] and talked to at least 12. The last one we visited was Pasvik. It's so hard to get to. It's so inconvenient. It's so cold. We were like, ‘I hope this isn't the one.' And of course, we met the dog-sledding teachers, and the place had this stark, brutal magic, and it was obvious that there was a movie to be made there.”

As IndieWire's Kate Erbland wrote in her review, “That Hege, Bjørn Tore, and Romain will learn some big life lessons from Pasvik in general and those pups in particular is expected, but it's not a given. Instead, we are treated to all the joys and pains of 10 transformative months, with Ewing and Grady taking us inside an experience that's both specific and oddly universal. Not everything turns out the way we expect, not every story has a tidy ending, but no one ever said becoming a new self was easy or expected. Folk high school? It helps. And, yes, I'd still like to go.”

							By 

	Christopher Cruz



	It takes a specific kind of marketing mind to imagine that a dark and gritty reboot of a beloved children's character can amount to anything good. While the Golden Age of Comic Books ultimately gave way to edgier storytelling in the Seventies and Eighties, and everything from Steamboat Willie to Winnie the Pooh now has a blood-soaked live-action iteration (thanks, public domain!), the basic concept rarely offers more than shock value. What if this candy-colored icon of happier days was a killer?


	The idea's seen its day in gaming, too. Bomberman: Act Zero (2006) is one of the greatest cautionary tales about how slapping a more mature coat of paint on a classic character can end up tarnishing an entire franchise. But somewhere inside Japanese development studio Bandai Namco, the notion of making Pac-Man into an eldritch horror in time to celebrate the series' 45th anniversary gained traction. The result is the upcoming side-scrolling adventure game Shadow Labyrinth (out July 18).

	











	And honestly? Maybe the idea wasn't so stupid after all.


Rolling Stone recently played about three hours of the all-new take on Pac-Man, and what we found was a surprisingly engrossing Metroidvania-style game that's inherently ridiculous but works better than it has any right to.


	Developed internally by Bandai Namco Studios, Shadow Labyrinth is a 2D side-scrolling action and exploration game that doesn't actually star Pac-Man — at least, not as fans know him. Set in the year 3333 on a desolate alien world, players take on the role of the Swordsman, a somewhat blank slate character with minimalist features clad in a tattered cloak.

	











	The Swordsman's background is intended to be a mystery unraveled within the game's story, but the groundwork for Shadow Labyrinth's lore was previously laid in last year's Prime Video anthology series, Secret Level, which set episodes in different game-inspired worlds. In the episode titled “PAC-MAN: Circle,” audiences got their first look at the world of the game through the eyes of a previous Swordsman (No. 7, preceding the game's No. 8). It was also the first look at the new Pac-Man, whose voracious hunger and relentlessness more closely resembled an updated take on the creatures from the TV mini-series The Langoliers, based on the Stephen King story.

	The game picks up with the next Swordsman, but unlike the 11-minute prequel short, Shadow Labyrinth intends to spend much more time fleshing out the plot. In the preview, the early stages of the game were omitted, leaving players to start further into the game after meeting Puck, the pseudo-robotic looking version of Pac-Man that serves as a partner and guide. The mystery of Puck's origins and goals is to be discovered in the multi-hour epic featuring full towns of NPCs and sprawling regions to explore.


	Fans of the Pac-Man series — or anyone who's ever been forced to listen to a fan of the series like in the party scene from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World — will know that the character's original Japanese name was Puck-Man (from the Japanese term paku-paku). Here, the moniker serves to differentiate the dark version of the mascot from the classic one.


	Visually, the game's art style feels more in line with an indie than anything produced by a massive company like Bandai Namco. Its characters, ranging from the Bosconian denizens to the grotesque enemies creeping about all feature a quaintly illustrated style and bop about with restricted animations, like a paper cutout gliding along the more static, detailed environment.

	The Bosconians are important for another reason: fan service. While Shadow Labyrinth has been billed as a celebration of Pac-Man, it also incorporates tons of other deep-cut references to older Bandai Namco games like Galaga (1981), Dig Dug (1982), and Splatterhouse (1988). The Bosconians that players will meet and do quests for are a reference to (what else?) 1981's shoot-em-up, Bosconian.


	Although most developers would like to avoid the term Metroidvania — which is now shorthand for any 2D platformer that features exploring a pseudo-gated open world with tons of backtracking required — there's really no way to avoid it. Shadow Labyrinth fits the bill to a tee. But that's not a bad thing!

	











	The core gameplay loop will be familiar to anyone who's played games like Metroid Dread (2021) or Hollow Knight (2017): move directionally through closed corridors, fighting enemies and solving platforming puzzles to find keys, and progress. Along the way, towns filled with NPCs will fill in the larger text and provide questlines to follow. There are upgrades to core stats and abilities, and multiple ways to maximize the synergy between the Swordsman and Puck.


	For the most part, it all works pretty well, even for a subgenre that's been thoroughly worn into the ground. Combat is fast and snappy but requires in-depth knowledge of its systems players will develop over time. An ESP gauge (basically stamina) determines how many actions can be done in rapid succession, and too many subsequent attacks or dodges can leave the Swordsman vulnerable. Enemies have pretty obvious weak points and can be parried into a stunned state that presents an opening, and larger enemies require quick thinking to find the right position without being overwhelmed by the mob.


	Some of the combat systems can feel restrictive, even in the overpowered state of the character presented in the demo, featuring multiple higher-level abilities and tons of upgrades to health. For instance, block and parry are mutually exclusive, meaning that one of the two must be selected via a quick-menu in-game. It's an odd design choice, especially for a game already stacked with forced menus like the map (which needs to be checked constantly).


	Platforming sections, too, often feel hindered by a strange air of jankiness. Every game of this type requires learning the internal physics of how jumping and inertia work — Mario doesn't exactly feel the way Sonic does in action, right? But with very strict internal logic about what constitutes a proper jump, and some very unforgiving windows to do it correctly, solving basic puzzles and dodging hazards can be frustrating. It often feels like a game less inspired by titles of the 1980s and more like one designed in the era, with all the bugs and warts.


	Although a lot of the platforming and exploration can occasionally feel like a stilted chore, the game does shine when it commits to the Pac-Man aspect. Certain areas require the player to merge with Puck for on-rails, gravity-defying sections where the new Pac-Man reverts to his classic form. These sections play exponentially better than the base game, with a stickiness that tethers the player to walls and platforms, allowing them to focus more on precise timing than getting screwed over by a millimeter-off leap.

	











	The game's boss battles are also a high point. While the standard encounters often suffer from their chaos, the larger fights with massive singular enemies manage to focus the action on specific tasks like breaking down a boss' shield or timely dodging of wave beams. In the demo, two bosses were present. The first is a multi-story, bugged eyed creature whose design is inspired by the gory horror game Splatterhouse. The second is a techno-suit-wearing version of Pinky, one of the ghosts players gobble up in the Pac-Man arcade game.


	Both encounters precise use of parries, dodging, and strategic stamina management to overcome the enemy, and were easily the most riveting parts of the overall preview. Although a few deaths might be needed, these bouts felt like the best use of the game's various combat abilities and bode well for what the final game could offer. After defeating the bosses, the terrifyingly feral hunger seen in the Secret Level short overcomes Puck, who in true Pac-Man fashion devours the corpses with jaw unhinged.


	It's hard to say if Shadow Labyrinth will end up delivering a fully enjoyable package when it arrives later this summer. The fundamentals are there, with a grimly designed sci-fi fantasy world to explore, solid combat, and occasionally satisfying platforming. But there's a roughness around the edges that — intentionally or not — creates some undesirable friction. In a landscape packed to the brim with options in this same vein, is the gritty Pac-Man schtick be enough to carry it for the long haul?


	Although it's easy to roll your eyes at the general premise, the design and intent of Shadow Labyrinth works better than it should. From what's been shown so far, the game is at its best when it's embracing its arcade-era roots rather than leaning into the more forced Metroidvania tropes. When the action clicks, it's great — and the platforming sections starring the lemon-colored 2D pixel version of Puck become something to look forward to in an otherwise overly familiar exploration game.

	While the hook of the game's marketing is undoubtedly a massive WTF seeing a dark visage of a classic character, the real test for Shadow Labyrinth's success will be whether it can balance its Jekyl with Hyde for the adventure's full playtime, and shake things up often enough to avoid making people wish the experience were as enjoyable as its no-frills coin-up inspirations.

	











Shadow Labyrinth launches on July 18 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Sterling K. Brown is deepening his roots at Hulu. After starring in the iconic ABC series “This Is Us” (and later reteaming with creator Dan Fogelman for “Paradise”), the Emmy winner and Oscar nominee is back at the streamer with the novel adaptation of “Washington Black.” 

Brown stars in and executive produces the series based on Esi Edugyan's bestselling novel of the same name about a young boy who leaves a plantation in the 1800s and embarks on an adventure around the world. The official synopsis reads: “‘Washington Black' follows the 19th-century odyssey of George Washington ‘Wash' Black, an eleven-year-old boy (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) born on a Barbados sugar plantation, whose prodigious scientific mind sets him on a path of unexpected destiny. When a harrowing incident forces Wash to flee, he is thrust into a globe-spanning adventure that challenges and reshapes his understanding of family, freedom, and love. As he navigates uncharted lands and impossible odds, Wash finds the courage to imagine a future beyond the confines of the society he was born into.”

Rupert Graves, Iola Evans, Edward Bluemel, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Eddie Karanja, and Tom Ellis co-star alongside Brown. The project was announced in 2021. 

 










“Washington Black” is produced by 20th Television Production in association with Indian Meadows Productions and The Gotham Group. Along with Brown, Selwyn Seyfu Hinds, Kimberly Ann Harrison, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Wanuri Kahiu, Mo Marable, Rob Seidenglanz, Jeremy Bell, Lindsay Williams, D.J. Goldberg, Jennifer Johnson, and Anthony Hemingway also executive produce. Esi Edugyan is co-producer.

Hinds and Harrison are the showrunners for the series, which is among IndieWire's most anticipated series of the season. IndieWire's Proma Khosla wrote that “Washington Black” is the top pick for Hulu debuts this July.

Brown previously told IndieWire's Anne Thompson he selects his roles based on which speak to him. “[I want to] keep surprising people as much as I possibly can,” he said. “I enjoy making people feel. […] I will go where the story is, where the best story is told, with wonderful creative partnerships. I'm happy to be in a place where I have choice. That's a rarity in this business.”

“Washington Black” premieres July 23 on Hulu. Check out the trailer below.

	Oscar winner Cillian Murphy's next feature, Steve, will receive a theatrical release in select cinemas in September before dropping on Netflix on October 3. We've got a first-look image of Murphy in the eponymous role – scroll down to check it out. 


	Murphy also produces the reform school drama under his Big Things Films banner with partner Alan Moloney, and in collaboration with Netflix which handles global distribution. The release dates could point to fall film festival play.


	Directed by Tim Mielants, Steve is a reimagining of Max Porter's novel Shy, and also stars the previously announced Jay Lycurgo. Supporting cast revealed today are Emmy and Golden Globe winner Tracey Ullman, Top Boy's Simbi Ajikawo (aka Little Simz) and BAFTA winner and Oscar nominee Emily Watson. Mielants recently helmed Netflix's Murphy-starrer Small Things Like These in which Watson featured.

	Set in the mid-1990s, Steve follows a pivotal day in the life of the titular headteacher and his students at a last-chance reform school amidst a world that has forsaken them. As Steve fights to protect the school's integrity and impending closure, he grapples with his own mental health. In parallel to Steve's struggles, troubled teen Shy (Lycurgo) is caught between his past and what lies ahead as he tries to reconcile his inner fragility with his impulse for self-destruction and violence.

Mac DeMarco has officially announced a new album. The Canadian musician wrote, recorded, produced, and mixed Guitar entirely himself, only recruiting David Ives for mastering duties. He also shot all the record's music videos and cover art on tripods. The clip for lead single “Home” shows DeMarco canoeing alongside various shorebirds. Watch it below.

“I think Guitar is as close to a true representation of where I'm at in my life today as I can manage to put to paper.” DeMarco said in a press statement. “I'm happy to share this music, and look forward to playing these songs as many places as I'm able.”

Guitar is out August 22 via Mac's Record Label. In 2023, DeMarco shared the 199-track compilation One Wayne G and the instrumental LP Five Easy Hot Dogs. His last proper guitar-and-vocals studio album was 2019's Here Comes the Cowboy.

Following his previously announced 2025 tour dates, DeMarco will stay on the road through spring 2026, making further stops in Japan, Hong Kong, and across the southern and midwestern United States. Find all of his upcoming shows below.

With an archive of more than a thousand original movies produced over the last 15 years, Hallmark Channel and its stars have shared plenty of cute and funny bloopers with fans. But the outtake that Ashley Williams posted on June 22, 2025, in honor of Paul Campbell's birthday may very well take the cake as the best Hallmark blooper ever.

Williams waited over a year to share what happened as they filmed the final scene of “Falling Together” in the spring of 2024. During what was meant to be a sweet, romantic moment, Williams wrote in the caption, “a background actor… let one rip RIGHT by where Paul and I were about to kiss.” 

“It's the blooperiest of bloopers and it makes me cry laughing to this day,” she wrote, and then made matters even funnier with a smattering of puns, joking, “Paul, you are the wind beneath my wings. The air in my tires. You blow me away. Happy birthday, partner.”

A post shared by Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamsandcompany)

Williams added narrative text over the video to ensure fans could tell exactly when the flatulence in question occurred. In a scene designed to look like one of the Alzheimer's Association's annual fundraising walks, Campbell could be heard delivering his line to Williams. 

Over the video, she pointed out in text, “Here's the fart. You really gotta listen…We both CLEARLY hear it. But the camera is still rolling so we can't react.”

Trying to stifle their laughter, Williams says through gritted teeth, “We have to kiss.” After smooching, she whispers and wheezily giggles, “Did you hear that?” and Campbell kisses her again just to disguise their laughter. 

As the camera pans out, she writes over the video, “We cut. I collapse on Paul.” 

Many fans said they were in tears over the blooper video, flooding Williams' post with comments, including one who wrote, “I'm crying from laughter watching this! 🤣” and another who called it “the best thing ever 😂”

One fan commented, “I laughed so hard and laughed even harder hearing you laugh 😂”

Someone else admitted, “you are a hoot Ashley Williams, you made me laugh so hard, I about peed myself 😂😂😂😂”

“I have no idea how you kept your composure so well,” someone else wrote. “I died laughing immediatly!!! 😂🤣”

A post shared by Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow)

Williams has every right to toot her own horn about the hilarious blooper from “Falling Together,” which premiered on Hallmark Channel in September. But believe it or not, it's not the only gas-induced outtake in the Hallmark archives. In 2023, a gassy horse named Noodles caused a bit of a stir during the filming of “When Calls The Heart” season 10. 

Plenty of other mishaps have been responsible for laugh-out-loud bloopers on the sets of Hallmark movies and series over the years, with stars getting tongue-tied or tripped up over what's happening on-set. 

One classic, seen above, is from the 2021 Tyler Hynes and Erin Krakow rom-com “It Was Always You,” in which he timed his invitation to dance just-right each time she took a swig of champagne, causing her to bust out laughing. 

In early June, Hallmark provided a montage of funny outtakes to “Entertainment Tonight” of Williams and Alison Sweeney filming their “To Barcelona” movies, including shots of Williams spilling Italian food on herself. 

In 2021, Williams (are you noticing a theme here?) was featured in another adorable blooper reel with her sister, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, to promote their “Sister Swap” movies.

The Jay-Z-founded entertainment juggernaut says in a new court filing that its role as Fat Joe's management company shouldn't involve it in the bombshell racketeering case.

Roc Nation wants out of an explosive new lawsuit accusing Fat Joe of victimizing his longtime hypeman via a wide-ranging criminal enterprise, saying it's “nonsensical” to suggest the rapper's management company was involved in any of the scandalous behavior alleged in the case.


Jay-Z's entertainment company was among a slew of people and companies named last week in Terrance “T.A.” Dixon's lawsuit against Fat Joe (Joseph Cartagena). Dixon, Fat Joe's hypeman for over a decade, said he was forced to work without pay while being subjected to psychological manipulation and exposed to sexual misconduct, including the trafficking of underage girls.


	The claims in Dixon's Thursday (June 19) complaint, which Fat Joe has fiercely denied and characterized as extortion, are framed as a racketeering enterprise abetted by Roc Nation and other outside entities. But Roc Nation's attorneys quickly filed a motion to dismiss on Monday (June 23), saying the company “has nothing to do with any of this.”


	“Roc Nation's alleged role in this case — according to plaintiff himself — is that it became Mr. Cartagena's artist management company in 2017, and in that capacity, earned a commission on revenue Mr. Cartagena generated,” writes Roc Nation's lawyer Alex Spiro. “Yet, according to plaintiff, the fact that Roc Nation had a business relationship with Mr. Cartagena somehow makes Roc Nation part of a RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] enterprise, a participant in sex trafficking, and an aider-and-abettor of Mr. Cartagena's alleged conduct. That is nonsensical.”


	According to Monday's motion, there's not a single factual allegation in the complaint that ties Roc Nation to any of Fat Joe's alleged wrongdoing. Dixon's lawsuit claimed the management company was responsible for his withheld wages, but Spiro says Roc Nation only manages Fat Joe's catalog, publishing rights and intellectual property.


	“How Roc Nation supposedly knew of this deplorable alleged conduct is a mystery,” writes Spiro. “He does not assert how Roc Nation's management of Mr. Cartagena's music business gave it insight into how much plaintiff should have been paid, what he was paid, or any venture to deprive him of adequate compensation.”


	In a statement to Billboard on Monday, Spiro says, “Roc Nation has nothing to do with any of this. Nothing. And we expect this case to be dismissed.”


	Reached for comment on Monday, Dixon's attorney Tyrone Blackburn tells Billboard he will oppose Roc Nation's motion to be dismissed from the case.


	“I am happy to see that Roc Nation was smart enough to distance itself from Fat Joe and his RICO enterprise,” adds Blackburn. “The plaintiff has no personal animosity towards Roc Nation or its leadership.”


	Dixon's case against Fat Joe was actually preceded by the rapper suing Dixon and Blackburn for extortion. Two months ago, Fat Joe filed a lawsuit accusing the former hypeman and his attorney of trying to extract a settlement with “wholly fabricated” and “grotesque” claims of pedophilia.


	In a statement after Dixon filed his own lawsuit last week, Fat Joe's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said they'll continue to fight the claims and that “law enforcement is aware of the extortionate demand at the heart of this scheme.”

	Justin Bieber encountered the paparazzi during an outing and got a bit heated during the interaction. The moment quickly went viral on social media and even turned into a meme. We went to the streets to have fans weigh in on the interaction to determine whether Bieber's reaction was valid or not.


	What did you think of the viral interaction? Let us know in the comments!


	Guest 1:


	It is what it is, bro. There're paparazzi everywhere for you. Like, you're Justin Bieber, bro.  


	Tetris Kelly:


	Last week, Justin Bieber stood on business as he confronted a group of paparazzi who was determined to kill his vibe. 


	Guest 2:


	I don't know. It just seems kind of off to me. 


	Tetris Kelly:


	In the video, Justin can be heard saying, “It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business. Is it?” Things got a little heated between Justin and the paps. Their exchange went viral from content creator re-enactments. Justin, having a little fun himself, took to Instagram where he shared a content creator's remix of his viral moment. Then Justin posted a black-and-white image with the caption, “y'all think the business is a joke, but you're drunk.” This video of Justin and the paparazzi has started an interesting discourse online. In the video, Justin talks about setting boundaries while the paparazzi say they're just doing their jobs. But we started to wonder: Who's right? Should Justin be left alone, or were the paparazzi just doing their jobs? We took it to the streets of West Hollywood to see what you all thought. 


	Guest 3:


	He's always reacted a little bit, you know, strange when it comes to paparazzi and stuff. Who knows what's going on through his head. But I feel like you know what you sign up for when you become a celebrity. 


Keep watching for more.

Aaron Rodgers' frustration was palpable Tuesday when he exploded into a furious rant over his right to a private life amid rampant rumors shrouding his new marriage. 

The NFL veteran, 41, dropped a shock marriage bombshell during his first official Steelers training earlier this month when he confirmed to reporters that he had tied the knot 'a couple of months ago.' 

However, the identity of the four-time MVP's new wife has remained a mystery in the weeks since, sparking conspiracy theories on the internet that his marriage could be a hoax. Even his family was said to be questioning whether the wedding took place. 

But Rodgers ripped into the rumors Tuesday when he took aim at the rampant speculation in a furious four-minute-long tirade on the Pat McAfee Show.    

'It's a sick society, isn't it? I lived in the public eye for 20 years, I had public relationships,' he began referring to his past high-profile romances with the likes of actress Shailene Woodley and NASCAR star Danica Patrick.

'How did that work out? I had peple leaking my home information, and making up stories, I had people calling the paparazzi, I had people posting my personal life on the internet. I didn't want that, didn't like any of that. 

'Now I'm with someone who's private who doesn't want to be in the public eye, didn't sign up to be in the public eye, doesn't want to be a celebrity. And because I do things in private because I want my personal life to be private, I'm now weird and have the paparazzi stalking me.'  

Rodgers previously divulged to McAfee in December that he was in a relationship with a woman named 'Brittani', and that she did not have any social media. However, on Tuesday he refused to leak any more details, never even referring to his wife by a name. 

During Tuesday's rant, Rodgers went on to question: 'What happened to common decency about security and a personal life? 

'Now we have to dive into details of where you live, what you're doing and who you're with, who your wife is and if you even have a wife, and if you're doing so sort of attention-grabbing thing - because my wife is a private person, doesn't have social media. 

'Where are we at in society that that's the norm? Just because I'm not selling wedding to the magazines or making a loving post on Instagram.' 

The former Super Bowl winner also insisted that his family members wouldn't know any details about his private life or his new bride as claimed 'they don't know anything about them' because he doesn't talk to them. 

Rodgers' feud with his younger brother Jordan has been well-documented for years now after the latter went on and won season 12 of The Bachelorette, marrying that year's star JoJo Fletcher. 

First indications of a feud between Aaron and his family surfaced during The Bachelorette in 2016, when Jordan introduced JoJo to his eldest brother, Luke, and his parents. 

'My private life is my private life and it's going to stay that way, and I'm with somebody who wants to be private, and if and when she wants to be out and there's a picture, she'll choose that,' the new Steelers quarterback continued. 

'The entitlement to information about my private life is so f***ing ridiculous and embarrassing,' he added. 

The signal caller signed a one-year, $13.65million deal with the Steelers earlier this month after yet another offseason of speculation over his NFL future.

But he also admitted Tuesday, that the upcoming NFL season is probably his last before he hangs his cleats up for good, saying, 'I'm pretty sure this is it.'

And Rodgers suggested that beyond the end of the 2025 NFL season not only will fans no longer see him on the field, they won't see him at all as he vowed to keep his private life just that - private. 

'When this is all done, I'm out. You won't see me. And I know that I've chosen to be in the public eye for one more season, but my private life is staying private,' he insisted. 

Rodgers' last public relationship was with Woodley, with the pair going their separate ways in 2022 after two years together. The actress is believed to have moved on with 'Emily In Paris' star Lucas Bravo.

Prior to his romance with Woodley he dated some high-profile figures in former racing car driver Danica Patrick and another actress in Olivia Munn.

Patrick previously sensationally claimed that their relationship was 'emotionally abusive' and 'wore me down to nothing'.

The former NASCAR driver and Rodgers started dating in January 2018 and made their red-carpet debut at that year's ESPY awards.

At the end of 2019 they bought a home together in Malibu and spent the first few months of 2020 living together in the trendy California beach town.

However, their relationship didn't last much longer as they split in July 2020 after just over two years together.

A dramatic new video showing a disc-shaped UFO, filmed by the US military, has been leaked to the public by independent journalist and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell. The thermal footage, along with two enhanced clips, was reportedly captured during a high-altitude reconnaissance mission and shows an unidentified object abruptly changing direction, without any visible signs of propulsion.

Corbell, known for previous credible leaks involving UFO sightings, described the footage as historic. “This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,” he told DailyMail.com. “It has implications that are huge.”

BREAKING: NEW UAP FOOTAGE-Is it a sphere? The lighting/reflection on the “bottom” is uncommon in IR. May be spherical?-90° turn? (Moves cloud to cloud?)-Symbology looks legit (Wescam IR camera), filmed close to Afghan/Pakistan border-Any evidence of CGI? Camera artifacts? https://t.co/R7njUUX6hl pic.twitter.com/ekMmLYkMwz

The video, taken on November 23, 2020, is believed to show the disc-shaped craft flying through the clouds near the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The coordinates, visible in the footage, match this location. While most previously recorded UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) resemble “Tic Tac” or pill-shaped objects, this one clearly appears as a saucer-like disc, reminiscent of classic science-fiction depictions.

Corbell says the object may be anywhere between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, although there is debate over its precise size. “It's a perfect-looking disc, maybe it's an orb,” he told NBC News. The footage, captured by thermal imaging, shows the object manoeuvring in ways inconsistent with any known aircraft, no exhaust, no wings, and a sharp directional shift mid-flight.

Corbell released the footage after years of verifying its authenticity through trusted military and intelligence contacts. His podcast cohost, George Knapp, emphasised the credibility: “The source is legit. We know it's real. It was not supposed to be made public. But it should've been.”

This isn't the first time the military has encountered unexplained aerial objects. Corbell previously leaked information about a giant unidentified object hovering over a US base and described similar cases dating back to 2004, when Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz carrier group saw a fast-moving “Tic Tac” object.

Another incident in 2015 off the East Coast, recorded by pilots on the USS Roosevelt, showed flying objects with no visible propulsion system. Corbell hopes this leak will push the government to be more transparent. “These objects have implications for national security, aerospace defence, and possibly even humanity's understanding of our place in the universe,” he said.

Overconfidence is a hallmark trait of people who believe in conspiracies, and they also significantly overestimate how much others agree with them, Cornell psychology researchers have found. The study indicates that belief in conspiracies may be less about a person's needs and motivations and more about their failure to recognize that they might be wrong.

Conspiracy believers not only consistently overestimated their performance on numeracy and perception tests, revealing they tend to be less analytic in the way they think. They also are genuinely unaware that their beliefs are on the fringe, thinking themselves to be in the majority 93% of the time, according to the research. The work counters previous theories that people believe conspiracies essentially because they want to, out of narcissism or to appear unique.

"This group of people are really miscalibrated from reality," said Gordon Pennycook, associate professor of psychology and the Himan Brown Faculty Fellow in the College of Arts and Sciences. "In many cases, they believe something that very few people agree with. Not only is it something that doesn't make a lot of sense, based on what we know about the world, but they also have no idea how far out in the fringe they are. They think they are in the majority in most cases, even if they're in a tiny minority.

Pennycook is the corresponding author of "Overconfidently Conspiratorial: Conspiracy Believers are Dispositionally Overconfident and Massively Overestimate How Much Others Agree with Them," which is published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. Jabin Binnendyk, a doctoral student in psychology, and David G. Rand of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are co-authors.

Rand and Pennycook started this research in 2018, observing that people who believe in conspiracies seem to have real faith in their own cognitive abilities, "which is paradoxical," Pennycook said, "because prior work has shown that people who believe in conspiracies tend to be more intuitive."

The researchers conducted eight studies with 4,181 U.S. adults. Four studies assessed participants' levels of overconfidence using tests of perception, numeracy and cognitive reflection. Because overconfidence is difficult to measure—those who are the most incompetent are the least able to recognize their own incompetence, Pennycook said—the researchers used a new measurement approach to account for this effect.

Rather than completing specific tests with measurable outcomes, participants were given tasks where actual performance and their perceived performance were unrelated, such as quickly discerning an image so obscured, they essentially had to guess what it is.

"Participants have little reason to believe that they did well—allowing higher estimated performance to more directly index higher levels of trait overconfidence without being confounded by actual performance," the researchers wrote.

The studies then measured conspiracy beliefs by asking direct questions about popular—but false—conspiracy claims, including "the Apollo Moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood film studio," "Princess Diana's death was not an accident," and "Dinosaurs never existed."

Results of these four studies show an association between a tendency toward overconfidence and belief in conspiracies, indicating that a disposition to overrate one's cognitive skills may play an important role in conspiracy beliefs.

"If overconfidence is an important component of conspiracy beliefs, then it is likely that believers do not realize that they are in the minority," the researchers wrote. "In contrast, if conspiracy beliefs are more driven by need for uniqueness, then believers may well know that they are in the minority—in fact, they may revel in this fact."

Another four studies tested the study participants' perceptions of others' beliefs, and found that overconfidence predicted both belief in conspiracies and the tendency to overestimate how much others believe in false conspiracies. On average, a minority of participants believed in the false conspiracies. Even so, they thought that a majority of others agreed with them in each study. That is, conspiracy believers massively overestimated how much others agreed with them.

Conspiracy belief is a growing issue, thanks to an "expanded marketplace for conspiracy theories" online and on social media platforms, Pennycook said.

However, the propensity to think most other people share these beliefs creates challenges for efforts to undermine false beliefs in conspiracies. The researchers wrote, "The people who most need help distinguishing truth from falsity are the least likely to recognize that they need it."

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array has detected methanol isotopes around a nearby star, which could help explain why the ingredients for life are present on Earth.

Researchers have found alcohol in the orbit of a young star, and it could help them understand the origins of life on Earth.

Methanol (methyl alcohol) and its isotopes (versions of elements) were detected in gases around a star called HD 100453, which is about 330 light-years from Earth. This is the first time researchers have found isotopes of methanol in the disk of a young star like HD 100453, the scientists reported in a study published June 5 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Methanol is a building block for organic compounds such as amino acids, which are needed for life. Researchers had previously detected methanol — but not its far rarer isotopes — in other star-forming disks.

"Finding these isotopes of methanol gives essential insight into the history of ingredients necessary to build life here on Earth," study lead author Alice Booth, a research fellow at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said in a statement.

Many young stars are surrounded by swirling disks of gas and dust. These protoplanetary disks, also known as planet-forming disks, provide the material for planets, moons and comets to form.

The team made the methanol discovery using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. ALMA maps the chemical composition and distribution of gas in nearby (relatively speaking) protoplanetary disks.

HD 100453 is larger than the sun, with about 1.6 times the sun's mass. This means that methanol and other molecules in its disk exist as a gas farther from their home star than would have been the case when our solar system was young. Smaller stars have cooler disks, so their molecules are normally frozen as ice and undetectable to ALMA, according to the statement.

In HD 100453's disk, the researchers found that the ratio of methanol to other organic molecules was similar to that of comets in our solar system. The findings suggest that ices within protoplanetary disks eventually clump together to form comets loaded with complex organic molecules, which may then be delivered to planets through collisions.

"This research supports the idea that comets may have played a big role in delivering important organic material to the Earth billions of years ago," study co-author Milou Temmink, a doctoral candidate who studies protoplanetary disks at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said in the statement. "They may be the reason why life, including us, was able to form here."

June 24 (UPI) -- Supernatural alum Jensen Ackles says reuniting with his former co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins for The Boys Season 5 was a "really good time."

The actor, 47, discussed the fifth and final season of The Boys when he stopped by The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon on Monday.
"So, Eric Kripke, who created Supernatural -- he is also the writer-showrunner of The Boys," Ackles told Fallon. "When he likes to work with somebody, he likes to continue working with them. And I was the benefactor of that, obviously. But then he thought, 'Oh, what a great idea. Let's just bring the cast back together.'"
Supernatural premiered on the WB in 2005 before moving to the CW for its sophomore season. The series ran for 15 seasons, through 2019. It starred Ackles and Padalecki as brothers Dean and Sam, respectively. Together, they faced various obstacles presented by paranormal entities. Collins also starred.

"It was funny because there was a little, like, concern that, you know, we're gonna get Jared and Misha and Jensen together, and it's gonna be a little wacky, because, 15 years together, we got a little off," he added. "...It was a really good time. I can't wait to be able to say more."


Ackles, Padalecki and Collins announced the casting in February.

Ackles portrays Ben, or Soldier Boy, on The Boys, which follows a team of vigilantes who take issue with dishonorable superheroes. The show is adapted from the comic series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. 

Prime Video has yet to announce a premiere date for Season 5.

It's been five years since Supernatural ended its 15-season run on The CW (the series finale aired on November 19, 2020), but the show remains as popular as ever, thanks to Netflix and fan conventions, as star Jensen Ackles, who played hunter Dean Winchester alongside Jared Padalecki as his brother Sam, noted while on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Monday, June 23.

Ackles was on the late night talk show to promote his new Prime Video series Countdown (premiering on Wednesday, June 25, with the first three episodes), but Jimmy Fallon did bring up his past show and ask about the potential for a Supernatural revival. (Watch the full video of Ackles on The Tonight Show above.)

“I mean, look, it's always hanging out there,” Ackles said. “ I think there's a reason we did it for 15 years. We enjoyed it, we enjoyed each other, we enjoyed the story, the characters. It was hard to hang it up. But I don't know that we ever hang it up in Supernatural, so… We'll see.”

Ackles also spoke about the Supernatural fan conventions that the actors do across the world. “I thought that they would fizzle out, like, once the show — show's been off for five years,” he admitted. “And they're still growing, and we're still getting asked to come to these different cities.”

Fallon wondered if that had to do with streaming, and Ackles did note that the show has done well on Netflix. “A lot of people during the pandemic, I think, found it, and they binged all 15 seasons, and now they're coming to these events, and they're wanting to ask us questions,” said Ackles. He pointed out that they don't get feedback on TV show sets from an audience while filming, but “now, we get to go and we get to see these crowds of people who really enjoy what we do, and it just it's energizing.”

Supernatural did end with Dean dying on an ordinary hunt then flash-forwards showing Sam's life until he died of old age and joined his brother in heaven. But in the world of Supernatural, anything can be done to bring these characters back.

Countdown boss Derek Haas talks creating the character around Ackles, and the cast teases the “Avengers”-like team of the crime thriller.

Robert Hastings has spent nearly five decades investigating one of the most unnerving and underreported patterns in modern military history: unidentified flying objects repeatedly interfering with nuclear weapons. 

Shortly after he began interviewing retired Air Force personnel in the early 1980s, Hastings says his phone started ringing after each call - but no one would speak. Just heavy breathing.

'Somebody was trying to intimidate me,' he claimed to the Daily Mail. 

'But I took it as confirmation I was on the right track. They wouldn't be monitoring me if I was some nut listening to liars.'

Although initially shaken and concerned these mysterious calls would result in violent attacks or charges for divulging classified information, Hastings said he 'ultimately decided that this was important.'

'I felt strongly that the public needed to know the facts, and so I just stuck with it.'

Hastings is best known for helping bring to light the now-infamous 1967 incident at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where multiple nuclear missiles were mysteriously disabled while security personnel above ground reported a glowing object hovering over the silos. 

Hastings' father worked at the base's radar facility, and as a teenager, Hastings took a janitorial job cleaning the air traffic control tower.

One night, Hastings recalled, a radar supervisor waved him over to his screen and pointed out five unexplained blips. 

'He kind of motioned me over to take a look at what he was looking at. For whatever reason, he did that almost nonchalantly,' he said. 'What he pointed out were these five unknown blips, which formally are called targets. And he probably used the word "unknown," which is the formal designation for a non-identified aerial object.'

That brief moment would go on to shape the rest of his life. 

Years later, he began interviewing military veterans who had witnessed similar strange phenomena - many of whom had direct experience with nuclear weapons.

'I began informally, at first very sporadically, seeking out Air Force veterans,' he said. 

'By 1981 I had probably in the neighborhood of 20 or 25 sources of veterans. And they were all telling me the same thing… these kinds of nuclear weapons related UFO incidents.'

Among them was Captain David Schuur, a missile launch officer who described a chilling event at Minot Air Force Base in the 1960s. 

'He said his missiles were actually temporarily activated for a period of time and were preparing to launch for all intents and purposes,' Hastings said.

'And he had to flip what's called an inhibit switch… to disrupt this what seemed to be an impending launch.'

Hastings' experience inspired him to collect interviews from veterans who had similar experiences, especially around nuclear bases (pictured: Malmstrom)

Hastings also described an event at Ellsworth Air Force Base where another witness allegedly encountered a UFO while working in a missile silo. 

Hastings said the witness was a targeting technician, adding that he was underground at the time. Suddenly, he relayed, the guard started banging on the ladder, saying, 'Get up here. Get up here.' When they emerged, Hastings said, they heard 'an omnipresent hum.'

Moments later, according to Hastings, a massive rhombus-shaped object appeared overhead - and the missile went offline.

At times, the activity was even more alarming abroad. 'Unbelievably, one of the people I interviewed was a retired Soviet Army Colonel,' Hastings said. 'According to this document that George smuggled out and had translated… there was an intermediate range missile base in Soviet Ukraine… and for some 15 seconds, the missiles went into countdown mode. They were apparently preparing to launch.'

Despite the pattern, Hastings doesn't believe the so-called entities - what he refers to as NHI, or non-human intelligence - are attempting to start a war.

'What I emphasize to my audiences and in my book, to my readers, I don't think that the NHI who were involved in these incidents, either here or in the Soviet Union, were actually attempting to start World War III,' he said. 

'I think rather, what they were attempting to do is to scare the hell out of the nuclear forces, the nuclear powers, to basically say, "You better think twice. You're playing with fire."'

He added, 'I think they're trying to keep humans from destroying ourselves, but also they don't want their activities terminated or negatively impacted by massive radiation surrounding the earth and so on years after the war.'

Even in the 21st century, the reported sightings haven't stopped. Hastings described an incident at FE Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming in 2010, shortly after he and Robert Salas held a press conference in Washington revealing decades of UAP activity at missile sites.

'According to the Atlantic story, overnight on October 23… the base could not communicate with five of the launch capsules,' He said. 

Hastings explained that if war had been declared at that moment, the missiles 'could not have been launched.'

But according to Hastings, Air Force technicians who were deployed to investigate the problem saw something stunning: 'Multiple teams saw a huge, cigar shaped object in the air flying over the missile field.

'They were called together in a squadron wide meeting and told not to discuss what they quote "may or may not have seen," end quote.'

The Air Force later blamed a faulty processor and claimed the problem lasted only 59 minutes. But Hastings claimed his sources told a different story.

'It was apparently intermittent for 26 hours… I'm sure that the Air Force would not want to acknowledge that they had lost control or the ability to launch that many missiles for more than a day.'

In his opinion, these incidents form a consistent and disturbing pattern.

'What my sources are confirming to me is that this has gone on repeatedly, year after year, decade after decade… The available testimony, the available evidence, even though it's anecdotal, confirms that the UFO nuclear weapons link is long standing, widespread and ongoing,' claimed Hastings, who has lectured at more than 500 colleges and universities over the course of his career.

Many of his most valuable leads came from veterans who approached him after his presentations. He meticulously verified each with official military discharge documents.

His work reportedly reached the highest levels of government. According to Hastings, unbeknownst to him, physics researcher Hal Puthoff 'actually gave four copies of my book to Lou Elizondo and three other persons' in Washington, DC.

Even former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reportedly read Hastings' work, which helped convince him to back the secret Pentagon program known as AAWSAP and its successor, AATIP.

Today, Hastings is 75 and retired due to congestive heart failure. He's no longer conducting new interviews, but he says his research continues to ripple through official circles - and among journalists and whistleblowers newly emboldened to speak out.

'I've done my part,' he said. 'Now it's up to the next generation to keep asking questions. The more people know about these incidents, the harder it becomes to deny they happened.' 

Asked whether he thinks official disclosure is coming, Hastings is cautiously optimistic.

'I think it's just a question of time before the US government, probably in conjunction with other world governments, they're going to have to simultaneously admit… that these are NHI,' he said.

'But even when that happens… I don't think that any government is going to immediately acknowledge that they've been messing with our nuclear weapons. It's just too disconcerting.'

New footage shows an expressionless iRonCub MK3 robot taking off using four thrusters — two where its arms should be and two in a jetpack on its back.

Researchers have demonstrated the first successful vertical liftoff of a humanoid robot — a major step toward flying robots that mimic human capabilities.

The new robot, dubbed iRonCub MK3, uses four thrusters to achieve vertical thrust, two built into its arms and two in a jetpack mounted on its back.

In footage released by the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) to YouTube on 18 June, the mask-donning robot is held from a suspender and then activates, lifting off roughly 20 inches (50 centimeters) from the ground using its thrusters.

The iCub robot that IIT's humanoid is based on is child-like in both size and appearance. It measures 3 feet (1 meter) tall while weighing 49 pounds (22 kilograms), adopting child-like dimensions, and donning a highly recognizable smooth and shiny "baby face" head.

First launched in 2009 by the RobotCub Consortium of European universities, it is designed to be a testbed for research into human cognition and artificial intelligence (AI) and has been used in countless projects over the last 16 years.

In a corresponding study describing the robot, published June 1 on the arXiv preprint server, the IIT engineers say their augmented version of the robot is the first such jet-powered flying humanoid robot designed to take off. They added this work highlights the new possibilities that a flying, humanoid robot presents.

In contrast to many other robotic platforms currently in development, which typically focus exclusively on ground-based locomotion and manipulation, adding aerial mobility may pave the way for assistance in search and rescue missions, traversing collapsed buildings and flooded areas, or other terrain inaccessible to humans, the scientists said in the study.

Combining flight with the ability to interact with its environment, a robot of this kind could clear debris and assist in locating or even extracting victims.

The authors of the study also point out that a flying humanoid robot could carry out repairs on structures difficult for human beings to access, like the undersides of bridges. They could even be deployed in hazardous environments where people can't safely operate, like the site of a nuclear or chemical leaks.

iRonCub is based on IIT's iCub3 platform. This system is designed to allow a robot to emulate a number of human capabilities as it's being remotely controlled by an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) helmet-like heads-up display (HUD) and other specialized equipment.

To equip the iCub for flight, the team added load-bearing mounting brackets to secure the jetpack and a new titanium spine to support its weight. Because previous versions of the iRonCub had issues with catching fire from the thrusters' exhaust, heat-resistant panels and covers were added to the iCub chassis. The thrusters' tilt angle was also adjusted to help with in-flight stability and to angle the exhaust away from the robot's body.



For this version, the robot's forearms and hands were removed to make space for the arm-mounted thrusters, but the team says the forearms are still fully compatible and will be readded in later iterations.

To ensure the chassis could handle the stress of takeoff and flight, the team performed a Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis — a problem-solving technique that centers around breaking a structure down into smaller interconnected components. As a result, they applied axial loads of 750 newtons (three times the peak thrust of each turbine) to the brackets of the jet engines.

One of the major challenges of achieving flight in a humanoid robot of this type is accounting for all of the joints and actuation points and adjusting them, as well as the thrusters, in a coordinated way, so the robot doesn't end up flying off course or upside down.

The engineers managed this with what's called a Linear Parameter Varying Model Predictive Control (MPC), a complex flight controller that's constantly computing the optimal joint position and jet throttle.

The scientists extensively tested the system first in computer simulations before then launching real-world tests, in large part due to the safety risks of operating thrusters with exhaust temperatures in excess of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius).

After successfully demonstrating a launch with a predefined trajectory and accurate tracking, the team now plans to focus its efforts on improving the flight controller to handle external disturbances that may occur during a real flight scenario, like wind or other inclement weather.

A psychic has warned Donald Trump's Middle East ceasefire is 'not the end of hostilities' and claims the UK will be 'dragged into the conflict'.

Athos Salomé, 38, from Brazil, is often referred to as the 'Living Nostradamus' because he accurately predicted dozens of events such as the Microsoft global outage, the coronavirus pandemic and Queen Elizabeth's death.

In May, he warned we were 'just seconds away' from 'a silent nuclear crisis' saying the destruction of an Iranian nuclear reactor would have a global environmental and political impact.

Now, Salomé has issued a chilling warning about the current geopolitical scene after the United States president Donald Trump launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday evening and announced the 'bilateral ceasefire' on Monday.

Salomé revealed that this is 'not the end of hostilities', saying: 'It is merely a theatrical interlude in a script written to manipulate headlines, delay investigations and test how far misinformation can be sold as heroism.'

'True peace does not come about suddenly, nor from a solitary speech during prime time. It requires real commitment, mature diplomacy and, above all, respect for life.' 

None of this was present in yesterday's announcement, according to the Living Nostradamus. Contrary to what has been suggested, the psychic believes 'war is not over'; it has merely changed its guise.

Salomé added: 'Drones continue to fly over sensitive regions, troops remain in position, and reconnaissance satellites have not changed their focus.

'Deep down, we are not talking about a ceasefire, we are talking about political survival, a possible freeze. 

'Trump, who vowed to restore American greatness, now plays with the pieces of his own ego. Every move he makes is calculated: not to avoid war, but to avoid his downfall.'

The psychic also predicted that the UK will be dragged into the conflict 'not by choice, but by force of silent alliances, strategic treaties and hidden pressures that escape public scrutiny.'

According to Athos, the 'first domino has already fallen' and the UK is already very much involved behind the scenes. 

He claimed: 'Even more worrying is the silent involvement of the United Kingdom, which, although it has not made an official statement, is already moving its military bases in Diego Garcia to support American logistical operations.

'Fuel, transport, evacuation of diplomats, all of this is being treated as ‘technical support,' although the smell of pre-engagement is in the air.'

Salomé revealed three unprecedented fronts through which Britain will become a 'key player' in the international crisis.

He warned of three potential scenarios in which Britain's involvement in the conflict could escalate.

1. Iran targets the British base at Diego Garcia

The British base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which is technically under UK sovereignty but operated in close collaboration with the US, is already in full 'hidden' activity, serving as a logistical and digital support centre.

Salomé added: 'Even without a public statement, Diego Garcia is being used for diplomatic evacuation operations, strategic weapons transport and electronic surveillance. 

'Emergency contracts with civilian companies have been hastily signed. In the event of retaliation by Iran, the base could become an indirect target for cruise missiles or attacks by Iranian drones and their proxies in Yemen or Pakistan.'

If this happens, says Athos, the United Kingdom will be forced to react, not of its own volition, but because its territorial integrity will have been violated.

2. Strait of Hormuz: the Royal Navy's invisible operation

According to Salomé, the second front is already discreetly in motion.  

After the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear sites, Tehran said it will reserve all options to defend itself.

This has stoked speculation that Iran's leadership may pressure its enemies to relent by blocking or effectively closing the Strait of Hormuz to shipping.

The waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf handles about a quarter of the world's seaborne oil trade, so if Iran were to block access to the massive tankers that deliver oil and gas to China, Europe, and other major markets, it could drive up global oil prices and trigger widespread economic disruption.

Salomé claims the British Royal Navy has received secret orders to reposition ships between Oman and Bahrain as a containment plan called 'Operation Shield of Hormuz.'

He added: 'If Iran blocks the strait, as it has already threatened to do, the United Kingdom will act immediately, escorting oil tankers and conducting naval mine sweeps. 

'But beware: although sold to the press as a 'humanitarian action', this mission will involve direct clashes with drones, torpedoes and underwater sabotage. The war will be technical, but real.'

Athos warns that this involvement will be the beginning of a continuous and inevitable presence of British forces in the Persian Gulf.

3. NATO's hidden card and cyber warfare

The third and most insidious line of involvement will come, according to Salomé, from the digital realm. 

Behind the scenes at NATO, there are confidential talks about the possible invocation of Article 5, the collective defence clause, in the event of coordinated cyber attacks by Tehran against American facilities in Europe, such as the Ramstein air base in Germany.

'If there is an Iranian digital offensive against military targets in Europe, the United Kingdom will be legally compelled to participate in NATO's defence. 

'This will include coordinated blockades, electronic sanctions, cyber espionage and even attacks on Iranian servers.'

In other words, the United Kingdom could enter the war not with tanks, but with algorithms, firewalls and state viruses, according to the Brazilian medium.

Keir Starmer is currently engaged in frantic diplomacy over the Iran crisis with Donald Trump. 

The PM and president spoke last night after the US strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites. But Downing Street's readout notably did not include any reference to the 'de-escalation' Sir Keir has been urging in other statements.

Instead No10 said the leaders agreed Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and should return to negotiations.

Soon after the call Mr Trump took to social media apparently endorsing regime change - swiping that it could be time to 'Make Iran Great Again'.

The stance raises fresh questions about Sir Keir's influence and the health of the Special Relationship. After meeting Mr Trump in person at the G7 in Canada last week, the premier had insisted he did not believe the US would go ahead with the attacks.

America did not ask to use the Diego Garcia base for the bombing raid, amid speculation that Attorney General Lord Hermer had advised UK participation would be illegal.

Ministers again refused to say explicitly this morning whether Britain supported the action taken by the US.

Last month Salomé warned: 'There are wars that aren't televised, but they happen every day.

'One of them is the underground conflict between Iran and Israel. Drones, industrial sabotage and cyber-attacks already make up a silent theatre of war.

He revealed the greatest risk is the destruction of an Iranian nuclear reactor, which would have a global environmental and political impact.

'The world is just seconds away from a silent nuclear crisis,' he warned, saying that only three heads of state are aware of the real magnitude of this threat.

A Cambridge graduate died as a result of the anti-medicine conspiracy theories promoted by her mother, her brothers have claimed.

Paloma Shemirani died last year at the age of 23 after refusing chemotherapy, despite having been told by doctors she had a high chance of survival if she had accepted the treatment.

Her brothers blame the anti-medicine views of her mother Kate Shemirani, who was struck off the nursing register in 2021 because of her beliefs, for their sister's death.

Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani told the BBC: “My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have.”

Paloma began to have chest pains and breathing difficulties not long after graduating in 2023. 

On 22 December Paloma and her then-boyfriend Ander Harris went to Maidstone Hospital where doctors diagnosed her with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Medics told her she had an 80 per cent chance of recovering from the cancer, which can cause death if left untreated, if she undertook chemotherapy. 

Kate Shemirani texted Ander to say he should tell his partner to refuse chemotherapy or any treatment, according to the BBC. 

Paloma also contacted Patrick Vickers, a former partner of her mother who is also an alternative health practitioner. 

He told Paloma the 80 per cent chance of survival was “exaggerated”, and encouraged her to instead begin Gerson therapy, which involves a strict vegan diet, along with juices, supplements and coffee enemas. 

He said she should consider chemotherapy if her symptoms did not improve after six weeks.

Paloma decided to go ahead with Gerson therapy during her hospital stay. 

“Paloma's strategy was to appease, to be sweet, to try and win the love that she hadn't been granted earlier,” Sebastian said. 

Chantelle, a school friend, told the broadcaster: “I don't think her ideology was strong enough to make those decisions. People have different opinions about these things, but I think her mum played a massive, massive role into it.”

Kate Shemirani has not responded directly to the allegations in the BBC Panorama programme. 

She and her ex-husband, Paloma's father Faramarz Shemirani, wrote to the broadcaster to say they have evidence “Paloma died as a result of medical interventions given without confirmed diagnosis or lawful consent”.

Mr Vickers denies playing a role in Paloma's death, telling the broadcaster its claims “are legally inaccurate”.

Kate Shemirani was an NHS nurse in the 1980s and calls herself “the Natural Nurse” on social media.

She rose to online prominence during the pandemic, where she claimed Covid was a hoax and that vaccines were part of a plan to kill many people. 

In some posts she claims treating cancer with chemotherapy is “ill-informed” and akin to pouring mustard gas into people's veins. 

She sells apricot kernels for their “potential health benefits” along with nutritional supplements, and offers information and advice on her website. 

She charges around £70 for an annual membership to her site, while patients - including those with cancer - pay £195 for a consultation and personalised 12-week programme.

Gabriel was not told of his sister's death and found out in a phone call with his lawyer. 

He had begun a legal case before his sister died because he wanted an assessment of whether she was receiving appropriate medical treatment to be carried out. 

Gabriel had to inform his brother of the news. 

“It's like being burnt alive and you feel the searing pain every time it comes out of your mouth,” Gabriel says.

Sebastian says he blamed himself. “I haven't come to terms with that at all,” he says.

An inquest into Paloma's death will begin next month.
