                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly seven months after the fatal shooting of an insurance CEO in New York drew widespread attention to health insurers' practice of denying or delaying doctor-ordered care, the largest U.S. insurers agreed Monday to streamline their often cumbersome preapproval system. Dozens of insurance companies, including Cigna, Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare, agreed to several measures, which include making fewer medical procedures subject to prior authorization and speeding up the review process. Insurers also pledged to use clear language when communicating with patients and promised that medical professionals would review coverage denials. "The pledge is not a mandate," Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said during a news conference. "This is an opportunity for the industry to show itself." Oz said he wants insurers to eliminate preapprovals for knee arthroscopy, a common, minimally invasive procedure to diagnose and treat knee problems. Chris Klomp, director of the Center for Medicare at CMS, recommended prior authorization be eliminated for vaginal deliveries, colonoscopies, and cataract surgeries, among other procedures. Health insurers said the changes would benefit most Americans, including those with commercial or private coverage, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care. The insurers have also agreed that patients who switch insurance plans may continue receiving treatment or other health care services for 90 days without facing immediate prior authorization requirements imposed by their new insurer. But health policy analysts say prior authorization — a system that forces some people to delay care or abandon treatment — may continue to pose serious health consequences for affected patients. That said, many people may not notice a difference, even if insurers follow through on their new commitments. "So much of the prior authorization process is behind the black box," said Kaye Pestaina, director of the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. "I'm not sure how this changes that," Pestaina said. Oz acknowledged "violence in the streets" prompted Monday's announcement. Health insurance CEOs now move with security details wherever they go, Klomp said. "There's no question that health insurers have a reputation problem," said Robert Hartwig, an insurance expert and a clinical associate professor at the University of South Carolina. But government interventions to improve prior authorization will be used "if we're forced to use them," Oz said during the news conference. Health insurers will still be allowed to deny doctor-recommended care, which is arguably the biggest criticism that patients and providers level against insurance companies. Most states have already passed at least one law imposing requirements on insurers, often intended to reduce the time patients spend waiting for answers from their insurance company and to require transparency from insurers about which prescriptions and procedures require preapproval. Some states have also enacted "gold card" programs for doctors that allow physicians with a robust record of prior authorization approvals to bypass the requirements. Nationally, rules proposed by the first Trump administration and finalized by the Biden administration are already set to take effect next year. Those rules apply only to certain categories of insurance, including Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Beyond that, some insurance companies committed to improvement long before Monday's announcement. Earlier this year, UnitedHealthcare pledged to reduce prior authorization volume by 10%. Cigna announced its own set of improvements in February. Insurance companies are already supposed to be doing some of these things. For example, the Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to communicate with patients in plain language about health plan benefits and coverage. But denial letters remain confusing because companies tend to use jargon. Insurers also pledged that medical professionals would continue to review prior authorization denials. AHIP claims this is "a standard already in place." Health insurers issue millions of denials every year, though most prior authorization requests are quickly, sometimes even instantly, approved. The use of AI in making prior authorization decisions isn't new — and it will probably continue to ramp up, with insurers pledging Monday to issue 80% of prior authorization decisions "in real-time" by 2027. "Artificial intelligence should help this tremendously," Rep. Gregory Murphy (R-N.C.), a physician, said during the news conference. Results from a survey published by the American Medical Association in February indicated 61% of physicians are concerned that the use of AI by insurance companies is already increasing denials. Oz said CMS will post a full list of participating insurers this summer, while other details will become public by January. He said insurers have agreed to post data about their use of prior authorization on a public dashboard, but it isn't clear when that platform will be unveiled. He did not name specific targets, indicate how they will be made public, or specify how the government would enforce them. He noted that health insurers made "past promises" to improve prior authorization in 2018. Meanwhile, it also remains unclear what services insurers will ultimately agree to release from prior authorization requirements. Patient advocates are in the process of identifying "low-value codes," Oz said, that should not require preapproval, but it is unknown when those codes will be made public or when insurers will agree to release them from prior authorization rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) include targets for safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), which are critical in preventing cholera, a persistent health threat in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) launched a global strategy titled Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030, which aims to reduce cholera-related deaths by 90% and eliminate cholera in up to 20 countries by 2030. However, the effect of disparities in WASH access on the unequal cholera burden across geographic regions remains poorly understood. In a new study published in the KeAi journal Global Transitions, a team of Chinese researchers evaluated the impact of WASH access on cholera and the unequal burden across 89 low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017 under the UNSDG framework. Evaluating the impact and attributable burden of WASH on cholera can help cholera-affected areas formulate targeted control strategies tailored to the specific conditions of each country, as outlined in the GTFCC's Global Roadmap." Wanqi Wen, first author of the study from Sun Yat-sen University Notably, the proportions of piped water and sewer/septic sanitation negatively relate to cholera, while harmful effects on cholera were noted for proportions of surface water and open defecation. Corresponding author Hualiang Lin, also from Sun Yat-sen University, emphasized that this research highlights the need for maintaining and increasing access to safe WASH in cholera-affected countries. "Regional disparities in WASH access further contributed to unequal cholera burden. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 25.77 % of cholera were attributed to the high proportion of unimproved drinking water, much higher than 9.09 % in Northern Africa and Western Asia," explains Lin. "Our findings offer comprehensive information for implementing targeted, local-level control approaches to end cholera globally." The authors also emphasize that their estimates of WASH-related prevention fractions offer actionable reference points for countries implementing UN SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and the GTFCC's 2030 Roadmap. "Achieving universal access to improved sanitation could reduce cholera risk by 32.98 % in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 7.47 % in Central and Southern Asia," says Lin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite medical advances, infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses are still among the most common causes of death worldwide. What role could fructose play in such diseases? A research group led by Ina Bergheim from the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Vienna has now been able to prove for the first time that monocytes, important immune cells in the blood, react more strongly to bacterial toxins after fructose consumption - but not in a positive way. Specifically, the concentration of receptors for certain bacterial toxins increases, making the body more susceptible to inflammation. In addition, they conducted experiments with isolated monocytes and cell culture models to investigate the molecular mechanisms. Toll-like receptor 2 regulates the immune response, among other things. The higher concentration was accompanied by an increased sensitivity of the monocytes to lipoteichoic acid, a bacterial toxin. Ina Bergheim, study leader, University of Vienna Specifically, pro-inflammatory messengers such as interleukin-6, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were increasingly released. "These findings make an important contribution to understanding how individual food components and fructose in particular can influence the immune system," says Bergheim. "They indicate that even short-term, high fructose consumption in healthy people can influence the immune system and increase inflammation." Future studies should clarify the long-term effects of chronically increased fructose consumption on the immune system and susceptibility to infection, particularly in risk groups with, for example, type II diabetes mellitus or fatty liver disease, which is associated with metabolic dysfunction. "Sugar, especially the fructose in sugary drinks and sweets, has long been suspected of increasing the risk of developing metabolic diseases - this needs to be investigated," says Bergheim. Fructose intake enhances lipoteichoic acid-mediated immune response in monocytes of healthy humans. Explore the latest tools that boost speed and accuracy in B-cell cloning processes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis identifies a possible way to slow or block progression of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in people over age 50. The WashU Medicine researchers and their international collaborators implicated problems with cholesterol metabolism in this type of vision loss, perhaps helping to explain the links between macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease, which both worsen with age. The new findings - identified using human plasma samples and mouse models of macular degeneration - suggest that increasing the amount of a molecule called apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the blood fixes problems in cholesterol processing that lead to cellular damage in the eyes and other organs. Various methods of dialing up ApoM could serve as new treatment strategies for age-related macular degeneration and perhaps some forms of heart failure triggered by similar dysfunctional cholesterol processing. Our findings suggest that developing treatments that increase ApoM levels could treat or even prevent the disease and therefore preserve people's vision as they age." Rajendra S. Apte, MD, PhD, senior author, the Paul A. Cibis Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at WashU Medicine In macular degeneration, doctors can see cholesterol-rich deposits under the retina during an eye exam, according to Apte. Dry macular degeneration can turn into "wet" macular degeneration, in which abnormal blood vessel growth damages vision. Geographic atrophy and wet macular degeneration are advanced forms of the disease that are accompanied by vision loss. Although some approved therapies for advanced disease are available, the disease process itself is not reversible at that stage. In recent years, evidence has emerged that ApoM can serve as a protective molecule with known anti-inflammatory effects and roles in maintaining healthy cholesterol metabolism. With that in mind, Apte and co-senior author Ali Javaheri, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, were interested assessing whether reduced ApoM levels, which fall with age, could be involved in the dysfunctional cholesterol metabolism that is at the root of multiple diseases of aging, including macular degeneration and heart disease. They showed that patients with macular degeneration have reduced levels of ApoM circulating in the blood compared with healthy controls. And past work by Javaheri, a WashU Medicine cardiologist, showed that patients with various forms of heart failure also had reduced levels of ApoM in the blood. Apte and Javaheri's research suggests that when ApoM is low, cells in the retina and heart muscle can't correctly metabolize cholesterol deposits and have a hard time getting rid of these accumulating lipids. When these lipids build up, it leads to inflammation and cellular damage. To see if they could reverse the harmful effects of low ApoM, the researchers increased ApoM levels in mouse models of macular degeneration, using genetic modification or plasma transfer from other mice. The researchers further found evidence that ApoM triggers a signaling pathway that breaks down the cholesterol in cellular compartments called lysosomes, which are known for playing important roles in disposing of cellular waste. Apte and Javaheri are working with Mobius Scientific, a WashU startup company that is working to harness this knowledge of the role of ApoM in macular degeneration to develop new approaches to treating or preventing the disease. Apte and Javaheri worked with WashU's Office of Technology Management (OTM) to launch Mobius Scientific in 2022. The findings also could have implications for future interventions that raise ApoM in patients with heart failure. "One of the exciting things about this collaboration is realizing the links between retinal pigment epithelial cells and heart muscle cell, which are both vulnerable to low ApoM," Javeheri said. We look forward to exploring strategies to increase ApoM in ways that could help the eye and the heart maintain healthy cholesterol metabolism over time and stave off two major diseases of aging."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New data published in The Journal of Immunology, reveal that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy improved overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with CRC. Patients who received CIK cell therapy with chemotherapy or surgery showed improved outcomes regardless of whether they had early or advanced stages. "For advanced colorectal cancer, the prognosis has been rather pessimistic, and patients at stages II-III face a relatively high risk of recurrence and metastasis following surgery, with limited treatment options for these patients. Despite the positive outcomes of CIK cell therapy, some patients do not respond to the treatment. Researchers analyzed blood samples from patients to determine whether any biomarkers could predict who would respond well to CIK cell therapy. They found that CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels in a patient's blood could indicate whether they would benefit from CIK cell therapy. CEA is expressed in some CRC patients who undergo surgery and is considered an indicator of poor prognosis and disease recurrence. These results could pave the way for a simple blood test administered before treatment, which could improve patient survival. The long-term effects of CIK cell therapy for CRC patients had not been understood until now. The promising results of our study will hopefully facilitate the widespread adoption of cell therapies for treating malignant tumors, including CRC." This retrospective study followed two groups of patients after they received treatment. The CIK group that received CIK cell therapy with chemotherapy or surgery and the control group that received chemotherapy and/or surgery. Comparing the results of progression-free survival and overall survival within the CIK group, researchers investigated different biomarkers in patients' blood that may be most relevant to predicting survival. The researchers plan to continue this work by investigating the effects of combining CIK therapy with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in the treatment of CRC and by conducting prospective clinical studies to establish CIK cell therapy as a treatment for CRC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine have found that semaglutide, a popular diabetes and weight-loss drug, may lower the risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Dementia, a condition that slowly makes it harder for people to remember things and think clearly, occurs when brain cells are damaged and their connections stop working properly. This damage, which worsens over time, can be caused by various modifiable factors, including obesity, T2D, cardiovascular diseases, traumatic brain injury and stroke. According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 6 million people in the United States are diagnosed with dementia, and it causes more than 100,000 deaths each year. Encouragingly, research indicates that 45% of dementia cases could be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors. The study, published today in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (DOI 10.1177/13872877251351329), suggests T2D patients taking semaglutide had a significantly lower risk of developing dementia compared to other antidiabetic medications. These results were more profound in women and older adults. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLP-1R) molecule that decreases hunger and helps regulate blood sugar in T2D, is also the active component in the diabetes and weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Semaglutide has shown a broad range of benefits, including reductions in cardiovascular diseases. The research team-led by biomedical informatics professor Rong Xu-analyzed three years of electronic records of nearly 1.7 million T2D patients nationally. They found patients prescribed semaglutide had a significantly lower risk for Alzheimer's disease-related dementia, compared to those who had taken any of seven other anti-diabetic medications, including other types of GLP-1R-targeting medications. "There is no cure or effective treatment for dementia, so this new study provides real-world evidence for its potential impact on preventing or slowing dementia development among at-high risk population," said Xu, who also directs the School of Medicine's Center for AI in Drug Discovery and is a member of the Cancer Genomics Epigenomics Program at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our results indicate that research into semaglutide's use for dementia prevention will need to be further investigated through randomized clinical trials."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic state attorneys general led by those from California, New York, and Massachusetts are pressuring medical professional groups to defend reproductive rights, including medication abortion, emergency abortions, and travel between states for health care in response to recent increases in the number of abortion bans. The American Medical Association adopted a formal position June 9 recommending that medical certification exams be moved out of states with restrictive abortion policies or made virtual, after 20 attorneys general petitioned to protect physicians who fear legal repercussions because of their work. "It seems incremental, but there are so many things that go into expanding and maintaining access to care," said Arneta Rogers, executive director of the Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice at the University of California-Berkeley's law school. Since the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022, 16 states, including Texas, have implemented laws banning abortion almost entirely, and many of them impose criminal penalties on providers as well as options to sue doctors. That's raised concern among some physicians who fear being charged if they go to those states, even if their home state offers protection to provide reproductive and gender-affirming health care. Pointing to the recent fining and indictment of a physician in New York who allegedly provided abortion pills to a woman in Texas and a teen in Louisiana, a coalition of physicians wrote in a letter to the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology that “the limits of shield laws are tenuous" and that "Texas laws can affect physicians practicing outside of the state as well." The campaign was launched by several Democratic attorneys general, including Rob Bonta of California, Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, and Letitia James of New York, who each have established a reproductive rights unit as a bulwark for their state following the Dobbs decision. "Reproductive health care and gender-affirming care providers should not have to risk their safety or freedom just to advance in their medical careers," James said in a statement. "Forcing providers to travel to states that have declared war on reproductive freedom and LGBTQ+ rights is as unnecessary as it is dangerous." In their petition, the attorneys general included a letter from Joseph Ottolenghi, medical director at Choices Women's Medical Center in New York City, who was denied his request to take the test remotely or outside of Texas. To be certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, physicians need to take the in-person exam at its testing facility in Dallas. The board completed construction of its new testing facility last year. "As a New York practitioner, I have made every effort not to violate any other state's laws, but the outer contours of these draconian laws have not been tested or clarified by the courts," Ottolenghi wrote. Rachel Rebouché, the dean of Temple University's law school and a reproductive law scholar, said "putting the heft" of the attorneys general behind this effort helps build awareness and a "public reckoning" on behalf of providers. Separately, some doctors have urged medical conferences to boycott states with abortion bans. Donna Harrison, an OB-GYN and the director of research at the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, described the petition as an "attack not only on pro-life states but also on life-affirming medical professionals." Harrison said the "OB-GYN community consists of physicians with values that are as diverse as our nation's state abortion laws," and that this diversity "fosters a medical environment of debate and rigorous thought leading to advancements that ultimately serve our patients." The AMA's new policy urges specialty medical boards to host exams in states without restrictive abortion laws, offer the tests remotely, or provide exemptions for physicians. There is no deadline for a decision to be made. And it noted that its exam dates are kept under wraps, and that there have been "no incidents of harm to candidates or examiners across thousands of in-person examinations." Democratic state prosecutors, however, warned in their petition that the "web of confusing and punitive state-based restrictions creates a legal minefield for medical providers." Texas is among the states that have banned doctors from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth, and it has reportedly made efforts to get records from medical facilities and professionals in other states who may have provided that type of care to Texans. The Texas attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment. States such as California and New York have laws to block doctors from being extradited under other states' laws and to prevent sharing evidence against them. But instances that require leveraging these laws could still mean lengthy legal proceedings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An article published in the journal Nature Metabolism presents an experimental drug that stimulates adipose tissue cells to produce heat through a process known as thermogenesis, thereby promoting weight loss. In animal tests, the compound prevented fat accumulation in response to a high-fat diet, treated existing obesity, and reversed associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance. Preliminary results from clinical research indicate that the substance is safe and may have beneficial metabolic effects on humans. But this result isn't conclusive because it was a small group, and the objective was to assess whether the compound is safe and well tolerated. We intend to start phase 2 of the study later this year, which is designed to test its effectiveness in treating obesity." The experimental drug, currently called SANA (short for "salicylate-based nitroalkene"), is a derivative of salicylate, a chemical compound with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties found naturally in plants and used to make drugs such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). However, we observed that instead of protecting against inflammation, the molecule we synthesized protects against diet-induced obesity," says the researcher. Two different models were used to test this effect in animals. In the first model, SANA was administered to mice alongside a high-fat diet, which prevented any weight gain. After three weeks, the mice had lost 20% of their body mass. There was also a reduction in blood sugar, improved insulin sensitivity, and a decrease in fat accumulated in the liver (a condition known as hepatic steatosis for which there is still no effective pharmacological treatment). Nine Brazilian researchers collaborated on this task: Marcelo Mori, Pedro Vieira and Larissa Menezes dos Reis from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP); William Festuccia and Luiz Osório Leiria from the University of São Paulo (USP); and Juliana Camacho-Pereira, Marina Santo Chichierchio, Gabriele Barbosa, and Leonardo de Souza from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). This stage was supported by FAPESP through three projects (20/04159-8, 21/08354-2 and 22/11234-1). The experiments showed that SANA specifically targets adipose tissue, activating thermogenesis through an unconventional mechanism. It can therefore be considered the first in a new class of anti-obesity drugs. As the authors explain, thermogenesis is typically mediated by a protein called UCP1, which is found within mitochondria (the organelles that generate energy for cells). UCP1 is activated in certain situations, such as exposure to cold. This causes the energy generated by cellular respiration to dissipate as heat. However, this is not the case with SANA. The new drug causes adipocytes to use creatine, a compound formed by three amino acids (arginine, glycine, and methionine), as an energy source to produce heat without involving the UCP1 protein. "We conducted tests with UCP1-deficient mice [genetically modified to not express the protein] and proved that SANA activates thermogenesis in these animals, even in the absence of UCP1 and under thermoneutral conditions, that is, without exposure to cold," says William Festuccia, a professor at the Biomedical Sciences Institute at USP. According to the researcher, the observed impact on body temperature is small and does not pose a significant health risk. In experiments coordinated by Marcelo Mori at the Institute of Biology at UNICAMP, it was confirmed that SANA acts on enzymes involved in the so-called "creatine futile cycle," a thermogenic mechanism in which the amino acid compound is repeatedly converted into phosphocreatine and back into creatine, consuming ATP and releasing energy as heat. "The fact that it's a small molecule and acts through a totally different mechanism allows SANA to be combined with other substances already used in the treatment of obesity, such as GLP-1 analogs [semaglutide and similar]," says Mori. "When we reduce food intake, our body tends to slow down its metabolism. To avoid this plateau effect, it'd be interesting to combine a molecule that inhibits appetite with another that promotes caloric expenditure." Mori adds that although GLP-1 analogs are effective in combating obesity and controlling blood sugar, they also tend to promote lean mass loss, which is particularly problematic for the elderly. "That's why it's important to have alternatives," he concludes. A nitroalkene derivative of salicylate, SANA, induces creatine-dependent thermogenesis and promotes weight loss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new clinical trial found that taking a popular diabetes and weight-loss drug once weekly significantly improves blood sugar and leads to substantial weight loss in adults with Type 1 diabetes who use automated insulin delivery systems. Semaglutide is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor agonists. Sold under the trade names such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus, the drug was initially developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, helping to manage blood sugar levels. The 26-week, double-blind study involved 72 participants across four medical centers, including Oregon Health & Science University. Researchers found that 36% of patients taking semaglutide met all three key health goals - improved blood glucose levels, reduced time spent in low blood sugar and at least 5% weight loss - compared to none in the placebo group. Andrew Ahmann, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University's School of Medicine, and co-author on the study Those on semaglutide lost an average of about 18.5 pounds over six months in the study and saw modest improvements in average blood sugar levels (A1C) and the amount of time blood sugar stays in a healthy range, without a higher risk of dangerous low blood sugar or serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis. While semaglutide is already approved for Type 2 diabetes and obesity, its use in Type 1 diabetes remains investigational. This is the first randomized clinical trial to show that the medication may also be effective in Type 1 diabetes in patients already using automated insulin delivery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that what men eat, especially a Mediterranean diet or ultra-processed foods, can make a real difference to sperm quality and fertility potential. Role of Mediterranean Diet and Ultra-Processed Foods on Sperm Parameters: Data from a Cross-Sectional Study. In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers in Italy evaluated the role of the Mediterranean diet (MD) and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) on sperm parameters. Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after one year of regular, unprotected sex. It affects 15% to 25% of couples, or around 186 million individuals worldwide. Lifestyle factors could negatively affect sperm parameters and overall reproductive health. Adherence to healthy diets, including MD, is associated with improved seminal parameters. However, the associations between male fertility and UPFs are less well-defined. The optimal intake of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, particularly from food sources, plays a vital role in spermatogenesis. However, UPFs are industrially produced and contain ingredients not found in natural foods (e.g., additives, refined sugars). As such, UPFs lack essential vitamins, fiber, and minerals. Increasing literature also links UPF consumption to elevated risks of non-communicable diseases and cancer. Importantly, while adherence to the MD has been linked to better semen parameters and reproductive capacity, high UPF intake may negatively affect sperm quality. Participants were males aged 18–60 attending an Italian Hospital for semen analysis between September 2022 and April 2024. Further, plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and testosterone were measured. UPF intake was assessed using the 24-hour Food Recall Questionnaire. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine differences between continuous variables, whereas Fisher's exact or chi-squared test was used for discrete variables. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlations between variables. Further, multivariate analyses compared semen parameters strongly associated with UPF intake and MEDAS scores. The study also excluded individuals with conditions or behaviors known to affect fertility, such as those taking certain medications, those with chronic illnesses, or those engaging in high levels of physical activity (more than 3 hours per week). Representative scheme summarizing the possible mechanistic influences of dietary patterns on spermatogenesis. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) likely has a direct positive effect on the different cell populations of the seminiferous tubules due to its composition rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and oligo-elements. In parallel, MD may positively influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by enhancing testis sensitivity to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or by reducing negative feedback at the central level. Ultra-processed food intake negatively influences testis function, both because it is inversely related to MD adherence and due to the reduced content of protective factors. MEDAS scores had a significant positive correlation with seminal parameters and a negative correlation with percentage of calories from UPFs (%Kal-UP) and serum LH and FSH levels. Conversely, %Kal-UP was negatively correlated with all seminal parameters. The MEDAS score and %Kal-UP were not associated with BMI or age, and the correlations between MEDAS or %Kal-UP and semen parameters remained significant after controlling for BMI and age, indicating that these associations are independent of these confounders. Meanwhile, FSH levels were lower in individuals with moderate or high MD adherence compared to those with low adherence. Testosterone and SHBG levels did not differ significantly across MD adherence categories. Since discrete categories of UPFs were unavailable, an unbiased stratification was performed by increasing quartiles of %Kal-UP (Q1–Q4). Notably, individuals in the low MD adherence category and those in Q4 of %Kal-UP exhibited significantly lower values of sperm parameters compared to those in the high adherence category and Q1 of %Kal-UP. Furthermore, participants were stratified into two categories based on FSH levels: normal (<8 IU/mL) and high (>8 IU/mL) for the multivariate analysis. A significant increase in total sperm count and concentration was noted with higher MD adherence, but only in individuals with normal FSH levels. Moderate and high MD adherence categories were associated with a significantly lower risk of low sperm count. On the other hand, Q3 and Q4 of %Kal-UP were associated with a significantly higher risk of total sperm count < 39 million per ejaculate. However, when high FSH levels (≥8 IU/mL, indicative of primary testicular impairment) were included in the analysis, FSH emerged as the dominant predictor of reduced sperm count, and dietary associations became less pronounced. Additionally, UPF intake was estimated from a single 24-hour recall, which can introduce error, and hormonal data were available only for a subset of participants. As a result, findings should be interpreted with caution and validated by further research. The findings underscored an interplay between plasma FSH levels, MD adherence, UPF intake, and seminal parameters. With high FSH levels, reflecting primary testicular impairment, the dietary pattern had mild or null associations with seminal parameters. Likewise, UPF intake had fewer associations with sperm parameters. In contrast, with normal FSH, suggestive of preserved testicular function, greater MD adherence was associated with a better seminal profile, while UPF intake showed an opposite association. These findings support the role of dietary interventions as potential modifiable risk factors for managing male infertility, particularly in men with preserved testicular function.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women who experience complications during pregnancy face a higher risk of stroke in the following decades according to research published in the European Heart Journal today (Tuesday). The study, which included data on more than two million women over more than 40 years, found an increased risk for women who had diabetes or high blood pressure while pregnant, a preterm delivery or a baby with a low birth weight. Researchers say these common pregnancy complications could act as an early signal for cardiovascular problems in the future, meaning women could receive help early in life to lower their risk of stroke. A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, starving brain cells of oxygen and leading to possible cognitive and physical disabilities. He said: "We know that pregnancy is a 'natural stress test' that may reveal higher cardiovascular disease risks long before cardiovascular disease actually develops. However, the long-term cardiovascular risks for these women remain poorly understood and so are often not considered in their routine clinical care." The researchers used data from a Swedish national cohort of all 2,201,393 singleton pregnancies between 1973 and 2015. Around 30% of the women (667,774) experienced at least one of the following complications: preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks), a baby born small for their gestational age (among the smallest 10%), high blood pressure during pregnancy including preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure) and pregnancy diabetes (high blood sugar). The risk of stroke was almost doubled for women who had high blood pressure (not preeclampsia) or high blood sugar during pregnancy. Risks were even greater in women who experienced two or more of these complications. However, for women who had pregnancy diabetes, the increased risk became even higher over time. These pregnancy complications share some common features, including placental abnormalities and inflammation, that may potentially affect the structure or function of small blood vessels. Those changes in the small blood vessels sometimes progress further after pregnancy, and this could be one factor in the women's higher risk of stroke. Both women and their doctors should now recognise that pregnancy complications are an early signal for future stroke risk. This can help us identify high-risk women long before they suffer a stroke or other cardiovascular disease. Women who experience these complications need support to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Professor Casey Crump, Department of Family & Community Medicine, UTHealth Houston In an accompanying editorial Dr. Abbi Lane from the University of Michigan, USA, said: "Stroke is a major cause of death and disability that may be preceded by distinct risk factors in women vs. men. The study presented in this issue of European Heart Journal by Crump and colleagues addressed this critical need by rigorously defining the associations between adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and stroke. APOs were not rare; 30% of women had experienced at least one APO. All APOs were significantly associated with stroke over 46 years of follow-up […]. "Perhaps more attention should be paid to the psychological and emotional toll associated with APOs. responses to stress that are also early events in the development of overt stroke risk factors. […] High stress is linked to unfavourable effects on lifestyle and coping behaviours, including smoking, worse medication adherence, poor diet, low physical activity, and higher body weight. "Interrupting the cascade from APO to stroke might involve a multifaceted approach to control blood pressure and address modifiable lifestyle habits that influence physical and mental health soon after APOs. "As APOs occur in ∼30% of parous people and stroke is ∼90% preventable, implementing a multicomponent, preventive intervention aimed at modifiable stroke risk factors soon after delivery seems like an obvious win."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Endoscopies could be replaced by far less invasive capsule sponge tests for half of all patients with Barrett's esophagus, a known precursor to esophageal cancer, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital and Queen Mary University of London. The capsule sponge test is easier to administer and could be carried out by nurses and at GP practices, reducing the burden on NHS resources. Esophageal cancer is difficult to treat, with fewer than one in five patients surviving for five or more years following diagnosis, a figure that has barely changed over the past three decades. At first, these cells change to resemble those in the lining of the intestines, but over time they can change to a pre-cancerous state known as dysplasia. Patients with low-grade dysplasia have around a one in 10 chance of developing esophageal cancer, but this risk doubles to one in five for high-grade dysplasia. Dysplasia can be treated without surgery, and treatment greatly reduces the risk of future cancer. Barrett's esophagus is usually diagnosed after a patient reports symptoms such as persistent heartburn and receives an endoscopy, an invasive procedure that involves passing a camera down into the stomach. However, there are long waiting times for initial endoscopy investigations on the NHS. Patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus will be monitored to look for dysplasia or early cancer, undergoing regular endoscopies – often 10 or more over their lifetime. Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, Director of the Early Cancer Institute at the University of Cambridge and honorary consultant gastroenterologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital, who specializes in Barrett's esophagus, said: "It's extremely important to monitor patients so that we can catch the dysplasia and prevent it developing to cancer – and if someone is unfortunate enough to develop cancer, we can catch it early and treat it. What we need is an alternative surveillance method that's less invasive, easier to administer and more reliable." Pathologists look for two key markers – 'red flags' that suggest the cells are pre-cancerous. These are: abnormalities in a protein (known as p53) that helps to prevent tumours developing; and cells that appear abnormal or irregular when examined under a microscope ('atypia'). But now, Professor Fitzgerald and her team have turned their attention to monitoring it more effectively with this device. In research published today in The Lancet, Professor Fitzgerald and colleagues looked at whether it was possible to use the capsule sponge to stratify patients with Barrett's esophagus according to their risk and use this information to determine how they are monitored. Those at highest risk would be seen urgently to see if they need treatment and those at moderate risk would continue to receive endoscopies, but those at lowest risk could continue to be monitored without the need for another endoscopy. The team recruited 910 patients from 13 hospitals across the UK, all of whom had been diagnosed previously with Barrett's esophagus, and who were undergoing surveillance. Around 15% of patients were classed as high risk, meaning that they had abnormal p53 and/or atypia. 38% of these patients were found to be at a pre-cancerous stage. Patients with neither of the two markers, but whose Barrett's esophagus was over a certain length and who met other risk factors related to age and sex, were classed as moderate risk. Over half of the patients (54%) were classed as low risk. These were patients who had neither of the two markers and did not meet other risk factors related to age and sex. Endoscopy revealed that just two of these 495 patients – 0.4% - had a high-grade dysplasia that needed follow-up (and there were no cancers). Our findings suggest that the capsule sponge could help stratify patients with Barrett's esophagus by risk and that half of them will fall into the low-risk group. Given that the risk of these individuals progressing to dysplasia and then to esophageal cancer is so low, it should be safe to replace their usual endoscopy with the capsule sponge." First author Dr W. Keith Tan, Honorary Registrar in Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Addenbrooke's Hospital said: "Our ability to identify patients at low versus high risk using the capsule sponge – which may be as accurate as the current gold standard, endoscopy – is a great step forward. The capsule sponge can be administered easily and quickly by nurses with only limited training required and will not need to take up precious endoscopy resources, which may be better for patients and more cost-effective for the NHS." Professor Fitzgerald, who is also a Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge added: "We are very excited by these results, which could lead to a test that is much more accessible and less operator dependent to improve standards for monitoring for patients with Barrett's across the NHS and beyond." The study was supported by Cancer Research UK, Innovate UK, NHS England Cancer Alliance, and Medical Research Council, with infrastructure support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre. Chief Executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell, said: "Survival rates for esophageal cancer have remained unacceptably low for decades, with fewer than 20% of patients surviving for five or more years after diagnosis. Early detection is vital if we are to change this grim statistic. "The Cancer Research UK–backed capsule sponge represents one of the most promising breakthroughs in early detection we have seen to date. These new findings bring us closer to transforming the way we diagnose and ultimately treat this disease. If adopted widely, this innovative approach could spare significant numbers of people from discomfort and invasive endoscopies. Duncan Cook, aged 57, a plumbing and heating engineer from Cambridge, participated in the research. For almost 20 years, Duncan has had regular endoscopies to monitor his Barrett's esophagus. "I have a busy job and being able to have the sponge instead of an endoscopy would be much easier and save a lot of time. The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, set to be built on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, will bring together clinical excellence from Addenbrooke's Hospital and world-leading researchers at the University of Cambridge, including Professor Fitzgerald's work, under one roof in a new NHS hospital. It will enable the development and discovery of more non-invasive devices like the capsule sponge, to detect cancer earlier, and save more lives. Tan, W. K., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As experts sound the alarm over Avian Intestinal Spirochaetosis, new research reveals growing risks to global food security and why protecting both animal and human health has never been more urgent. Review: Avian intestinal spirochaetosis: an emerging zoonosis. In a recent review in the journal Animal Diseases, researchers collated and discussed nearly 100 prior publications to enhance our understanding of Avian Intestinal Spirochaetosis (AIS), a disease primarily affecting poultry but caused by Brachyspira species that also infect swine. Stealthy invasion: Brachyspira drills through intestinal mucus using corkscrew-like motion and whip-like flagella, then anchors between gut cells to create a destructive "false brush border" that blocks nutrient absorption. While AIS specifically refers to avian infection, other Brachyspira species are responsible for related diseases in swine. Alarmingly, recent reports have sparked growing concern over AIS's zoonotic (human-infecting) potential, with scientific awareness of zoonotic potential increasing rather than a documented surge in cases and ongoing research into its public health implications. There is currently no commercially available vaccine or standardized treatment for the disease, and standard antibiotic therapies are facing growing limitations due to resistance and regulatory restrictions. This review synthesizes traditional and cutting-edge research on AIS, focusing on its causes, diagnosis, transmission, and treatment options. It finally identifies gaps in the literature and ongoing research (including a recombinant vaccine candidate tested in layer chickens) that may help nip AIS in the bud, thereby preventing the next significant global zoonotic outbreak. Dietary weak spot: Layer hens fed wheat-based diets showed 30% higher B. intermedia colonization than those eating sorghum or barley—revealing farm feed choices directly impact vulnerability. The growing global demand for meat-based food products has had an unintended, yet scary, consequence – a surge in gastrointestinal diseases among livestock, especially birds. Larger poultry farms and higher densities have been shown to increase the frequency of disease transmission, resulting in outbreaks that rapidly spread across adjoining farms. Less prevalent than their respiratory counterparts, some gastrointestinal diseases, such as Avian Intestinal Spirochaetosis (AIS), are highly disruptive, with outbreaks causing devastating economic loss (~£18 million annually in the UK alone). AIS is a chronic bacterial infection in poultry (particularly in layer and breeder hens) caused by the colonization of the host's lower gastrointestinal tract, especially the caeca and colon, by Brachyspira spp. AIS results in chronic diarrhea, poor egg quality, delayed laying turnaround, weight loss, and increased mortality, particularly in layer and broiler breeder hens. Despite these impacts and the growing global burden of AIS, the disease and its causative agents (mainly these three Brachyspira species in birds) remain underreported and poorly understood. Hidden human damage: Infected people's gut biopsies show spirochetes clinging to colon cells like "fringes," often with telltale eosinophil surges and distinct "pseudoappendicitis" symptoms that mimic other bowel diseases. Transmission vectors include not only direct contact but also wild birds and rodents, which play a significant role in disease spread and pose biosecurity challenges. Significantly, humans can also contract Brachyspira infections through close contact with, or the consumption of, infected meat. The resultant colonic spirochaetosis is characterized by a range of gastrointestinal symptoms, most often chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rectal bleeding, and sometimes weight loss. Many cases are asymptomatic, but the risk is higher among immunocompromised individuals or those in environments with poor hygiene. Severe outcomes, including ulcerative colitis, invasive spirochetemia, and rarely death, are also reported, particularly in vulnerable populations. Disease diagnosis relies on traditional microbiology or newer molecular (genetic sequencing) techniques. Unfortunately, recent bans on antibiotic use in poultry rearing and the rising drug resistance in AIS strains hinder treatments, exacerbating disease spread and necessitating a better understanding of its epidemiology. Mechanism of in vivo intestinal colonization by Brachyspira spp Kitchen-counter fighters: Olive oil waste ("alperujo") fermented into feed cut chicken infections by half in trials, while cinnamon extract (cinnamaldehyde) blocked Brachyspira growth in lab tests—offering pantry-shelf alternatives to antibiotics. The present review aims to synthesize and elucidate current scientific knowledge on AIS by collating outcomes from over 95 publications across four scientific repositories (Google Scholar, PubMed Central, PubMed, and CAS) to unravel the disease's epidemiology, human and veterinary impacts, thereby informing future research efforts and policy reform. The present review identifies and highlights several key points regarding Brachyspira spp. Overall, the review highlights AIS as a rising economic, agricultural, and public health threat. AIS is emerging as a significant veterinary and zoonotic issue. The ongoing global intensification of poultry farming, alongside recent antibiotic restrictions, has increased disease risk and transmission potential. While conventional diagnostics and antibiotic therapies have limitations, advances in molecular detection, probiotic interventions, and a new recombinant vaccine offer hope. However, further field validation and regulatory support are needed. Spirochaetosis remains an underreported and understudied disease. When considering its zoonotic potential, a ‘One Health' approach, integrating animal and human surveillance strategies, is imperative.
