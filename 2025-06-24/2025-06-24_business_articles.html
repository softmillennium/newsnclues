                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is growing optimism that a ceasefire in the brief war between Israel and Iran will hold, after it was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump said he was "not happy" with Israel and Iran after both nations engaged in attacks on each other following his announcement of the truce. CNBC reporters are covering the Middle East conflict live on air and online, reporting from Washington, London, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, San Francisco, Singapore and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns that his country "will strike again" if Iran "thinks of rebuilding" its nuclear program. "We destroyed the key facilities in Arak, Natanz, and Isfahan," Netanyahu says during remarks to the nation, NBC News reports. He touts Israel's attack on Iran as "a historic victory" and says that his country would have "faced the danger of annihilation" if it did not act. He also says Israel "has never had a greater friend" than Trump, who he says "joined our cause in an unprecedented way." Hamas must be defeated, and our hostages must be brought home," Netanyahu says, adding that Israel has "no intention of easing off the gas pedal." U.S. missile strikes did not completely destroy Iran's key nuclear sites, CNN first reported, citing an early U.S. intelligence assessment described to the news outlet by three sources briefed on it. Asked for comment by CNBC, the Pentagon shared a statement from Hegseth that, "Based on everything we have seen — and I've seen it all — our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons." Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday, "The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed, and everyone knows it." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement that the "alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as 'top secret' but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community." "The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program," Leavitt said. She added: "Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration." The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The classified House briefing on the Middle East, originally scheduled for today, is now set to take place on Friday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson says. "Senior Administration officials will present the latest information pertaining to the situation involving Israel and Iran," he says in a post on X. "This decision reflects the need to ensure that Members receive timely and complete information aligned with the current circumstances," Johnson writes on X. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, says he spoke with U.S. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth to thank Trump for taking action "against the Iranian nuclear threat." "I emphasized that Israel will respect the ceasefire — as long as the other side does," Katz says in an X post. "We agreed to deepen the close U.S.-Israel security cooperation." Israel's Ben Gurion Airport is returning to normal operations, the country's airports authority says. "Restrictions on the number of incoming and outgoing flights, as well as the number of passengers on each flight, have been lifted," the Times of Israel reports from an Israel Airports Authority statement. Iran's airspace is also partially open, according to flight monitoring company FlightRadar24. "Iranian airspace is now open to international arrivals and departures to/from Tehran with prior permission," FlightRadar24 wrote on X. "Our assessment is that there has been some localized radioactive as well as chemical release inside the affected facilities that contained nuclear material – mainly uranium enriched to varying degrees," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a press release. Grossi said that "there has been no report of increased off-site radiation levels" or radiological impact in neighboring countries. U.S. strikes at Iran's Natanz nuclear site created two impact holes above the subterranean halls that were used for enrichment, the IAEA release said. "Based on its knowledge of what these halls contained, the IAEA assesses that this strike may have caused localized contamination and chemical hazards," the agency said. Israel has lifted war-related restrictions across the country that had banned public gatherings, closed schools, shuttered all but essential businesses, and limited air travel. "Following a situation assessment and approval by Defense Minister Israel Katz, it has been decided that starting today at [8 p.m. local time], the Home Front Command's defensive guidelines will be updated," Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. As part of these changes, "all areas of the country will transition to full operational activity without restrictions," the IDF said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slams the delay of the Senate's classified briefing on Iran as "outrageous," "evasive" and "derelict." "This last minute postponement of our briefing is outrageous," he tells reporters after the briefing, originally scheduled for today, was moved to Thursday, NBC News reports. The briefing is reportedly postponed to allow for Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to return from the NATO summit and attend. Stocks are posting gains today, amid cautious optimism about the Israel-Iran ceasefire. Atomic energy watchdogs estimate that Iran has at least 9 kilos of uranium enriched to 60%, a level that could relatively easily be further enriched to 90%, or weapons grade. Republican Rep. Scott Perry, Penn., told CNN he suspects Iran still has enriched uranium even after the American strikes. I wouldn't be surprised if some of it still exists," he said. Perry told CNN's John Berman he also believed Iran was still "a terrorist regime." "So after these 12 days there is still a terrorist regime in power with enriched uranium?" Yeah, I think that's a correct characterization," said Perry. Where is the enriched uranium that seemingly was removed from Fordo?" I see no indication of a coherent strategy here. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is arguing that the War Powers Act, a Nixon-era law limiting the president's power to unilaterally wage war, is unconstitutional. Johnson also vowed that a pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran under that law will not pass the House. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, last week introduced a War Powers resolution that would bar the U.S. military from "unauthorized hostilities" in Iran. But Massie said Monday evening that he would not advance his resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, Politico reported. Read more about Johnson's War Powers Act dilemma here. Vice Admiral Charles Cooper II, Trump's nominee to serve as commander of U.S. Central Command, warns of an "emerging axis" among Iran, North Korea, Russia and China. "We've certainly seen the tactical implications of support from Iran to Russia," he said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "We've seen tactical implications of Chinese companies providing sensors and weapons and components to Iran, who ship them to the Houthis who shoot them at Americans," he added. Oil prices have fallen sharply now that Trump says China can keep buying oil from Iran, a sign that the U.S. is easing its maximum pressure campaign on the Islamic Republic in the wake of a ceasefire with Israel. Global benchmark Brent fell $4.14, or 5.79%, to $67.34 per barrel by 11:55 a.m. U.S. crude oil was last down $3.97, or 5.79%, to $65.54 a barrel. "China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. "Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the U.S., also. It was my Great Honor to make this happen!" Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken is calling the U.S.'s weekend missile strike on Iran nuclear sites "unwise and unnecessary" in a new New York Times op-ed. "I can only hope that we inflicted maximum damage — damage that gives the president the leverage he needs to finally deliver the deal he has so far failed to achieve," he wrote. Michèle Flournoy, WestExec Advisors co-founder and managing partner and former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the Obama administration, said the focus now should be on putting pressure on both sides. The key is to assess how much damage was actually done to Iran's nuclear programs and determine whether Iran will come to the negotiating table "more seriously than it did before," she told CNBC's Squawk Box. "I understand that we all want to sigh a big sigh of relief today with the ceasefire, but this is far from over as yet," she added. Two classified briefings for Congress on Iran that were scheduled for this afternoon have been postponed, NBC News' Frank Thorp reports. Thorp notes this will be the first classified briefing since the U.S. strikes last weekend to which all members of Congress are invited, not just a small group of intelligence committee leaders and party leadership. "Both Israel and Iran wanted to stop the War, equally! It was my great honor to Destroy All Nuclear facilities & capability, and then, STOP THE WAR!" U.S. intelligence officials have admitted in recent days they do not know where much of that material is being stored. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Starbucks:

A coffee drink at a Starbucks location in New York.

Starbucks Corp. is simplifying how it charges for drink modifications, a change the company said will result in better value for customers.

Starting Tuesday, the coffee chain is charging a flat fee of 80 cents for any combination of sauces and syrups, no matter the number of pumps. Previously, the cost could vary depending on the flavor of the sauce or syrup, or the type of drink it was added to.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One piece of career advice that's stood the test of time is to write a thank you note to anyone you interview with for a job. Doing so can help give you an edge to stand out from other applicants, experts say. During one assignment, she connected with the CEO of a tech company. She hand-wrote him a thank you note after their meeting, expressing her gratitude for his time. Graef tells CNBC Make It that he was taken by the gesture, noting that "nobody ever does this anymore." She earned between $150 to $200 per post, about once or twice a month, she says, for a few years after college. It doesn't take much time or effort to send a thoughtful thank you after a job interview, though "surprisingly few" applicants do it these days, executive recruiter Jeff Hyman previously told Make It. A good note doesn't have to be long but should: "You don't have to write a thesis, but point out a moment or two that are specific to your interaction with whomever is receiving the note," she says. She prefers to send a handwritten note — if time is of the essence, she'll send an email right after the interaction but follow up with a physical card to arrive a day or two later. In early 2024, she was laid off from her job as a Macy's copywriter and has since focused on building her own business doing freelance copywriting, editing and proofreading for companies. Late last year, she decided to revisit her earlier efforts to ghostwrite for CEOs and other executives, especially as they build their brands on LinkedIn. Graef landed a full-time contract job in January and spends 10 to 15 hours per week on her own writing business. Working in her new quality assurance job doesn't feel as rewarding as writing for clients, but she hopes to one day scale her business to replace her income and eventually quit the corporate world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic's use of books to train its artificial intelligence model Claude was "fair use" and "transformative," a federal judge ruled late on Monday. Amazon-backed Anthropic's AI training did not violate the authors' copyrights since the large language models "have not reproduced to the public a given work's creative elements, nor even one author's identifiable expressive style," wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup. "The purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate new text was quintessentially transformative," Alsup wrote. "Like any reader aspiring to be a writer." The decision is a significant win for AI companies as legal battles play out over the use and application of copyrighted works in developing and training LLMs. CNBC has reached out to Anthropic and the plaintiffs for comment The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, was brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson in August. The suit alleged that Anthropic built a "multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books." Alsup did, however, order a trial on the pirated material that Anthropic put into its central library of content, even though the company did not use it for AI training. "That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft, but it may affect the extent of statutory damages," the judge wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Many underwriters are not touching vessels with perceived U.S., U.K. or Israeli links at any price," said David Osler, insurance editor for Lloyd's List. According to insurance broker Marsh McLennan, rates among insurance companies that are offering coverage to vessels are now ranging between 0.25%-0.45% of ship value, up from 0.125% a few weeks ago. These rates were consistent over the previous week, but after the U.S. strikes over the weekend on Iran nuclear sites, Middle East marine war risk rates "hardened significantly," according to Osler. By the end of the day on Monday, pricing had risen to as high as 0.5%, and was even higher for U.S.-affiliated ships. Container ships and tankers vary in estimated value based on age, size, cargo held and markets served, with containerships worth anywhere from tens of millions of dollars to the most expensive container ships and oil tankers reaching $100 million in value and above. Osler tells CNBC because of the fluidity, underwriters also cut the required notification period from 48 hours to 24 hours. The uncertainty is the pricing," said Marcus Baker, global head of marine, cargo, and logistics at Marsh McLennan. Baker told CNBC he cannot remember a time when the notification period was reduced from 48 hours to 24 hours. Middle East ocean freight rates have also experienced a surge. Among issues that are influencing the insurance market are concerns about Iran blocking and trapping ships, and the level of appetite from China, a big customer of Iranian oil. President Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday that China can keep buying Iranian oil, a signal the U.S. was not intent on maximizing pressure on Iran's economy. "If there was a pullback from China, there would be less call for war risk, so the simple laws of supply and demand suggest it should calm rates," said Osler. Osler said rates should ease off if the current tentative ceasefire holds, based on information he has received from insurance market sources, but headlines on Tuesday indicated that was uncertain and weighed on the outlook. I mean, in Trump's interview this morning, I don't know what that's going to do, but he's obviously angry," Osler said of President Trump's comments to the press before he left for a NATO summit when he said he was "not happy" with Israel and Iran, after having announced the ceasefire on Monday night. "The developments effectively put the market in wait-and-see mode, with conditions volatile as underwriters come to terms with political developments as they unfold," Osler said. Baker said a decision by Iran to shut down the Strait of Hormuz has political and economic aspects, and practical issues for China and India, the largest destinations of Iranian crude, not to mention the reaction from other Middle Eastern nations to consider, incuding Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman. Last Wednesday, the Joint War Committee of Lloyd's of London's war risk underwriters met, where they released a list of designated areas underwriters have the discretion, but not the obligation, to levy additional premiums or APs. In an updated threat circular from British maritime security firm Ambrey released on Tuesday, it wrote, "There is a realistic possibility that the conflict between Israel and Iran will continue/restart, and there may be subsequent U.S. involvement, but the risk of U.S. involvement is assessed to have lowered. This means that in practice, shipowners must provide insurers with notification of transits." Baker said it is important to put the rise in rates in context of recent conflict zones and shipping. "Ukraine rates went up to 5% and we're only, we're not even a tenth of those rates yet," he said. It was a very significant increase in the value of grain, which was way less than the value of a cargo of oil and a VLCC [very large crude carrier].

Microsoft is struggling to sell its Copilot AI assistant to corporations because many of their employees want ChatGPT.

OpenAI's nascent strength in the enterprise market is giving Microsoft, its partner and biggest investor, indigestion.

Last spring, drugmaker Amgen Inc. announced plans to buy Microsoft Corp.'s Copilot AI assistant for 20,000 employees. It was a timely endorsement of the software company's multibillion-dollar bet on generative artificial intelligence, and Microsoft touted its new Copilot customer in three separate case studies.

Thirteen months later, Amgen employees are using a rival product: OpenAI's ChatGPT. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oil prices are down sharply while stocks are up on Tuesday after Middle East tensions lessened. Hours before this, Iran's foreign minister posted on X that there was no cease-fire agreement — but that if Israel stopped attacking Iran, Iran would not engage further. Benchmark US West Texas Intermediate oil futures were down 3.2% to $66.30 a barrel at 6:10 a.m. ET, while international Brent crude oil futures were 3.4% lower at $69.08 a barrel. Oil prices have now reversed gains from June 12, a day before Israel struck Iran. Though Iran targeted US military assets, markets are relieved that Iran did not target the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route for the global oil and gas trade, wrote analysts at Rystad Energy, a research and intelligence firm. Tehran's strikes on US airbase in Qatar signaled "a possible desire from Iran to de-escalate by inflicting minimal damage to US infrastructure in the region," wrote the analysts. US officials said there were no reports of casualties. The energy markets are now focused on developments in the Strait of Hormuz, where a quarter of seaborne oil and a fifth of global liquefied natural gas trade passes. "The waterway handles significant volumes for global markets and its importance cannot be understated," added Janiv Shah, a vice president of oil markets analysis at Rystad Energy. In an earlier Truth Social post, Trump described Iran's retaliatory attack as a "very weak response," and thanked Tehran for giving the US early notice of the strikes. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould wrote in a note on Tuesday that markets "will be watching closely to see if the cessation in hostilities is maintained and for Iran's next move." "There are still outstanding questions, from whether a ceasefire will hold given that mutual strikes had continued overnight, to the future of what remains of Iran's nuclear programme," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a blog on Tuesday. "But as things stand, the past 12 days look set to join the long list of geopolitical shocks that proved temporarily disruptive but had little lasting effect on markets," they added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We could soon find out as billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez, a newscaster turned helicopter pilot, are set to tie the knot in Venice this week. Business Insider asked luxury wedding planners, who were not involved in the Bezos and Sánchez nuptials, in Venice and elsewhere, to dish on what exactly goes into planning a high-profile wedding like this one. "Whoever you are, on your wedding day, you want a day that's more special than your ordinary everyday," said wedding planner and event producer Sarah Haywood. "But if your ordinary everyday is Jeff Bezos', that's a challenge." When working on luxury weddings of this scale, the planners said no details would be overlooked. "There's a really specific picture of what we're envisioning, and we're not leaving anything to chance for these types of weddings," said Chelsea LaFollette, owner, planner, and designer of Brilliant Event Planning. As for how much Bezos and Sánchez's wedding might cost, Roberta Camille Lione, a luxury wedding planner and founder of Italian Knot, said it could get into the eight-figure range. Lione, who plans luxury weddings in Venice but is not connected to the Bezos wedding, told BI it was "absolutely plausible" for a multi-day, high-end wedding celebration in the city to cost 10 million euros, or about $11.5 million. She said unconfirmed reports that the wedding will cost 30 million euros seemed quite high, even by luxury standards, but that it was "not impossible — especially if the couple is sparing no expense across accommodations, logistics, entertainment, and design." "Underneath everything is this huge machine with cogs going around making sure that the event's going to happen seemingly seamlessly," Haywood said of luxury weddings. That might mean creating tablescape pictures to pinpoint exactly where every type of fork, knife, and spoon goes. LaFollette said vendor timelines are so granular they're down to 5-minute intervals. Whereas most couples might rent a bar, at more upscale weddings, "everything is bespoke," said Haywood. "From the platforms that they're dining on, to the staging, to the bars — anything that you can see has been created especially for them," in many of these cases, she said. Headline entertainment is also not out of the question, and a performer's technical rider can create some hefty expenses. "If a global star like Beyoncé were performing, that could add several million euros just for the performance, not to mention staging, production, and logistics," Lione said. Haywood said Venice made sense as the destination for Bezos and Sánchez's wedding, saying, "European glamour is having a bit of a renaissance" right now. While details about where the events will take place or where guests will stay have not been made public, several luxury hotels in Venice are largely booked for the week, including the Gritti Palace, Hotel Cipriani, and Aman, which was where George and Amal Clooney got married in 2014. Two Italy-based wedding planners told BI that while Venice is a stunning location for a wedding, the floating city poses unique logistical challenges. "With no cars in the city, all transport is via private boats, water taxis, and gondolas. For ultra-VIP events, fleets of luxury boats are arranged to handle guest transfers with discretion and style," Lione said. Giovanna Wurmbrand Stuppach, founder of Anthea Wedding, told BI that a wedding of this reported size, around 200 guests, should not cause major disruptions to residents because they are typically "very discreet" and take place in private venues. This is certainly not to be underestimated," she said. Weddings of the ultrawealthy also incur some expenses that many others don't. There will likely be security watching the perimeter of the space, keeping an eye on the guest list, and even watching out for people flying drones to try to catch a glimpse. Lione said that Venice's narrow streets and crowded canals means "discreet but robust security details are essential." "Coordination with local authorities is often necessary, especially for controlling access to public areas," she said, adding that VIP guests could also cause fan-driven overcrowding that would need to be managed and planned for. However, protesters in Venice have said they plan to disrupt the Bezos-Sánchez wedding, so the event organizers are likely also factoring that in when it comes to coordinating transportation and security. Whatever Bezos and Sánchez have in store for their nuptials, LaFollette said the celebrations would be "setting the example of what weddings are going to aspire to for the next few years."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Jayant Tyagi, a Salesforce software engineer, wants quick answers from ChatGPT, he doesn't bother opening the app or heading to his browser. Instead, he fires off a voice message to ChatGPT inside WhatsApp, the world's most popular messaging service owned by Meta. "I'm already an avid WhatsApp user, so it makes sense to access ChatGPT right there instead of installing yet another app," he told Business Insider. WhatsApp, used by more than 3 billion people globally, is "the largest surface that people use Meta AI on," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's April earnings call. The app is also becoming an AI free-for-all, with rival chatbots now jockeying for attention inside. "A lot of people are finding WhatsApp to be a natural and useful place to explore AI," Meta spokesperson Vispi Bhopti told BI. Bhopti added that more than a billion users use Meta AI across WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, although WhatsApp continues to see the strongest usage. "We believe people will try multiple AIs and choose what's right for them," Bhopti said. OpenAI, which made ChatGPT available on WhatsApp at the end of last year, said that the move is part of a broader accessibility mission. Demand for the bot on WhatsApp was so strong that it briefly crashed at launch. This means any company can run a chatbot on WhatsApp simply by paying Meta, no formal partnership required. In practice, that has opened the door for rival AI companies to tap into WhatsApp's massive global audience without needing Meta's explicit blessing. While WhatsApp has roughly 100 million monthly users in the US, its footprint is far larger in countries like India and Brazil, where it serves as a primary communication tool, and for many, the main gateway to the internet. By plugging into WhatsApp, companies like OpenAI and Perplexity can grow their presence in these markets without having to convince users to download separate apps or sign up for new services. "We do not think of users as 'monetizable,'" a Perplexity spokesperson told BI. This experience aligns with the spirit of WhatsApp as well." For users, WhatsApp is becoming an AI marketplace where chatbots from different companies now compete for attention inside the same app. Users can reach both ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp simply by saving their official numbers in your phone's contacts (1-800-CHATGPT — handy!) Both allow users to ask questions, generate images, and interact with voice notes. "Using these bots directly in WhatsApp feels more natural, like texting a smart friend, compared to opening separate apps for each one," Sumit Gupta, an engineer at San Francisco-based productivity startup Notion, told BI. Meta AI, on the other hand, can be pulled directly into group conversations, which remains a key advantage for it. "I use Meta AI a lot in groups to generate memes and create polls," Naga Santhosh Reddy Vootukuri, an engineering manager at Microsoft, told BI. WhatsApp has long been a breeding ground for misinformation. Now, users are turning AI chatbots on the app into their own truth squads. Vootukuri said that he often pulls Meta AI into group chats to "bust fake videos," especially around politics, that crop up in conversations. Srinivas, the Perplexity CEO, highlighted the trend on LinkedIn earlier this year, urging users to forward misinformation to Perplexity's WhatsApp chatbot and get it fact-checked instantly. A Perplexity spokesperson told BI that the company introduced the feature because "WhatsApp, in particular, often struggles with misinformation through forwarded messages." AI chatbots through WhatsApp can work even on flights. Many airlines limit in-flight WiFi to basic messaging apps, and since the ChatGPT and Perplexity bots run entirely within WhatsApp, users can easily access them midair, as several people have posted on social media. For power users, mixing and matching chatbots within WhatsApp has become second nature. "I use Meta AI a lot for rephrasing messages or casual stuff where I don't care about accuracy," Manas Paldhe, a software engineer at Infinitus Systems, told BI. For serious writing or deeper work, I still go back to ChatGPT." That kind of flexibility could make it harder for Meta to lock users into its own assistant.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hims & Hers stock plunged 35% on Monday after its collaboration with Novo Nordisk came to a halt. The Danish pharmaceutical giant said it was ending the partnership because Hims is selling and promoting a cheaper copycat of Novo's blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy. "Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk," Novo said in a statement on Monday. Novo said that Hims would no longer have direct access to Wegovy. In a statement on X on Monday, Hims' CEO Andrew Dudum said Novo was being anti-competitive and that Hims will continue to provide a range of treatments, including Wegovy. "In recent weeks, Novo Nordisk's commercial team increasingly pressured us to control clinical standards and steer patients to Wegovy regardless of whether it was clinically best for patients," he wrote. "We refuse to be strong-armed by any pharmaceutical company's anticompetitive demands that infringe on the independent decision making of providers and limit patient choice." Hims' stock has been on a roller coaster this year, with shares dropping and jumping sharply on new developments in the weight loss drug industry. The company's stock fell over 19% following Dudum's remarks on Novo. The company was allowed to make legal copies of Novo's weight loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during a shortage that began in 2022. In February, the US Food and Drug Administration removed semaglutide injection products from its shortage list and gave compounders 60-90 days to stop making copies. Hims and Novo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
