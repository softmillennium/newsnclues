President Donald Trump laid into Israeli leaders for bombarding Iran right after he announced a ceasefire deal between the warring states on Tuesday, levying a rare criticism of Israel even after bombing Iran on its behalf. Speaking in remarks to the press before boarding a plane to a NATO summit, Trump expressed frustration that Israel, in its usual fashion, unleashed a barrage of strikes on Iran shortly after he unceremoniously announced a ceasefire deal between the two countries that was to take effect hours later. Iran struck back, with initial reports from Iranian officials saying that there was no deal; Iranian officials later confirmed the deal but said they reserved the right to fight back if Israel continued striking. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. I didn't like the fact that the retaliation [from Iran] was very strong, but in all fairness, Israel unloaded a lot, and now I hear Israel just went out because they felt there was — violated by one rocket that didn't land anywhere,” said an incensed Trump on Tuesday morning. He went on to say that the ceasefire deal is still standing, but that both Israel and Iran have violated the ceasefire. Just hours before his remarks to the press, the president had fired off numerous posts on Truth Social, saying, “ISRAEL. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION.” Trump's ire seemed specifically targeted at Israel on Tuesday morning. Even after a reporter asked a question about Iran violating the ceasefire deal, he specifically brought up his frustration with Israel again unprompted. Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before, the biggest load that we've seen. But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning,” he went on. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” the president concluded. Trump also said that he isn't interested in pursuing regime change in Iran, marking a sharp turn from just 24 hours before, when he said he supported it in a post on Truth Social. Seemingly the only thing that changed between then and Tuesday is Iran's strike on an U.S. air base in Qatar — which Trump struck an almost jovial tone toward, even thanking Iran for giving the U.S. prior notice of the strike to minimize casualties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Caught in the crossfire, Qatar on Monday night found itself in the unusual position of being asked by the US to mediate to end a war where one of the two parties was firing missiles at it. It seems Monday's heavily signalled Iranian attack on Qatar's 60-acre Al Udeid airbase, the largest US military facility in the Middle East, may even have become the opening to resume diplomacy. The attack, which caused no casualties, cleared the ground for Donald Trump and Qatar to work together to secure the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran. It once again highlights Qatar's role as professional mediator – a bespoke service this tiny but massively wealthy country makes available from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Gaza. Ever since Israel launched its attack on Iran 12 days ago, Qatar has been at the forefront of the countries denouncing it, saying it considered the assault “a blatant violation of Iran's sovereignty and security, as well as a clear breach of international law”. Iran's relations with Qatar have also been on a steady upward curve, especially since Iran acted as a friend of Qatar when the state was being boycotted by its Gulf allies. Iran's Monday night missile salvo was a symbolic, almost courteous, attack on the US airbase in response to American strikes on its nuclear facilities. Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi, Qatar's foreign minister, issued a “strong condemnation” of the attack, and told the Iranian ambassador, Ali Salehabadi, that Qatar had a right to respond, yet at the same time Qatar's deputy foreign minister, Majed al-Ansari, balanced a condemnation of Iran's actions by pointing out that Qatar had been one of the first countries to warn against the dangers of Israeli escalation in the region. For its part, Iran's supreme national security council said it “remains committed to maintaining and continuing warm and historic relations” with Qatar. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, insisted Tehran would not allow US and Israeli “criminal aggressions and malign policies” to create divisions between it and “brotherly” regional states. Rarely has such an intrusion of another country's sovereignty been accompanied by so much regret. Indeed almost as soon as the near performative bombs were fended off by Qatar's air defences, Qatar's emir was being called by Trump to see if he could have the conversation required with the Iranians to secure their agreement to a ceasefire. Iran's position since the conflict started has been that the onus lies with Israel to stop striking, but if Trump delivered an Israeli ceasefire Tehran would respond, Qatar was told. Qatar has also worked the White House well, not just by providing Trump with a converted new Air Force One, but by being trusted by Democrats and Republicans alike. Its value was underscored by Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy, in his recent interview with Tucker Carlson. Witkoff showered praise on Qatar, saying “they're criticised for not being well motivated. In the past, they've had some views that are a little bit more radical, but it's moderated quite a bit. They pay for every dollar of the airbase. They don't have their hand out for a thing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jury awarded $500,000 to widow and estate of the police officer who killed himself nine days after the January 6 riot The eight-member jury ordered the man, 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, to pay $380,000 in punitive damages and $60,000 in compensatory damages to Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Washington DC metropolitan police officer Jeffrey Smith, inside the Capitol. They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering. The judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith's wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. Federal judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death. Walls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. On Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband – an encounter captured on the officer's body camera. I never intended to strike the officer,” he said. Walls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as “shocking”. “We're talking about a three-second event,” he told the judge. “A lot of things can happen in three seconds.” Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol attack when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the January 6 attack. Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide. More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack. Erin Smith has applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.</p>

The approach keeps streets clean and litter-free by limiting public trash bins, with garbage trucks making scheduled rounds, allowing residents to bring out their trash at designated times for collection, he said. Taipei also collects a fee per garbage bag, requiring residents to use designated bags that they must buy, while no such rules apply for recycled waste, he said. He also highlighted an incentive program he introduced as mayor for the city's YouBike rental system that offers the first 30 minutes of each ride for free, leading one in four residents to switch from driving or riding motorcycles to using the city's bicycles instead. Chiang also outlined plans to transform the city's Beitou-Shilin Technology Park (北投士林科技園區) into a net zero demonstration zone, featuring low-carbon buildings, a wind corridor layout and sustainable infrastructure. A year-long renovation of Taipei's Bangka Park (艋舺公園) began yesterday, as city workers fenced off the site and cleared out belongings left by homeless residents who had been living there. Despite protests from displaced residents, a city official defended the government's relocation efforts, saying transitional housing has been offered. The renovation of the park in Taipei's Wanhua District (萬華), near Longshan Temple (龍山寺), began at 9am yesterday, as about 20 homeless people packed their belongings and left after being asked to move by city personnel. Among them was a 90-year-old woman surnamed Wang (王), who last week said that she had no plans The permit originally read: “reduce coal use by 40 percent from Jan. China might accelerate its strategic actions toward Taiwan, the South China Sea and across the first island chain, after the US officially entered a military conflict with Iran, as Beijing would perceive Washington as incapable of fighting a two-front war, a military expert said yesterday. The US' ongoing conflict with Iran is not merely an act of retaliation or a “delaying tactic,” but a strategic military campaign aimed at dismantling Tehran's nuclear capabilities and reshaping the regional order in the Middle East, said National Defense University distinguished adjunct lecturer Holmes Liao (廖宏祥), former McDonnell Douglas Aerospace representative in Taiwan. Beijing said its Eastern Theater Command ‘organized troops to monitor and guard the entire process' of a Taiwan Strait transit                                        China sent 74 warplanes toward Taiwan between late Thursday and early yesterday, 61 of which crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. As President Donald Trump announced a deal brokered between Israel and Iran on Monday evening, new polling shows that a plurality of Americans disapproved of his military strikes on Iran last weekend, and that very few voters have confidence that the conflict will not escalate. When asked whether they had concerns about the conflict growing, the answers from respondents were more uniform, with 84 percent saying they were concerned about that possibility and only 15 percent saying they were not. Perhaps because of Trump's actions within the conflict, his approval rating reached an all-time low within Reuters/Ipsos polling during his second term in office so far. According to the most recent poll, just 41 percent of Americans approve of his job performance at this time, with 57 percent disapproving, resulting in a net -16-point approval rating. The next-lowest net rating for Trump, at -12 points, was found in a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month. Despite concerns from most Americans that the conflict would escalate, Trump announced a tepid ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran on Monday evening. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!” Trump wrote in a subsequent post. As the Israeli military appeared to be conducting more missions, Trump lashed out, demanding that they halt their operations against Iran. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. Speaking to reporters as he was departing the White House Tuesday morning for a NATO summit at The Hague, Trump condemned both countries for violating the truce he had bragged about brokering less than 24 hours earlier. “There was one rocket that I guess was fired overboard after the time limit and now Israel is going out. These guys [have] got to calm down,” Trump said. He then uttered an expletive out of frustration with both countries' failure to abide by his demands. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” Trump said.

MOSCOW, June 24. /TASS/. The conflict in Ukraine is heading towards Kiev's unconditional surrender, which will be followed by Russia's diplomatic victory, with Russia deciding the future of Ukraine, former French paratrooper turned military analyst Xavier Moreau told TASS in an interview.

"All conflicts end with diplomacy, even if it is the signing of a document declaring surrender. I believe we are heading towards Kiev's unconditional surrender. Historically, defeat in battle means surrender, and later a peace treaty," he said.

According to the expert, the final say in the settlement will go to Russia. "The terms of the future peace will be decided by powerful states, but the final word on what remains of Ukraine will be Russia's. The conflict will end with Russia's military and then diplomatic victory," the expert concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Israeli army only attacked a radar system near Tehran in response to two Iranian missile attacks that took place after the introduction of the ceasefire, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reported. "Pursuant to the conversation between [US] President [Donald] Trump and [Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, Israel has refrained from additional attacks," the office said. "The ceasefire was set for 7:00 a.m. (4:00 a.m. GMT) this morning. At 3:00 a.m. (12:00 a.m. GMT), Israel forcefully attacked in the heart of Tehran, struck regime targets and eliminated hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces personnel. These missiles were either intercepted or fell in open areas, and caused neither casualties nor damage. In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar installation near Tehran," the statement said. Earlier, US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had fully agreed to implement the ceasefire agreement about six hours after its announcement, that is about 7:00 a.m. Moscow time (4:00 a.m. GMT). Later, the Israeli army press service said that servicemen had recorded a new missile attack by Iran. According to the military, northern Israel was shelled. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Iran had violated the ceasefire and ordered the servicemen to launch new powerful strikes against Tehran. The Iranian Armed Forces General Staff had previously refuted reports of missile attacks on Israeli territory following the ceasefire. US President Donald Trump got involved in the situation, expressing his unhappiness with both Iran and Israel and urging all sides to seek detente.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The children are reportedly being used by an Islamic State–linked group known locally as al-Shabab to transport looted goods, perform forced labor, and in some cases serve as child soldiers or be forced into marriage. Mozambique has been battling the Islamist insurgency in Cabo Delgado since 2017. Government forces have struggled to contain the violence, relying on support from troops sent by Rwanda, South Africa, and other regional partners. In 2020, the insurgents carried out a wave of attacks in which they beheaded dozens of people, including children. Witnesses have said that children abducted from towns and villages have been used as fighters in subsequent attacks. Related article Mozambique opposition leader returns from exile as police fire tear gas at his supporters HRW said there had been a resurgence of attacks and child kidnappings in the last two months and called on Mozambique's government to do more to find the children and prevent further abductions. The problems in Cabo Delgado were largely overshadowed by Mozambique's deadly and long-running post-election protests last year. Cabo Delgado has also been battered by several recent cyclones and hurt by US President Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid. “Climate shocks, increasing violence and spiraling hunger are having a terrible impact on the population,” Egeland said. The NRC said more than 5 million people faced critical levels of hunger and more than 900,000 people faced emergency hunger conditions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 15 people and injuring scores of others, local officials reported. "Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere," he said. According to Lysak's latest update, there are currently more than 200 casualties in Dnipro, including 15 killed. Twelve of the wounded are in a serious condition. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition. "As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: "The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase." Almost a hundred of the victims remain in hospital, he added. Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The flying 24-hour visit, which was originally scheduled to be twice as long, is a reminder of just how much the world's most powerful man chafes at the business of international summitry but never misses an opportunity to revel in pomp and ceremony. He left his last Nato summit abruptly when Justin Trudeau, the then Canadian prime minister, was caught on camera joking about Mr Trump's penchant for turning any event into a press conference. That was six years ago just outside Watford. This time there is more pomp and glamour in a schedule that has been carefully tailored to keep him happy. There was even talk of slotting in a round of golf on Tuesday, although the abbreviated plan means that has been jettisoned. Instead he arrives in time to dine at the Huis ten Bosch, one of three official residences of the Dutch royal family. He leaves the next afternoon after a press conference. The main theme of the summit will be member states' commitment to spend five percent of gross domestic product on defence – one of Mr Trump's hobby horses and a chance for him to claim a huge win that has eluded previous American presidents. The usual three sessions have been reduced to one three-hour meeting. The short schedule meant it made sense of Mr Trump to cut down his visit from two nights to one, said Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary. “More action, less talk,” she told The Telegraph. She added that he was also going to be spending the night at a royal palace, “which he is very excited about.” However, plans to keep contentious issues off the agenda – such as Ukraine's request for membership – have faltered. Mr Trump will arrive fresh from ordering strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and retaliatory strikes on US bases in the Middle East. “It is deviating from the core issue at hand,” he told reporters. “The president will urge allies to revitalise their industrial capacities in order to create Western supply chains capable of producing the critical minerals, infrastructure, weapons and other products necessary for the security of America and her allies.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. STEFAN MAIR is Director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. Now, new leadership in Washington is casting doubt on its commitment to the defense of European allies. “I want to believe that theUnited States will stay by our side,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in March. France's contribution, he has suggested, might be to put its own nuclear arsenal in the service of its European neighbors. It is too early to tell what will come of the French president's offer. If the American nuclear umbrella is no longer open, Europe might need one of its own. Judged by those criteria, neither Macron's proposal nor any other option for an independent European nuclear deterrent currently passes muster. And that means beginning to take serious stock of their nuclear options. In the short term, doing so will signal that Washington needs to take Europe's deterrence concerns seriously. But it would also lay a foundation on which Europe could build should its fears of abandonment by the United States really come true. Historically, most European countries have viewed nuclear weapons with skepticism and, in some cases, outright hostility. Popular opposition was fueled in part by the belief that U.S. nuclear weapons were not a deterrent against Soviet aggression, as NATO leaders argued, but a vehicle for reckless provocation and warmongering. In reality, what followed was not Armageddon but détente. But in European policymaking circles, resistance to the logic of nuclear deterrence persisted. Outside Europe's two nuclear powers, France and the United Kingdom, European officials and thinkers still tend to associate all things nuclear with destruction more than with deterrence. Even so, the war in Ukraine has brought the nuclear issue back into focus, mainly in light of a renewed and growing nuclear threat from Russia. It is unclear how many of those warheads are meant to target central or western Europe. But the dozens of nuclear warheads Russia has stationed in Belarus are cause for concern, as they could easily strike NATO countries such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. More worrying than the arsenal itself, however, is Russia's potential willingness to use it, including as a means of coercion and blackmail. Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated nuclear threats against Ukraine and its European supporters portend trouble for the rest of the continent, particularly in conjunction with the ongoing reorganization and modernization of Russia's armed forces. Russia appears to be reorienting its military capabilities and strategy toward the possibility of protracted conflict with Europe. Trump and those around him have repeatedly suggested that the United States might not come to its allies' rescue if they were attacked, musing about pulling U.S. troops out of Europe and implying that Washington might not defend NATO members that do not spend sufficiently on their own defense. But security experts could find themselves in a similar position to that of economists: despite near-total expert consensus that tariffs will spark a trade war and hurt the U.S. economy, Trump plowed ahead. As the former U.S. diplomat and political scientist Ivo Daalder wrote in Foreign Affairs earlier this year, the principle of collective defense enshrined in NATO's founding treaty “derives its credibility less from the formal treaty than from a belief among the members that they are all prepared to come to one another's defense.” Potential aggressors must believe the same thing. Europe's entire post–Cold War security architecture rests on this belief. To throw it into doubt risks undermining the entire system from within and without. So far, European debates on how to establish deterrence without U.S. assistance have centered on conventional, nonnuclear military capabilities, and understandably so. The limited conventional military capabilities of European NATO members could tempt Russia into carrying out a limited attack—seizing a small piece of territory from one of its Baltic neighbors, say, or engaging a European military vessel—with the expectation that it would not suffer any serious consequences. If such an attack took place and Europe lacked the means for an appropriate military response, NATO's credibility would be shattered. Recognizing that danger, most European countries have pledged significant increases in defense spending. It will likely take several years for those investments to fill the gaps, but at least the necessary political decisions have been made and there is broad public support for them. European politicians have sporadically expressed concern about the nuclear threat from Russia, and defense experts have begun discussing Europe's nuclear options more seriously. The conditions for such a debate are better than they have been in years. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, polling indicated that in four European countries that hosted U.S. nuclear weapons—Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands—a plurality of respondents opposed such hosting arrangements. By contrast, in a March poll of nine European countries, 61 percent of respondents said they would welcome a French nuclear umbrella covering the entire continent. An extended nuclear deterrent of this type, provided by France but ideally also supplemented by the United Kingdom, would certainly merit closer scrutiny if the United States further diluted or even disavowed its security guarantees. Two other options, which seem less pertinent because they are even more controversial, also deserve attention. If Europe chose any of these paths, it would need to meet two criteria to make its nuclear deterrent credible. Of the three options, only one has been seriously discussed so far: an extended nuclear deterrent provided primarily by France, with complementary support from the United Kingdom. The new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has indicated interest in such an arrangement, even if he has said it would serve only to supplement American nuclear guarantees, not to replace them. As of today, however, French and British nuclear capabilities raise serious credibility concerns. Some 290 French nuclear warheads are ready for deployment; the United Kingdom can provide another 225. Taken together, that is a mere ten percent of what Russia can field. Deterrence is no simple numbers game, but a gap this wide is a clear liability, for reasons of both objective and perceived weakness. For one thing, it effectively restricts European allies to what nuclear experts call “deterrence by punishment.” Such deterrence rests on the threat of overwhelming retaliation—attack us, and we will respond by laying waste to your cities. France certainly has that capability, since most of its warheads are deployed on submarines, which are notoriously hard to detect and destroy. Would France and the United Kingdom, which lack tactical nuclear warheads of their own, be willing to use their high-yield strategic arsenal in response—and risk total annihilation if the enemy responded in kind? Getting there would require substantial investments in their respective arsenals to increase the number of strategic warheads, acquire tactical ones, and deploy them in a way that they could survive a first strike by an opponent. Given their budgetary constraints, it is unlikely that Paris and London could shoulder the burden of these investments on their own. France and the United Kingdom have consistently maintained that any decision to use nuclear weapons is a matter of national sovereignty. Europe's limited geographic scale and deep economic integration make such assurances more plausible than transatlantic pledges of protection by the United States. Nuclear-sharing agreements between the United States and its allies offer a useful template: under these pacts, the U.S. military deploys nuclear weapons to a number of allied states, and the host countries then provide some components of the necessary delivery systems, such as carrier aircraft and pilots. But Washington retains the sole authority to order a nuclear launch. The credibility of Paris's and London's assurances could also be enhanced by the creation of a consultation mechanism similar to NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, which discusses nuclear issues and reviews member states' policies but of which France is not a member. Judging by the outcomes of recent elections in France and the United Kingdom, one cannot rule out the rise, in both countries, of right-wing populist governments whose geopolitical instincts would lead them to pursue a France-only or United Kingdom–only nuclear policy. In other words, a Franco-British nuclear umbrella might one day snap shut for the same reasons the American one did. To mitigate the uncertainties that would complicate the Franco-British option, European leaders could set their sights on a more ambitious one: a collective, pan-European nuclear deterrent. During the Cold War, officials in the Kennedy administration considered a version of this arrangement: a multinational fleet of ships and submarines armed with American nuclear weapons but operated, owned, and controlled entirely by European NATO allies. A modern version of this proposal could place French and British nuclear weapons under the control of the European Union or a new body. But Europe's nonnuclear powers would have a much stronger incentive to share the financial burden of modernizing and expanding the French and British nuclear stockpile than they would have under the first option, since they would be investing in a jointly controlled arsenal rather than in weapons wholly controlled by others. Joint control would represent the arrangement's greatest strength for most of the continent, but it would be a nonstarter for Paris and London. Neither government would want to hand over its national arsenal to a European body and give up the final say on the weapons' use. Even if a multilateral nuclear force provided enhanced capabilities and thus a higher level of deterrence—whose benefits would also redound to the French and the British—the question of who held the ultimate launch authority would likely outweigh any other considerations. If only a single member state of the multilateral force suffered a nuclear attack, would the others really prove willing to respond? In either case, decision-making would require more time than is available during a potential nuclear conflict. What remains is undoubtedly the most controversial and far-reaching option: instead of relying on or investing in the existing French and British arsenals, other European countries could build nuclear weapons of their own. If these states accumulated arsenals comparable in size to those of France and the United Kingdom, Europe's collective capabilities would extend beyond deterrence by punishment. Rather than merely threatening retaliation in the wake of an attack, European states would be able to engage in “deterrence by denial”—that is, to make it difficult or even impossible for an adversary to carry out a devastating strike in the first place. But doing so would still take time—certainly enough time for a potential nuclear-armed aggressor such as Russia to carry out a preemptive conventional strike on enrichment sites and other development facilities. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, such a strike would have been unthinkable. To mitigate that risk, France and the United Kingdom could “lend out” some of their nuclear weapons on a temporary basis. The incentive for Paris and London to go along with this plan and support the nuclear ambitions of their allies would be to achieve strength in numbers: even without joint control, multiple European nuclear powers could establish a greater level of deterrence than France and the United Kingdom can establish for themselves today. The United States, for its part, would at long last be relieved of the burden of protecting Europe, freeing resources for alternative uses. In practice, there is no obvious contender for the position of Europe's third nuclear power. So far, only Poland seems to be weighing the option in earnest. “Poland must pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons,” Tusk, the country's prime minister, told Polish parliamentarians in March. The debate in Germany, meanwhile, is complicated by historical, political, cultural, and strategic considerations. Despite decades of reconciliation, integration, and democratic stability, the first half of the twentieth century—and Germany's role in it—still weighs heavily on European minds. That is to say nothing of German society's own wariness. These societal and political instincts are hardly compatible with the role of a nuclear power. The legal constraints on Germany are significant, too. The Two Plus Four Treaty, in particular, is a daunting legal obstacle, as a violation of one of its central elements could put the validity of the whole document into question. To be sure, recent events have already undercut the treaty's political basis. These unsettling changes could be reason enough for a joint decision by Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States to override Article 3(1). Nevertheless, any move by Germany toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons would be imaginable only in close consultation and concert with other European states, first and foremost Poland, where a nuclear-armed Germany would cause the most apprehension. A French and British nuclear umbrella would lack the necessary capabilities, and its beneficiaries would likely doubt its reliability in times of crisis. A pan-European nuclear deterrent appears even less feasible. Doing so would amount to a serious challenge to European democratic norms at a time when they are already under assault by illiberal forces. Nuclear proliferation in Europe might provide effective and credible deterrence. But it would carry legal and political risks that, for the time being, are too great for European leaders to countenance. It could also set off a wave of nuclear proliferation outside Europe, including in states that Western governments consider hostile. Then again, even if Europe stays put, there is no knowing if nonproliferation will hold in other parts of the world. If anything, current trends suggest that the first place it will buckle is East Asia. If the Trump administration continues to create a sense of uncertainty about the U.S. security guarantee to South Korea, for example, leaders in Seoul could reach a breaking point. South Korean defense strategists have pointed out that this situation would become untenable if their country's only nuclear ally, the United States, were to withdraw. A nuclear-armed South Korea would, in turn, encourage Japan to pursue the same course. Nuclear proliferation in East Asia would also alter the terms of the debate in Europe, where it might be viewed as a shift more real and definitive than Trump's threats alone. It is a sobering scenario: European leaders, faced with nothing but bad options, may prove incapable of breaking their nuclear impasse unless someone else takes the plunge first. Europe's safest bet, until then, is to at least prepare for all contingencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. CELESTE A. WALLANDER is Executive Director of Penn Washington and an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security. She was Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and oversaw U.S. military assistance to Ukraine during the Biden administration. In explaining this increase, many commentators cited a single factor: Donald Trump. It is true that the U.S. president's rhetoric, broadly critical of European defense spending during his first presidential term and now his second, has played a role in the uptick. But the increase was underway before Trump entered politics. For over a decade, NATO allies have been focused on the elevated threat that Russia poses to European security, with Russian President Vladimir Putin's naked aggression against Ukraine as a harbinger. Together, these factors prompted the steady increase in defense spending, procurement, and production that helped Europe build more capable militaries before Trump's return to the presidency in 2025—and that will continue after he leaves office. Trump's reelection has only helped underscore the continent's burgeoning independence: Europeans now see a fundamentally changed United States, and they are no longer confident that investing in U.S. leadership will secure their interests. Thanks to the continent's increased strength, Washington can now focus on China first and Russia second. There is a reason why generations of U.S. presidents from both parties have pushed for Europe to spend more on defense. But before American officials pat themselves on the back or take a victory lap, they must understand the downsides of their success. Growing European power means the era of comfortable U.S. leadership is over. And the continent is already holding up Washington's efforts to end the war in Ukraine, restraining American officials in ways it previously wouldn't. None of this means the transatlantic alliance is doomed, let alone already finished. Washington and Europe still have many shared interests, which will encourage them to keep working together. But the changing balance of power means that the United States now has to earn Europe's partnership—just when that partnership is becoming more significant. It can forge a new transatlantic relationship that respects Europe's interests. Or it can lose the world order to a triumvirate of autocracies: Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran. Ever since its 1949 founding, NATO has relied heavily on the United States. During the Cold War, in the 1970s, Europe's NATO members spent an average of two to three percent of their GDP on defense. As a result, the most capable military force defending Europe was made up of American troops. Credible defense and deterrence against any Soviet attack depended on Washington. This might seem odd, given that Europe—not North America—would suffer most immediately from Soviet conquest. But preventing Moscow from controlling western Europe when it already occupied eastern Europe was the necessary condition for American global security and prosperity. The Soviet Union's ultimate goal was to defeat the United States, and control of western European economic and industrial power would fuel Moscow's ability to strike against its real enemy: an America built on democracy, a market economy, and global trade. Washington, locked in competition with the only other power that came close to matching it, could thus not risk a third world war on the continent. European and American security were, in other words, indivisible. Because a collective good benefits all members of a group regardless of who steps up to provide it, there is little incentive for most members to pay. The imbalance of defense spending was still a source of friction in the alliance, but U.S. leadership was ultimately in Washington's own interest. The United States got more than just a stable world order in exchange for being Europe's protector. It received a stockpile of military, political, economic, and diplomatic advantages. (Each state gained unique benefits from its bilateral relationship with the superpower.) These are called “access, basing, and overflight,” or ABO, agreements. In 2001, multiple European allies granted Washington permission to use its bases for operations in Afghanistan, as well as the right to fly military planes through European airspace. Several NATO allies that opposed the 2003 U.S. war against Iraq nonetheless allowed Washington to use bases in Europe for the invasion—or at least permitted U.S. military aircraft to transit their territory. When France did not, it was criticized by some members for causing NATO disunity. Washington's 2024 defense of Israel against Iranian air attacks depended on American military aircraft and ships based in Greece, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. And European bases support U.S. counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa. These bases even help the United States protect itself. If they succeed in evading detection there, they can move along the U.S. coastline unnoticed, ready to launch nuclear weapons against hundreds of American targets without warning. Such an attack would be extremely difficult to defend against. Washington is helped in this task by patrols from Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The United States benefits from NATO leadership in ways that go beyond basing. That means they must use similar sets of weapons. And although NATO states are free to purchase any systems that meet alliance interoperability and capability requirements, in practice, they very often buy U.S.-made ones. Poland and the Baltic states have prioritized the purchase of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, because when their units and U.S. units need to hand off patrol duties to each other to ensure round-the-clock coverage of NATO's eastern frontline, operating with the same equipment makes the process relatively frictionless. The Polish government is more likely to get American soldiers patrolling and training with Polish soldiers every day if they are all working from the same weapons systems. American leaders, after all, will then have greater confidence that their soldiers will be effective and safe if the troops fighting alongside them are using the same technology. By equipping European forces with American weapons, eastern allies can encourage Washington to keep its military in the region. The American Foreign Military Sales system is notoriously inefficient, with years-long processes to finalize contracts and last-minute price increases. But European countries still choose U.S. military equipment over their own partly because American defense contractors, accustomed to servicing the enormous U.S. armed forces, are typically capable of providing decades' worth of maintenance, parts, and upgrades. This reliability is one reason why European countries have inked contracts for fifth-generation F-35 aircraft despite the high prices and torturous timelines. Europe's purchases help the United States maintain a strong defense industrial base. From 2022 to 2024, European countries purchased $61 billion worth of U.S. defense systems, accounting for 34 percent of all their defense contract procurement, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The F-35 alone is worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense companies. And these deals are growing in size and scale: since 2020, European NATO allies have more than doubled the number of weapons they import and increased the proportion they buy from the United States from 54 percent to 64 percent. U.S. military contractors are not just exporting more to European allies but also getting a larger share of the continent's defense spending pie. Yes, Washington pays more for defense than Europe does. But the United States has long enjoyed its own benefits from this predominance. As European defense spending grows, however, the two sides are becoming more equal. In 2014, European NATO members spent an average of 1.5 percent of their GDP on defense, procurement included, compared with 3.7 for the United States. In 2024, however, European members spent an average of 2.2 percent of GDP on defense, whereas the United States spent just under 3.4 percent. If the United States' share of global GDP were significantly larger than Europe's, Washington might still be spending far more on NATO than its transatlantic counterparts do, even as Europe begins to spend a similar share of GDP on defense. Rattled by Moscow's assault and under mounting American pressure, nearly all NATO countries began to allocate larger shares of their spending to defense, even as U.S. outlays slipped. Europe also began spending more on buying and maintaining military equipment. Europe seems poised to go even further in the years ahead. The union recently changed its stringent deficit spending restrictions so that members can budget up to 1.5 percent more of individual GDP on defense. If EU countries take advantage of this provision, they could spend more than $700 billion more on defense through 2030 than is currently earmarked. EU member governments seem similarly committed to increasing spending. Belgium, Italy, and Spain have all announced that they will reach NATO's two percent goal in 2025. Other European countries have announced defense budget increases, as well. Most strikingly, Germany—long highly averse to both defense and deficit spending—changed its constitution so it could borrow money for military purposes. The country's new government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has signaled plans to expand defense procurement through at least 2030. Should all these trends continue, Europe will not only match U.S. regional defense spending but also exceed it. The continent has also taken steps to make sure this new money is not wasted. This change resulted in the signing last year of a $5.6 billion contract by Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and Sweden to procure Patriot missiles. They are also stepping up in terms of leadership. Hungary has taken leadership of its own battle group. But they are now much closer in strength to the United States within the NATO alliance, even in comparison with five years ago. With Finland and Sweden as NATO members, the continent has forces that can better manage challenges from China and Russia in the Arctic. To counter Russia's use of the Black Sea as a platform for striking Ukraine, NATO's European members are developing new coastal defense forces and autonomous vehicles that can enhance U.S. operations in the Mediterranean. The heavy burden that Washington bore for collective defense is being lightened by Europe's response to Russia. Countries drawing from the EU's new $163.5 billion defense procurement loan pool must spend the funds only for purchases from European defense companies. A senior EU official told me that purchases from U.S. defense companies might qualify if their products are manufactured in Europe. Such agreements could help American production by creating more resilient supply chains, but not if tariffs and trade barriers create obstacles for U.S. companies in Europe. For example, American companies have been scouring the globe for sources of ammunition fuses and explosives, many of which European companies have been able to source. But ironically, that potential benefit could be undermined if new tariff rules label these products as European imports, even if they are ultimately produced by American companies on the continent. For instance, the United States wants to put a quick stop to the war in Ukraine, and it has therefore argued for lifting sanctions on Russia in step-by-step peace negotiations. Europe, however, does not want to pressure Kyiv into an unwanted settlement. But this time around, the continent has declared that it will not lift sanctions until Ukraine is ready to settle. This has severely restricted the amount of relief American officials can provide to Russia. Europe is also home to SWIFT, the payments mechanism that is keeping Russian banks from gaining access to the global financial system. And Europe has significant sanctions on Russian shipping and Russian access to dual-use technology goods, which the United States can do nothing about. Other parts of the United States' Russia policy also depend on European acquiescence. Unlike the United States, for example, the vast majority of European countries will not concede that Russia should be able to dictate whether Ukraine can be a member of NATO—not least because Putin has stated that a peace settlement with Kyiv should also revisit previous rounds of NATO's enlargement. If a sense of a common transatlantic purpose continues to fray, Europe might wind up undermining Washington's objectives elsewhere in the world. Should the United States decide to conduct a major military campaign against Iran's nuclear facilities, for example, it will want to use its military bases in Europe. As long as NATO remains strong, the United States will probably be able to keep using its bases in Europe for self-defense. Protecting North America is written into the alliance's charter. But European countries may no longer trust that Washington will defend them should the need arise. As a result, European leaders are seriously discussing whether the continent should acquire its own credible nuclear deterrent. (Washington, for example, is separated from its competitors by vast oceans.) The United States claims it has no intention of pulling its nuclear umbrella from Europe or ignoring Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all. But Washington's NATO policy seems to change every day, and Europe does not have the time to wait and see if the Americans will actually uphold their commitments. There is, of course, another force splitting Washington and Europe: Trump. In 2017, Europe could comfort itself with the thought that American voters didn't really know what they were getting when they elected him. But in 2024, Americans had already watched Trump bully U.S. allies, toy with leaving NATO, and cozy up to Russia. Unfortunately, in the months since that diplomat and I spoke, relations have deteriorated further. During his first term, Trump had advisers and cabinet members who supported the transatlantic relationship and restrained some of his worst impulses. In February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told European officials in Brussels that “the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.” In a speech in Munich the same month, Vice President JD Vance said that when he looked “at Europe today, it's sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the Cold War's winners.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, told reporters that Washington had “incredible opportunities” to partner with Russia. In a poll of 18,000 Europeans conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations just after Trump's victory in November, more than half of respondents considered the United States merely a “necessary partner” rather than an “ally,” a term that just 22 percent were willing to apply. Just 18 months earlier, more than half of Europeans polled by ECFR considered the United States an ally. European officials, for their part, now speak of relations with the United States using a term that they once reserved for China: “de-risking.” Over the past decade, European countries have erected barriers to Chinese investment in critical national infrastructure on the assumption, pushed by Washington, that doing so was necessary to reduce the risk that Beijing could acquire leverage over their political systems and economies. They became particularly interested in doing so after Trump slapped sudden, massive tariffs on almost all the continent's exports. In 2028, Americans might be able to slow Europe's flight from Washington by replacing Trump with a more traditional leader. But it will take more than one election to persuade Europeans that the United States can be trusted again. Even if Trump is followed by a string of committed transatlanticist presidents, U.S.-European relations will probably never return to what they were. Europe is moving away from Washington not just because of Trump but also because its priorities are different from the United States', its capabilities have improved, and Europeans are no longer certain that America is an unshakable ally. But that doesn't mean the United States and Europe are headed for divorce. Russia is still a threat to the United States. This means accepting, first and foremost, that the world now has multiple poles and that the continent is one of them. The key will be returning to the fundamentals of defense diplomacy: accommodating power, recognizing interests, and allowing for a give and take that unlocks mutually beneficial agreements. Now, they will have to get better at dealmaking and compromise. As Washington considers reducing its military posture in Europe, it will need to spend more to compete for the continent's defense contracts. The United States will also have to accept that NATO allies hosting U.S. military bases might have strong views on how Washington can prevent Iranian nuclear proliferation. If the United States can maintain its partnership with Europe, it will have an advantage not available to China or Russia in a multipolar world. Neither Beijing nor Moscow has an alliance of such economic heft, diplomatic might, and global reach. They cannot muster the kind of power wielded by NATO. Europe may give Americans headaches, but it always has; there is a reason why Washington has long wanted the continent to give the United States freedom to focus on other issues. But having achieved what they wanted, U.S. officials now have to make a choice. Or they can forge a new, more accommodating transatlantic relationship. They will face obstacles in attempting the latter, given all that has changed. But the two parties have nearly a century of shared experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump's allies insist he had the authority to take unilateral action against Iran to eliminate what they called a potential nuclear threat posed by Tehran.Carlos Barria/Reuters Three Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a war powers resolution on Monday to check President Donald Trump's use of military force against Iran after U.S. strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites over the weekend. Trump's Republican Party holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and it is unlikely any resolution restricting Trump's actions could pass both chambers. Mr. Trump on raised the question of regime change in Iran following U.S. strikes against key military sites over the weekend, as senior officials in his administration warned Tehran against retaliation. “President Trump must not be allowed to start a war with Iran, or any country, without Congressional approval,” the lawmakers said, adding that Trump ordered the strikes “without meaningful consultation or Congressional authorization.” Opinion: U.S. bombing raid on Iran raises countless questions despite apparent ceasefire Analysis: Donald Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear sites were ‘obliterated' seems stretched House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier on Monday it was not the time to consider a war powers resolution. “The president has posted on social media about regime change, undermining any claim that this was a narrowly tailored operation to eliminate a nuclear threat,” the Democratic lawmakers said, referring to a Sunday post in which Trump raised the prospect of overthrowing Iran's government. Israel is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons and says its war against Iran aims to prevent Tehran from developing its own nuclear weapons.
