                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So, as a young queer fan and youth National Team player, Davidson watched the USWNT and USMNT suit up in jerseys that celebrated her community. “It felt really appropriate for the team,” Davidson said. I think they were probably one of the first sports teams to do that. It wasn't long until Davidson got a chance to wear the number herself. After winning an NCAA title later that year with Stanford, the defender earned her first cap in January 2018. I think especially at the time I first wore the Pride jersey, there was a lot of representation on the team, so it was just fun, almost a community builder. It was like a Pride party on the field.” Within hours of the final whistle, he's getting texts asking, “Can you save me one?” or “Can you have more made?” Not everyone who reaches out is a big sports fan, but the Pride numbers always catch their attention. The messages demonstrate to Ream and his teammates one of the most beautiful aspects of soccer — that everyone belongs. Mewis felt like it was a “beautiful statement of support” from U.S. Soccer but also a tribute to the fans. The jerseys also created a conduit for Mewis to have deeper, eye-opening conversations with those around her. She didn't understand some of the battles her teammates were facing with being accepted by their families. “I remember feeling really moved by that and recognizing that it was going to be really important for me to be an ally and advocate for the celebration of Pride and advocate for the LGBTQ community,” Mewis said. Mewis' support also extends to her older sister Kristie, also a former National Team player, who recently had a baby with her fiancé, Australian and Chelsea FC star Sam Kerr. Her sister,Samantha is uniquely aware of how much it matters. “I know that community is going through a lot right now and have a difficult time with some of their human rights and generally just being pretty targeted,” Mewis said. For Davidson, Pride means celebration, but it's also about protest. According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than one in five hate crimes is motivated by anti-LGBTQ+ bias. She understands just how important it is to uplift and create a safe space for the collective group. When U.S. Soccer first launched the rainbow numbered jerseys, it was not very common to find many in sports pushing that envelope, Davidson recalls. It was important then to promote that message, but the continual support now is even greater. “And that no matter what we're still there to support and we're still there to include queer people in our community.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, even though backups Patrick Schulte and Zack Steffen were both forced to miss the competition due to injuries, head coach Mauricio Pochettino has still opted to bench Turner, with 26-year-old New York City FC's Matt Freese handed the starting role in all three of the USMNT's group games. The move has left Turner, who spent this past season on loan at Crystal Palace from Nottingham Forest, winning the FA Cup as backup to Dean Henderson, watching on yet again as his teammates have gone on to win three games in a row. This decision has not gone down well with former USMNT star turned analyst Herculez Gomez, who recently admitted on Futbol Americas that he does not “understand why Matt Freese is playing.” “If Matt Turner is the goalkeeper with the most international experience and the one thing that he has lacking right now is games, sharpness, why not give him these games, these minutes?” he went on to ask. I do not, for the life of me, know why he is starting in these games.” What's more, Gomez added that if he were in Turner's shoes, he'd be wondering why he was still in camp, especially with a $9.1 million transfer to French side Lyon seemingly set to be completed this summer, as per ESPN. Should Turner's move to Ligue 1 go through, he could soon take over as the starter if Brazilian Lucas Perri is pried away this summer, with Italian side Roma linked, via Tom Bogert. Alternatively, should Perri remain in France, Turner faces yet another tough battle for gametime, one which a solid summer could help. I could be helping my situation, helping myself win a starting position in case the starting goalkeeper they have right now doesn't get sold to Roma. I've gotta battle it out with him, get myself an edge. What am I doing at the Gold Cup backing this guy up? But Gomez's issue wasn't just with Pochettino's decision to start Freese, but also with the NYCFC shot stopper's blunder against Haiti, where his misplaced pass all but handed Louicius Don Deedson a goal on a silver platter. But you cannot make that mistake, ” Gomez claimed. It remains to be seen whether or not Pochettino will return to Turner for the knockout round, with the USMNT scheduled to take on Costa Rica in the quarterfinals on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After FIFA President Gianni Infantino cozied up to Donald Trump in the Oval Office, FIFA's consistent anti-racism and anti-discrimination messages at international tournaments were conspicuous by their absence. After FIFA received backlash, it was displayed for one day to commemorate the “International Day for Countering Hate Speech.” One of those commentators is former ESPN personality Jemele Hill. As part of her Spolitics focus on the crossover between sports and politics, Hill had pointed words for FIFA and Infantino in particular. She played a cut of his infamous speech proclaiming that he was Arab, African, gay, and disabled in an attempt to preach unity and inclusion. “Considering that Trump and his administration have gone all-in on anything not white, male, heterosexual, or Christian under attack, perhaps Infantino decided that just for the Club World Cup, let's just let racism feel a little more at home. Since there is clearly widespread support for it in this presidential administration,” Hill said. Hill noted that sports organizations have tended to support social justice causes when it has been politically and culturally convenient for them to do so, but back down when it comes to more than optics. “I've long let go of any hope that leagues, teams, and other sports organizations actually care about making any real impact when it comes to social justice. Meanwhile the players that power their leagues are impacted by the social issues that they readily abandon when it's time to take a real stand. Surely Infantino isn't oblivious to the fact that the Club World Cup just as ICE is cosplaying as modern day slave catchers across this country,” Hill added.” Despite the controversy, Jemele Hill doesn't think calls to boycott next year's World Cup in North America will have a significant impact, given the importance of sports in society, especially among those in power. “Some have suggested that FIFA should withdraw next year's World Cup from the United States. But considering the World Cup has been in Qatar and Russia, I'm going to go out on a limb and say moral compass of a country isn't a high priority for them. Others have encouraged people to boycott the World Cup and the Club World Cup but I can't say I anticipate there will be any major needle moving in that direction because people love their sports. “To be part of NBC's return to the NBA — a network with such a rich basketball legacy — and its debut on Peacock is truly an honor."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle Reign FC midfielder Ainsley McCammon has been called up to U.S. Under-19 and Under-18 women's National Team camp. The teams will come together from June 24-July 1 for a joint training camp at McCurry Park in Fayetteville, Georgia. All Players in Camp are Age-Eligible for 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. “"Ainsley's invitation to the U-19s as they build toward the 2026 World Cup is a tremendous opportunity. She continues to grow every day at our club, and being part of this team now sets her up to make an impact when it matters most down the road,” said Reign FC General Manager Lesle Gallimore. The players from both age groups will be divided into two teams for the camp featuring players from both age groups. The joint camp is part of the Federation's U.S. Way philosophy which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the full U.S. Women's National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship. For the U-19s, 22 players were named with 20 born in 2006 and two born in 2007, while the U-18 roster also features 24 players, all born in 2007. McCammon is one of two NWSL players called up for the U-19 WNT camp. McCammon, who has appeared in seven matches for the Reign this season, attended the USA Futures Camp earlier this year and was called up for the FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup in 2024.</p>

Alabama is one of just two collegiate programs to have a pair of players represented on the U-18 National Team training camp roster

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -  Alabama's Olivia Belcher and Maddie Padelski have been called up to the U.S. U-18 National Team Training Camp, the United States soccer organization announced Tuesday. The camp will host players from both the U-18 and U-19 age groups and will run from June 24-July 1 in Fayetteville, Ga. 

Players from both the U-18 and U-19 training camps will be intermixed and divided into two teams as all players at the joint camp are eligible for the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. Alabama and North Carolina are the lone collegiate programs to have two players named to the U-18 women's national team camp roster. Additionally, Padelski is one of seven players that earned a bronze medal with the United States at the 2024 U-17 Women's World Cup. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA is throwing a gala to “celebrate” the Club World Cup at a venue on Wall Street in New York City – and attendees are being charged thousands of dollars to party with its President Gianni Infantino and, according to the co-organizers, FIFA World Cup stars. The co-organizers Big Art (an international event management company) promoted the event on Instagram with an attached link to book tickets via a WhatsApp sales representative. Promotion on Big Art's Facebook page said the “VIP event will gather Legends of the game, FIFA's top leadership and a handpicked guest list of international figures from business, fashion and culture.” A sales representative said in their opening message on WhatsApp that Infantino will attend, before adding that Kaka, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Roberto Baggio will also be there. All four players have either been involved in sponsorship activations, or spoken positively about the tournament or attended games with FIFA during the Club World Cup. It added that FIFA attendees are still to be confirmed. The Big Art sales representative also said that this paid-for entry represented a “rare opportunity to align your brand with FIFA and engage directly with global decision-makers, influencers and icons from across the world.” FIFA did not comment when asked by The Athletic what role it had in the pricing of the event, or whether it is appropriate for individuals or brands to spend thousands of dollars to engage directly with FIFA leadership. Last month, the first ticketing packages for next summer's men's World Cup went on sale with the release of a collection of high-end hospitality options. The initial release was limited to certain hospitality offerings involving several games packaged together, starting at $3,500 (£2,625) per person and climbing to an eye-popping $73,200 (£54,750).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the U.S. men's national team's seemingly endless search for a No. 9 - aka a striker - the Americans hope they have found one in Patrick Agyemang. He is hungry going forward and to score. In soccer, it is sometimes better to have amnesia and forget about the past and worry about the future. “Me and John, we talked about that pass,” Agyemang told FOX Sports afterwards. Once I saw the keeper come on, compose yourself, take your time and around the goalkeeper, and once I got there, just finished.” According to OptaJack, Agyemang has scored five goals in his first nine international appearances, tying him Jozy Altidore for the sixth-fewest games needed to score five times for the USMNT. "Patrick is doing a fantastic job for the team," USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said at the post-game press conference. Still room to improve, but we are so happy with him." The son of Ghanaian parents, he began his college career at a Division III school - Eastern Connecticut State University. Most high-profile players will attend Division I schools right off the bat, climb through a club's academy or go to Europe at a relatively young age. striker recorded 30 goals and added 10 assists in his first two seasons at Eastern Connecticut, while earning D-III All-American honors. He also was named Little East Conference player of the year as a sophomore. Agyemang transferred to the University of Rhode Island (Division I) and connected for 19 goals and 12 assists in his final two seasons as he wound up on the MAC Hermann Award Watch List. Not seeing much time with the first team (182 minutes total) as a rookie, Agyemang scored 10 goals in only a dozen matches for Crown Legacy FC (MLS NEXT Pro). With some seasoning and a year of professional soccer under his left, Agyemang enjoyed a breakout sophomore season in 2024, pacing Charlotte FC with 10 goals. Not many MLS teams can say that their top goal-scorer is a U.S. citizen. Agyemang's production caught the eye of Pochettino, who called him into January camp and for a pair of international friendlies against Venezuela and Costa Rica. He acquitted himself well, scoring once in each of those contests. In his debut match against Venezuela on Jan. 18, Agyemang demonstrated how lethal he can be. A pass from Matko Miljevic was deflected into his path on the left flank. “Once that ball breaks through, I'm like 1 v 1. I love getting the shot off my left foot. Four days later on Jan. 22, Agyemang came off the bench to give the Americans some 90th-minute insurance in a 2-0 win over Costa Rica in Orlando, Fla. He became the 12th player to score in both of his first two USMNT caps, and the first since Ricardo Pepi in 2021. Agyemang and his teammates will face the Costa Ricans again, this time in Minneapolis in the Concacaf Gold quarterfinals on Sunday, June 29. “The Gold Cup is a tough tournament,” Agyemang told FOX Sports. He has struggled holding onto the ball and his passing isn't always spot on, which is important for someone with his height who also can be a target payer. So, he still has some work to do. They finished their national team careers with 57 goals apiece. Their prime-time years usually run from 22 to 30, although there are exceptions of the age spectrum (see Lionel Messi, who turned 38 on Tuesday, June 24, and Cristiano Ronaldo, 40, as two prime examples). As we have learned this year, strikers can live a fragile existence. Here are just five recent examples of their rollercoaster life: * Ricardo Pepi, 22, who has turned into a lethal presence for PSV Eindhoven (17 goals in 28 matches across all competitions. He missed two months with a dislocated shoulder while performing for Monaco in French Ligue 1. * Josh Sargent, 25, who has filled the net for Norwich City in the English Championship (he tallied 15 goals this season), hasn't scored for the national team since a 4-0 win over Cuba in 2019. He didn't do much in the Concacaf Nations League in March and was left off the Gold Cup roster by head coach Mauricio Pochettino. * Haji Wright, 27, who connected for a goal at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, has an Achilles injury and he was sent home during the tournament. His next game will be for Coventry City later this summer. * Damion Downs, 20, also incurred an injury during the tournament and wasn't available as a substitute in the Haiti match. He competes for FC Köln in the Budesliga. The A.C. Milan standout is much better suited as a player, not a target man, who can run at the opposition and set up teammates for assists or score goals himself. To borrow a baseball phrase about pitching, you can never have enough dangerous forwards on your roster. On June 24, 2025, it is difficult to predict whether Agyemang, or any other No. 9 will be on the USMNT roster for next year's World Cup. It likely will come down to whether they are fit and in form, healthy and whether Pochettino feels like he is best suited for the team. If Patrick Agyemang can stay healthy, keep up his production for club and country and improve and hone his skills through the next year, we just might see him on the U.S. roster for the 2026 World Cup.</p>

As players born in 2005 are too old for the next FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2026, this training camp serves as an opportunity for them to continue developing within U.S. WNT programs with hopes of moving along the pathway to U.S. U-23 WNT and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's roster includes 15 MLS players, giving veterans and rising stars alike the opportunity to impress. The USMNT rebounded from a four-match winless streak heading into the tournament and have won three in a row in their quest for an eighth Gold Cup title. While it wasn't all smooth sailing, the USMNT won three straight matches to top Group D. Following a 5-0 victory over Trinidad & Tobago, Pochettino's side grinded out a pair of one-goal wins against Saudi Arabia and Haiti. Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang has scored twice, including the match-winner against Haiti. He's second on the team in goals scored behind Malik Tillman (three). New York City FC goalkeeper Matt Freese has conceded just once, while right back Alex Freeman (Orlando City) has started every match. Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake) and Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps FC) continue to impress in midfield. Going for a fourth this Sunday in the @GoldCup quarterfinals! Miguel Herrera's side opened the tournament with a wild 4-3 victory over Suriname; a Manfred Ugalde penalty kick in second-half stoppage time was the difference. New York City FC forward Alonso Martínez has also scored and started each match, while Ariel Lassiter (Portland Timbers) made one substitute appearance before reportedly fracturing his hand.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Heimo Schirgi's first big job in soccer was as head of operations for UEFA, the largest and most influential of the global game's six geographic confederations. So when Schirgi moved into his current job as FIFA's chief operating officer for the World Cup, he brought with him the knowledge that the Champions League, for all its prestige and gravitas, also had one weakness: its field was limited to the 55 soccer-playing countries of Europe. “You have all these club competitions on a confederation, continental level, right?” he said. “But you don't have it on a global level. You never had clubs from South America competing against European clubs in a serious tournament with high stakes. Europe, it seems, isn't so dominant after all. Paris Saint-Germain, the reigning European champion, lost to Botafogo, currently eighth in Brazil's Serie A. Iconic English club Chelsea was beaten handily by Flamengo, another Brazilian team. Mexico's Monterrey played Inter Milan, the Champions League runner-up, to a draw. Real Madrid, Europe's most decorated club, tied Al Hilal, which finished second in the Saudi Pro League. Those results may still prove to be little more than a stumble on the way to an all-European final four. And that uncertainty, Schirgi insists, is why the Club World Cup was created. Paris Saint-Germain loses in an upset to Botafogo in a FIFA Club World Cup that so far has been hampered by low attendance and hot weather. We know that club soccer is at a very high level.” And if there's been a big loser, it's arguably been Major League Soccer, which has shown it's not ready to play with the big boys. Although the U.S. league made history when Inter Miami beat Porto 2-1 in a group-stage game, marking the first time an MLS club has beaten a European team in a competitive match, the league's other two entries — LAFC and the Seattle Sounders — combined for just two goals and were shut out three times in their first five games, all losses. But if the first Club World Cup has proven to be surprisingly entertaining, even compelling, there have been a few hiccups. Attendance was hurt by several early weekday kickoffs and high admission prices, which forced FIFA to essentially start giving away tickets. Just one game has sold out; six others drew fewer than 14,100 fans. It was so bad in Cincinnati last Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's substitutes watched the first half on TV in the dressing room. Temperatures are expected to top 100 degrees on Tuesday in New Jersey, where Porto plays Al Ahly, and an excessive heat warning has been issued in Philadelphia, where Chelsea and Esperance de Tunis meet. That, however, will serve as a wake-up call for next summer's World Cup, which will be played in similar conditions. The World Cup will expand from 64 to 104 games next summer. Recent years have seen tournaments such as the Nations League added to the international calendar while club competitions including the Champions League, Europa League and Club World Cup expanded. Others, such as the Leagues Cup, were created out of whole cloth. As a result some players have played more than 70 matches for club and country in the last year. FIFPRO, the global union representing soccer players, has cited scientific research in its call for a mandatory four-week break each year. FIFA, the Club World Cup organizer, responded by offering a $1 billion prize-money purse to get teams to play through that break. A team spokesperson later said the visit ‘carried no political agenda.' “With the introduction of the new Champions League format and the new Club World Cup, which extends for over a month, the workload on teams and players has increased significantly,” said Giuseppe Marotta, chairman and chief executive officer of Inter Milan. “However these competitions also represent a huge opportunity in terms of visibility and revenue. For this reasons, they must be safeguarded. Marotta suggests shortening league schedules, which means diminishing domestic competitions while giving more power to the likes of FIFA and UEFA. That could be a slippery slope, one that would make the world's game less local and more global. ⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump dropped the f-bomb while expressing how frustrated he is about Israel and Iran violating a ceasefire. Prior to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, in one of the most controversial decisions in U.S. Soccer history, then-Head Coach Jürgen Klinsmann elected not to bring star player Landon Donovan. The decision was largely down to a 4  1/2 month sabbatical that Donovan took from soccer ranging from the end of 2012 through March of 2013. It was a decision that Donovan openly disagreed with and, on the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer, the former 4-time U.S. Men's Player of the Year was asked if him and Klinsmann ever attempted to resolve their differences over the disagreement. “At the end of 2014 – October 10th... 10/10, ironically - I had a sendoff game in Hartford with U.S. Soccer,” said Donovan. And then he said at one point - this was really interesting - he's like, ‘you know, and I journaled everything that happened during all of this time. Adding to the tension following Klinsmann's decision in 2014 was a tweet posted by his son, Jonathan, who at the time was a goalkeeper on the USMNT's under-18 team which read “HAHAHAHAHAHAH DONOVAN HAHAHAHAA I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE UNTIL MY PHONE NOTIFIED ME'' followed by four laughing emojis and an additional ''HAHA.'' Donovan noted that Jürgen brought this up during their meeting. He also, you know, apologized for his son being obnoxious during that time. And then look, my choices were, on the field when I got subbed off - I think it was the 40th minute or so - I was still upset with him. I still, you know, I didn't want to give him any time, but you also don't want to make a bigger deal out of it. Donovan's former USMNT teammate and current co-host on Unfiltered Soccer, Tim Howard, has been an outspoken critic of Klinsmann's time as U.S. Head Coach. “In a decision where a legendary player who still has so much to offer that team going into a major tournament could never, ever be making a decision - let me quote him – ‘that's best for the team,' without asking the senior players on that team for their opinion,” said Howard. The senior players on that team were never asked for their opinion. So, it's impossible, impossible as a manager to make a decision that's best for the team without gaining that knowledge before the decision.” New episodes of “Unfiltered Soccer” drop every Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an ideal world, this game would've carried absolutely no consequences with it. Instead, it's Flamengo who are in that enviably ideal position after their rather comprehensive 3-1 win over Chelsea on Friday. They play LAFC at the same time as this game, and the result will matter not one jot. If we do beat Tunis — and we're definitely going with “if”, based on Friday's performance — our reward will be a matchup against the winners of that group, most likely Bayern Munich, with either Boca Juniors or Benfica finishing runners-up. Bayern could technically still finish second, should they lose to Benfica in their last game (played before our game). Granted, a draw would do us just fine as well, so I guess as long as we don't lose, we get to at least play one knockout round game. Date / Time: Tuesday, June 24, 2025, 9pm EDT; 2am BST (next day); 6:30am IST (next day)Venue: Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia, PA, USAReferee: Yael Falcón, with VARForecast: Triple-digit temperatures are forecast, with a heat index of 105°F (40+ °C); and it won't get much cooler at night either, with gametime temperatures exceeding 90°F (32 °C). They lost to Flamengo, 2-0, in their opener, but then beat LAFC, 1-0, to set up this showdown for a place in the last 16. That goal was scored, appropriately enough, by Youcef Belaïli, their leading goalscorer and overall most dangerous player, who briefly played in Ligue 1, even, with Brest and Ajaccio just a few years ago. Unfortunately for them, Belaïli is suspended after getting booked in each of their first two games. Last year's top scorer, former Palmeiras youth player Ricardo Rodrigues is another threat. (For what it's worth, Tunis appealed the yellow that was given to Belaïli for simulation against LAFC by referee Anthony Taylor.) Either way, experienced head coach Maher Kanzari is ready to shock the world. We will be well prepared, especially mentally. Everyone is waiting for this game and we are really proud of what we have achieved so far.” Chelsea team news: Enzo Maresca tried a tactical experiment against Flamengo, which crashed and burned. Thankfully, we've had practically no opportunity to train under the heat dome oppressing the Philadelphia area, so perhaps we'll go back to something a bit more tried and true (for better or worse). That said, at this point, having started mostly our usual first-teamers in the first two games, Maresca has little choice but to rotate for this one regardless of anything else. So let's hope we see something coherent at the very least. ‘Tomorrow, we will do some rotation because the ones who played two games are quite tired to play again. So we will make rotation, and we will see if there is a chance for those who haven't played as much.” “It's almost impossible to train a full session because of the weather. We are trying to save energy for the game; this morning's session was very short, just plan for tomorrow, that's it. It's not easy with these temperatures, but we will give our best tomorrow to get to the next stage of the competition.” Nicolas Jackson is suspended after setting a new club record for receiving the quickest red card as a substitute (four minutes! ), while Reece James and Levi Colwill have been dealing with illness and had been held completely out of training over the weekend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI GARDENS, FL — Lionel Messi could only look down and shake his head in disappointment. Inter Miami jumped out to a 2-0 lead, but had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Brazilian club Palmeiras at Hard Rock Stadium to end the group stage in the Club World Cup — the night before Messi's 38th birthday. Inter Miami is the only Major League Soccer club to advance to the Club World Cup knockout rounds, as both Los Angeles FC and the Seattle Sounders have been eliminated. The next matchup is a juicy one, too. Messi and Inter Miami will face his old team Paris Saint-Germain — the club he left two years ago to join Major League Soccer and play the twilight of his career in the United States. It spoiled an early birthday present for Messi. USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights from both Club World Cup Group A matches: Moments after Pepê's goal, the Inter Miami and Palmeiras game ended with a 2-2 tie, thus ending the Club World Cup hopes of both FC Porto and Al Ahly. Lionel Messi could only shake his head in disbelief. If this match ends in a draw, both clubs will still advance to the Round of 16. Inter Miami is still in great shape to advance, and can even allow another goal in this match to reach the Club World Cup round of 16. But they have at least 10 decisive minutes left to secure victory. Luis Suarez delivered another stellar pass, this time to Messi, who was unable to apply the finish in the 73rd minute. Suarez has been substituted out so Inter Miami can prioritize defense to end this match. The fans at MetLife Stadium are getting their money's worth with this one. Meanwhile, Al Ahly is making sure the Portuguese club doesn't advance to the Club World Cup knockout round. As things currently stand, Inter Miami and Palmeiras would both advance. Inter Miami is about 30 minutes away from winning their group at the FIFA Club World Cup. Luis Suarez dribbled past several defenders, doubled Inter Miami's lead with his left foot in the 65th minute. That's three goals in a four-minute span at MetLife Stadium, as FC Porto's Samu Aghehowa headed home an equalizer in the 53rd minute. Messi is looking to impose his presence in this match. Meanwhile, in the other match, both sides have traded a series of goals in the second half. The action is coming fast and furious at MetLife Stadium. Immediately after FC Porto tied it on William Gomes' shot, Wessam Abou Ali headed home his third goal of the game. Abou Ali's hat trick goal came on a cross from teammate Mohamed Hany. FC Porto's William Gomes scored a banger of a goal to tie up the game in the 50th minute. Porto desperately needs to score goals — and for Inter Miami to hold onto its lead — if it has any hopes of advancing in the Club World Cup. Inter Miami's Tadeo Allende had another chance at a runaway goal, but his finish was wide of the left post. It was a stellar pass from Luis Suarez. And it was a great of a chance as any for Inter Miami to double their lead in this Club World Cup match. He pushed a Palmeiras player after losing possession, but it was an apparent response to his teammate Telasco Segovia being aggressively challenged without a foul considered. Wessam Abou Ali buried the free kick and now has scored both of Al Ahly's goals as the Egyptian powerhouse keeps its Club World Cup hopes alive. FC Porto is doing its part to help the Inter Miami cause. Moments after Wessam Abou Ali scored Al Ahly's first goal of the Club World Cup, Porto tied it up. 18-year-old phenom Rodrigo Mora evened up the score in the 23rd minute to give his club a chance at advancement (Porto needs a win, coupled with an Inter Miami win and goal differential tiebreaker edge). A Porto win pushes Inter Miami in the Club World Cup knockout round, regardless of the result of Inter Miami's game with Palmeiras. Inter Miami has struck first with Tadeo Allende's runaway goal in the 16th minute. Al Ahly needs to win and get some serious help from Palmeiras against Inter Miami. This is Al Ahly's first goal of the Club World Cup. Luis Suarez to Noah Allen, who found Messi in prime position. Even though Messi fell to the pitch, a penalty was not called after he collided into a Palmeiras defender. An early save from Inter Miami's Oscar Ustari, who has been crucial in the club allowing just one goal through two matches in the Club World Cup. The Inter Miami-Palmeiras match is available on TBS and TruTV in English, and available to live stream on DAZN. The Porto-Al Ahly match is also available to live stream on DAZN. The odds aren't in Inter Miami's favor for this one, according to BETMGM. Messi experienced some right thigh discomfort in the second half of Inter Miami's 2-1 win over FC Porto last Thursday in Atlanta, but he finished the match. Messi also practiced with his Inter Miami teammates before the Palmeiras match. Messi will turn 38 on June 24, just hours after Inter Miami faces Palmeiras. How's this for a juicy Club World Cup storyline? It's possible Messi could face one of his former teams in the knockout stage. Paris Saint-Germain has won Group B after a 2-0 win over MLS side Seattle Sounders, while Atlético Madrid's Antoine Griezmann scored in the 87th minute to push Brazilian side Botafogo to Group B runner-up. It's a disappointing result for Botafogo, which upset PSG 1-0 in their second group-stage match.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Paris Saint-Germain emerged from Group B along with Botafogo, as Atlético Madrid did not score the necessary goals to reach the knockout round. Then on Monday night, Lionel Messi and Inter Miami nearly fell apart completely against Palmeiras, but did enough to finish second in Group A. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma did not have to make a save in the match. PSG will face Inter Miami in the knockout round on Sunday (12 p.m. Despite winning Monday's match, Atlético Madrid will not advance to the Round of 16. Instead, those spots will be taken by Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain. The match's lone goal didn't come until the 87th minute when Antoine Griezmann scored off a cross through several defenders from Julian Alvarez. Both clubs missed scoring chances early on with Atlético Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak making.a stretching save to deny Jefferson Savarino in the 10th minute. Alvarez also missed a close shot wide left just before the half. Atlético Madrid got the one goal despite outshooting Botafogo 23-7. This match was a shootout in every sense of the word. It looked like Inter Miami was going to roll into the knockout stage as winners of Group A, thanks to two early goals Monday night. Tadeo Allende scored first in the 16th minute on a breakaway, and Luis Suarez followed suit in the second half with a solo goal of his own after weaving past two defenders. Though Miami made it into the Round of 16 regardless, the late collapse wasn't great — and it set up a battle with European champions PSG in the next round, something they nearly avoided. Palmeiras, now the winners of Group A, will get fellow Brazilian club Botafogo on Saturday (12 p.m. This belongs to Pepê, who completed a wild match with his deep goal against Al Ahly. Group C: Auckland City vs. Boca Juniors at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tennessee; 3 p.m. Group C: Benfica vs. Bayern Munich at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina; 3 p.m. Group D: Espérance de Tunis vs. Chelsea at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia; 9 p.m. Group D: LAFC vs. Flamengo at Camping World Stadium in Orlando; 9 p.m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's military action raises questions for football body Infantino and council to decide if Iran can play in Mexico There are no provisions within Fifa's regulations to prevent Iran from playing their group matches in the US, despite the country being subject to military action by the Trump administration and Iranian citizens being under a travel ban that prevents them from entering the country. The ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A could Iran avoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico. If Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president, Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow. Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a “general principle” that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.</p>
