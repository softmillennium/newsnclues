                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter The National Football League's finance committee approved the sale of 2.35% of the Chicago Bears to existing owners of the team in a deal that sets a league record and values the Bears at $8.9 billion, according to three people familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The Bears were valued at $6.4 billion just a year ago in CNBC's Official NFL Team Valuations — No. The team rose to No. Galatioto Sports Partners represented the estate in the sale, said the people, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Neither the NFL nor Galatioto Sports Partners responded to emailed questions from CNBC about the sale. The previous record high valuation in the sale of a minority stake in an NFL team was $8.6 billion, in the purchase of a 6.2% stake of the San Francisco 49ers in May, according to a person familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The New York Giants are currently looking to sell a 10% stake at about a $10 billion valuation, CNBC previously reported. The Bears currently play at the obsolete Soldier Field, which was last renovated more than 20 years ago. The team is exploring building a stadium in Arlington Heights, a suburb of Chicago. A fixed-roof domed stadium would give the Bears an opportunity to host non-NFL events year-round and get more non-NFL event revenue. Valuations for the sale of limited partner stakes do not necessarily translate to control sale prices. Large LP stakes, say, above 20%, typically sell at discounts to control sale valuations because limited partners have no stake in how the team is run and the dollar amount to buy the stake is relatively large. In some cases, however, small LP stakes, say, below 10%, can sell at a premium to a control sale valuation because an LP stake may be the only opportunity a person has to own a piece of an NFL team due to skyrocketing valuations and the actual dollar amount required to buy such a stake is relatively small. The last control sale of an NFL team was Josh Harris' purchase of the Washington Commanders for $6.05 billion in 2023, according to media reports. Got a confidential news tip?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in the coming days in federal court in Virginia, MSNBC reported Wednesday. Comey for years has been a target of Trump's ire. The president, in a social media post on Saturday, called Comey "guilty as hell" as he raged about the lack of criminal charges against the former FBI leader. MSNBC reporter Ken Dilanian, in a post on X, said Comey is expected to be indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia, according to three people familiar with the matter. "The full extent of the charges being prepared against Comey is unclear, but the sources believe that at least one element of the indictment — if it goes forward -- will accuse him of lying to Congress during his testimony on September 30, 2020 about whether he authorized a leak of information," Dilanian tweeted. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that day had asked Comey if he lied when he said he did not, as FBI director, authorize a leak of information to The Wall Street Journal for an October 2016 article about a Justice Department probe of then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email use. Dilanian, who reported Wednesday's story with his MSNBC colleague Carol Leonnig, noted that the five-year statute of limitations on that charge would lapse next Tuesday. Cruz, in a December 2020 letter to the Justice Department, wrote that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had admitted knowing about and authorizing the leak. Cruz wrote that while McCabe has insisted that Comey was aware of his decision to authorize the disclosure, Comey "has denied this claim." In May 2017 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey had said he "never" had been an anonymous source in news reports about probes involving Trump or Clinton, and that he had not authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source. In his September 2020, testimony, Comey said he stood by that answer. "Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe's statements are irreconcilably contradictory," Cruz wrote to the Justice Department. Mr. Comey, on the other hand, has said that he neither authorized the leak nor knew of Mr. McCabe's involvement." "One of them is lying under oath—a federal crime," Cruz wrote. CNBC has requested comment from Comey through his book publisher. Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday that was aimed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, said that  Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, are "all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to get done." "Then we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney, in Virginia, with a really bad Republican past. A Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job," Trump wrote, referring to acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert, who resigned Friday. "That's why two of the worst Dem Senators PUSHED him so hard. He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case," wrote, Trump, who had put Sierbert into the job.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in the race for mayor of New York City, said Wednesday that he has received at least seven calls from "emissaries" of wealthy people who have repeatedly offered him money to end his campaign. Sliwa slammed those offers as "unethical and illegal." And he warned that if he receives one more such offer, he will begin revealing names of the wealthy New Yorkers who have made them, NBC affiliate WNBC reported. "Cross my heart and hope to die," the Guardian Angels founder told WNBC when asked if he plans to stay in the race until Election Day, Nov. 4. President Donald Trump has suggested that Sliwa and Mayor Eric Adams drop out of the race to clear the way for a one-on-one match-up between former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani. "I would say that Cuomo might have a chance of winning if it was a one-on-one," said Trump, who has called Mamdani a "communist." Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist. Recent polls show Mamdani comfortably leading Cuomo, with Adams and Sliwa trailing by a wide margin. Please check back for updates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Honda is the latest automaker to roll back plans for an electric vehicle, citing "market conditions." The company is ending its US production of the Acura ZDX electric crossover that General Motors was producing at a plant in Tennessee, spokespeople for both brands confirmed to Business Insider. A spokesperson for Honda said in an emailed statement that the decision was made "to better align our product portfolio with the needs of our customers and market conditions." In May of this year, Honda's CEO said the company would cut its EV investment by 30% through the 2031 fiscal year, partly due to "a slowdown in EV market expansion." A $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV in the US ends on September 30 as part of President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." Despite a more general slowdown, EV sales surged in August as people raced to take advantage of the credit. Other automakers have also rolled back plans for EVs in recent years and focused more on internal combustion engines, which power gasoline vehicles. Hertz, for example, paused plans to buy 65,000 EVs last year. Just days ago, the CEO of luxury carmaker Bentley said that it will continue to invest in combustion engines, after previously saying it wanted to build only electric vehicles by 2035. He cited a "dip in demand for luxury electric vehicles."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You probably don't who Wang Laisheng is. In fact, you're probably using one right now. Wang is the cofounder and vice chairman of Luxshare Precision Industry, a China-based manufacturer that originally made cables and accessories for Apple products before getting the bump up to start assembling the company's golden goose: phones. Shares are listed on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and the company is reportedly eyeing a Hong Kong listing this year. According to Forbes data, Wang's net worth is now $14.3 billion. That's up from $9 billion as of last Thursday's close, before the iPhone 17 launch. He added $788 million to his net worth on Wednesday alone as Luxshare stock rose another 7%. Another bullish driver has materialized over the same timeframe, with The Information also reporting that Luxshare signed a deal with OpenAI to produce a consumer AI device. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Tseng sees this as a positive sign for the long-term health of Luxshare, saying it "could be a fresh, long-term growth driver and diversify the company's revenue stream beyond Apple." Moral of the story: if you do a job well for Apple, then other tech titans will eventually come knocking. And if Luxshare continues growing as expected, so will Wang's wealth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A trusted market gauge has surged to its highest levels since the dot-com bubble, signaling stocks are the most expensive in 25 years. That spike preceded a 49% crash for the benchmark stock index between March 2000 and October 2002 as the internet boom collapsed. "The US equity market looks expensive relative to its history, pretty much any way you slice it," Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider by email. He added that the Shiller P/E and several other valuation measures are "all in the top 10% of their historic ranges." Mould said that "valuation does not guarantee an imminent accident," but investors might want to take precautions, in part because US stock returns have been "modest to disappointing" when they've traded at "similar Shiller P/E multiples to those in evidence now." The Shiller P/E ratio was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, who predicted the dot-com bubble would burst in "Irrational Exuberance," published just as the market peaked in March 2000. Investors use the traditional P/E ratio to value a company's stock based on its earnings multiple, or how many times higher its price is than its earnings per share, or EPS, in a year. Similarly, the Shiller P/E ratio takes a stock index's point value and divides it by the combined EPS of its constituent companies over the last 10 years, adjusted for inflation and divided by 10 to get a real, average figure. The ratio can smooth out the effects of business cycles on profits by factoring in a decade's worth of earnings, providing a longer-term perspective on market valuation than the conventional P/E ratio. The Shiller P/E ratio doesn't indicate an imminent crash, as markets can remain overvalued or undervalued for years. It also doesn't account for interest rates, index composition, economic shifts, and corporate profitability, which can vary between time periods and influence valuations. The S&P 500 has doubled in five years to trade at record highs, led by AI stocks such as Nvidia, which has soared almost 14-fold to become the world's most valuable public company with a $4.3 trillion market capitalization. Several commentators have flagged that stocks are pricey. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a Tuesday speech that "equity prices are fairly highly valued." Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, told Business Insider in August that the huge market values and vast shareholder bases of AI companies like Microsoft and Meta meant "more investors will suffer than suffered in the dot-com crash, and their suffering will be more painful." Gerber said that valuations are justified because AI companies promise tremendous growth and their profitability is "just insane."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cloudflare unveiled a new policy framework designed to give website owners, publishers, and content creators greater control over how AI systems access and use their content. The web is making a pivotal shift from traditional search engines to AI-powered answer engines that create responses directly from scraped content, often without linking back to original sources. This threatens the web's original traffic-driven model, which rewards content creation with clicks, views, and revenue. In contrast, Google's main search bot collects data from websites to feed both traditional search results and new AI-powered answer engines, including AI Overviews. "Every AI answer engine should have to play by the same rules," he told Business Insider. The Content Signals Policy, announced on Wednesday, builds on the company's existing web crawling bot management service, with new signals specifically aimed at AI crawlers and data scrapers. Websites use a standard called robots.txt to control how bots access their data. Now, the boom in AI bot scraping is putting pressure on it. Essentially, it's a gentlemen's agreement, and some AI companies ignore these website preferences and still crawl sites for data because their thirst for it is so strong. Cloudflare is introducing what is essentially a new license for websites to help them explicitly block or allow AI bot crawlers in nuanced and more powerful ways. Prince said this license could carry legal weight, especially for Google. "Google's legal team will see this for what it is — a contract with legal ramifications if they ignore it," Prince said. Prince added that Cloudflare helps run about 20% of the web, so this new license will be applied automatically to millions of websites on Wednesday. That sets up a choice for Google, Prince said. The tech giant can either stop crawling these sites for its search engine, which would mean missing out on a large chunk of web content. Or, Google could comply and separate its bot crawlers, having one for traditional search and one for AI answer engines, Prince said. Cloudflare specifically mentioned Google's AI Overviews in its announcement on Wednesday, saying these new settings will let websites block bots that collect data for AI Overviews and "inference," or how AI models draw conclusions and create outputs from data. "The internet cannot wait for a solution while in the meantime, creators' original content is used for profit by other companies," Prince said. Prince said that OpenAI is being more responsible here by separating out its crawling bots, having one for its core AI operations and another for search functions. More importantly, the policy distinguishes between different AI-related uses, including search, AI input, and AI training, and it reminds crawlers that robots.txt declarations can carry "legal significance." A search preference would tell bot crawlers that a site's content can only be scraped for use in traditional search engines that send users to the original source of the information. The third preference, AI training, would allow websites to block AI bots that scrape data for use in the initial pre-training process, in which AI models are trained to understand the world in broad and powerful ways. "Robots.txt is an underutilized resource that we can help strengthen and make it clear to AI companies that they can no longer ignore a content creator's preferences."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's AI coding assistant Q Developer saw revenue fall behind rivals in its first year, prompting the company to reassess its broader branding plans, Business Insider has learned. As of late April, a full year since its launch, Q Developer's projected annual recurring revenue was $16.3 million, according to an internal document obtained by BI. ARR is a common industry metric that extrapolates weekly or monthly revenue streams into an annualized figure. Q Developer's growth might have stood out in earlier years, but it looks modest in today's rapidly accelerating AI industry, according to Jason Lemkin, managing director of SaaStr Fund. Even younger AI startups like Gamma and Higgsfield hit $50 million in ARR in less than a year, underscoring Q Developer's comparatively slower growth, Lemkin said. "AWS has fallen behind in the AI race." An Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email that it is "continuing to innovate rapidly" to grow Q, with firms including ADP, Deloitte, and Japan Research Institute among active users. "We're extremely pleased with the accelerating growth of Amazon Q, where daily usage of Q Developer has increased 9-fold per person this year," the spokesperson added. Q is a key AI product category for Amazon, akin to Microsoft's Copilot. Q Developer is a AI coding assistant for developers, while Q Business is an AI chatbot targeting general business users. Q Business is also undergoing a major revamp with the forthcoming Quick Suite, BI previously reported. Several Amazon employees told BI that AWS lacks a strong reputation for AI-powered developer tools. They said generative AI took AWS by surprise, leading the company to rush new products without comprehensive feature sets. Amazon's spokesperson told BI that Q Developer continues to receive positive feedback from customers, and it is the most widely used internal tool at the company. For Amazon, the AI coding market is too big to walk away from. Gartner projects that by 2028, 40% of new business software will be built with such tools. Yet even inside Amazon, employees appear to favor external products like Cursor over Q Developer. Internal Slack messages reviewed by BI earlier this year showed that Amazon was planning to deploy Cursor internally after strong employee demand. In one message, an employee wrote that Cursor can make "almost instantaneous" changes, while Q Developer takes "minutes." On May's earnings call, however, he pointed to Cursor, an AWS cloud customer, as a major force behind the "explosion of coding agents."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Silicon Valley isn't the only industry reeling from President Donald Trump's plans to charge companies hiring skilled foreign workers $100,000 for visas. Wall Street banks and other financial firms have long used the H-1B visa program to fill an array of roles, from computer programmers to traders and even investment bankers.Trump's executive order, signed late Friday, "caught everyone off guard," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on CNBC while in Mumbai, India, this week. We studied certified visa applications during this time period to highlight the biggest financial industry users of the visa program. The data does not reflect the total number of H-1B employees at any given firm, but it provides helpful context on immigrant labor demands. The data shows that some of the largest financial employers heavily rely on this visa to fill a range of roles, especially technology roles. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup declined to comment. The others did not respond to a request for comment from BI. The country's largest bank focused its H-1B hiring heavily on technologists, with more than 500 certified applications for vice president, lead software engineer, and associate software engineer III positions. Not all of Goldman Sachs' certified applications specified the role, focusing instead on the level of hire, such as an associate. The data, however, does show a wide range of technologist hires and financial hires, including many vice president-level banking roles. Citi's certified applications also largely focused on technology roles, including more than 150 certified applications for "Application Development Technical Lead Analyst" roles. The data showed hundreds of applications for data science and analysis roles, as well as some less technical roles like "business manager." Visa is yet another company largely focused on tech and data hires. Bank of America also focused its applications on tech hiring. Morgan Stanley's data only showed the level of roles it was hiring for, so we cannot analyze what kinds of jobs its looking to fill. However, we can see that they have applied for vice president-level roles the most, followed by associates and then directors. Employees worldwide: More than 70,000 per their company website US Bank is yet another bank that largely uses H-1B visas for for technology roles, such as senior software engineer. There are other financial roles though, like tax accountant, underwriter, and project manager for the firm's impact finance, focused on affordable housing. The British bank's US visa hiring is also largely focused on technology. Charles Schwab is also using H-1B visa to hire tech talent, with the data showing nearly 50 software development and engineering senior manager roles and nearly 100 software development and engineering manager hires. Wells Fargo joins the ranks of financial firms largely focused on technological hires in its H-1B visa applications. UBS had certified applications for a slew of tech and financial roles. On the financial side, it has applied for roles like investment banking analyst and associate, the entry-level role to a banking career, as well as an associate director of global markets FX trading. Like Morgan Stanley, BlackRock only provides the level of roles hired. The bulk of roles culled by Business Insider were at the associate or vice president level, though there are also more than 20 director-level applications. Non-financial roles included applications for a head of internal liquidity stress testing in treasury and a global head of liquidity risk oversight. A large chunk of Vanguard's applications were for application engineering and other technical roles. Software engineering roles made up roughly half of Truist's applications reviewed by Business Insider. Most other roles were tech-focused, such as a senior data analyst in liquidity and regulatory reporting, though there were some rare non-tech roles, such as Treasury market and liquidity risk officer. Discover joins the ranks of others on this list with roughly 100 applications mentioning data science. Other interesting technical roles included a lead robotic process automation analyst.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In July, the U.S deported five third-country nationals to Eswatini as part of its campaign against illegal immigration. Orville Isaac Etoria, a Jamaican who was part of the group, has now been sent back to his home country, according to a statement by the Eswatini government. DON'T MISS THIS: Trapped in Ghana: U.S. deportees claim they're still locked up despite government denials "Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family," said the Eswatini government statement issued on Monday. The Legal Aid Society of New York, however, has reproved his treatment, claiming that Etoria entered the US as a minor and maintained legitimate permanent residency status there for many years. The legal representatives for the four deportees still in Eswatini claim they have been unable to get in touch with them. But Eswatini disclosed that it is working to repatriate them all. SEE ALSO: Eswatini counters U.S. deportation agreement, says no deal exists to host accused migrant The Trump administration was able to continue deporting migrants without providing them an opportunity to prove that they were being persecuted or injured because of a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin described five of the deported individuals as "depraved monsters" in a tweet on X.
