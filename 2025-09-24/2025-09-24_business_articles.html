                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in the latest sign that AI relationships are getting complicated, Microsoft is beginning to use more technology from OpenAI rival Anthropic. The software giant said Wednesday that it's starting to draw on an AI model from Anthropic to answer some queries in the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant for commercial clients. The effort represents another step toward diversification in generative AI for Microsoft, which has mainly relied on OpenAI models for artificial intelligence features in Bing, Windows and other products. As part of a strategic partnership, Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, and OpenAI operates its models in the Azure cloud, among other places. OpenAI has been busy expanding its roster of high-powered partners. In recent weeks, the company has disclosed that it plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle, and it's forged a $10 billion agreement with chip designer Broadcom. Microsoft and OpenAI remain close, but their arrangement is changing. Last year, Microsoft said it was allowing software engineers to get coding help from Anthropic and Google models in the GitHub Copilot Chat assistant, and not just from OpenAI. Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud supplier for OpenAI's programming interface that third-party applications rely on. "And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot," Charles Lamanna, Microsoft's president of business and industry Copilot, wrote in a blog post. Corporate users can now opt to tap Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when building their own AI agents with Microsoft's Copilot Studio tool. Administrators must enable Anthropic models before employees can use them. Their use is subject to Anthropic's terms and conditions, Lamanna wrote. In addition to incorporating large language models from more companies, Microsoft has started testing MAI-1-preview, which it built in-house. "As AI becomes more capable and agentic, models themselves become more of a commodity," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an October LinkedIn post. Last year, Microsoft identified OpenAI and Anthropic as competitors in AI products. The Information reported on Microsoft's Copilot plans with Anthropic earlier in September. The analysts, who recommend holding the stock, wrote that based on an "industry check," about 60% of customers are "implementing Copilot for just 10% of their 365 user base," and just 4% roll it out for every user.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MUNICH â€” Xiaomi on Wednesday made the international debut of a slew of new devices and appliances with its smartphones at the center, as the Chinese tech giant sets out to directly challenge Samsung. The devices, priced at 649 euros ($766) and 799 euros, respectively, continue Xiaomi's strategy of bringing phones with the latest specs to the market at a competitive price. Xiaomi talked up the triple-camera system, large 6.83-inch display and big battery power, as it looks to position the devices as a potential contender to Samsung's mid-range A series and top-end S Series of smartphones. For comparison, Samsung's S25 starts at 799 euros, while its top-end device, the S25 Ultra, starts at 1,249 euros in Germany. "The 15T is basically an affordable flagship with high-end features but priced half a notch down from the top tier premium devices," Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research at International Data Corporation, told CNBC by email. Over the past few years, Xiaomi has expanded its geographical footprint and offerings to include everything from washing machines to electric cars. In Europe, Xiaomi has cemented itself as the third largest smartphone player by market share, behind Samsung and Apple, through a mix of high-end and mid-tier devices that have offered a stiff challenge to the two giants. In China, it is gearing up for the unveiling of its 17 series of devices, which will be its flagship. "Xiaomi 15T is another important step for Xiaomi in its premiumization strategy, particularly trying to capture the slightly more budget-sensitive, spec-focused buyers that still opt for a high-end device, Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys said. "One of Xiaomi's major strategic focuses in taking on the high-end." On Wednesday, Xiaomi announced the global launch of it Mijia brand of  home appliances, which include a refrigerator, washing machine and air conditioner. It's a move right out of Samsung's playbook. The South Korean technology giant sells products across the world spanning from appliances to smartphones and TVs. "Xiaomi naturally puts the pressure on any competitor in the sectors that it enters given its operating model of aggressively priced yet good quality products," Ma said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lithium Americas stock doubled Wednesday as the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the mining company, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The White House proposed the equity stake as Lithium Americas renegotiates the terms of a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a Trump administration official told CNBC. Reuters first reported the equity stake proposal. Lithium Americas' shares hit a session high of $6.23, up more than 100% over Tuesday's close of $3.07. The miner has a market cap of about $1.5 billion. Lithium Americas trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE but is incorporated and domiciled in Canada. The Department of Defense took a 15% equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials in July. Shares of Las Vegas-based MP Materials have more than doubled since the deal. Thacker Pass in northern Nevada is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America with the first phase of the project scheduled to start operations in late 2027. The project is a joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors. Lithium Americas has a 62% stake and operates the mine. GM has a 38% stake and has agreed to buy offtake from the mine when it is operational. Lithium is a critical material for electric vehicle batteries. "If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers," the official said. Lithium Americas confirmed Wednesday that it is in talks with the Energy Department and GM on the loan for Thacker Pass. GM declined CNBC's request for comment. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum revealed in April that the Trump administration was considering taking equity stakes in miners to back them against state-sponsored competition in China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A gunman opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas on Wednesday morning, shooting multiple people and killing one before taking his own life, authorities said. "We had four individuals that were shot, two of them deceased, including the shooter," Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux said at a news conference. Federal authorities said that the victims include ICE detainees. Rothrock said that rounds of ammunition found near the suspected shooter "contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature." FBI Director Kash Patel later wrote on X that an "initial review of the evidence shows an [ideological] motive behind this attack." More updates will be forthcoming," Patel wrote in the post, which included a photo of the casings. The attack is being investigated as "an act of targeted violence," Rothrock said at the presser. Rothrock said the shooting was just the latest example of violence targeting ICE in Texas, noting that there was a "coordinated attack" on an immigrant detention center in the state on July 4. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson thanked law enforcement who responded to the shooting, and called for people to come together in prayer for the nation. "There's a lot going on right now in our country, a lot that's confusing," he said. "Please pray for everyone who's affected by today's tragedy." Multiple senior Trump administration officials quickly drew a link between the attack and what they characterized as extreme left-wing rhetoric against ICE. The agency has become a flashpoint of controversy during President Donald Trump's second term, as it carries out unprecedented operations to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X later Wednesday, "These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences." Vice President JD Vance posted, "The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote, "Democrats must stop demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For humans to pass the prestigious, three-part chartered financial analyst exam, it typically takes around 1,000 hours of studying over the course of several years. New research found that the technology underpinning a slew of artificial intelligence models is now advanced enough to pass even the most difficult â€“ Level III â€“ mock exams in a matter of minutes. The new study â€“ developed by researchers from New York University Stern School of Business and GoodFin, an AI-powered wealth management platform â€“ evaluated 23 large language models on their ability to answer multiple choice and essay questions on mock CFA Level III exams. They found frontier reasoning models, including o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus, were able to use "chain-of-thought prompting" to successfully pass. Previous research, particularly from two years ago, had found artificial intelligence could clear Levels I and II of the exam, but it struggled with Level III, due to the essay questions. However, the technology has evolved so rapidly that the researchers wanted to know whether the models could handle, "specialized, high-stakes analytical reasoning required for professional financial decision-making." The third CFA exam is primarily focused on portfolio management and wealth planning. "I think there's absolutely a future where this technology transforms the industry," said Anna Joo Fee, founder and CEO of GoodFin, which contributed to â€“ but did not pay for â€“ the research. "There are things like context and intent that are hard for the machine to assess right now," Fee said. "That's where a human shines, in understanding your body language and cues."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a chaotic few days for the tech sector, and industry executives and experts are still assessing how U.S. President Donald Trump's latest immigration crackdown could shape the future of their workforces. The Trump administration sparked widespread panic Friday after announcing employers will pay a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, which are temporary work visas granted to highly skilled foreign professionals. These visas have underpinned the U.S. tech workforce for decades. Some tech executives, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have lauded the changes to the H-1B program, but experts told CNBC that the Trump administration's changes could prevent some tech companies â€” namely startups â€” from securing top foreign talent. "The short of it is, it would be a disaster for America, for American companies, American competitiveness, American innovation," said Exequiel Hernandez, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The current annual cap for H-1B visas is at 65,000, along with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals with advanced degrees. In fiscal 2025, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google are among the top 10 companies that employ the most H-1B holders. As tech companies scrambled to respond before Trump's proclamation went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Sunday, the White House quelled some concerns on Saturday by clarifying that the fee is not annual and would only apply to new visas, not renewals for current visa holders. More changes could be on the horizon. "It will mean H1-B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs," he wrote. OpenAI's Altman expressed support for the updates during an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt on Monday. "We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of outlining financial incentives seems good to me," Altman said. The new $100,000 fee is a big jump for small, cash-strapped startups. Even big tech companies could feel some pain and have to reassess who they use H-1Bs for. But their deep pockets come with advantages. "A big firm like Microsoft or Google, even though it's not ideal for them, they have workarounds," said Wharton's Hernandez. Garry Tan, the CEO of the popular startup accelerator Y Combinator, criticized the Trump administration's new fee, writing in a LinkedIn post that "it kneecaps startups" and is a "massive gift" to overseas tech hubs. "In the middle of an AI arms race, we're telling builders to build elsewhere," Tan wrote. "We need American Little Tech to winâ€”not $100K toll booths." U.S. tech companies big and small are fiercely competing with one another â€“ and the rest of the world â€“ as they race to develop the most advanced AI models and applications. Organizations like Meta have shelled out billions of dollars to recruit top AI talent in an effort to try and gain an edge. "What this does is that it gives our competitors, other countries, places like Asia, Canada, Europe, they can then attract these employees to create new innovations," said Stevenâ€¯Hubbard, a data scientist at the American Immigration Council, which is a nonprofit for immigration advocacy and research. One big competitor in the war for talent is China. Earlier this year, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek rattled global markets after claiming to create a large language chatbot that outperformed competitors at a fraction of the cost. The news raised questions over the significant sums that American tech companies are shelling out on AI. Some experts worry that visa changes could deal a victory into China's hands, sending top talent overseas. The move may also deter foreign students from attending university in the U.S. as uncertainty hangs over their post-graduation job prospects. "Those students are going to look at this environment and stay home," said Greg Morrisett, vice provost at Cornell Tech. "It's giving a leg up to both China and India in terms of feeding their startup ecosystems."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's AI coding assistant Q Developer saw revenue fall behind rivals in its first year, prompting the company to reassess its broader branding plans, Business Insider has learned. As of late April, a full year since its launch, Q Developer's projected annual recurring revenue was $16.3 million, according to an internal document obtained by BI. ARR is a common industry metric that extrapolates weekly or monthly revenue streams into an annualized figure. Q Developer's growth might have stood out in earlier years, but it looks modest in today's rapidly accelerating AI industry, according to Jason Lemkin, managing director of SaaStr Fund. Even younger AI startups like Gamma and Higgsfield hit $50 million in ARR in less than a year, underscoring Q Developer's comparatively slower growth, Lemkin said. "AWS has fallen behind in the AI race." An Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email that it is "continuing to innovate rapidly" to grow Q, with firms including ADP, Deloitte, and Japan Research Institute among active users. "We're extremely pleased with the accelerating growth of Amazon Q, where daily usage of Q Developer has increased 9-fold per person this year," the spokesperson added. Q is a key AI product category for Amazon, akin to Microsoft's Copilot. Q Developer is a AI coding assistant for developers, while Q Business is an AI chatbot targeting general business users. Q Business is also undergoing a major revamp with the forthcoming Quick Suite, BI previously reported. Several Amazon employees told BI that AWS lacks a strong reputation for AI-powered developer tools. They said generative AI took AWS by surprise, leading the company to rush new products without comprehensive feature sets. Amazon's spokesperson told BI that Q Developer continues to receive positive feedback from customers, and it is the most widely used internal tool at the company. For Amazon, the AI coding market is too big to walk away from. Gartner projects that by 2028, 40% of new business software will be built with such tools. Yet even inside Amazon, employees appear to favor external products like Cursor over Q Developer. Internal Slack messages reviewed by BI earlier this year showed that Amazon was planning to deploy Cursor internally after strong employee demand. In one message, an employee wrote that Cursor can make "almost instantaneous" changes, while Q Developer takes "minutes." On May's earnings call, however, he pointed to Cursor, an AWS cloud customer, as a major force behind the "explosion of coding agents."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In July, the U.S deported five third-country nationals to Eswatini as part of its campaign against illegal immigration. Orville Isaac Etoria, a Jamaican who was part of the group, has now been sent back to his home country, according to a statement by the Eswatini government. DON'T MISS THIS: Trapped in Ghana: U.S. deportees claim they're still locked up despite government denials "Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family," said the Eswatini government statement issued on Monday. The Legal Aid Society of New York, however, has reproved his treatment, claiming that Etoria entered the US as a minor and maintained legitimate permanent residency status there for many years. The legal representatives for the four deportees still in Eswatini claim they have been unable to get in touch with them. But Eswatini disclosed that it is working to repatriate them all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business leaders such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Netflix chairman Reed Hastings have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas. The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering. On Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000. The sudden move has sparked concerns among Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, whose workers are on H-1B visas. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee during an interview with CNBC on Monday. And we represent the American dream," Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The pair announced on Monday that Nvidia was making a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. "We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me," Altman told CNBC during his joint interview with Jensen Huang on Monday. Netflix cofounder and chairman Reed Hastings praised Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, calling it a "great solution" compared to the existing lottery system. "It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs," he wrote. "Shark Tank" star Kevin O'Leary said the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas would hurt American companies and limit their access to talent. And all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew," O'Leary told Fox Business's "Varney & Co." on Monday. "I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries," he added. O'Leary said that the US government should, in fact, be paying foreign graduates to stay and work in the US. We should give them a 100 grand to come here," he said. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Trump's new H-1B visa fee could be a part of his administration's negotiation strategy with India. In August, Trump raised US tariffs on Indian goods to 50% from 25%. He wrote in a Truth Social post on August 4 that this was because India was not only "buying massive amounts of Russian Oil" but also "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." More than 70% of all H-1B visa holders come from India. Longer term, I think President Trump and his team want to keep as much innovation, talent, and technology talent as possible in the US," Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the executive order was a rule change that "caught everyone off guard." In an interview with CNBC this week, Dimon said he supports "merit-based immigration " and expects employers who rely on the program to object to the president's executive order. It ranked first on a list of financial companies that use them. Royal Bank of Canada's CEO Dave McKay said the US President's move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is a win for Canada. In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, McKay called the rule a "material opportunity" for Canada to attract more skilled tech workers. He said the country should capitalize on it to accelerate growth in its innovation sector. "So from India or from South Asia or from Europe, they'll say, 'Well, I can't get into the US, but I want to move to North America â€” I'll come to Canada,'" McKay said. The RBC chief added that the Canadian government could lower taxes to make it more attractive to launch and grow businesses. CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said that his company, like other tech firms, depends on talented individuals to help "build and drive" technology forward. "Anytime you add an additional fee to it, it does serve as sand in the gears," Intrator said in an appearance on CNBC on Monday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's made by Guangzhou Automobile Group, or GAC, one of China's largest carmakers. Hyptec, short for "hyper" and "technology," is part of GAC's Aion brand and represents its bid to tap the booming premium EV market. With the HT, that push is aimed squarely at Tesla's Model Y and BYD's Sealion 7. The company makes no secret of who it's going up against. The HT's silhouette struck me as very similar to Tesla's Model Y. Interestingly, it was designed at GAC's Advanced Design Studio in Los Angeles, just 15 miles from Tesla's design hub in Hawthorne â€” though there's no evidence the proximity influenced the design. The HT wears sharp character lines, a coupe-like roofline, and flush door handles, giving it a futuristic look that blends sporty and premium. One of the Hyptec HT's boldest design choices is its gullwing rear doors, a touch of "Back to the Future" made modern. Hyptec says they need a little over a foot of clearance, with 12 radar sensors to stop them clipping walls or ceilings. They felt seamless in use: Press a button, and the doors glide up, making entry and exit easier than expected. Testing the car with two young kids in tow, they didn't feel entirely safe. At one point, a closing door required us to move a child's head out of the way â€” the sensors didn't seem ready to intervene. That said, there is the option for a standard door. The car is also available in less attention-grabbing colors. For drivers interested in turning more heads, the HT features a choreographed audio-visual "light show" for onlookers â€” a party trick Tesla fans will recognize. When I stepped in, the HT felt spacious and comfortable. I could even choose which part of my back deserved a little extra love. As expected these days, everything is controlled through a central screen. The car has a 14.6-inch display that handles climate, driving modes, and safety systems. It looks sleek, but adjusting basics like air conditioning required digging into menus. I also found disabling the safety assistance both difficult and annoying. The steering wheel reminded me of an Aston Martin DBX, and visibility was good all around. That said, a couple of details could use fine-tuning. I ended up plugging in a cable instead. Even at three-figure speeds, wind and road noise are barely noticeable, leaving the cabin cocoon-like. GAC claims a WLTP range of 323 miles, which should be more than enough to get from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on a single charge. Even so, it was very quick, especially in sport mode, as most EVs are. When a bend tightened more than expected, the HT stayed composed, with the steering delivering a reassuringly precise response. In China, the top-spec Hyptec HT is priced at 285,900 yuan, or $40,100, slightly above the Tesla Model Y's 263,500 yuan price tag. GAC is set to expand into Europe next. With a Brazilian factory slated to open in 2026, the company is signaling its intent to be a frontrunner in the global EV race.</p>
