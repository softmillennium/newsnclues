If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. This story was originally published by The New Lede. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a rollback of certain Biden-era regulations that determine how the agency evaluates chemicals — a move it says will speed innovation. Critics argue the plan weakens safeguards to protect people from toxic exposures. TSCA is a federal law under which the EPA evaluates chemicals to make sure human and environmental health will be protected before chemicals are put into the marketplace. In its explanation, the EPA wrote that the 2024 amendment could “negatively impact EPA's ability to complete risk evaluations in a timely manner” and added that the agency should have discretion in deciding which “conditions of use, exposure routes and exposure pathways it will consider in risk evaluation,” a move that would allow the EPA to exclude some uses of a chemical from its reviews. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. This proposed change ignores that people are often exposed to the same chemical from different sources, said Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy for the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. But if you look at the combination, they both contribute to your exposure,” Doa added. Other proposed changes include scaling back how much information manufacturers need to provide for a proposed chemical; considering personal protection and safety equipment use when evaluating workplace chemical risks; and allowing the agency to determine if certain uses of a chemical carry unreasonable risks instead of making a single risk judgment based on all of the chemical's uses — the latter approach negatively impacts technological innovation and businesses, according to the proposed rule change. Doa said these changes are “all coordinated in order to lower what they characterize as exposures and risk.” Both previously worked at the American Chemistry Council — which represents chemical manufacturers and praised the proposed changes in a statement. “By revisiting provisions that created unnecessary complexity, confusion and uncertainty, EPA is taking steps to ensure that TSCA risk evaluations incorporate the best available and most recent science by adequately considering relevant exposures and condition of use information to inform decision-making,” said Kimberly Wise White, the council's vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six months ago, 4-year-old Jose Morales-Ortiz was struggling to say two-word sentences. By the end of June, though, it was clear something had changed. Keith Joyce, his guardian, said Jose was able to tell him about the other kids at school and answer follow-up questions. Joyce credits these milestones to leucovorin, a drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to ease the side effects of certain kinds of chemotherapy. On Monday, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the agency would speed a label change for leucovorin to help kids with folate deficiency in their brains — something he said could cause developmental delays and features of autism, including difficulties with communication, sensory processing and repetitive behaviors. With the label change, state Medicaid programs will be able to cover it, and the administration has pledged to conduct more research on it as a therapy. “This gives hope to the many parents with autistic children that it may be possible to improve their lives,” President Donald Trump said at Monday's news conference. At the same briefing, Trump also made unsupported claims about the painkiller Tylenol as a cause of autism and cautioned parents about getting too many vaccines for their kids. Trump's comments sparked widespread concern and criticism from many in the autism community. But there's some curiosity about a new use for the old drug, too. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the Autism Science Foundation said of the FDA's announcement. The group said it doesn't currently recommend the drug as a treatment for autism based on existing evidence, but “we welcome additional investigation into leucovorin.” Folate is a B vitamin that's critical for neural development. Pregnant women take the synthetic form, folic acid, in prenatal vitamins. Folic acid is also used to fortify flour and grain products, to help prevent neural tube defects like spina bifida in the womb. The German doctor worked with a cell biologist at SUNY-Downstate named Edward Quadros who had developed a blood test called FRAT, for Folate Receptor Autoantibody Test. That test has since been licensed to a private lab, and doctors can order it for about $300. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist in private practice in Phoenix, Arizona, was intrigued by the research and began testing kids who came through his clinic. In a clinical trial published in 2013, Frye found that one-third of treated children saw moderate to much improvement compared with a control group of children who were on a waiting list for this therapy, “mostly in communication, verbal communication, expressive speech, receptive language and such,” he said. Frye was able to repeat those findings in another study published a few years later. The one thing we know about autism is that it's very complicated, and kids need to be taken individually.” Joyce, Jose's guardian, first read about leucovorin in December, but there wasn't much to go on — just a handful of small studies. It took three months before he even asked Jose's doctor about the drug. “I completely believe in the whole scientific method,” Joyce said, and there simply wasn't enough science to support its use for children with autism. Joyce eventually thought it might be worth a trial but couldn't get an off-label prescription for Jose until a specialized developmental pediatrician who Jose sees, who had just been to a conference where it was discussed, agreed it had promise. Jose had a baseline speech assessment in April so they would be able to measure whether the medication was helping. “We went in for a follow-up four months later, and the changes were so dramatic,” Joyce said. There have been no large placebo-controlled trials of leucovorin for autism, as would typically be required by the FDA before it approves a drug. Mandell says the most rigorous study, from China, “finds a one-point change, on average, in on a 60-point scale in favor of leucovorin. So like a tiny, really not clinically significant change.” Still, Mandell agrees that the medication is pretty safe. The most common side effects in kids are stomach issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite. More seriously, he said, kids with autism who also take certain medications for seizures may see an increase in those seizures if they take leucovorin. The use of this medication needs to be monitored by a doctor. That happened to a degree with Jose, Joyce said. At soccer practice, for example, Jose would go out onto the field but come off five minutes later and not be able to re-engage. In a news release Monday, the FDA said it had conducted its own review of scientific evidence for leucovorin and concluded it was enough to change the label of the drug to indicate that it could help children with low levels of folate in their brains. “Children are suffering and deserve access to potential treatments that have shown promise. We are using gold standard science and common sense to deliver for the American people,” Makary said in a statement. From his own review, Mandell at the University of Pennsylvania said that the evidence behind leucovorin for autism doesn't rise to the level of “gold-standard science” and that the approval for autism is dangerous on a couple of levels: First, because it sets a dangerous precedent for drug approvals, and second, because it could be giving false hope to desperate families. If the FDA grants a new indication for leucovorin, as it has said that it intends to do, it would be the first time that's happened for a drug with such a small amount of evidence behind it, said a former FDA official who declined to be named because they feared retaliation from the Trump administration. “The hypocrisy of what's going on here, of saying that you want to use gold-standard science and then using the lowest standard of junk science, I mean, this is a really low standard to make a major sweeping change. It should not be lost on people,” the official said. In May, Joyce started a Facebook group called “Leucovorin for Autism” to share his research into leucovorin and answer questions in case other parents wanted their children to try it. Since the White House announcement, it has gained more than 10,000 members. He has noticed a worrying trend: people rushing to buy over-the-counter folinic acid supplements, which are different from the prescription version and contain only micrograms of its active ingredient. In clinical trials, children were dosed leucovorin based on their weight but could take up to 50 milligrams per day. The supplements may also have additives or extra ingredients that kids are getting in big doses, which could cause problems, he added. But this summer, Jose began to pay attention to the fans' chants during the game and watched when people waved their scarves. “I was just like, ‘Wow, he knows the world's here,' ” Joyce said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched an attack on a Ukrainian Ground Forces training ground on Sept. 24, including two Iskander ballistic missiles, causing casualties among personnel, the military reported. Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military. The military added that efforts are ongoing to fortify training centers, ranges, and other military infrastructure with reinforced shelters to reduce casualties from continued Russian attacks. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted Ukrainian training grounds, including sites far from the front lines. These strikes have raised concerns over the safety of personnel and the preparedness of protective measures at rear-area facilities. Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24. The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff. Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations. The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported. While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine. Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round. Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men. Although the Kremlin declared mobilization "completed," it has never been officially ended by a decree. Russian forces took an underage girl hostage to use her as a human shield after murdering her parents in a front-line village in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24. She was then held hostage to prevent Ukrainian troops from opening fire during the ongoing battle, according to the military. "All radio intercepts confirm that Russian actions were premeditated," the statement read. Murdering civilians and using them as human shields constitutes a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, offered his first public assessment of Ukraine's 2024 cross-border operation in Russia's Kursk Oblast in an op-ed for the Ukrainian news outlet Mirror of the Week on Sept. 24. "I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," he said. Ukraine launched the unprecedented incursion in August 2024, advancing into Russian territory and seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) within the first months. The operation, planned by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, sought to divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and disrupt Moscow's plans to invade Sumy Oblast, which borders Kursk Oblast. Russia, reinforced by around 12,000 North Korean troops, launched a counter-offensive this spring that later forced Ukraine out of most of the captured Russian territory. Zaluzhnyi, the current ambassador to the U.K., said that limited incursions can be undertaken, but practice showed they often failed to deliver long-term success. "Practice has shown that, ultimately, an isolated tactical breakthrough on a narrow section of the front does not bring the necessary success to the attacking side," he wrote. The former military chief added that Russia's forces had managed to leverage "technological and tactical advantages" to blunt Ukraine's gains and later counterattack. Zaluzhnyi's comments contrast with Syrskyi's, who has consistently emphasized heavy Russian losses as the primary achievement of the Kursk campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Very mean' animal, appearing out of nowhere and clawing and biting people's legs, still on the loose in Bay Area city Residents of a San Francisco Bay Area city are on the lookout for an aggressive squirrel that has sent at least two people to the emergency room for medical treatment. Joan Heblack told ABC affiliate KGO-TV that she was walking in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael when a squirrel seemingly came out of nowhere and attacked her leg, clawing and biting. Isabel Campoy also said she was attacked while walking in the same area. The squirrel launched itself from the ground to her face and wound up on her arm, leaving it bloody, she said. Flyers have now been posted, warning residents that the squirrel is no joke and that more than five people have been attacked by a “very mean squirrel” that “comes out of nowhere”. Vanessa Potter of WildCare, a wildlife rescue organization in San Rafael, told KGO-TV that the aggressive behavior likely comes from the squirrel being fed and cared for by humans when it was a baby. She said squirrels are not vectors for rabies. Experts say the public should not feed wild animals. The city manager's office did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska published on Tuesday found that almost 42% of respondents believe Ukraine should drop its territorial claims for security guarantees and peace. Of the 1,000 Polish adults of voting age surveyed in late-August, 48% were against giving up land claims for peace, with 10% undecided.A survey published only last month by Rzeczpospolita found 37.4% supported concessions, while 50.5% opposed them. Moscow has long insisted that Kiev recognize Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as Russian territory in any peace deal. Kiev has rejected this, with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky vowing last month to retake Crimea – largely populated by ethnic Russians – which voted to join Russia after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. He also pledged to reclaim the four other regions, which joined Russia in 2022, saying “it's only a matter of time.” Poland has been one of Ukraine's top donors since 2022, providing over €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid – more than 70% of it as weapons – according to Germany's Kiel Institute. However, support for Kiev among Polish citizens has been steadily declining. On Sunday, an anti-war rally took place in Warsaw, with demonstrators waving national flags and carrying placards denouncing Poland's involvement in the conflict and military aid for Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly warned that foreign aid only prolongs the conflict and urged a diplomatic solution. It insists any settlement must include Ukrainian neutrality, demilitarization, and recognition of the current territorial reality – including the status of its new regions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Team Israel Premier Tech's Matthew Riccitello competes during the 18th stage of the Vuelta a Espana in Spain earlier this month.MIGUEL RIOPA/AFP/Getty Images The Israeli cycling team that has been a focus for pro-Palestinian protests said on Wednesday it was reviewing its branding for next year as sponsors pressured for a name change. The Israel-Premier Tech team took their full name off riders' jerseys for the recent Vuelta a Espana, which was halted early due to a plethora of protests over the Gaza war. The team is owned by Canadian-Israeli businessman Sylvan Adams and has an Israeli licence. “Without a name change, without a flag change, we won't continue,” its founder Rob Gitelis told Cyclingnews. Another sponsor, Canadian-based manufacturer and horticulture firm Premier Tech, expressed a similar stance in a statement published by some media this week. “We are sensitive and attentive to the situation on the international scene, which has evolved considerably since our arrival on the World Tour in 2017,” it said, adding that it had always supported cyclists from Quebec and Canada.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of US government employees who lost their jobs in Elon Musk's cost-cutting drive are being asked to return to work. Those who accept must report for duty on Oct 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid leave. Mr Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identified the GSA, which had about 12,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration, as a chief target of its campaign to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government. Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees left the agency in programs that encouraged them to resign or take early retirement. The GSA sent more than 800 lease cancellation notices to landlords, in many cases without informing the tenants. Pushback against the GSA's dumping of its portfolio was swift, and both initiatives had been scaled back. More than 480 leases put forward for termination by Doge have since been spared. The leases were for offices scattered around the country that are occupied by such agencies as the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and Food and Drug Administration. Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official, said: “Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed. Mr Becker, who represents owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions, said GSA had been in a “triage mode” for months. He said the sudden reversal of the downsizing reflected how Mr Musk and Doge had gone too far, too fast. Doge's “wall of receipts,” which once boasted that the lease cancellations alone would save nearly $460m, has since reduced that estimate to $140m by the end of July, according to Mr Becker. As part of its cost-cutting drive, the GSA cut the GSA's headquarters staff by 79 per cent, its portfolio managers by 65 per cent and facilities managers by 35 per cent, according to a federal official.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov has called for an immediate end to the genocide of the Palestinian people and urged recognition of Palestine's independence during the session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. "We demand an immediate halt to the genocide against the Palestinians and the launch of an international judicial investigation by the UN International Court of Justice," Japarov declared. He stressed that Kyrgyzstan firmly condemns violence and terrorism in all forms, including the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. "Such terrorists must be punished severely. However, there are established methods and procedures for combating terrorism and eliminating terrorists. These are the methods that should be employed," he explained. Japarov went on to insist that the recognition of Palestinian independence is essential. Palestine must achieve independence based on the 1967 borders," he said. The Kyrgyz leader also voiced opposition to missile strikes on Qatar and Iran. "We likewise condemn the recent rocket attacks on the territories of Qatar and Iran, as such actions are an infringement on the sovereignty of independent states, pose a threat to regional stability and security, and violate the norms of international law," Japarov emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. DON GRAVES, JR., was U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce from 2021 to 2025. AROOP MUKHARJI was Senior Adviser for Economic and National Security to the Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce from 2022 to 2024. Until recently, few policy tools united Democrats and Republicans like export controls. In the wrong hands, semiconductors and certain other U.S. technologies can present national security risks. In August, the administration brokered a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia, a U.S. company that designs semiconductor chips used to power artificial intelligence. Previously, the U.S. government reviewed license applications to ensure transactions did not present unacceptable risks. Although Beijing banned Chinese companies from buying Nvidia's chips last week, after accusing the company of violating antimonopoly laws, the Trump administration's deal is part of a worrying trend: the monetization of national security. Instead of treating security as an indivisible, priceless ideal—similar to free and fair elections, free speech, or freedom of religion—the administration is treating U.S. national security as if it were a portfolio of divisible, priceable assets. Reducing national security to dollars and cents does not just distort the term's meaning; it also makes the United States less secure. Replacing licenses with revenue-sharing deals, making certain types of direct investments, and squeezing U.S. allies and partners may all help fill U.S. government coffers. But policies designed to maximize short-term gain can create new security problems and leave the old ones unsolved. They will enable U.S. technology to more easily reach American adversaries, cost the U.S. government oversight over taxpayer money, and sacrifice Washington's ability to shape the world around it. True economic security will remain out of reach as long as the government is run as a business, its policy levers and relationships priced, bundled, and repriced, available to be bought and sold. As the historians Peter Roady and Andrew Preston have recently documented, during his 1932 election campaign and following presidential term, Franklin Roosevelt deliberately defined the phrase to capture risks to domestic economic well-being. In his second fireside chat in 1933, Roosevelt argued that economic struggle led to “incalculable” social harm and a “loss of that sense of security.” A new domestic economic program was “imperative to our national security,” he declared, later summarizing, “Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.” Roosevelt's original interpretation of national security later gave way to a more militarized, more expansive conception, reinforced by the interests of a growing arms industry and the rise of the modern military-industrial complex. It came to encompass every corner of the world. Four years later, President Joe Biden's 2021 interim national security guidance repeated the same mantra: “Economic security is national security.” Biden's Department of Commerce played a greater role in national security policy than anyone in government could remember, not just with export controls but also in work on supply chains, cybersecurity, information and communication technology, climate change, investment security, law enforcement, commercial diplomacy, standards development, patents, domestic investment, and even commercial space policy. There was substantial bipartisan alignment on many of these issues. It is not simply that economic, technology, and trade policy became more appealing arrows in the national security quiver. But more significantly, on a philosophical level, leading Democrats and Republicans agreed that security itself meant much more than an absence of physical attack. The first Trump administration's relentless focus on manufacturing domestically to rely less on others and its concern that Huawei and TikTok could give the Chinese government access to American data, furthermore, continued into the Biden administration. With notable exceptions, such as export controls, Democratic and Republican policy solutions were not always the same, but everyone largely agreed on what the problem was. The H20 chip deal with Nvidia is one way it has done this, by allowing a company whose business with China presents a national security threat to buy off that risk. But in principle, a riskless export control license is an oxymoron; licenses are required only when the government has identified a risk. It did so for the H20 chip just a few months ago, in April. This is the reason paying for export control licenses is prohibited under U.S. law (Title 50 of the U.S. Code), to prevent a situation in which financial gain takes precedence over national security concerns. When export controls are about money rather than security standards, U.S. technology will easily reach malign actors. Possible legal complications, however, have not stopped the Trump administration from pursuing this kind of arrangement. It has already reached a deal with another technology company, AMD, to give the U.S. government 15 percent of its revenue from selling its MI308 processors in China—something Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (whose department does not oversee dual-use export controls) called a “beta test.” The administration could continue to replicate this model, and not just in export control cases. If an investment presents any kind of concern, such as data security, however, pretending the problem does not exist because someone has agreed to pay the government is not a real solution. And left unresolved, a national security problem will only fester. The monetization of national security has not been limited to revenue-sharing deals. The administration is also exploring direct investment in U.S. companies. Most notably, the government announced in August that it was purchasing a ten percent stake (roughly $8.9 billion) in Intel, the United States' largest semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike revenue-sharing deals, direct investment is unusual but not unprecedented. There can be legitimate reasons for the government to invest in a company that is critical to national security and needs help. But making money should not be the primary goal—a single company's payouts to the government should not be prioritized above nationwide security interests. The largest grant supported manufacturing projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and the company was obligated to report on project milestones and follow national security guardrails that, among other things, limited its activities with foreign countries of concern. Also embedded in the grant program was a provision to return money to taxpayers in the case of unanticipated profits, called “upside sharing.” But instead of continuing to disburse grant money and keeping these protections in place, the U.S. government opted for equity. This meant more cash up front for Intel and potentially more future revenue for the federal government but—critically—a significant loss of oversight of taxpayer dollars. Intel may decide to use those dollars in ways that support national security interests. Finally, the administration has monetized national security through its approach to U.S. military support and foreign aid, helping others if it brings a financial return. “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” the then candidate Trump said in 2024. “You know, we're no different than an insurance company.” Shortly after Trump's election, Taiwan pledged to increase its spending on U.S. weapons; in the early months of his presidency, Trump's frequent complaints about allied free-riding pressured others to do the same. The administration followed a similar mercenary logic in pursuing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine in exchange for Washington's continued support for Kyiv's war effort and in canceling U.S. foreign aid across the globe. To replace a “charity-based model” of development assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in July, the administration would instead seek investment opportunities that produce “a multiplier effect” that benefits the private sector. Yet likening aid to an insurance policy or a market venture misses the greatest strategic value of supporting others. Aside from the compelling morality of alleviating human suffering, this aid can provide a bulwark against foreign manipulation, the emergence of terrorist havens, the growth of black markets, and other security threats that arise from chronic underdevelopment and economic struggle. Those interests, like so many others—nuclear nonproliferation, maintaining robust alliances, supporting democracy—have little to do with immediate financial returns. In doing so, it betrays a fundamentally different view of what national security is—one that suggests security can be priced at all. Monetization can even create new vulnerabilities and sources of insecurity by incentivizing affluent players to join the game. Take, for instance, Qatar's gift of a gleaming $400 million airplane to transport the U.S. president. Truly advancing economic security requires that policymakers navigate tradeoffs, recognize that other countries hold leverage, engage partners, and play the long game. Maintaining a bird's-eye view of tradeoffs and tensions in economic security policy is essential to making wise decisions. Economic actions taken on behalf of national security, such as export controls, could have the unintended effect of limiting economic growth and innovation. More narrowly targeted trade arrangements would help minimize adverse effects on American consumers, producers, and investors. The United States does not exist in a unipolar world, controlling supply chains and economic chokepoints. Frustrations with U.S. tariff policies have already breathed new life into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an economic and security body that encompasses more than 40 percent of the world's population and aspires to be a strategic counterweight to the United States' presence in Asia. Building trusted supply chains, protecting data, and executing export controls, for instance, all rely on coordination with international partners and, perhaps more important, with industry. It is accomplished through regular, deliberative bureaucratic conversations and adherence to process. By genuinely seeking input from its partners, the United States can avoid the kind of harmful backlash to its policies that ultimately undermines U.S. influence. Finally, policymakers must recognize that economic security is a long game. Yet many national security professionals mistakenly assume that they will see the same immediate results as decisive military action. This is what makes development aid—which the Trump administration has slashed as a supposed cost-saving measure—so valuable. But helping build a healthier and more prosperous world reduces the chances of many bad outcomes. The United States' security challenges are becoming only more complex, and policymakers are still figuring out how best to address them using the economic tools at their disposal. Yet one guiding principle is clear: a democratic government does not exist to enrich itself.National security policy, therefore, should not seek profits or involve opportunistic bonus payments.
