                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top congressional Republicans and White House allies are working behind the scenes to prevent a politically charged floor vote to release the government's Jeffrey Epstein case files next month, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. The intensifying effort to halt that floor vote comes as Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, declared on Wednesday they have the 218 votes needed to compel one when Congress returns. That final signature on their petition to force the vote will come from Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in Arizona Tuesday night, once she is formally sworn in. The Epstein issue, however, has animated some Republican members, with Trump allies on Capitol Hill like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina signing onto the petition. While the exact strategy to avoid a vote is not yet clear, some of the GOP lawmakers who have signed on are privately being pressured to withdraw their name from the petition, which would prevent a vote from taking place, one of those sources said. Boebert told CNN last week that she would not be removing her name from the petition, noting at the time that she was not getting pressured to do so. GOP leaders are now working to prevent the vote from happening, one of the sources said, because Massie and Khanna are just days away from collecting the 218 signatures needed to force leadership's hand. The pair had notched their 217th signature earlier this month when Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw, fresh off winning a special election in Virginia's 11th District, was sworn in and signed the petition. House Speaker Mike Johnson has argued that Massie's petition has been drafted in a way that does not adequately protect victims' personal information and has said the full House has no need to take a vote while the Oversight Committee's investigation is ongoing. Johnson had previously tried to kill Luna's petition by inserting language – through the House Rules Committee – into an unrelated rule vote. Republicans on the House Rules Committee have made clear that this time, they will not help Johnson kill the Epstein files vote, a third source said. While few Republicans have backed the effort to force a vote, a number have expressed support for the underlying bill. CNN's Kristen Holmes and Alison Main contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former president says successor's claims about drug branded Tylenol in US ‘undermines public health that can do harm to women' Barack Obama has said Donald Trump's claims linking paracetamol to autism in infants is “violence against the truth” that could harm pregnant women if they were too scared to take pain relief. “We have the spectacle of my successor in the Oval Office making broad claims around certain drugs and autism that have been continuously disproved,” he said. On Monday Trump had said: “Taking Tylenol is not good … All pregnant women should talk to their doctors about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant.” On one side the progressive view where change came through democracy, the other driven by populists including Trump wanting a return to an older, more conservative worldview. He said: “My successor has not been particularly shy about it. Obama was also critical of progressives who he said became “complacent” and “smug” in the 90s and 00s, “posturing that we believe in all these values because they were never tested. The former president has generally kept a low profile after leaving office. In London, Obama did not refer to Trump by name, only as “my successor”. He is due to receive the Freedom of Dublin on Thursday.</p>

A Trump administration proposal to rescind a bedrock conservation rule that protects 45 million acres of pristine national forests and the nation's least-developed public lands from logging, road construction, development, and pollution is facing widespread opposition. Despite federal regulators providing an unusually brief time window for public comment, hundreds of thousands of comments were filed, with one analysis showing a near-unanimous desire to keep the rule in place. The Roadless Area Conservation Rule, also known as the Roadless Rule, prohibits road construction and timber harvests in many of the remaining wilderness areas that standard cars and trucks cannot reach, effectively preventing mining, hydrocarbon extraction, and logging in those areas and limiting the human footprint in pristine ecosystems. Conservation groups say the rule is critical for preserving sources of clean drinking water, wildlife migration corridors, and access to large areas of unfragmented backcountry cherished by outdoors enthusiasts. “Roadless Areas are not just scenic backcountry — they are biodiversity strongholds and fire-adapted ecosystems that rely on natural, mixed-severity fire to thrive,” said Jennifer Mamola, advocacy and policy director at the John Muir Project, a forest science think tank, in an email. The potential repeal of the Roadless Rule would add to a long list of environmental protections slashed under President Donald Trump. In March,​​ Trump ordered the Forest Service and other agencies to bypass the Endangered Species Act and promote an “immediate expansion” of timber production on federal lands as part of a broader push to empower favored industries. The Trump administration argues the Roadless Rule is a needless regulation that frustrates local land managers, stifles “jobs and economic growth” in rural communities, and limits access for wildfire prevention efforts such as fuel management — which Trump has called “cleaning the floors” — a claim Mamola said contradicts studies linking roadbuilding to an increase in human-caused fires. “Weakening protections puts both wildlife and the integrity of these landscapes at risk, while doing nothing to make our communities safer,” Mamola said. Big timber and paper companies that would profit from greater access to old-growth forests in Alaska and the Western U.S. tend to support more Republican than Democratic candidates and spend millions of dollars a year lobbying Congress, according to OpenSecrets. Trump was the industry's top recipient of campaign cash in 2024, followed by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas). The rule was enacted in 2001 after the Forest Service collaborated with multiple federal agencies to hold hundreds of public hearings as well as consultations with Native American tribes across the Western United States over a two-year period. Public comment periods are typically at least 30 days and can run up to 90 or 120 days for complex federal regulations with broad impact. Rep. Jared Huffman is the ranking member on the House Natural Resources Committee and a Democrat from a densely forested district in northern California, where the Six Rivers National Forest alone supplies $428 million worth of clean drinking water to homes each year. I urge you to abandon this reckless course and uphold the Roadless Rule's protections,” Huffman said in a statement. Supporters of rescinding the Roadless Rule argue it creates barriers to active forest management and efforts to prevent wildfires that are intensifying with climate change, such as clearing potential fuel for fire. The Roadless Rule does allow for fuel management and timber harvests under certain circumstances, according to Huffman, and dozens of conservation groups agree that punching more holes into the backcountry with roads would lead to more human-caused fires, as research has shown. “Peer-reviewed science shows that logging in backcountry landscapes does not protect communities and often increases fire risk, especially near roads, where 95 percent of human-caused fires occur,” Mamola said. “By contrast, investments in home hardening and defensible space deliver a three to four times return in disaster recovery, according to FEMA's 2018 report.” Last month, 155 public lands groups, including the John Muir Project, sent a letter to Congress calling for stronger protections for designated roadless areas, specifically highlighting loopholes that allow logging and road-building under the guise of wildfire mitigation. “Now, as the push to repeal the Roadless Rule gains momentum, closing these loopholes and protecting these wildlands is more urgent than ever,” Mamola said. Conservationists say roadless areas are also buffer zones that protect national parks and wildlife sanctuaries visited by hikers and tourists from expanding wildfires. There's one reason why many backcountry areas remain roadless: they are difficult to reach, and the Forest Service already faces a $4.85 billion backlog of road maintenance across the existing 370,000 miles of forest roads, according to Huffman. According to Wes Siler, an outdoor recreation journalist writing on Substack, the Roadless Rule presents a major barrier to opening the remote Tongass National Forest in Alaska to both domestic and international logging companies. Still, Siler expects the national forest could be saved by a combination of sheer incompetence and Trump's sweeping cuts to federal agencies. Siler reports that Rollins has a paltry $50 million budget to build new Forest Service roads. In a best case scenario, that budget only buys 80 miles of new road.” Federal law requires an environmental impact analysis of the proposal that is expected to be finalized next year and face a litany of legal challenges that could further delay any changes to the rule.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former RBC employee allegedly accessed Prime Minister Mark Carney's banking profile in June.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press A former Royal Bank of Canada RY-T employee is facing criminal charges after allegedly accessing Prime Minister Mark Carney's banking profile and participating in a fraud scheme believed to be linked to organized crime. Ibrahim El-Hakim, who was then a client adviser, allegedly accessed Mr. Carney's profile on June 17 at an RBC branch near Parliament Hill. The 23-year-old Ottawa resident has been charged with fraud over $5,000, unauthorized use of a computer, identity theft and trafficking in identity information, according to court documents. The allegations have not been proven in court. Cheryl Brean, a spokesperson for RBC, said the bank worked closely with law enforcement to support their investigation. “While we cannot comment on specifics of matters before the court, we can share that we independently identified unauthorized system access, took immediate action to engage authorities and the individual named is no longer employed at the bank,” Ms. Brean said in a statement. According to an affidavit from an RCMP officer, RBC's director of security interviewed Mr. El-Hakim on June 27 as part of the bank's internal investigation. The Telegram user asked him to create banking profiles, obtain credit cards and access customer profiles, paying him $500 for each completed request, according to the affidavit. Mr. El-Hakim received a total of $5,000 in payment to his accounts at Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the document said. The RCMP officer's affidavit was filed in Montreal as part of a request to preserve security footage held by Tyco Integrated Security. His lawyer, Ronald Guertin, declined to comment, noting that he has not yet received all of the police information regarding the allegations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched an attack on a Ukrainian Ground Forces training ground on Sept. 24, including two Iskander ballistic missiles, causing casualties among personnel, the military reported. Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military. The military added that efforts are ongoing to fortify training centers, ranges, and other military infrastructure with reinforced shelters to reduce casualties from continued Russian attacks. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted Ukrainian training grounds, including sites far from the front lines. These strikes have raised concerns over the safety of personnel and the preparedness of protective measures at rear-area facilities. Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24. The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff. Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations. The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported. While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine. Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round. Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men. Although the Kremlin declared mobilization "completed," it has never been officially ended by a decree. Russian forces took an underage girl hostage to use her as a human shield after murdering her parents in a front-line village in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24. She was then held hostage to prevent Ukrainian troops from opening fire during the ongoing battle, according to the military. "All radio intercepts confirm that Russian actions were premeditated," the statement read. Murdering civilians and using them as human shields constitutes a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, offered his first public assessment of Ukraine's 2024 cross-border operation in Russia's Kursk Oblast in an op-ed for the Ukrainian news outlet Mirror of the Week on Sept. 24. "I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," he said. Ukraine launched the unprecedented incursion in August 2024, advancing into Russian territory and seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) within the first months. The operation, planned by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, sought to divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and disrupt Moscow's plans to invade Sumy Oblast, which borders Kursk Oblast. Russia, reinforced by around 12,000 North Korean troops, launched a counter-offensive this spring that later forced Ukraine out of most of the captured Russian territory. Zaluzhnyi, the current ambassador to the U.K., said that limited incursions can be undertaken, but practice showed they often failed to deliver long-term success. "Practice has shown that, ultimately, an isolated tactical breakthrough on a narrow section of the front does not bring the necessary success to the attacking side," he wrote. The former military chief added that Russia's forces had managed to leverage "technological and tactical advantages" to blunt Ukraine's gains and later counterattack. Zaluzhnyi's comments contrast with Syrskyi's, who has consistently emphasized heavy Russian losses as the primary achievement of the Kursk campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mother of missing child criticises owners for ‘inviting girls to swim in river that may hold her body' The owners of Camp Mystic in Texas announced reconstruction plans on Monday in a series of emails that were sent to the victims' families and former campers. “We are not only rebuilding cabins and trails, but also a place where laughter, friendship and spiritual growth will continue to flourish,” an email to past campers read. “We look forward to welcoming you back inside the green gates.” The disaster was one of the most lethal floods in US history, with a death toll of at least 120 people — including 36 children. The camp's reopening has been met with fury from victims' families, especially as one child, Cile Steward, eight, remains missing. Her mother, Cici, released a statement on Tuesday condemning plans to reopen the camp. She said: “The truth is, Camp Mystic failed our daughters. “Recovery teams are still out there, scouring the river, risking and sacrificing so much to find her so we can finally lay her to rest. Camp Mystic, however, has only added to our grief,” she wrote. She accused the camp of engaging in a “brief pause before business as usual”. She added: “Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter's body.” Camp Mystic also plans to build a memorial on the camp dedicated to those who were killed in the floods earlier this summer. A statement released by the Eastland family on Tuesday said they had received “no negative comments from any of the bereaved families regarding plans to build a memorial.” But Mr Bonner believes the camp's resources should remain focused on finding Cile's body. The group is calling for legislation in Texas to implement camp safety reforms, including by building new cabins and moving existing ones away from floodplains.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska published on Tuesday found that almost 42% of respondents believe Ukraine should drop its territorial claims for security guarantees and peace. Of the 1,000 Polish adults of voting age surveyed in late-August, 48% were against giving up land claims for peace, with 10% undecided.A survey published only last month by Rzeczpospolita found 37.4% supported concessions, while 50.5% opposed them. Moscow has long insisted that Kiev recognize Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as Russian territory in any peace deal. Kiev has rejected this, with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky vowing last month to retake Crimea – largely populated by ethnic Russians – which voted to join Russia after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. He also pledged to reclaim the four other regions, which joined Russia in 2022, saying “it's only a matter of time.” Poland has been one of Ukraine's top donors since 2022, providing over €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid – more than 70% of it as weapons – according to Germany's Kiel Institute. However, support for Kiev among Polish citizens has been steadily declining. On Sunday, an anti-war rally took place in Warsaw, with demonstrators waving national flags and carrying placards denouncing Poland's involvement in the conflict and military aid for Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly warned that foreign aid only prolongs the conflict and urged a diplomatic solution. It insists any settlement must include Ukrainian neutrality, demilitarization, and recognition of the current territorial reality – including the status of its new regions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov has called for an immediate end to the genocide of the Palestinian people and urged recognition of Palestine's independence during the session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. "We demand an immediate halt to the genocide against the Palestinians and the launch of an international judicial investigation by the UN International Court of Justice," Japarov declared. He stressed that Kyrgyzstan firmly condemns violence and terrorism in all forms, including the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. "Such terrorists must be punished severely. However, there are established methods and procedures for combating terrorism and eliminating terrorists. These are the methods that should be employed," he explained. Japarov went on to insist that the recognition of Palestinian independence is essential. Palestine must achieve independence based on the 1967 borders," he said. The Kyrgyz leader also voiced opposition to missile strikes on Qatar and Iran. "We likewise condemn the recent rocket attacks on the territories of Qatar and Iran, as such actions are an infringement on the sovereignty of independent states, pose a threat to regional stability and security, and violate the norms of international law," Japarov emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. DON GRAVES, JR., was U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce from 2021 to 2025. AROOP MUKHARJI was Senior Adviser for Economic and National Security to the Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce from 2022 to 2024. Until recently, few policy tools united Democrats and Republicans like export controls. In the wrong hands, semiconductors and certain other U.S. technologies can present national security risks. In August, the administration brokered a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia, a U.S. company that designs semiconductor chips used to power artificial intelligence. Previously, the U.S. government reviewed license applications to ensure transactions did not present unacceptable risks. Although Beijing banned Chinese companies from buying Nvidia's chips last week, after accusing the company of violating antimonopoly laws, the Trump administration's deal is part of a worrying trend: the monetization of national security. Instead of treating security as an indivisible, priceless ideal—similar to free and fair elections, free speech, or freedom of religion—the administration is treating U.S. national security as if it were a portfolio of divisible, priceable assets. Reducing national security to dollars and cents does not just distort the term's meaning; it also makes the United States less secure. Replacing licenses with revenue-sharing deals, making certain types of direct investments, and squeezing U.S. allies and partners may all help fill U.S. government coffers. But policies designed to maximize short-term gain can create new security problems and leave the old ones unsolved. They will enable U.S. technology to more easily reach American adversaries, cost the U.S. government oversight over taxpayer money, and sacrifice Washington's ability to shape the world around it. True economic security will remain out of reach as long as the government is run as a business, its policy levers and relationships priced, bundled, and repriced, available to be bought and sold. As the historians Peter Roady and Andrew Preston have recently documented, during his 1932 election campaign and following presidential term, Franklin Roosevelt deliberately defined the phrase to capture risks to domestic economic well-being. In his second fireside chat in 1933, Roosevelt argued that economic struggle led to “incalculable” social harm and a “loss of that sense of security.” A new domestic economic program was “imperative to our national security,” he declared, later summarizing, “Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.” Roosevelt's original interpretation of national security later gave way to a more militarized, more expansive conception, reinforced by the interests of a growing arms industry and the rise of the modern military-industrial complex. It came to encompass every corner of the world. Four years later, President Joe Biden's 2021 interim national security guidance repeated the same mantra: “Economic security is national security.” Biden's Department of Commerce played a greater role in national security policy than anyone in government could remember, not just with export controls but also in work on supply chains, cybersecurity, information and communication technology, climate change, investment security, law enforcement, commercial diplomacy, standards development, patents, domestic investment, and even commercial space policy. There was substantial bipartisan alignment on many of these issues. It is not simply that economic, technology, and trade policy became more appealing arrows in the national security quiver. But more significantly, on a philosophical level, leading Democrats and Republicans agreed that security itself meant much more than an absence of physical attack. The first Trump administration's relentless focus on manufacturing domestically to rely less on others and its concern that Huawei and TikTok could give the Chinese government access to American data, furthermore, continued into the Biden administration. With notable exceptions, such as export controls, Democratic and Republican policy solutions were not always the same, but everyone largely agreed on what the problem was. The H20 chip deal with Nvidia is one way it has done this, by allowing a company whose business with China presents a national security threat to buy off that risk. But in principle, a riskless export control license is an oxymoron; licenses are required only when the government has identified a risk. It did so for the H20 chip just a few months ago, in April. This is the reason paying for export control licenses is prohibited under U.S. law (Title 50 of the U.S. Code), to prevent a situation in which financial gain takes precedence over national security concerns. When export controls are about money rather than security standards, U.S. technology will easily reach malign actors. Possible legal complications, however, have not stopped the Trump administration from pursuing this kind of arrangement. It has already reached a deal with another technology company, AMD, to give the U.S. government 15 percent of its revenue from selling its MI308 processors in China—something Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (whose department does not oversee dual-use export controls) called a “beta test.” The administration could continue to replicate this model, and not just in export control cases. If an investment presents any kind of concern, such as data security, however, pretending the problem does not exist because someone has agreed to pay the government is not a real solution. And left unresolved, a national security problem will only fester. The monetization of national security has not been limited to revenue-sharing deals. The administration is also exploring direct investment in U.S. companies. Most notably, the government announced in August that it was purchasing a ten percent stake (roughly $8.9 billion) in Intel, the United States' largest semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike revenue-sharing deals, direct investment is unusual but not unprecedented. There can be legitimate reasons for the government to invest in a company that is critical to national security and needs help. But making money should not be the primary goal—a single company's payouts to the government should not be prioritized above nationwide security interests. The largest grant supported manufacturing projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and the company was obligated to report on project milestones and follow national security guardrails that, among other things, limited its activities with foreign countries of concern. Also embedded in the grant program was a provision to return money to taxpayers in the case of unanticipated profits, called “upside sharing.” But instead of continuing to disburse grant money and keeping these protections in place, the U.S. government opted for equity. This meant more cash up front for Intel and potentially more future revenue for the federal government but—critically—a significant loss of oversight of taxpayer dollars. Intel may decide to use those dollars in ways that support national security interests. Finally, the administration has monetized national security through its approach to U.S. military support and foreign aid, helping others if it brings a financial return. “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” the then candidate Trump said in 2024. “You know, we're no different than an insurance company.” Shortly after Trump's election, Taiwan pledged to increase its spending on U.S. weapons; in the early months of his presidency, Trump's frequent complaints about allied free-riding pressured others to do the same. The administration followed a similar mercenary logic in pursuing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine in exchange for Washington's continued support for Kyiv's war effort and in canceling U.S. foreign aid across the globe. To replace a “charity-based model” of development assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in July, the administration would instead seek investment opportunities that produce “a multiplier effect” that benefits the private sector. Yet likening aid to an insurance policy or a market venture misses the greatest strategic value of supporting others. Aside from the compelling morality of alleviating human suffering, this aid can provide a bulwark against foreign manipulation, the emergence of terrorist havens, the growth of black markets, and other security threats that arise from chronic underdevelopment and economic struggle. Those interests, like so many others—nuclear nonproliferation, maintaining robust alliances, supporting democracy—have little to do with immediate financial returns. In doing so, it betrays a fundamentally different view of what national security is—one that suggests security can be priced at all. Monetization can even create new vulnerabilities and sources of insecurity by incentivizing affluent players to join the game. Take, for instance, Qatar's gift of a gleaming $400 million airplane to transport the U.S. president. Truly advancing economic security requires that policymakers navigate tradeoffs, recognize that other countries hold leverage, engage partners, and play the long game. Maintaining a bird's-eye view of tradeoffs and tensions in economic security policy is essential to making wise decisions. Economic actions taken on behalf of national security, such as export controls, could have the unintended effect of limiting economic growth and innovation. More narrowly targeted trade arrangements would help minimize adverse effects on American consumers, producers, and investors. The United States does not exist in a unipolar world, controlling supply chains and economic chokepoints. Frustrations with U.S. tariff policies have already breathed new life into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an economic and security body that encompasses more than 40 percent of the world's population and aspires to be a strategic counterweight to the United States' presence in Asia. Building trusted supply chains, protecting data, and executing export controls, for instance, all rely on coordination with international partners and, perhaps more important, with industry. It is accomplished through regular, deliberative bureaucratic conversations and adherence to process. By genuinely seeking input from its partners, the United States can avoid the kind of harmful backlash to its policies that ultimately undermines U.S. influence. Finally, policymakers must recognize that economic security is a long game. Yet many national security professionals mistakenly assume that they will see the same immediate results as decisive military action. This is what makes development aid—which the Trump administration has slashed as a supposed cost-saving measure—so valuable. But helping build a healthier and more prosperous world reduces the chances of many bad outcomes. The United States' security challenges are becoming only more complex, and policymakers are still figuring out how best to address them using the economic tools at their disposal. Yet one guiding principle is clear: a democratic government does not exist to enrich itself.National security policy, therefore, should not seek profits or involve opportunistic bonus payments.
