                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A broad draft Authorization for Use of Military Force could give wide latitude to go after supposed “narco-terrorists.” Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. A draft proposal to authorize the use of U.S. military force against drug cartels is currently floating around Congress and the White House, according to a recent New York Times report. Although an official version of the proposal has yet to be released, publicly available information suggests that it could be used to justify U.S. military intervention in at least 60 countries. Human Rights Watch called the strikes “unlawful extrajudicial killings.” How far Washington should go in its new counternarcotics campaign has been a source of controversy within the Trump administration. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. An “Authorization for Use of Military Force” (AUMF) is the instrument most often used to provide legal justification for military hostilities today. AUMF legislation passed in response to the 9/11 attacks laid the groundwork for a “Global War on Terror” that included targeting many suspects who had nothing to do with 9/11. Because of its extremely broad language, the 2001 AUMF has since been used to justify military interventions in at least 22 countries. Apparently modeled on the 2001 AUMF, Mills' new AUMF is similarly broad: although it only lasts for five years, the authorization does not identify specific targets and contains no geographic restrictions. Earlier this year, the White House added a long list of Latin American drug cartels to the national “Foreign Terrorist Organizations” (FTO) list. Although the full text of Mills' AUMF hasn't been confirmed, under his reported proposal, the president could have the authority to wage war against any of these organizations, regardless of where they are operating. Based on what is known about it so far, Mills' proposal would leave “a large amount of discretion in the hands of the executive to make determinations about who ‘counts' within the scope of targeting,” said Elizabeth Beavers, assistant professor of law at Widener University's Delaware Law School. Other countries with Sinaloa Cartel activity include Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama, and Thailand. But this is only one of many cartels that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the Trump administration. Cartels like Tren de Aragua have an established presence in Costa Rica. Meanwhile, the Trump administration designated several more countries as high-priority drug transit routes, specifically arguing that our “assistance” was “vital to the national interests of the United States” in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Myanmar, and Venezuela. “There are still a whole host of constitutional protections against extrajudicial targeting of persons within the U.S. that an AUMF doesn't just sweep away,” said Beavers. Still, this assumes that the president would be willing to abide by these protections. “This entire conversation about lawfulness rests entirely on what the other branches of government, including the courts, are willing to do about such violations,” she added. Such a list would likely include the Taliban's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanon, and a long list of countries alleged by the U.S. government to have al-Qaeda affiliates: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. While there's currently no indication that Congress is eager to take up, let alone pass, an extremely broad new military force authorization, if it were to become law, it would fully merge two of the largest policy failures in U.S. history — the War on Drugs and the War on Terror — into one singular concept that could expand armed conflict throughout the entire Western hemisphere and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital city, told reporters Wednesday: “People are wondering what it is about this Muslim mayor who leads a liberal, multi-cultural, progressive and successful city that means I appear to be living rent-free inside Donald Trump's head.” London City Hall had earlier responded to Trump's remarks, saying in a statement: “London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.” It refers to a set of principles that govern the moral and religious lives of Muslims on matters as varied as prayer, finance, divorce or halal food. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended Khan in a post on X Tuesday, writing: “Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London.” Trump was in the United Kingdom last week for an unprecedented second state visit. Second-term US presidents aren't typically afforded the pomp of two official trips. A state banquet was held in his honor at Windsor Castle, but his itinerary didn't include a journey to the British capital – where crowds of protesters had gathered. Khan, who was elected in 2016, is a strong critic of Trump, notably giving permission for protesters to fly a 20-foot-tall “Trump baby” balloon in London during his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. On the campaign trail before his first term as president, Trump pledged to ban Muslims from the US once in office. Khan at the time deemed it an “outrageous policy.” Khan later called Trump's views on Islam “ignorant,” to which the president hit back, saying, “I will remember those statements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italy said it deployed one of its naval vessels on Wednesday to come to the aid of an aid flotilla that was targeted by drones while trying to reach Gaza, with activists claiming that Israel was behind the strikes. Volunteers from the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) – an organization trying to get aid into the besieged enclave using ships setting sail from ports across the Mediterranean – say that some of their vessels were targeted by drones. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. “In the final days before reaching Gaza, the GSF is experiencing an alarmingly dangerous escalation, with multiple boats reporting targeted explosions and unidentified objects being dropped on and near the boats, causing significant damage and widespread obstruction in communication,” the organization said in a statement Tuesday. There are variety of nationals on board the vessels, including citizens from Italy, Sweden and Spain, CNN understands. “I think this has to escalate further and further and reach … European Commission levels, because this needs to be tackled, coordinated with all the countries, at least in Europe,” lawmaker Juan Bordera told Reuters. Bordera added that those on the flotilla were “stressed” and lived through a “crazy, crazy nightmare” amid Tuesday night's explosions. On Tuesday, Israel's foreign ministry said on X that the country would take “necessary measures” to stop the flotilla from reaching Gaza. The ministry said it would be willing to transfer the aid from the flotilla to Gaza through the Ashkelon port in Israel, but it accused flotilla organizers of refusing such a transfer and “pursuing a violent course of action.” Francesca Albanese, United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on X that the flotilla had come under attack 14 times between Tunis and Crete. “Four vessels are now damaged and require urgent repair. UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan has called for an “independent, impartial and thorough investigation” into the reported attacks. Italy has authorized the dispatch of an Italian naval vessel, which according to a statement from Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, is now en route to the area for possible rescue operations. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke of her “total condemnation” of the drone strike on Tuesday night, calling it “gratuitous, dangerous and irresponsible.” Meloni added that Italy is “conducting our own investigation to determine who is responsible.” “To ensure their safety, the foreign ministry had already notified the Israeli authorities that any operation entrusted to Israel's armed forces be conducted in compliance with international law and the principle of absolute caution,” a statement from Italy's foreign ministry said. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is working to mediate with the Israeli government to allow the humanitarian supplies transported by the flotilla to enter Gaza, a spokesperson for his office told CNN. Meanwhile, Sweden's foreign ministry said it is following the developments very closely, adding that approximately 15 Swedish nationals were aboard the vessels. In May, activists on board an aid ship say they were targeted by an Israeli drone in international waters off the coast of Malta. An Israeli Air Force cargo plane was picked up on flight trackers circling the waters near Malta for an extended period of time before the attack.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24. The confirmation follows a reported overnight attack on the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in Russia's Republic of Bashkortostan. The Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat facility is one of Russia's largest oil refining and petrochemical plants, producing 150 different types of products, including gasoline and diesel fuel. It is located some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff. Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations. The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. The plant processes up to 3.2 million tons of oil products annually, according to the General Staff. Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks on Russia's oil industry over the past year, forcing operational suspensions and exacerbating a nationwide fuel shortage.

She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. One of the largest oil refineries in Russia, the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in the Republic of Bashkortostan, came under Ukrainian attack overnight on Sept. 24. The cyberattack disrupted automated check-in systems caused flight cancellations and delays at several major European airports. Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military. While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine. The A330 aircraft was traveling to Lithuania's Siauliai air base, reportedly also carrying relatives of Spanish air force personnel deployed as part of a NATO air policing mission. "I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," said Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief. A Russian unit broke into a house and killed the girl's parents before abducting her, Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24. Responding to Trump's comment that Russia looks like a "paper tiger," Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said that "Russia is more commonly associated with a bear.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conservative youth group chapters will counter ‘woke indoctrination', says Ryan Walters After far-right activist Charlie Kirk was killed on a college campus earlier this month, requests to start chapters of his conservative youth group, Turning Point, at colleges and high schools have surged, the organization has said. In a press release on Tuesday, Ryan Walters, the Oklahoma superintendent, detailed how students could start a chapter of “Club America”, the organization's high school program, by gathering at least three students from the same school and completing a charter agreement. Then, Turning Point will help the club get a teacher sponsor and official recognition, and send materials such as an “activism kit”. In a video posted on X, Walters railed further against the “radical leftists” who “dominate classrooms and push woke indoctrination”. When asked by a local reporter what would happen in a school that said it wouldn't open a chapter of the group, Walters said he would go after the school's accreditation. “They would be in danger of not being a school district if they decided to reject a club that is here to promote civic engagement,” he said. “Everything would be on the table in that scenario.” Nadine Gallagher, a teacher in Oklahoma, told local news station KOCO that if students wanted to start a club, she's “all for it”. But, she said, “I don't like forced anything.” Andrew Kolvet, the spokesman for Turning Point USA, said the group has received a “massive surge of inquiries to start new chapters”, particularly after Sunday's memorial for Kirk. Even accounting for attrition and duplicates, we are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and College campus in America,” Kolvet wrote on X. Turning Point chapters organize around conservative principles, and the organization's activism kits “promote issues ranging from voter registration, free speech and gun access, to kits entitled ‘Make America Healthy Again'”, according to USA Today. Turning Point chapters on college campuses also host conservative speakers. Kirk often went on college speaking tours to debate students and advanced views in person and on his podcast that were at times racist, sexist or otherwise derogatory, including that there was a “great replacement strategy” underway via immigration, that Islam is a “a threat to America” and that “in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people”. Walters has come under fire for repeated instances of pushing religion and rightwing politics in Oklahoma schools. He pushed to include 2020 election fraud conspiracies in the state's high school social studies curriculum. Walters also put out a press release on 17 September claiming that teachers who made derogatory comments about Kirk after his death would be fired. The department identified 70 certified teachers who “have made statements regarding Charlie Kirk's murder”. “Any teacher posting defamatory and egregious comments will NOT be teaching in Oklahoma classrooms and any school that refused to participate in a moment of silence and/or lower their flags for Charlie Kirk is currently under investigation,” the press release said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska published on Tuesday found that almost 42% of respondents believe Ukraine should drop its territorial claims for security guarantees and peace. Of the 1,000 Polish adults of voting age surveyed in late-August, 48% were against giving up land claims for peace, with 10% undecided.A survey published only last month by Rzeczpospolita found 37.4% supported concessions, while 50.5% opposed them. Moscow has long insisted that Kiev recognize Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as Russian territory in any peace deal. Kiev has rejected this, with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky vowing last month to retake Crimea – largely populated by ethnic Russians – which voted to join Russia after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. He also pledged to reclaim the four other regions, which joined Russia in 2022, saying “it's only a matter of time.” Poland has been one of Ukraine's top donors since 2022, providing over €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid – more than 70% of it as weapons – according to Germany's Kiel Institute. However, support for Kiev among Polish citizens has been steadily declining. On Sunday, an anti-war rally took place in Warsaw, with demonstrators waving national flags and carrying placards denouncing Poland's involvement in the conflict and military aid for Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly warned that foreign aid only prolongs the conflict and urged a diplomatic solution. It insists any settlement must include Ukrainian neutrality, demilitarization, and recognition of the current territorial reality – including the status of its new regions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday named an eventual successor to New Orleans' embattled Catholic archbishop, Gregory Aymond, two weeks after his archdiocese agreed to settle with survivors of clergy sexual abuse for $230m. Leo, history's first US pope, named bishop James Checchio of Metuchen, New Jersey, as the coadjutor bishop of New Orleans. The role positions Checchio to assist Aymond initially and then succeed him when he retires. The New Orleans archdiocese agreed on 8 September to a $230m proposed settlement to end one of the US church's longest and most contentious battles over abuse claims. It had proposed in May to pay at least $179.2m in response to more than 500 abuse claims, but victims' attorneys opposed the deal as too low. The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020, rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors say allowed church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court. The archdiocese's largest insurer, Travelers, for now has held out against a settlement. If it ultimately decides to contribute to a settlement rather than risk facing litigation from individual abuse claimants, the amount of the settlement in the New Orleans archdiocese bankruptcy would ostensibly increase from $230m. Aymond had resisted calls for his resignation over the church's management of its decades-old clergy abuse scandal, which in New Orleans has thrust the local archdiocese under law enforcement investigation for alleged child sex trafficking. Media investigations in February revealed that the archdiocese received help from executives of professional American football's New Orleans Saints with respect to softening critical press coverage of the church's management of the clergy-abuse scandal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported. While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine. Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round. Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men. Although the Kremlin declared mobilization "completed," it has never been officially ended by a decree. Since then, Moscow has sought to avoid another large-scale mobilization by ramping up contract recruitment, offering financial incentives to volunteers. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. The cyberattack disrupted automated check-in systems caused flight cancellations and delays at several major European airports. Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military. While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine. The A330 aircraft was traveling to Lithuania's Siauliai air base, reportedly also carrying relatives of Spanish air force personnel deployed as part of a NATO air policing mission. "I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," said Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief. A Russian unit broke into a house and killed the girl's parents before abducting her, Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Construction continues at the Lithium Nevada Corp. mine site Tracker Pass project on April 24, 2023, near Orovada, NevRick Bowmer/The Associated Press U.S.-listed shares of Lithium Americas (LAC-N, LAC-T) jumped over 100 per cent on Wednesday after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is seeking up to a 10 per cent stake in the miner, in the latest sign of Washington's intervention into industries it considers critical to national security. Vancouver-based Lithium Americas said on Wednesday it was in discussions with the U.S. energy department and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan. The move underscores President Donald Trump's increasing use of direct government ownership to steer strategic sectors and curb reliance on China, which dominates refining of many critical minerals. China produces over 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually, ranking third after Australia and Chile, but dominates refining, processing more than 75 per cent of the world's lithium into battery-grade material. TD Cowen analysts said a government stake would lend credence to the Thacker Pass project completion and expansion to multiple phases with perhaps enhanced economics. The project is seen as a linchpin in building a domestic supply chain part of Washington's long-standing drive to boost U.S. production of lithium, a metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. Jefferies said the administration's preference for equity stakes, viewed as lower political cost than tax increases, can support financing, corporate profits, and favorable returns on invested capital. NBCFM Research analyst Mohamed Sidibe said the MP Materials-DoD model shows how government equity, long-term offtake, and price support can derisk strategic projects. He added for Lithium Americas, a similar approach could strengthen funding and project durability, though it may dilute existing shareholders. The Thacker Pass project is expected to begin production in 2028. Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said an equity stake could include offtake price guarantees, potentially making Thacker Pass profitable even if lithium prices remain lower for longer. The news also lifted other lithium miners in premarket trading. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameco shares have more than doubled in the last year.Liam Richards/The Canadian Press When Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Donald Trump in the White House in early May, the U.S. President rambled off a list of products, including cars and steel, that he said the United States did not need from Canada. America's nuclear power supply chain is currently vulnerable, with about 25 per cent of the country's enriched uranium being sourced from Russia. That reality likely prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to champion the expansion of America's uranium stockpiles as he was attending the International Atomic Energy Agency general conference in Vienna on Sept. 15 The news sparked renewed interest in uranium stocks which have already been in a bull market. Cameco CCO-T shares have more than doubled over the past 12 months, and insiders at the uranium mining giant have been in profit-taking mode. As of Sept. 19, 14 Cameco insiders have sold just over $12.7-million worth of stock into the public market over the past six months. The 130,787 shares were sold at an average price of $97.34. During the same period, four insiders acquired a total of 91,325 shares through the exercise of options at strike prices ranging from $11.32 to $15.27. Last week, the stock had a trailing 12-month P/E ratio above 90. That said, Cameco does rank high in terms of price momentum, and it is conceivable that the stock could continue to rise despite insider profit-taking and its price tag. In our experience, insider selling in large companies can often take place months and even years before a stock enters a meaningful correction. Uranium miner Cameco lowers 2025 production forecast amid McArthur River mine transition delays In terms of actionable signals, we generally tend to favour insider buying over selling. On that front, two smaller names have hit our screens recently. Mega Uranium MGA-T is an investment and junior exploration company which is currently in the top 10 per cent of our rankings with a sunny INK Edge outlook. It caught our attention as a potential value play. If bullish uranium sentiment picks up more steam in the months ahead, junior names like Mega Uranium, which have lagged some larger names, could conceivably benefit from increased investor flows. Shootaring Canyon is one of three licensed, permitted, and constructed conventional uranium mills in the U.S. On May 13, Velvet-Wood became the first uranium project fast-tracked under Mr. Trump's energy emergency declaration. We often hear Mr, Carney talk about Canada building projects at speeds never imagined. Despite the headlines, Anfield stock has failed to surpass its 52-week high of $10.13 set last October. Chief operating officer Daniel Bleak appears to see opportunity. Over the past three months, he has bought 7,750 at an average price of $7.95 on a post-consolidation basis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of US government employees who lost their jobs in Elon Musk's cost-cutting drive are being asked to return to work. Those who accept must report for duty on Oct 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid leave. Mr Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identified the GSA, which had about 12,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration, as a chief target of its campaign to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government. Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees left the agency in programs that encouraged them to resign or take early retirement. The GSA sent more than 800 lease cancellation notices to landlords, in many cases without informing the tenants. Pushback against the GSA's dumping of its portfolio was swift, and both initiatives had been scaled back. More than 480 leases put forward for termination by Doge have since been spared. The leases were for offices scattered around the country that are occupied by such agencies as the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and Food and Drug Administration. Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official, said: “Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed. Mr Becker, who represents owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions, said GSA had been in a “triage mode” for months. He said the sudden reversal of the downsizing reflected how Mr Musk and Doge had gone too far, too fast. Doge's “wall of receipts,” which once boasted that the lease cancellations alone would save nearly $460m, has since reduced that estimate to $140m by the end of July, according to Mr Becker. As part of its cost-cutting drive, the GSA cut the GSA's headquarters staff by 79 per cent, its portfolio managers by 65 per cent and facilities managers by 35 per cent, according to a federal official.</p>

The late-night show was suspended after Kimmel said in his monologue that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” and that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” MAGA stands for President Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” policy agenda.</p>

Japarov went on to insist that the recognition of Palestinian independence is essential. Palestine must achieve independence based on the 1967 borders," he said. The Kyrgyz leader also voiced opposition to missile strikes on Qatar and Iran. "We likewise condemn the recent rocket attacks on the territories of Qatar and Iran, as such actions are an infringement on the sovereignty of independent states, pose a threat to regional stability and security, and violate the norms of international law," Japarov emphasized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. DON GRAVES, JR., was U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce from 2021 to 2025. AROOP MUKHARJI was Senior Adviser for Economic and National Security to the Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce from 2022 to 2024. Until recently, few policy tools united Democrats and Republicans like export controls. In the wrong hands, semiconductors and certain other U.S. technologies can present national security risks. In August, the administration brokered a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia, a U.S. company that designs semiconductor chips used to power artificial intelligence. Previously, the U.S. government reviewed license applications to ensure transactions did not present unacceptable risks. Although Beijing banned Chinese companies from buying Nvidia's chips last week, after accusing the company of violating antimonopoly laws, the Trump administration's deal is part of a worrying trend: the monetization of national security. Instead of treating security as an indivisible, priceless ideal—similar to free and fair elections, free speech, or freedom of religion—the administration is treating U.S. national security as if it were a portfolio of divisible, priceable assets. Reducing national security to dollars and cents does not just distort the term's meaning; it also makes the United States less secure. Replacing licenses with revenue-sharing deals, making certain types of direct investments, and squeezing U.S. allies and partners may all help fill U.S. government coffers. But policies designed to maximize short-term gain can create new security problems and leave the old ones unsolved. They will enable U.S. technology to more easily reach American adversaries, cost the U.S. government oversight over taxpayer money, and sacrifice Washington's ability to shape the world around it. True economic security will remain out of reach as long as the government is run as a business, its policy levers and relationships priced, bundled, and repriced, available to be bought and sold. As the historians Peter Roady and Andrew Preston have recently documented, during his 1932 election campaign and following presidential term, Franklin Roosevelt deliberately defined the phrase to capture risks to domestic economic well-being. In his second fireside chat in 1933, Roosevelt argued that economic struggle led to “incalculable” social harm and a “loss of that sense of security.” A new domestic economic program was “imperative to our national security,” he declared, later summarizing, “Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.” Roosevelt's original interpretation of national security later gave way to a more militarized, more expansive conception, reinforced by the interests of a growing arms industry and the rise of the modern military-industrial complex. It came to encompass every corner of the world. Four years later, President Joe Biden's 2021 interim national security guidance repeated the same mantra: “Economic security is national security.” Biden's Department of Commerce played a greater role in national security policy than anyone in government could remember, not just with export controls but also in work on supply chains, cybersecurity, information and communication technology, climate change, investment security, law enforcement, commercial diplomacy, standards development, patents, domestic investment, and even commercial space policy. There was substantial bipartisan alignment on many of these issues. It is not simply that economic, technology, and trade policy became more appealing arrows in the national security quiver. But more significantly, on a philosophical level, leading Democrats and Republicans agreed that security itself meant much more than an absence of physical attack. The first Trump administration's relentless focus on manufacturing domestically to rely less on others and its concern that Huawei and TikTok could give the Chinese government access to American data, furthermore, continued into the Biden administration. With notable exceptions, such as export controls, Democratic and Republican policy solutions were not always the same, but everyone largely agreed on what the problem was. The H20 chip deal with Nvidia is one way it has done this, by allowing a company whose business with China presents a national security threat to buy off that risk. But in principle, a riskless export control license is an oxymoron; licenses are required only when the government has identified a risk. It did so for the H20 chip just a few months ago, in April. This is the reason paying for export control licenses is prohibited under U.S. law (Title 50 of the U.S. Code), to prevent a situation in which financial gain takes precedence over national security concerns. When export controls are about money rather than security standards, U.S. technology will easily reach malign actors. Possible legal complications, however, have not stopped the Trump administration from pursuing this kind of arrangement. It has already reached a deal with another technology company, AMD, to give the U.S. government 15 percent of its revenue from selling its MI308 processors in China—something Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (whose department does not oversee dual-use export controls) called a “beta test.” The administration could continue to replicate this model, and not just in export control cases. If an investment presents any kind of concern, such as data security, however, pretending the problem does not exist because someone has agreed to pay the government is not a real solution. And left unresolved, a national security problem will only fester. The monetization of national security has not been limited to revenue-sharing deals. The administration is also exploring direct investment in U.S. companies. Most notably, the government announced in August that it was purchasing a ten percent stake (roughly $8.9 billion) in Intel, the United States' largest semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike revenue-sharing deals, direct investment is unusual but not unprecedented. There can be legitimate reasons for the government to invest in a company that is critical to national security and needs help. But making money should not be the primary goal—a single company's payouts to the government should not be prioritized above nationwide security interests. The largest grant supported manufacturing projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and the company was obligated to report on project milestones and follow national security guardrails that, among other things, limited its activities with foreign countries of concern. Also embedded in the grant program was a provision to return money to taxpayers in the case of unanticipated profits, called “upside sharing.” But instead of continuing to disburse grant money and keeping these protections in place, the U.S. government opted for equity. This meant more cash up front for Intel and potentially more future revenue for the federal government but—critically—a significant loss of oversight of taxpayer dollars. Intel may decide to use those dollars in ways that support national security interests. Finally, the administration has monetized national security through its approach to U.S. military support and foreign aid, helping others if it brings a financial return. “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” the then candidate Trump said in 2024. “You know, we're no different than an insurance company.” Shortly after Trump's election, Taiwan pledged to increase its spending on U.S. weapons; in the early months of his presidency, Trump's frequent complaints about allied free-riding pressured others to do the same. The administration followed a similar mercenary logic in pursuing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine in exchange for Washington's continued support for Kyiv's war effort and in canceling U.S. foreign aid across the globe. To replace a “charity-based model” of development assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in July, the administration would instead seek investment opportunities that produce “a multiplier effect” that benefits the private sector. Yet likening aid to an insurance policy or a market venture misses the greatest strategic value of supporting others. Aside from the compelling morality of alleviating human suffering, this aid can provide a bulwark against foreign manipulation, the emergence of terrorist havens, the growth of black markets, and other security threats that arise from chronic underdevelopment and economic struggle. Those interests, like so many others—nuclear nonproliferation, maintaining robust alliances, supporting democracy—have little to do with immediate financial returns. In doing so, it betrays a fundamentally different view of what national security is—one that suggests security can be priced at all. Monetization can even create new vulnerabilities and sources of insecurity by incentivizing affluent players to join the game. Take, for instance, Qatar's gift of a gleaming $400 million airplane to transport the U.S. president. Truly advancing economic security requires that policymakers navigate tradeoffs, recognize that other countries hold leverage, engage partners, and play the long game. Maintaining a bird's-eye view of tradeoffs and tensions in economic security policy is essential to making wise decisions. Economic actions taken on behalf of national security, such as export controls, could have the unintended effect of limiting economic growth and innovation. More narrowly targeted trade arrangements would help minimize adverse effects on American consumers, producers, and investors. The United States does not exist in a unipolar world, controlling supply chains and economic chokepoints. Frustrations with U.S. tariff policies have already breathed new life into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an economic and security body that encompasses more than 40 percent of the world's population and aspires to be a strategic counterweight to the United States' presence in Asia. Building trusted supply chains, protecting data, and executing export controls, for instance, all rely on coordination with international partners and, perhaps more important, with industry. It is accomplished through regular, deliberative bureaucratic conversations and adherence to process. By genuinely seeking input from its partners, the United States can avoid the kind of harmful backlash to its policies that ultimately undermines U.S. influence. Finally, policymakers must recognize that economic security is a long game. Yet many national security professionals mistakenly assume that they will see the same immediate results as decisive military action. This is what makes development aid—which the Trump administration has slashed as a supposed cost-saving measure—so valuable. But helping build a healthier and more prosperous world reduces the chances of many bad outcomes. The United States' security challenges are becoming only more complex, and policymakers are still figuring out how best to address them using the economic tools at their disposal. Yet one guiding principle is clear: a democratic government does not exist to enrich itself.National security policy, therefore, should not seek profits or involve opportunistic bonus payments.
