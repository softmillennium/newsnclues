                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman give their verdicts on how the Azerbaijan Grand Prix went for Haas. A good getaway saw him fighting with Nico Hulkenberg, but unfortunately the duo collided. He was asked afterwards whether the early collision hampered his race. “Luckily it didn't – I think for both our races. At least I didn't have heavy damage,” he explained. We will review – it has been a difficult weekend for us. “I think there are a lot of things we can improve for next weekend and this is what we will look out for in Singapore.” Those were just the latest in a series of issues for Haas, which Ocon wants to see rectified moving forwards. “Yesterday [we had] a brake problem, in Monza we had an issue with the front end of the car really that was quite big. As for Bearman, he knew that Q2 crash was costly as it meant a P15 starting slot on a day where there was only one race retiree, and limited options to move forward. “Qualifying was tough this weekend; I did a mistake in Q2 that meant I didn't put a lap on the board. Of course, it was very tricky conditions but that is no excuse. So yeah, just need some improvements [needed] for Singapore,” was his take. But starting 15th, lost a few places on the early laps with the Safety Car restart and after that I was really stuck. “In the first stint, I lost a lot of time stuck behind [Franco] Colapinto and [Lance] Stroll, and after that it was really damage limitation. The car was quick but I couldn't do much with it.” Haas head to Singapore sitting ninth in the standings, 11 points behind Kick Sauber.</p>

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola delve into the factors that have given Red Bull a well-balanced car across recent races.

The Max Verstappen/Red Bull resurgence of the last two races has inevitably led to speculation about whether this winning form can be extended beyond just the outlying low-downforce demands of Monza and Baku.

Team boss Laurent Mekies was urging caution of that idea in Baku, saying: “The people back at the factory have been working so hard in trying to understand what has been limiting us with this car. We have been developing our understanding on this and this has been helping.
