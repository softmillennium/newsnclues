                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, or CCHFV, is a biosafety level 4 pathogen and a Category A bioterrorism agent, causing severe viral hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates reaching up to 40%. There is currently no approved vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for CCHFV. "This project will identify broadly protective antibody candidates that can be developed into potential therapies." The research brings together an interdisciplinary and international team to tackle one of the world's most dangerous emerging viral threats. The team includes co-principal investigator Dr. Mohammad Sajadi, a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine; and co-investigators Aura Garrison and Joseph Golden, who are research microbiologists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, a long-time leader in hemorrhagic fever virus research. The project will study survivors of CCHFV in Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Uganda to find antibodies that protect against the virus. A monoclonal antibody is a type of lab-made protein that mimics the immune system's ability to fight harmful viruses or bacteria. By focusing on non-traditional viral targets, our approach could lead to new, life-saving therapeutics and help establish a framework for addressing future nairovirus outbreaks." Other partners on the project include scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Hitit University in Turkey, and South Kazakhstan Medical Academy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Université de Montréal's affiliated hospital research centre (CRCHUM) are testing out a mobile application to help young adults who have a first episode of psychosis to support safer cannabis consumption. The nationwide clinical trial, a first in Canada, is led by Université de Montréal psychiatry and addictology professor Didier Jutras-Aswad, a researcher at CRCHUM. Called CHAMPS (Cannabis Harm-reducing App to Manage Practices Safely), the pilot study is described in an article published in the August issue of Psychiatry Research. Built in collaboration with young adults, clinicians and a number of experts, our app includes interactive modules and personalized support to reduce risks associated with cannabis consumption." "Our pilot study confirmed its acceptability among youth having experienced a first psychotic episode," he said. The pilot study was conducted with the support of a multidisciplinary team that included Stephanie Coronado-Montoya, the study's first author and former PhD student of Jutras-Aswad's, and Dr. Amal Abdel-Baki, a psychiatrist at CHUM, among others. The goal of the project is to provide an alternative to traditional care centred on abstinence and which is often inadequate for young adults who have experienced a first episode of psychosis and who do not plan to stop their cannabis consumption. "When comparing standard care to an approach that includes CHAMPS, we can see that the app is well regarded and that it can be integrated into real clinical environments," said Jutras-Aswad. "Even if we cannot currently draw any conclusions about CHAMPS's efficacy, we have seen an encouraging signal in terms of a decrease in cannabis-related problems," he said. Recruitment will take place over a three-year period. CHAMPS is more than a phone app, its proponents say: it could easily be included in existing clinical care, without increasing workloads for medical personnel. In fact, the researchers add, it exemplifies a new approach to mental health care, one that is specifically designed to meet the actual needs of an often neglected young adult population. "Many people don't seek to, at least for a certain period of time, reduce or cease their cannabis use," said Jutras-Aswad. CHAMPS joins a larger movement that is working toward humanizing, personalizing and destigmatizing cannabis use in mental health care, he said. "It's very important that we change perceptions, practices and philosophies in order to more broadly adopt harm reduction in mental health care," he emphasized. To that end, in July, he and his team published several Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Cannabis Use-Related Adverse Psychosis Outcomes, actively promoting their approach via an international group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The diagnosis and medical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a condition that according to leading researchers in the field should be treated, has now advanced significantly. A series of articles in The Lancet provides both a comprehensive and thorough review of current research. We have reached a stage where Alzheimer's disease is no longer something you can do little about. Similarly, there is a consensus that people undergoing memory assessments should be offered a finger prick so that their blood can be analyzed for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, preferably at an early stage when memory and mental abilities still only reveal mild symptoms. The answer to these questions is yes, the tests are adequate, and the medicines are useful and should be used, as long as the risk of side effects, such as cardiovascular disease, is properly managed,” says Henrik Zetterberg. Swedish healthcare is waiting for regulatory approval before the medicines can start being used. Meanwhile, more and more blood samples for Alzheimer's testing are being taken during basic memory assessments in Swedish primary care, as a complement to cognitive tests and assessments of physical and mental health, including interventions to rule out, for example, stress, depression or brain tumor. “Every week we run perhaps 40-50 samples, primarily from Sweden and from different parts of the country, and I expect that to increase significantly this fall,” he says. This does not concern screening, Zetterberg emphasizes, but routine care for patients who seek help because they sense that their memory and mental abilities are failing. One of his Lancet articles describes the development within Alzheimer's diagnosis as a revolution. “It is great that we have it implemented in Sweden; we are at the clinical cutting edge. The Lancet articles take a stand, stating that we now have something that actually looks good, and we can put the discussion about the benefits behind us,” concludes Henrik Zetterberg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Cleveland's humid summer heat, Michal Gostkowski, DO, doesn't need a jacket. As winter's cold bite creeps in, he'll be sure to bundle up. That's the idea behind a newly cleared adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) device now being used to treat PD, said Gostkowski, neurologist at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. This can result in significant side effects, including dyskinesia. By monitoring brain activity in real time and adjusting stimulation dynamically, this next-generation technology delivers greater symptom control with fewer side effects. Neurologists in North America, Europe, and Asia are adopting the therapy to help preserve patients' independence and function, offering hope for millions living with the disease. Of Gostkowski's 75 patients using aDBS, to date, none has discontinued the therapy. “This has been very advantageous for most patients,” Gostkowski told Medscape Medical News. “It just seems to provide what the body is missing, what the brain's not doing by itself, and patients really like it.” In February, manufacturer Medtronic received FDA clearance for BrainSense aDBS and the BrainSense Electrode Identifier system, making it the first and only aDBS system cleared for clinical use in PD. The approval was the culmination of more than a decade of research into refining aDBS — from determining which brain wave frequencies correlate to Parkinson's motor symptoms to further identifying which signals were safe and effective enough to drive the aDBS system. In 2018, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), first implanted aDBS in two patients with PD, demonstrating that it was as effective at controlling symptoms as cDBS. Stimulation then modulates the disrupted beta waves in patients with PD, helping to alleviate certain motor symptoms. A pivotal clinical trial — ADAPT-PD — led by Helen Bronte-Stewart, MD, MS, professor of neurology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, served as the basis for FDA clearance of the technology. Among the study's 68 participants (70.6% men; mean age, 62.2 years; disease duration, 13.5 years), most had effective “on” time (defined as time when symptoms were well controlled) without experiencing troublesome dyskinesia compared with cDBS. “More than two thirds of study participants indicated a ‘strong' or ‘somewhat' preference for aDBS over their previous cDBS settings for improved motor symptoms or fewer symptom fluctuations,” the investigators wrote. “If there isn't enough of a signal recordable, then adaptive deep brain stimulation won't work, and that often depends on where the lead is in the brain,” she said. Older patients and those with preexisting gait and speech problems are at a greater risk for stimulation-induced side effects, said Martijn Beudel, MD, PhD, neurologist and associate professor at Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. In addition, patients with significant cognitive impairment or dementia are typically ineligible because the surgery itself may pose risks. Nonmotor symptoms of PD — such as swallowing difficulties, drooling, or blood pressure regulation — are not improved with this technology. “My tremor is almost all gone, except if I experience extreme anxiety or stress — and my dyskinesia is pretty well under control,” Laycock said in a Cleveland Clinic patient profile. “My symptoms are minimal compared to the way they were, and a lot of that is due to the adaptive deep brain stimulation.” In fact, aDBS has enabled him to continue his 47-year career on the podium. A recent study led by UCSF researchers showed that aDBS improved symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD while reducing common side effects of cDBS. Patients like Laycock who transition to aDBS require no further surgery — the Medtronic's Percept DBS system can be updated via software to activate its adaptive setting. Although patients with the Percept device installed can technically update to aDBS, that doesn't always mean they should. She cautioned against framing aDBS as a revolutionary alternative that patients must have. Rather, she said, it should be viewed as a personalized biological therapy vs an entirely new treatment. Worldwide, more than 160,000 patients with PD have DBS implants, though it's unclear how many are using aDBS. However, Medtronic reports that to date, over 40,000 people globally have the Percept device. “The exact number of clinics using aDBS is still small. Gostkowski and Brett Youngerman, MD, neurosurgeon and assistant professor of neurological surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, said that their patients with PD have had no issues getting insurance coverage for the treatment. Across the pond in Netherlands, Beudel has been busy rolling out aDBS to his patients. His team began using aDBS in routine clinical practice in 2021, initially through the ADAPT-PD trial, and has since expanded its use to roughly 20 patients this year. He noted that patients currently require slightly more frequent hospital visits than those with cDBS, primarily for algorithm adjustments. However, in his experience, aDBS offers superior management of stimulation-induced side effects, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, and gait disturbances. The battery requires monthly recharging but retains capacity for roughly 12 years — far outlasting most cell phones. However, there are still key aspects of aDBS that experts believe need further refinement. “The main limitation right now is that it's limited to a single predefined biomarker primarily focused on beta power,” Youngerman, who also reported beneficial outcomes from aDBS among his 25 patients, told Medscape Medical News. The current commercial device remains first generation, but future iterations are expected to incorporate more sophisticated algorithms capable of interpreting additional neural signals as scientific understanding advances, said Bronte-Stewart. aDBS is also being explored as a potential treatment for other neurologic disorders and certain psychiatric conditions. Remote monitoring tools are also in development, potentially allowing clinicians to access a patient's aDBS data remotely and further reduce the need for clinic visits. Postmarket studies are planned, and early registries are being established, though results will likely take a year or more to emerge, Okun noted. However, we must simplify programming and ensure broader access to make it a true game changer for Parkinson's care,” he said. Gostkowski's patient Rand described the therapy as “a life-changing procedure that allows you to become your own self again.” Youngerman and Gostkowski reported having no relevant financial disclosures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study shows that people with higher levels of the protein albumin in their urine are at increased risk of developing dementia. The study, led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, is published in the scientific journal Journal of Internal Medicine. Although age remains the biggest risk factor for developing dementia, researchers have increasingly shown that diseases in other parts of the body, such as the kidneys, can also affect the brain.In the new study, the researchers were able to show that people with higher levels of albumin in their urine, an abnormal condition known as albuminuria (see fact box), are at increased risk of developing dementia later in life.This association was strongest for vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, often caused by stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other vascular diseases, and for mixed dementia, which combines features of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.The study included 130,000 older adults in Stockholm, all over the age of 65 and free of dementia at the start of the study. During a follow-up period of approximately four years, seven percent of the participants developed dementia.After taking into account kidney function and other factors, the researchers found that people with moderate levels of the protein albumin in their urine (30-299 mg/g) had a 25 percent higher risk of developing dementia, while those with high levels (≥300 mg/g) had a 37 percent higher risk compared to people with normal levels (<30 mg/g).Higher levels of this protein indicate kidney damage and, according to this study, may also signal a higher risk of dementia. The kidneys and the brain may seem like very different organs, but they share an important characteristic: both depend on a delicate network of small blood vessels. Hong Xu, last author, assistant professor at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society at Karolinska Institutet Just as a damaged kidney filter leaks proteins into the urine, a damaged blood-brain barrier allows toxins and inflammatory molecules to the brain tissue. Over time, this increases the risk of vascular damage, inflammation, and accumulation of harmful proteins linked to dementia. "These results underscore the importance of routine screening for albuminuria as part of early dementia risk assessment, especially in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the first study of its kind, scientists show that far-UV light can cut airborne allergen levels by a quarter in just half an hour, opening the door to safer breathing spaces for millions with asthma and allergies. Study: Far UV Exposure (UV222) Decreases Immune-Based Recognition of Common Airborne Allergens. Airborne allergens, or aeroallergens, can cause respiratory allergies and asthma. A recent study in ACS ES&T Air examined the impact of far-ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the immunogenicity of several common aeroallergens, hoping to find a preventative intervention. One in three Americans suffers from allergies, and these conditions cause multiple severe illnesses worldwide. Airborne allergens, often occurring as indoor aerosols, are a significant cause of such allergies. They also trigger asthma, which affects 262 million people globally, with 1,000 deaths a day. In most cases, they trigger an immune response that causes allergic reactions, though non-proteins are sometimes involved. Specific regions of the protein's three-dimensional structure form recognition and binding sites to which immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies attach, setting off the inflammatory-allergic cascade. Current control strategies include preventive measures, medication, and engineering adaptations. Aeroallergens are, however, unique in their ability to persist indoors for years. As a result, researchers often rely on indirect indicators, such as mold spore or pollen counts, instead of measuring the allergens themselves. These may expose workers to aeroallergen concentrations above 10 ng/m3, an allergy-inducing threshold. Current preventive strategies are typically too intensive to be sustainable. Conventional ultraviolet therapy uses the 254 nm band, which is genotoxic and thus destroys microbes. It is highly absorbed by proteins, causing photooxidation and structural damage. However, its limited penetration power makes it safer on the skin and eyes. The current study targets using far-ultraviolet light UV222 as an occupant-safe treatment to reduce aeroallergens. The researchers developed a controlled chamber model containing 10 m3 of air. They generated airborne allergens within the chamber using those commonly linked to patient sensitization, allergy, and asthma. The chamber was set to a relative humidity of 60% since allergens derived from mold and dust mites thrive in such an environment. Aeroallergens were introduced from either dustborne or purified sources. The particle size distribution was also checked for allergen enrichment at any fraction. Still, it was set below the threshold for skin and eye exposure, as per the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) standards. Ozone levels generated by the radiation were also monitored. As expected, over 99% of aeroallergens in the experimental chamber were 10 µm or smaller. No single allergen was concentrated within any particle size range. Interestingly, some aeroallergens were more stable in the air than others, likely due to intramolecular interactions and interactions with the surrounding environment. Future research should examine how this stability influences the risk of inhalation. Allergen levels at baseline were about 50-200 ng/m3 in the controls and the UV chamber, reflecting clinically observed respirable air allergen levels. UV222 irradiation significantly reduced the average aeroallergen load by 20% to 25%. Comparing all aeroallergens, dustborne allergens decreased faster, on average, than airborne ones, after UV222 treatment. The least affected was Fel d 1, from dustborne and purified sources. However, it became much more vulnerable to UV222 after stabilizing components like Tween-20 were removed from the purified airborne form. Not only did clinically relevant reductions in aeroallergen loads occur, but they occurred within feasible time periods. Regarding allergen decrease, the reductions are comparable to those reported in long-term allergy studies, though the paper stresses that clinical outcomes were not directly tested here. The authors interpret these results cautiously, suggesting that UV222 likely disrupts protein structure and reduces immunoassay detection of allergens, which may also reduce IgE-epitope recognition in the body, but this requires further study. This is the first study to use common aeroallergens in a controlled setting at concentrations similar to real-world allergy-causing levels in the air. These new methods should help understand airborne allergens' movement and availability in respired air. They could thus help in framing effective interventions and preventive measures. “These findings suggest that UV222 exposure can reduce allergen immunorecognition within respirable particles, supporting its use as an integrated strategy for indoor aeroallergen control.” Further research is required to understand how this is associated with a clinically relevant reduction in symptoms in sensitized or allergic individuals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A common life-threatening genetic condition that causes high cholesterol from birth, FH can lead to premature heart attacks and heart disease, if it is not diagnosed until adulthood. The manuscript, titled "Accelerating Guideline Recommended Universal Pediatric Lipid Screening: Launch of the LEAD Pediatric Initiative," highlights strategies that could lead to improved universal guideline-recommended screening implementation. The Family Heart Foundation established the Leveraging Evidence and Data (LEAD) for Pediatric Cholesterol Screening Initiative last year to address current challenges that serve as friction points in providing life-saving screening. Every child in America between the ages of 9 and 11 years of age should get a simple blood test to screen their LDL cholesterol for a serious genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia. Many times, families do not understand that the cardiovascular disease that runs through their family for generations can be managed with early diagnosis. The publication in the Journal of Pediatrics lays out concrete actions that can be taken, and on which we have formed partnerships to support families and improve care for children." Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer of the Family Heart Foundation Data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and in Pediatrics, indicates that only 11% of youth in the U.S. between the ages of 9 and 21 had documented lipid screening, and 30 to 60% of youth with dyslipidemia may be missed by targeted screening alone compared to universal lipid screening. "Many clinicians do not understand the reason for pediatric lipid screening guidelines that were primarily developed to identify FH, a genetic condition designated by the World Health Organization in 1998 as a public health concern," said Laurence S. Sperling, MD, FACC, FACP, FAHA, MASPC, chief medical officer of the Family Heart Foundation, Katz professor in Preventive Cardiology at Emory University School of Medicine, and professor of Global Health at Rollins School of Public Health. "Early and aggressive cardiovascular disease can be prevented with an FH diagnosis in a child, leading to immediate and appropriate treatment. The goal of LEAD is to significantly impact missed opportunities to save hundreds of thousands of young lives from being cut short or burdened by early cardiovascular disease. The tools created by a working group representing patient, families, clinicians, and health systems as part of the Family Heart Foundation's LEAD initiative and outlined in the Journal of Pediatrics will increase understanding among clinicians and parents about the importance of universal screening."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trillions of microbes that live in the human gut may play a bigger role in health than previously thought, according to a new research by the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The article, published in September 2025 in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, explores how gut bacteria interact with human genes in ways that could shape disease risk, aging and even future medical treatments. These changes happen through chemical tags such as DNA or RNA methylation, which control when and how genes are expressed. Everyday factors-such as diet, stress, medications and aging-can influence these microbial interactions. For example, gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, nutrients and other chemical signals that may reprogram gene activity linked to immunity, metabolism or brain health. In turn, a person's lifestyle and genetic makeup can shape which microbes thrive in the gut, creating a feedback loop between humans and their microbes. The researchers point to future possibilities where understanding this loop could help doctors design personalized treatments. Potential applications include using microbial biomarkers (biological signals that indicate health or disease), developing "live biotherapeutics" (beneficial bacteria given like medicine) or refining fecal microbiota transplants, which transfer gut microbes from healthy donors to patients. Advances in artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis are helping scientists model these complex relationships at an unprecedented scale. Frameworks such as the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data) and CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics) are needed to ensure that data from microbiome research benefits diverse populations equitably. By mapping out how gut microbes communicate with human genes, the review underscores both the promise and responsibility of this emerging science. The insights could open the door to precision health strategies that tailor prevention and treatment to each individual's unique microbial and epigenetic makeup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from USC and Duke report that the persistent "know-do gap" - where clinicians know guidelines but practice differently - is the primary driver of antibiotic overprescribing for pediatric diarrhea in India's private sector, not lack of knowledge, point-of-sale profits, or stockouts of clinically recommended treatments such as oral rehydration salts (ORS). In a sample of 2,282 private providers across 253 towns, 70 percent prescribed antibiotics without signs of bacterial infection, and among those who knew antibiotics were inappropriate, 62 percent still prescribed them to standardized patients, indicating a large know-do gap. Randomized experiments showed that the know-do gap was driven by providers' beliefs about patient preferences and not profits from selling antibiotics or limited supplies of ORS. When patients expressed a preference for ORS, inappropriate antibiotic use fell by 17 percentage points on average, with especially large reductions among pharmacies. By contrast, removing point-of-sale financial incentives and supplying ORS had no meaningful effect on antibiotic prescribing. A discrete choice experiment with 1,189 caregivers further found that patients did not prefer providers who give antibiotics over those who provide ORS, underscoring the misalignment between provider perceptions and actual patient preferences. Our data reveal a striking disconnect: clinicians know antibiotics are wrong for most diarrhea cases, yet prescribe them anyway because they think parents expect 'strong' medicines. Correcting that perception, rather than another training seminar, offers the biggest win for global antibiotic stewardship." Zachary Wagner, corresponding author of USC's Center for Economic and Social Research "A lot of children are given antibiotics when they don't need them, and that can lead to drug-resistant bacteria - a problem for the whole world, not just India. By showing that patient–provider communication trumps financial motives, we give policymakers a laser-focused lever: help doctors understand real patient preferences," added coauthor Neeraj Sood of the USC Schaeffer Center and Price School.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Expanding access to lifestyle medicine education opportunities-such as continuing medical education (CME) courses, professional certification, webinars, mentoring and peer-to-peer connections, and conference participation-can facilitate the adoption of the medical specialty across health systems, according to a new study published in Translational Behavioral Medicine. This qualitative study conducted by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) found that intentional educational strategies are critical to the adoption and growth of lifestyle medicine programming and facilitate deepening of clinicians' knowledge, skills, and confidence in delivering lifestyle medicine interventions to treat, reverse and prevent chronic disease. These findings give health system leaders a roadmap of educational strategies to advance lifestyle medicine implementation. To understand how health systems prepare clinicians to practice lifestyle medicine, researchers conducted more than 60 interviews with clinicians, administrators and educators at eight health systems. Interviewees identified several educational strategies that supported lifestyle medicine practice, including: The role of cultural support had been further explored in a previous ACLM study. One physician in the new study responded that after they earned lifestyle medicine certification, they "helped 15 other people, a few physicians and nurse practitioners" get board certified." Interviewees noted that the experience not only instilled a passion for lifestyle medicine but also inspired them to disseminate knowledge and insights within their organizations. These initiatives gave clinicians firsthand experience with the same lifestyle interventions recommended for patients, reinforcing both their confidence and credibility when delivering lifestyle medicine care. While pilot programs have long been recognized as an approach to test the feasibility of an intervention, the study's first author Meghan Ames, DrPH, MSPH, RDN, said "This work highlights that delivering lifestyle medicine to health system employees can serve as a rich opportunity for healthcare professionals to learn firsthand what lifestyle medicine is and how powerful it can be to impact health." The study also pinpointed key educational content areas considered most critical: a clear definition and evidence base for lifestyle medicine, behavior change counseling, familiarity with lifestyle medicine referral opportunities and business operation skills. Many of the strategies interviewees described focused on raising awareness of the lifestyle medicine resources available both inside and outside their health systems. This awareness was seen as critical for making patient referrals and ensuring consistent use of lifestyle medicine services. As one physician explained, "It's also important that the people you work with know about what existing resources are," adding that education must be continuous because "you'll always have new staff or new physicians joining."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research presented at the 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS 2025) demonstrates that ocrelizumab provides superior control of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses compared with fingolimod, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab. Ocrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, was evaluated using real-world data from three large MS registries: MSBase, OFSEP, and the Danish MS Registry. In the fingolimod comparison, MS relapse rates were significantly lower with ocrelizumab (0.06 vs 0.14; p<0.001). Additionally, ocrelizumab reduced the risk of relapse-associated worsening compared with natalizumab, while no such difference was observed compared with alemtuzumab. For example, there was approximately one fewer relapse per 33 patient-years when comparing natalizumab to ocrelizumab. Adverse event data were not consistently available across registries. As a proxy for tolerability, the study examined treatment persistence. While ocrelizumab consistently reduced relapses and relapse-associated worsening, there was no evidence of differences in progression independent of relapse activity or disability improvement compared with the other high-efficacy therapies. "These findings suggest we may have reached the ceiling of disability benefit achievable via relapse suppression alone, highlighting the urgent need for treatments that target relapse-independent progression," Dr. Roos concluded. 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS 2025) Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.
