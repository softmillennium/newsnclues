                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, or CCHFV, is a biosafety level 4 pathogen and a Category A bioterrorism agent, causing severe viral hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates reaching up to 40%. There is currently no approved vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for CCHFV. "This project will identify broadly protective antibody candidates that can be developed into potential therapies." The research brings together an interdisciplinary and international team to tackle one of the world's most dangerous emerging viral threats. The team includes co-principal investigator Dr. Mohammad Sajadi, a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine; and co-investigators Aura Garrison and Joseph Golden, who are research microbiologists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, a long-time leader in hemorrhagic fever virus research. The project will study survivors of CCHFV in Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Uganda to find antibodies that protect against the virus. A monoclonal antibody is a type of lab-made protein that mimics the immune system's ability to fight harmful viruses or bacteria. By focusing on non-traditional viral targets, our approach could lead to new, life-saving therapeutics and help establish a framework for addressing future nairovirus outbreaks." Other partners on the project include scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Hitit University in Turkey, and South Kazakhstan Medical Academy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Université de Montréal's affiliated hospital research centre (CRCHUM) are testing out a mobile application to help young adults who have a first episode of psychosis to support safer cannabis consumption. The nationwide clinical trial, a first in Canada, is led by Université de Montréal psychiatry and addictology professor Didier Jutras-Aswad, a researcher at CRCHUM. Called CHAMPS (Cannabis Harm-reducing App to Manage Practices Safely), the pilot study is described in an article published in the August issue of Psychiatry Research. Built in collaboration with young adults, clinicians and a number of experts, our app includes interactive modules and personalized support to reduce risks associated with cannabis consumption." "Our pilot study confirmed its acceptability among youth having experienced a first psychotic episode," he said. The pilot study was conducted with the support of a multidisciplinary team that included Stephanie Coronado-Montoya, the study's first author and former PhD student of Jutras-Aswad's, and Dr. Amal Abdel-Baki, a psychiatrist at CHUM, among others. The goal of the project is to provide an alternative to traditional care centred on abstinence and which is often inadequate for young adults who have experienced a first episode of psychosis and who do not plan to stop their cannabis consumption. "When comparing standard care to an approach that includes CHAMPS, we can see that the app is well regarded and that it can be integrated into real clinical environments," said Jutras-Aswad. "Even if we cannot currently draw any conclusions about CHAMPS's efficacy, we have seen an encouraging signal in terms of a decrease in cannabis-related problems," he said. Recruitment will take place over a three-year period. CHAMPS is more than a phone app, its proponents say: it could easily be included in existing clinical care, without increasing workloads for medical personnel. In fact, the researchers add, it exemplifies a new approach to mental health care, one that is specifically designed to meet the actual needs of an often neglected young adult population. "Many people don't seek to, at least for a certain period of time, reduce or cease their cannabis use," said Jutras-Aswad. CHAMPS joins a larger movement that is working toward humanizing, personalizing and destigmatizing cannabis use in mental health care, he said. "It's very important that we change perceptions, practices and philosophies in order to more broadly adopt harm reduction in mental health care," he emphasized. To that end, in July, he and his team published several Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Cannabis Use-Related Adverse Psychosis Outcomes, actively promoting their approach via an international group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These conditions frequently overlap, with individuals who have AUD or chronic pain often also experiencing PTSD. When these disorders co-occur, they tend to worsen one another, making effective treatment significantly more challenging. Currently, no approved medications effectively treat PTSD and AUD together, and many available drugs come with serious side effects or limited results. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, conducted two complementary studies in rats to explore how a new drug, PPL-138, might help treat PTSD and its common companions – anxiety, chronic pain, and AUD. Intellectual property related to PPL-138 is owned by Phoenix PharmaLabs, Inc. The first study, carried out at the University of Oklahoma, looked at whether long-term treatment with PPL-138 could reduce PTSD-related symptoms in chronic traumatic stress. The second study, conducted at FAU, focused on the relationship between trauma, anxiety and alcohol use, and researchers divided rats into different groups. Results, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, provide promising evidence that PPL-138 could become a valuable treatment for PTSD and alcohol misuse – particularly when symptoms are rooted in anxiety. By targeting a brain system involved in both stress and addiction, researchers believe PPL-138 may one day offer a much-needed breakthrough for those struggling with these life-altering conditions. In both male and female rats, the drug selectively reduced alcohol use in those that also showed signs of trauma-related anxiety, without affecting those that were resilient or not stressed. Our results show that PPL-138 not only reduces trauma-related anxiety and pain, but also selectively curbs alcohol use in rats most vulnerable to stress-induced drinking. Among female rats, PPL-138 reduced alcohol intake in those exhibiting anxiety, even if their drinking had not escalated. This indicates that anxiety alone may be a primary factor driving alcohol use in females. "Anxious male rats were twice as likely as females to increase their alcohol intake following trauma, while nearly all female rats with more alcohol intake also displayed clear signs of anxiety," said Cippitelli. "This mirrors well-documented patterns in humans, where women are more prone to anxiety-related disorders like PTSD and often use alcohol to cope with emotional distress, whereas men typically engage in heavier, more generalized drinking." Importantly, the effects of PPL-138 were not due to sedation or reduced activity. In fact, movement levels remained unchanged in male rats and slightly increased in females – supporting the idea that the drug acts specifically on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, rather than causing general suppression or sedation. "This research represents a much-needed step toward helping both civilians and veterans living with the invisible wounds of trauma," said Cippitelli. "In our preclinical studies, PPL-138 shows strong potential as a single therapy for the overlapping symptoms of PTSD, chronic pain, and alcohol misuse – offering a potentially safer and more effective alternative to current multi-drug approaches." The opioid partial agonist PPL‐138 reduces alcohol self‐administration in rats susceptible to post‐traumatic stress disorder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The diagnosis and medical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a condition that according to leading researchers in the field should be treated, has now advanced significantly. A series of articles in The Lancet provides both a comprehensive and thorough review of current research. We have reached a stage where Alzheimer's disease is no longer something you can do little about. Similarly, there is a consensus that people undergoing memory assessments should be offered a finger prick so that their blood can be analyzed for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, preferably at an early stage when memory and mental abilities still only reveal mild symptoms. The answer to these questions is yes, the tests are adequate, and the medicines are useful and should be used, as long as the risk of side effects, such as cardiovascular disease, is properly managed,” says Henrik Zetterberg. Swedish healthcare is waiting for regulatory approval before the medicines can start being used. Meanwhile, more and more blood samples for Alzheimer's testing are being taken during basic memory assessments in Swedish primary care, as a complement to cognitive tests and assessments of physical and mental health, including interventions to rule out, for example, stress, depression or brain tumor. “Every week we run perhaps 40-50 samples, primarily from Sweden and from different parts of the country, and I expect that to increase significantly this fall,” he says. This does not concern screening, Zetterberg emphasizes, but routine care for patients who seek help because they sense that their memory and mental abilities are failing. One of his Lancet articles describes the development within Alzheimer's diagnosis as a revolution. “It is great that we have it implemented in Sweden; we are at the clinical cutting edge. The Lancet articles take a stand, stating that we now have something that actually looks good, and we can put the discussion about the benefits behind us,” concludes Henrik Zetterberg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have mapped underappreciated scaffolding cells in skin, known as fibroblasts. They show for the first time how fibroblasts go 'rogue' in many different diseases affecting multiple organs – from acne and psoriasis, to rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Universities of Cambridge and Newcastle, and their collaborators combined single-cell sequencing and spatial genomics datasets with machine learning to identify eight different types of fibroblasts. They show how the fibroblasts form distinct 'tissue neighborhoods' in skin and reveal their shared functions in a range of diseases across various tissues. Published today (24 September) in Nature Immunology, the researchers suggest that fibroblasts show potential as universal drug targets due to their involvement in multiple diseases across a range of tissues. Skin diseases account for 24 per cent of the UK's burden of illness, with wound care costing the NHS approximately £8.3 billion annually, and other skin conditions and diseases costing approximately £723 million each year. While it is known that fibroblasts increase their collagen production and develop muscle-like fibres to contract after wounding, it has been unclear how fibroblast states change across the many diseases observed in skin, from cancers to acne. The team generated spatial transcriptomic data – which measures gene expression and how it varies across different locations within a tissue – to spatially map the identified fibroblast populations from normal and diseased human skin. The researchers found that these scaffolding cells are far more complex than was previously thought. The team discovered five different types of fibroblasts in healthy skin, which are located in distinct 'tissue neighbourhoods' associated with specific functions. The team identified fibroblast populations shared across organs. Using machine learning models, they identified three 'rogue' subtypes of fibroblasts that are present in different organs across multiple diseases, including scarring diseases and lung cancer, rheumatoid arthritis in joints and inflammatory bowel disease in the gut. Interestingly, the researchers found that the same activated fibroblasts that recruit immune cells to early skin wounds were observed in inflammatory diseases, such as acne and inflammatory bowel disease. This suggests that a wound-like fibroblast state is used to attract immune cells to tissues in diseases like acne and inflammatory bowel disease, which both have a risk of scarring. By identifying shared disease-related and disease-specific fibroblasts within these 'tissue neighbourhoods' across multiple diseases and organs, the researchers identify potential universal drug targets. This means researchers may be able to develop single drugs that work for several diseases across the body. Fibroblasts have critical roles in recruiting immune cells to skin tissue and causing scarring, which can result in a range of skin diseases. We lack highly effective treatments to treat scarring in clinical practice, partly because these cells have been poorly understood. We've shown for the first time that fibroblasts occupy and maintain distinct anatomical microenvironments in skin tissue in health and disease. Our data are freely available and we provide an online tool that can be used by researchers to map fibroblasts from their own studies, to expand our knowledge on fibroblasts in disease." Dr. Lloyd Steele, first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and University of Cambridge Dr Mo Lotfollahi, senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "Artificial Intelligence is going to be transformative in how we do science in the next 10 years, and guide how we explore vast datasets and make sense of complexities of the human body. Matthew Patey, OBE, Chief Executive Officer at British Skin Foundation Professor Muzz Haniffa, lead author and Head of Cellular Genomics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and Professor of Dermatology and Immunology at Newcastle University, said: "The clinical relevance of our work is huge – it is paradigm-shifting in terms of how we move from understanding the role of individual cell types to uncovering how disease-specific cell types form 'tissue neighbourhoods' that mediate inflammation. We find the same disease-related fibroblasts involved in several diseases across the body – atopic eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis – meaning we could find universal therapeutic targets in these cells to treat many diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Cleveland's humid summer heat, Michal Gostkowski, DO, doesn't need a jacket. As winter's cold bite creeps in, he'll be sure to bundle up. That's the idea behind a newly cleared adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) device now being used to treat PD, said Gostkowski, neurologist at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. This can result in significant side effects, including dyskinesia. By monitoring brain activity in real time and adjusting stimulation dynamically, this next-generation technology delivers greater symptom control with fewer side effects. Neurologists in North America, Europe, and Asia are adopting the therapy to help preserve patients' independence and function, offering hope for millions living with the disease. Of Gostkowski's 75 patients using aDBS, to date, none has discontinued the therapy. “This has been very advantageous for most patients,” Gostkowski told Medscape Medical News. “It just seems to provide what the body is missing, what the brain's not doing by itself, and patients really like it.” In February, manufacturer Medtronic received FDA clearance for BrainSense aDBS and the BrainSense Electrode Identifier system, making it the first and only aDBS system cleared for clinical use in PD. The approval was the culmination of more than a decade of research into refining aDBS — from determining which brain wave frequencies correlate to Parkinson's motor symptoms to further identifying which signals were safe and effective enough to drive the aDBS system. In 2018, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), first implanted aDBS in two patients with PD, demonstrating that it was as effective at controlling symptoms as cDBS. Stimulation then modulates the disrupted beta waves in patients with PD, helping to alleviate certain motor symptoms. A pivotal clinical trial — ADAPT-PD — led by Helen Bronte-Stewart, MD, MS, professor of neurology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, served as the basis for FDA clearance of the technology. Among the study's 68 participants (70.6% men; mean age, 62.2 years; disease duration, 13.5 years), most had effective “on” time (defined as time when symptoms were well controlled) without experiencing troublesome dyskinesia compared with cDBS. “More than two thirds of study participants indicated a ‘strong' or ‘somewhat' preference for aDBS over their previous cDBS settings for improved motor symptoms or fewer symptom fluctuations,” the investigators wrote. “If there isn't enough of a signal recordable, then adaptive deep brain stimulation won't work, and that often depends on where the lead is in the brain,” she said. Older patients and those with preexisting gait and speech problems are at a greater risk for stimulation-induced side effects, said Martijn Beudel, MD, PhD, neurologist and associate professor at Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. In addition, patients with significant cognitive impairment or dementia are typically ineligible because the surgery itself may pose risks. Nonmotor symptoms of PD — such as swallowing difficulties, drooling, or blood pressure regulation — are not improved with this technology. “My tremor is almost all gone, except if I experience extreme anxiety or stress — and my dyskinesia is pretty well under control,” Laycock said in a Cleveland Clinic patient profile. “My symptoms are minimal compared to the way they were, and a lot of that is due to the adaptive deep brain stimulation.” In fact, aDBS has enabled him to continue his 47-year career on the podium. A recent study led by UCSF researchers showed that aDBS improved symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD while reducing common side effects of cDBS. Patients like Laycock who transition to aDBS require no further surgery — the Medtronic's Percept DBS system can be updated via software to activate its adaptive setting. Although patients with the Percept device installed can technically update to aDBS, that doesn't always mean they should. She cautioned against framing aDBS as a revolutionary alternative that patients must have. Rather, she said, it should be viewed as a personalized biological therapy vs an entirely new treatment. Worldwide, more than 160,000 patients with PD have DBS implants, though it's unclear how many are using aDBS. However, Medtronic reports that to date, over 40,000 people globally have the Percept device. “The exact number of clinics using aDBS is still small. Gostkowski and Brett Youngerman, MD, neurosurgeon and assistant professor of neurological surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, said that their patients with PD have had no issues getting insurance coverage for the treatment. Across the pond in Netherlands, Beudel has been busy rolling out aDBS to his patients. His team began using aDBS in routine clinical practice in 2021, initially through the ADAPT-PD trial, and has since expanded its use to roughly 20 patients this year. He noted that patients currently require slightly more frequent hospital visits than those with cDBS, primarily for algorithm adjustments. However, in his experience, aDBS offers superior management of stimulation-induced side effects, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, and gait disturbances. The battery requires monthly recharging but retains capacity for roughly 12 years — far outlasting most cell phones. However, there are still key aspects of aDBS that experts believe need further refinement. “The main limitation right now is that it's limited to a single predefined biomarker primarily focused on beta power,” Youngerman, who also reported beneficial outcomes from aDBS among his 25 patients, told Medscape Medical News. The current commercial device remains first generation, but future iterations are expected to incorporate more sophisticated algorithms capable of interpreting additional neural signals as scientific understanding advances, said Bronte-Stewart. aDBS is also being explored as a potential treatment for other neurologic disorders and certain psychiatric conditions. Remote monitoring tools are also in development, potentially allowing clinicians to access a patient's aDBS data remotely and further reduce the need for clinic visits. Postmarket studies are planned, and early registries are being established, though results will likely take a year or more to emerge, Okun noted. However, we must simplify programming and ensure broader access to make it a true game changer for Parkinson's care,” he said. Gostkowski's patient Rand described the therapy as “a life-changing procedure that allows you to become your own self again.” Youngerman and Gostkowski reported having no relevant financial disclosures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study shows that people with higher levels of the protein albumin in their urine are at increased risk of developing dementia. The study, led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, is published in the scientific journal Journal of Internal Medicine. Although age remains the biggest risk factor for developing dementia, researchers have increasingly shown that diseases in other parts of the body, such as the kidneys, can also affect the brain.In the new study, the researchers were able to show that people with higher levels of albumin in their urine, an abnormal condition known as albuminuria (see fact box), are at increased risk of developing dementia later in life.This association was strongest for vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, often caused by stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other vascular diseases, and for mixed dementia, which combines features of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.The study included 130,000 older adults in Stockholm, all over the age of 65 and free of dementia at the start of the study. During a follow-up period of approximately four years, seven percent of the participants developed dementia.After taking into account kidney function and other factors, the researchers found that people with moderate levels of the protein albumin in their urine (30-299 mg/g) had a 25 percent higher risk of developing dementia, while those with high levels (≥300 mg/g) had a 37 percent higher risk compared to people with normal levels (<30 mg/g).Higher levels of this protein indicate kidney damage and, according to this study, may also signal a higher risk of dementia. The kidneys and the brain may seem like very different organs, but they share an important characteristic: both depend on a delicate network of small blood vessels. Hong Xu, last author, assistant professor at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society at Karolinska Institutet Just as a damaged kidney filter leaks proteins into the urine, a damaged blood-brain barrier allows toxins and inflammatory molecules to the brain tissue. Over time, this increases the risk of vascular damage, inflammation, and accumulation of harmful proteins linked to dementia. "These results underscore the importance of routine screening for albuminuria as part of early dementia risk assessment, especially in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the first study of its kind, scientists show that far-UV light can cut airborne allergen levels by a quarter in just half an hour, opening the door to safer breathing spaces for millions with asthma and allergies. Study: Far UV Exposure (UV222) Decreases Immune-Based Recognition of Common Airborne Allergens. Airborne allergens, or aeroallergens, can cause respiratory allergies and asthma. A recent study in ACS ES&T Air examined the impact of far-ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the immunogenicity of several common aeroallergens, hoping to find a preventative intervention. One in three Americans suffers from allergies, and these conditions cause multiple severe illnesses worldwide. Airborne allergens, often occurring as indoor aerosols, are a significant cause of such allergies. They also trigger asthma, which affects 262 million people globally, with 1,000 deaths a day. In most cases, they trigger an immune response that causes allergic reactions, though non-proteins are sometimes involved. Specific regions of the protein's three-dimensional structure form recognition and binding sites to which immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies attach, setting off the inflammatory-allergic cascade. Current control strategies include preventive measures, medication, and engineering adaptations. Aeroallergens are, however, unique in their ability to persist indoors for years. As a result, researchers often rely on indirect indicators, such as mold spore or pollen counts, instead of measuring the allergens themselves. These may expose workers to aeroallergen concentrations above 10 ng/m3, an allergy-inducing threshold. Current preventive strategies are typically too intensive to be sustainable. Conventional ultraviolet therapy uses the 254 nm band, which is genotoxic and thus destroys microbes. It is highly absorbed by proteins, causing photooxidation and structural damage. However, its limited penetration power makes it safer on the skin and eyes. The current study targets using far-ultraviolet light UV222 as an occupant-safe treatment to reduce aeroallergens. The researchers developed a controlled chamber model containing 10 m3 of air. They generated airborne allergens within the chamber using those commonly linked to patient sensitization, allergy, and asthma. The chamber was set to a relative humidity of 60% since allergens derived from mold and dust mites thrive in such an environment. Aeroallergens were introduced from either dustborne or purified sources. The particle size distribution was also checked for allergen enrichment at any fraction. Still, it was set below the threshold for skin and eye exposure, as per the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) standards. Ozone levels generated by the radiation were also monitored. As expected, over 99% of aeroallergens in the experimental chamber were 10 µm or smaller. No single allergen was concentrated within any particle size range. Interestingly, some aeroallergens were more stable in the air than others, likely due to intramolecular interactions and interactions with the surrounding environment. Future research should examine how this stability influences the risk of inhalation. Allergen levels at baseline were about 50-200 ng/m3 in the controls and the UV chamber, reflecting clinically observed respirable air allergen levels. UV222 irradiation significantly reduced the average aeroallergen load by 20% to 25%. Comparing all aeroallergens, dustborne allergens decreased faster, on average, than airborne ones, after UV222 treatment. The least affected was Fel d 1, from dustborne and purified sources. However, it became much more vulnerable to UV222 after stabilizing components like Tween-20 were removed from the purified airborne form. Not only did clinically relevant reductions in aeroallergen loads occur, but they occurred within feasible time periods. Regarding allergen decrease, the reductions are comparable to those reported in long-term allergy studies, though the paper stresses that clinical outcomes were not directly tested here. The authors interpret these results cautiously, suggesting that UV222 likely disrupts protein structure and reduces immunoassay detection of allergens, which may also reduce IgE-epitope recognition in the body, but this requires further study. This is the first study to use common aeroallergens in a controlled setting at concentrations similar to real-world allergy-causing levels in the air. These new methods should help understand airborne allergens' movement and availability in respired air. They could thus help in framing effective interventions and preventive measures. “These findings suggest that UV222 exposure can reduce allergen immunorecognition within respirable particles, supporting its use as an integrated strategy for indoor aeroallergen control.” Further research is required to understand how this is associated with a clinically relevant reduction in symptoms in sensitized or allergic individuals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an experiment with 129 women, researchers discovered that foodie Instagram content lifted mood while clean eating posts failed to do so and hinted at subtle risks for body satisfaction. A recent study in Frontiers in Psychology compared the impact of social media content on clean eating vs eating-related control content (foodie) on its effect, body satisfaction, and food choices in a behavioral task. Spending more time on social media has been associated with lower body satisfaction and disordered eating among users. Instagram, a popular picture-based social media outlet, is used by more than 28% of global internet users. Recently, researchers have started to assess the impact of food- and eating-related social media posts on individuals' perceptions of their bodies and eating behaviors. Social media users share eating-related content by posting nutritional tips, food photography, and eating videos. Clean eating (CE) is an eating-related trend with thousands of Instagram posts containing the hashtags #healthyfood and #healthylifestyle. Although there is no universal definition of CE, it is commonly described as an eating behavior characterized by a higher intake of non-processed foods. Although the concept of CE could initially benefit health, restricting the variety and quantity of food may lead to disordered eating and promote a negative body image. Social media content has been found to trigger body dissatisfaction and appearance-ideal internalization, particularly among females between 18 and 30 years of age. Women between 17 and 55 years of age, who followed CE recommendations, were more likely to develop restrictive eating behavior, commonly in the form of orthorexia nervosa. In addition to CE, food content has also increased on Instagram, showcasing what people eat and cook, and often uses hashtags such as #foodporn. Not many studies have investigated the impact of consuming food-related content on body satisfaction and mood. Considering the high volume of social media content related to food, it is essential to understand how it affects an individual's mood, body satisfaction, and behavior. It assessed the impact of exposure to CE and foodie content on Instagram. The current study hypothesized that viewing CE Instagram profiles would enhance negative affect (NA) and decrease positive affect (PA) and body satisfaction, compared to viewing control content; that CE would lead to healthier snack choices; and that participants with higher baseline vulnerabilities (eating disorder or orthorexia symptoms, body dissatisfaction) would react more strongly. Female students from the University of Konstanz, primarily from the psychology department, were enrolled to evaluate PA and NA before and after exposure to content from two profiles: CE and control (foodie content) created on Instagram for this study. These accounts were not accessible outside the study. Any participant with substance dependence, the presence of severe depressive symptoms, a BMI lower than 17 or higher than 30, or those with suicidal tendency were excluded. Eligible participants completed a pre-questionnaire and were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions. Subsequently, they were asked to select a snack from various foods. Orthorexic behavior was assessed using the Düsseldorf Orthorexia Scale (DOS), while the Body Image States Scale (BISS) was used to determine an individual's self-evaluation of their physical appearance. A total of 129 women (CE-64 and Control-65) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Participants of both groups were of similar age, body mass index (BMI), eating disorder symptoms, orthorexia symptoms, or general psychopathology. No significant PA on profile exposure was observed. However, a significant effect of time was observed, with a reduction in PA from before to after exposure across the group. A significant interaction of time × profile was found regarding NA. A significant reduction in NA was observed from pre- to post-measurement when participants viewed the control profile. However, no significant changes were noted in participants after viewing the CE profile. A higher BISS score indicates lower body satisfaction. Interestingly, an interaction effect between profile and time was observed, but simple tests showed no clear changes within either group. Thus, while no significant body satisfaction changes were confirmed, there was tentative evidence that CE exposure may contribute to lower body satisfaction. Notably, this effect appeared even though no bodies were shown in the posts, suggesting that “healthy lifestyle” food content alone may influence body image. Regression analyses showed that pre-existing vulnerabilities (orthorexia symptoms, eating disorder symptoms, or body dissatisfaction) did not predict stronger reactions to CE content, contrary to the hypothesis. Neither CE nor control profile exposure impacted food choice, and body satisfaction effects were inconclusive but showed tentative signals of harm for CE. However, it is not conclusive whether social media content increases the risk of eating disorders or orthorexia symptoms. Importantly, foodie content reduced negative affect, suggesting that food-enjoyment-focused posts have a protective effect on mood compared to health-restrictive content. Future research must systematically validate this study's findings, especially with longer exposure times and more diverse samples.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A common life-threatening genetic condition that causes high cholesterol from birth, FH can lead to premature heart attacks and heart disease, if it is not diagnosed until adulthood. The manuscript, titled "Accelerating Guideline Recommended Universal Pediatric Lipid Screening: Launch of the LEAD Pediatric Initiative," highlights strategies that could lead to improved universal guideline-recommended screening implementation. The Family Heart Foundation established the Leveraging Evidence and Data (LEAD) for Pediatric Cholesterol Screening Initiative last year to address current challenges that serve as friction points in providing life-saving screening. Every child in America between the ages of 9 and 11 years of age should get a simple blood test to screen their LDL cholesterol for a serious genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia. Many times, families do not understand that the cardiovascular disease that runs through their family for generations can be managed with early diagnosis. The publication in the Journal of Pediatrics lays out concrete actions that can be taken, and on which we have formed partnerships to support families and improve care for children." Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer of the Family Heart Foundation Data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and in Pediatrics, indicates that only 11% of youth in the U.S. between the ages of 9 and 21 had documented lipid screening, and 30 to 60% of youth with dyslipidemia may be missed by targeted screening alone compared to universal lipid screening. "Many clinicians do not understand the reason for pediatric lipid screening guidelines that were primarily developed to identify FH, a genetic condition designated by the World Health Organization in 1998 as a public health concern," said Laurence S. Sperling, MD, FACC, FACP, FAHA, MASPC, chief medical officer of the Family Heart Foundation, Katz professor in Preventive Cardiology at Emory University School of Medicine, and professor of Global Health at Rollins School of Public Health. "Early and aggressive cardiovascular disease can be prevented with an FH diagnosis in a child, leading to immediate and appropriate treatment. The goal of LEAD is to significantly impact missed opportunities to save hundreds of thousands of young lives from being cut short or burdened by early cardiovascular disease. The tools created by a working group representing patient, families, clinicians, and health systems as part of the Family Heart Foundation's LEAD initiative and outlined in the Journal of Pediatrics will increase understanding among clinicians and parents about the importance of universal screening."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trillions of microbes that live in the human gut may play a bigger role in health than previously thought, according to a new research by the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The article, published in September 2025 in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, explores how gut bacteria interact with human genes in ways that could shape disease risk, aging and even future medical treatments. These changes happen through chemical tags such as DNA or RNA methylation, which control when and how genes are expressed. Everyday factors-such as diet, stress, medications and aging-can influence these microbial interactions. For example, gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, nutrients and other chemical signals that may reprogram gene activity linked to immunity, metabolism or brain health. In turn, a person's lifestyle and genetic makeup can shape which microbes thrive in the gut, creating a feedback loop between humans and their microbes. The researchers point to future possibilities where understanding this loop could help doctors design personalized treatments. Potential applications include using microbial biomarkers (biological signals that indicate health or disease), developing "live biotherapeutics" (beneficial bacteria given like medicine) or refining fecal microbiota transplants, which transfer gut microbes from healthy donors to patients. Advances in artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis are helping scientists model these complex relationships at an unprecedented scale. Frameworks such as the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data) and CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics) are needed to ensure that data from microbiome research benefits diverse populations equitably. By mapping out how gut microbes communicate with human genes, the review underscores both the promise and responsibility of this emerging science. The insights could open the door to precision health strategies that tailor prevention and treatment to each individual's unique microbial and epigenetic makeup.
