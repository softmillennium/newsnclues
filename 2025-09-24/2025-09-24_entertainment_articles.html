                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The dispute stems from a soured partnership between Insomniac, the global dance music events company partly owned by Live Nation, and Miami club and festival operators David Sinopoli, Davide L. Danese and Jose Gabriel Coloma Cano, who are best known for operating the city's famed Club Space venue and their work on the city's III Points festival. Insomniac brought a lawsuit last month against Sinopoli, Danese and Coloma Cano (referred to as “CDD” in legal papers), claiming the group tried to “bully” its way into more control over upstart Miami club Factory Town. But in counterclaims filed Wednesday (Sept. 24), CDD says it's actually Insomniac and Rotella who brought down their partnership with bad faith business practices. The countersuit cites social media comments critiquing Insomniac, as well as a 2012 criminal indictment that charged Rotella with bribing an event manager at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The charges were later dismissed, with Rotella pleading no contest to a misdemeanor conflict of interest and getting probation. He is also insufferable to work with,” write CDD's lawyers. Reached for comment on these new counterclaims on Wednesday, Insomniac's attorney Jordan Shaw says he's confident in their legal position and that CDD's personal attacks are irrelevant. “Their counterclaim is exactly what we expected, and the fact that they're relying on social media posts and dropped charges from 20 years ago tells you everything you need to know about their current claims,” says Shaw. Insomniac's original lawsuit against CDD claims the promoters made “outrageous demands” last year for more money and control of Factory Town. The two sides went into mediation this summer and emerged with a settlement, under which Insomniac would buy out CDD for $3 million and assume control of Factory Town. The Insomniac lawsuit alleges the CDD parties have since breached this settlement agreement by interfering in its planning of Factory Town's Hocus Pocus Halloween party and programming for Art Basel Miami in December. CDD says Insomniac has breached the deal by booking talent without their approval and ignoring myriad emails from CDD, copies of which are included in the suit. In one example, CDD claims Insomniac made an offer to party brand CircoLoco “that represented a 44% increase from the prior year's deal.” CDD objected to this offer, saying that it did “not reflect historical performance, venue capacity, or the reality of our shared structure.” The countersuit alleges that subsequent emails about the details of this deal were ignored by Insomniac. CDD's lead attorney, Bruce Weil, said in a statement on Wednesday that his clients have “established themselves as respected and valuable members of Miami's community through years of supporting local artists and boosting the local economy.” “It is disappointing that Pasquale Rotella and Insomniac are manipulating the facts by accusing CDD of the exact misconduct they themselves have inflicted, while retaliating against Club Space by attempting to obstruct and undermine CDD's ability to operate and manage it during a period of unprecedented success,” Weil added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Laila Lockhart Kraner and director Ryan Crego tease the interactive big-screen adaptation of Netflix's hit preschool series, also starring Kristen Wiig and Gloria Estefan. But now just days away from releasing in movie theaters across the country, Gabby herself wants to tell fans of all ages what to expect when Netflix‘s popular preschool series goes big screen. The little kids are going to stay entertained,” star Laila Lockhart Kraner tells The Hollywood Reporter of DreamWorks Animation‘s first live-action/animated hybrid film, written and directed by Ryan Crego. But I also think there's going to be a lot for everybody. Kraner, who is now 17, was 12 when she was first cast as Gabby, the live-action girl who uses magic in her cat ears to “pinch in” and shrink herself, along with her favorite stuffed animal, to go inside an animated version of her vibrant dollhouse. Gabby, best pal Pandy and her ensemble of cat-inspired friends — Cakey, MerCat, Carlita, Catrat, Baby Box, Kitty Fairy, Pillow Cat and DJ Catnip — have taken young viewers on 76 episodes and 11 seasons of cat-adventures with the hit Netflix series, all culminating now in Universal Pictures' Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie. So it's a lot of fun for the whole family.” Kraner says she was on set making an episode of Gabby's Dollhouse a couple of years ago when creators Traci Paige Johnson and Jennifer Twomey first floated the idea of making a Gabby movie to her. Then, enter animation creator, writer and director Crego, who was approached at a time when Gabby's Dollhouse was playing on loop in his own home. That'd be the coolest thing ever to make her favorite show into a movie. And, my son, who has grown up during the course of making this movie, has also fallen into the Gabby fandom,” Crego tells THR. Crego, inspired by his Cuban heritage, said a lightning bolt went off when casting Gabby's Gigi. “We were really lucky that she jumped on board because it's hard to imagine anyone else in that role,” he says of Estefan, who helps expand Gabby's world and also explains its magic. The voice cast also includes Thomas Lennon, Jason Mantzoukas, Ego Nwodim, Kyle Mooney, Melissa Villaseñor and Fortune Feimster. (Pre-released songs “Kaleidoscope,” “Gabby Dollhouse World” and “Pinching In” are already available.) “We tried really hard to make sure that the core audience of Gabby fans was going to be served first and foremost,” Crego says. So Kraner encourages moviegoers of all ages to keep that spirit alive. “A big part of the movie theater experience that is so special about Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie is that you're encouraged to go and sing and dance,” she continues. “That's always such a big part of the show that everybody really connects with, so being able to do that in a theater of other little Gabby fans is going to be such a blast. I hope everybody gets dressed up and brings their cat ears. It's supposed to be a fun and inclusive movie experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The limited edition features exclusive artwork, photos and poetry. Taylor Swift is right on target with her latest The Life of a Showgirl vinyl variant. Dubbed The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King, the limited pressings will feature a “summertime spritz pink shimmer” disc along with a collectible sleeve, a “giant” double-sided poster, an exclusive poem penned by Swift and special photos, according to the description. “A showgirl knows to save some of her best tricks for the grand finale…,” Swift wrote in her post, sharing photos of the Target edition. Available for purchase at $34.99, the Target exclusive will also feature its own custom cover art. The news follows a series of other Showgirl vinyls released by Swift, as well as a batch of Target-only Showgirl CDs containing exclusive double-sided posters. Featuring exclusive artwork, photographs and poetry, each vinyl variant became available for just 48 hours on the 14-time Grammy winner's website. In a recent Instagram video from Taylor Nation, Swift's official fan site, the musician explained why she wanted Showgirl to be available in so many different forms. “The photoshoot we did with Mert and Marcus was so extraordinary, and I was so happy with it, that I just wanted fans to have as many images from this world, this album era, as possible,” she said. The singer first announced the new LP on fiancé Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast, where she revealed that she'd made all 12 songs on the project with Max Martin and Shellback during her global Eras Tour. “I was so mentally stimulated and excited to be creating,” she said at the time. “We've made songs that I'm so proud of,” she added at the time. “We've never actually made an album before where it was just the three of us, there's no other collaborators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cherien Dabis' historical drama about a Palestinian family expelled from Jaffa in 1948 bowed at Sundance and is set for a theatrical release and awards season contention. Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo have boarded All That's Left of You, Jordan's selection for the best international feature Oscars category, as executive producers. When a Palestinian teenager gets swept up into a protest in the occupied West Bank and experiences a moment of violence that rocks his family, his mother recounts the political and emotional threads that led to that fateful moment. Angel Studios' Leap of Faith: Can Its Fan-Powered Model Survive Wall Street? “Cherien's beautiful, intelligent and deeply moving film All That's Left of You powerfully captures the true story of Palestine that has never been told before in a way that is both artistic and authentic,” Spanish actor Bardem said in a statement. A theatrical run in Los Angeles starting Nov. 28, 2025 is planned to position the movie for awards season play. That will be followed by a release in select cities on Jan. 9, 2026, before opening nationwide. Dabis' third feature also screened at Telluride after the conflict in Gaza forced principal production to shift from Palestine to Cyprus, Jordan and Greece. Dabis' two previous features, Amreeka (2009) and May in the Summer (2013), both debuted at Sundance. Amreeka went on to win the Fipresci international critics prize at Cannes. “I'm beyond thrilled to have two people I deeply admire, Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, join us in amplifying the urgency and importance of this film,” Dabis said in her own statement. “All That's Left of You takes audiences back to 1948 — the origin of Palestinian displacement — and follows one family across nearly eight decades, shaped by political forces beyond their control. The producer credits are shared by Dabis, Thanassis Karathanos, Martin Hampel and Karim Amer. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: With her time playing Eleven on the hit series Stranger Things coming to an end later this year, Millie Bobby Brown looks to have already found that next great character to play as sources tell Deadline the Emmy-nominee is in final negotiations to star as Olympian Kerri Strug in the pic Perfect. Ronnie Sandahl is writing with Brown producing under her PMCA banner. Gia Coppola Talks Close Collaboration With 'Sinners' DoP Autumn Durald Arkapaw & Floats Idea For 'The Last Showgirl' Sequel: "Shelly And Annette Rob A Casino" -- San Sebastian Netflix's Top Films & TV Series In The Data Dump Era: 'Squid Game' Stuns, British Bragging Rights, Plus Why 'Boss Baby' & 'CoComelon' Are King The image of her landing it perfectly and then having that ankle give out only to have her coach carry her off the mat is still considered one of the more memorable moments in Olympic history. Ever since her breakout role in the first season of Stranger Things, Brown has done a good job of picking her non-Stranger Things projects including her very successful Enola Holmes franchise with the third film expected to bow sometime soon. With this project, she gets her first big chance to sink her teeth into something that could play for the awards crowd similar to when Margot Robbie played Tonya Harding in I, Tonya. Next up for Brown is the final season of Stranger Things, which Netflix release over three volumes with the first set of episodes bowing over Thanksgiving weekend and the final episode bowing on New Years Eve. She also has Enola Holmes 3 and is about to start filming the Netflix pic Just Picture It opposite Gabriel LaBelle. Coppola feature directorial debut Palo Alto premiered at Telluride, Venice and Toronto Film Festivals before its 2014 Tribeca Film release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Chastain expressed her disappointment with Apple's decision to postpone the release of her upcoming limited series The Savant — about an undercover investigator who goes after online extremist groups — in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. In a statement shared on social media the following day, Chastain wrote, “I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. While AppleTV+ did not mention Kirk or cite any specific reasons behind its decision, it's widely believed that it stemmed from concerns over the show's content in relation to recent events. Based on descriptions of the series, there are no plot lines or characters that directly parallel Kirk or his death, but the show does contend with online extremism and political violence. But as Chastain seemed to suggest in her statement, Kirk's death isn't necessarily an isolated act of political violence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up nearly 12 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube. since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. “Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.” This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled. Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. He added: “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon MGM Studios‘ adaptation of Rebecca Yarros' bestselling novel Fourth Wing is closing in on a new showrunner. Wednesday Season 2 executive producer Meredith Averill is in final negotiations to board the project as writer and executive producer, sources tell Deadline. She would succeed Moira Walley-Beckett who left in June, a year after she was tapped to pen the adaptation. WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer was among a number of top writers who met on the project. The Fourth Wing TV series comes from Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Kilter Films and Premediated Productions. Planned as a five-book series, with Fourth Wing (2023), Iron Flame (2023) and Onyx Storm (2025) as the first three titles, The Empyrean follows twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail as she leaves the life of a Scribe behind at her mother's demand that she become a dragon rider. Fourth Wing has spent 88 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 18 of them at #1. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

But actors have to act (we love them for that, and that for them), and even a screen icon of Thompson's cachet is powerless to pass up the prospect of saying dialogue like “Freakin' fiddlesticks shitBUNS!” in a Marge Gunderson-thick Brainerd accent. So while the rest of us might have been happy to stay warm at home, Thompson hoofed it out to the snowy wilds of Finland in order to film “Dead of Winter,” a programmatic but tightly plotted thriller — set amidst a brutal Minnesota blizzard — in which she plays a widowed ice fisher who asks the wrong guy for directions on the way to a certain lake (he's not quite in the middle of feeding a human body into a wood chipper, but he might as well be). Hardly a scene goes by where Thompson isn't beaten, chased, and/or shot at in sub-zero temperatures, but you get the sense that all of the frostbite in the world couldn't have stopped her from getting her own little taste of “Fargo.” Related Stories Harris Dickinson Curates Roxy Film Series Ahead of His Directing Debut ‘Urchin': Varda, Tarkovsky, and More ‘Slow Horses' Season 5 Is an Invigorating Rebuke to Anti-Intellectualism Amid a World Gone Mad If only they could find a way forward for themselves. All “Minnesota nice” and quiet sorrow, she planned to start her search at a fishing spot that was especially meaningful to her late husband; the only problem is that she can't find it. Minutes later, after Barb's truck breaks down, she watches Camo Jacket hunt down and hand-tie a young woman (Laurel Madsen) who escaped from his house. But sneaking into Camo Jacket's basement and stealing the girl won't be easy, because Camo Jacket is married to Purple Lady (played by a rifle-toting Judy Greer, a fentanyl lollipop always lodged in her mouth), and she isn't quite as helpless as her husband. The action is taut, the stakes are clear, and Kirk never misses a chance to remind us that all of these are just regular people who've crossed paths in a dark place. These are humble Americans more accustomed to baiting fish than shooting humans, and while that may not excuse all of the thriller cliches this movie indulges when push comes to shove during its do-or-die third act (i.e. someone running out of ammo right when they've lined up a certain kill shot), every Coen brothers-esque blunder reinforces the idea that these characters have been forcibly diverted from the lives they were meant to live. To that end, the movie's greatest conflict might be that between their folksy earnestness and their flinty desperation, and it's a conflict that every member of the cast is able to articulate within themselves without resorting to caricature. The mystery as to why Purple Lady and Camo Jacket have kidnapped a suicidal woman is too opaque at first (something to do with organ harvesting, it seems? ), and then too impractical by the end (she's getting a doctor to do what? Recurring flashbacks — in which a younger Barb is embodied by Thompson's own daughter Gaia Wise — do more to disrupt the film's suspense than to meaningfully complicate its protagonist, but the most impactful of these glimpses into her marriage offer some insight into the various roles she hoped to play over the course of her life (wife, mother, entrepreneur, etc. ), and hint at the difficulties that have come from being recast against her will. If Thompson exudes too much tenacity for us to need such labored glimpses into her character's past, the extra insight makes it that much easier to buy her character's transformation into a badass good Samaritan, and “Dead of Winter” never loses sight of what its backwoods shenanigans mean to Barb on a deeper level. People will do anything to survive, but a life without purpose can be worse than death; watching Emma Thompson bleed, shiver, and shoot her way through a movie this cold is proof enough of that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. UPDATE 9/24: “The Savant” star Jessica Chastain in an Instagram statement made clear that she is “not aligned” with Apple on the studio's decision to delay the show, though she respects their decision to do so and admires their partnership. She explains that “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.” They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. ‘The Savant' is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Related Stories Jimmy Kimmel Made Himself Unassailable — Will That Be Enough? ‘Slow Horses' Season 5 Is an Invigorating Rebuke to Anti-Intellectualism Amid a World Gone Mad Original story follows: The anxiety around the political and cultural reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk is so high that we could see more media companies on edge about how audiences react to their content. “The Savant,” a limited series starring Jessica Chastain originally set to premiere this Friday on Apple TV+, will be postponed, a rep for Apple TV+ told IndieWire. While no specific reason was given, nor was any new release date announced, it's believed that current events contributed to the delay. “The Savant” stars Chastain as a woman who infiltrates online extremist groups in an attempt to discover mass shootings and extremist acts of terrorism before they happen. The series was created by Melissa James Gibson and was inspired by a 2019 article in Cosmopolitan, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” It shows a series of “snipers, bombings, ambushes” — with Chastain specifically trying to bring down someone who wants to make an imprint on history with the type of event people refer to “with a month and a date.” It's also a show that grapples with Chastain's moral dilemma of wondering if it's right to be engaging with such people, even if it's in the name of a greater good. “The Savant” would not be the first time a show or an episode was delayed in order to provide some breathing room from real-life tragedies. But the fervor over “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being pre-empted last week (it comes back on air tonight) is likely just the first example of media companies in this very moment looking closely at what's being said and represented on their screens as showrunners reach for the headlines with politically relevant commentary and entertainment.

Kimmel had made a joke about the man alleged to have shot and killed right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, prompting Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr to threaten the network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, with retaliation. Find Kimmel's complete opening monologue from his return below. Jimmy!” He began by remarking, “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol,” and expressed his gratitude to his fellow late-night talk show hosts and the audience for their support. Kimmel made a point to thank conservative pundits and politicians including Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz by name: “Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects—some of the things they say even make me want to throw up—it takes courage for them to speak up against this administration, and they did and they deserve credit for it.” Kimmel continued, “I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He also acknowledged CBS' recent cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East,” Kimmel remarked. “Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country, and that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities you live in to take my show off the air. At one point, Kimmel quoted a 2022 social media post from Brendan Carr during his tenure as FCC commissioner: “Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while humor to draw more people into the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.” A later segment featured Robert De Niro loosely impersonating the now-FCC chair—a reference to De Niro's role in Martin Scorsese's 1990 mob drama Goodfellas and a recent comment from Cruz comparing Carr to a “mafioso.” Unfortunately, and, I think, unjustly, this puts them at risk. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. It touches many, and, if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, it should be that, and not this.” Notably, this evening's episode of Kimmel did not air on all ABC stations nationwide. Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Kimmel tonight. McLachlan recently canceled her scheduled performance at the premiere event for Disney+'s Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery documentary, which took place on Sunday, September 21, “in support of free speech.” Watch her sing “Better Broken” below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Though FCC Chair Brendan Carr's comments last week have inspired Sinclair and Nexstar broadcast groups to continue preempting Kimmel's show, the host delivered a heartfelt and, dare we say, historic monologue to the rest of America. Those serviced by Sinclair and Nexstar will have to search it out on YouTube. “This country has become so authoritarian,” Kimmel said, “That Germans are like, ‘Come here. But while many reached out to Kimmel with kind words, the host had even kinder ones for those who were not fans. “I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” he said. “I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human,” he said. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some, it felt either insensitive or unclear, or maybe both. Not to mention, he thanked his viewers for the revolt and demanded that those same people show up for Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers should the president target them. “Our leader celebrates Americans losing their jobs because he can't take a joke.” He also continued his tradition of saying things that would irritate the president. “You almost have to feel sorry for him,” said Kimmel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That his character, Finn, never developed a coherent arc didn't help. After the series petered out with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, which revealed Finn to be a space equestrian, Boyega made his issues with Disney, particularly its handling of non-white characters, very well known. Appearing at Florida Supercon 2025, per Popverse, Boyega, once again, got candid about how the sequel trilogy and how he would've made a “whole completely different thing” had he been a producer. “They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it,” he said. I would want to give those characters way more way more.” It's not too surprising that most of his complaints, like those of many fans, are about The Last Jedi.
