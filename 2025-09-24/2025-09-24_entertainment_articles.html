                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up nearly 12 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube. since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. “Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.” This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled. Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. He added: “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this.

Maybe Trump assumed the same would happen to Kimmel. However, if more than 11 million people are willing to tune in online as well, his fight can't be with the networks.

But actors have to act (we love them for that, and that for them), and even a screen icon of Thompson's cachet is powerless to pass up the prospect of saying dialogue like “Freakin' fiddlesticks shitBUNS!” in a Marge Gunderson-thick Brainerd accent. So while the rest of us might have been happy to stay warm at home, Thompson hoofed it out to the snowy wilds of Finland in order to film “Dead of Winter,” a programmatic but tightly plotted thriller — set amidst a brutal Minnesota blizzard — in which she plays a widowed ice fisher who asks the wrong guy for directions on the way to a certain lake (he's not quite in the middle of feeding a human body into a wood chipper, but he might as well be). Hardly a scene goes by where Thompson isn't beaten, chased, and/or shot at in sub-zero temperatures, but you get the sense that all of the frostbite in the world couldn't have stopped her from getting her own little taste of “Fargo.” Related Stories Harris Dickinson Curates Roxy Film Series Ahead of His Directing Debut ‘Urchin': Varda, Tarkovsky, and More ‘Slow Horses' Season 5 Is an Invigorating Rebuke to Anti-Intellectualism Amid a World Gone Mad If only they could find a way forward for themselves. All “Minnesota nice” and quiet sorrow, she planned to start her search at a fishing spot that was especially meaningful to her late husband; the only problem is that she can't find it. Minutes later, after Barb's truck breaks down, she watches Camo Jacket hunt down and hand-tie a young woman (Laurel Madsen) who escaped from his house. But sneaking into Camo Jacket's basement and stealing the girl won't be easy, because Camo Jacket is married to Purple Lady (played by a rifle-toting Judy Greer, a fentanyl lollipop always lodged in her mouth), and she isn't quite as helpless as her husband. The action is taut, the stakes are clear, and Kirk never misses a chance to remind us that all of these are just regular people who've crossed paths in a dark place. These are humble Americans more accustomed to baiting fish than shooting humans, and while that may not excuse all of the thriller cliches this movie indulges when push comes to shove during its do-or-die third act (i.e. someone running out of ammo right when they've lined up a certain kill shot), every Coen brothers-esque blunder reinforces the idea that these characters have been forcibly diverted from the lives they were meant to live. To that end, the movie's greatest conflict might be that between their folksy earnestness and their flinty desperation, and it's a conflict that every member of the cast is able to articulate within themselves without resorting to caricature. The mystery as to why Purple Lady and Camo Jacket have kidnapped a suicidal woman is too opaque at first (something to do with organ harvesting, it seems? ), and then too impractical by the end (she's getting a doctor to do what? Recurring flashbacks — in which a younger Barb is embodied by Thompson's own daughter Gaia Wise — do more to disrupt the film's suspense than to meaningfully complicate its protagonist, but the most impactful of these glimpses into her marriage offer some insight into the various roles she hoped to play over the course of her life (wife, mother, entrepreneur, etc. ), and hint at the difficulties that have come from being recast against her will. If Thompson exudes too much tenacity for us to need such labored glimpses into her character's past, the extra insight makes it that much easier to buy her character's transformation into a badass good Samaritan, and “Dead of Winter” never loses sight of what its backwoods shenanigans mean to Barb on a deeper level. People will do anything to survive, but a life without purpose can be worse than death; watching Emma Thompson bleed, shiver, and shoot her way through a movie this cold is proof enough of that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon MGM Studios‘ adaptation of Rebecca Yarros' bestselling novel Fourth Wing is closing in on a new showrunner. Wednesday Season 2 executive producer Meredith Averill is in final negotiations to board the project as writer and executive producer, sources tell Deadline. She would succeed Moira Walley-Beckett who left in June, a year after she was tapped to pen the adaptation. WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer was among a number of top writers who met on the project. The Fourth Wing TV series comes from Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Kilter Films and Premediated Productions. Planned as a five-book series, with Fourth Wing (2023), Iron Flame (2023) and Onyx Storm (2025) as the first three titles, The Empyrean follows twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail as she leaves the life of a Scribe behind at her mother's demand that she become a dragon rider. Fourth Wing has spent 88 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 18 of them at #1. She was creator/executive producer on the CW's Star-Crossed and also executive produced Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman claims Metro sexually assaulted her in 2016, while the producer calls the case a "shakedown" she concocted while high on ayahuasca. The trial has just begun in a rape lawsuit against Metro Boomin – but attorneys for the superstar producer's alleged victim are asking for a mistrial, saying a defense lawyer made improper claims about her sexual history during opening arguments. A jury in Los Angeles federal court heard opening arguments on Tuesday (Sept. 23) for the civil case brought by Vanessa LeMaistre, who alleges she blacked out after ingesting Xanax and alcohol in Metro Boomin's studio during a 2016 recording session and later woke up to the producer (Leland Wayne) raping her. He has always maintained that their 2016 sexual encounter was consensual – but lawyers for LeMaistre say Metro's team went too far during opening statements on Tuesday by arguing that the two had also had consensual sex before that night at the recording studio. In all sexual violence trials, there are strict rules that limit the defense from alluding to an alleged victim's sexual history or apparent proclivities. Typically, a defendant needs to ask permission from the judge before bringing up any sexual conduct that is not tied to the specific incident at issue in a trial. LeMaistre's attorneys – led by Michael Willemin of the powerhouse plaintiff's firm Wigdor – say in a mistrial motion filed late on Tuesday that Metro's lawyers did not properly seek judicial approval before making these statements about their prior sexual history (which LeMaistre denies). Willemin says there's “no possible way to undo” the prejudice that Metro's opening caused, since jurors cannot unhear this statement. He's asking Judge R. Gary Klausner to declare a mistrial and start the whole case over again. Judge Klausner will likely address this issue before the trial is set to resume on Wednesday (Sept. 24). LeMaistre says she confided in Metro about the recent death of her 9-month-old son, and that they “bonded over the ability of music to help people in their darkest moments.” But LeMaistre's belief about her bond with Metro allegedly “shattered” the following September, when the producer invited her to watch him work in his California recording studio. LeMaistre alleges she became pregnant as a result of the assault and had an abortion in November 2016. The lyrical reference in LeMaistre's lawsuit is surprising, since Metro is a music producer and songwriter but does not typically write lyrics or rap himself. Metro's position is that LeMaistre has transformed a consensual sexual encounter into a false tale of rape in order to squeeze money out of him. He's focused heavily on LeMaistre journal entries from when she was high on ayahuasca in 2024, in which she detailed a “plan” to sue Metro for more than $3 million. The issue of ayahuasca took center stage when LeMaistre testified in court on Tuesday following opening statements. Rather, said LeMaistre, the ayahuasca merely helped her come to terms with the fact that her nonconsensual sex with Metro had been rape. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

UPDATE 9/24: “The Savant” star Jessica Chastain in an Instagram statement made clear that she is “not aligned” with Apple on the studio's decision to delay the show, though she respects their decision to do so and admires their partnership. She explains that “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.” They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. ‘The Savant' is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Related Stories Jimmy Kimmel Made Himself Unassailable — Will That Be Enough? ‘Slow Horses' Season 5 Is an Invigorating Rebuke to Anti-Intellectualism Amid a World Gone Mad Original story follows: The anxiety around the political and cultural reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk is so high that we could see more media companies on edge about how audiences react to their content. “The Savant,” a limited series starring Jessica Chastain originally set to premiere this Friday on Apple TV+, will be postponed, a rep for Apple TV+ told IndieWire. While no specific reason was given, nor was any new release date announced, it's believed that current events contributed to the delay. “The Savant” stars Chastain as a woman who infiltrates online extremist groups in an attempt to discover mass shootings and extremist acts of terrorism before they happen. The series was created by Melissa James Gibson and was inspired by a 2019 article in Cosmopolitan, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” It shows a series of “snipers, bombings, ambushes” — with Chastain specifically trying to bring down someone who wants to make an imprint on history with the type of event people refer to “with a month and a date.” It's also a show that grapples with Chastain's moral dilemma of wondering if it's right to be engaging with such people, even if it's in the name of a greater good. “The Savant” would not be the first time a show or an episode was delayed in order to provide some breathing room from real-life tragedies. But the fervor over “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being pre-empted last week (it comes back on air tonight) is likely just the first example of media companies in this very moment looking closely at what's being said and represented on their screens as showrunners reach for the headlines with politically relevant commentary and entertainment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean “Diddy” Combs is facing a new civil abuse lawsuit from his longtime stylist Deonte Nash, months after the ex-employee testified against the hip hop mogul at his criminal trial. In a case submitted Wednesday in a Los Angeles court, Deonte Nash accuses Combs of assault, sexual battery and other wrongdoing – the latest of dozens of such lawsuits filed against Diddy since abuse claims first surfaced in 2023. The case from Nash, who also served as a stylist to Combs' longtime girlfriend and alleged abuse victim Cassie Ventura, comes after he testified at the star's blockbuster criminal trial in May, and less than two weeks before the star will be sentenced for his convictions on prostitution charges. In his lengthy complaint, Nash says Combs turned his dream of working as a celebrity stylist “into a nightmare that he was forced to endure nearly every single day” for the ten years he worked for the star from 2008 to 2018. At a party in “2013 or 2014,” Nash says the star exposed his penis and moved closer to him until the stylist told him to stop. Nash felt violated and offended by this unwanted sexual touching.” He says he eventually had “no other choice” but to resign in 2018, but that Combs then “continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.” Nash's tabloid-style accusations are insulting not only to Mr. Combs but also to the countless individuals who worked honorably and professionally within his companies,” Wolff said. “In court, the truth will prevail, as it did in his criminal trial: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone—adult or minor, man or woman. Mr. Combs looks forward to clearing his name again in a court of law where truth matters.” At his blockbuster trial this spring, Nash took the witness stand for the prosecution, telling jurors he had seen Diddy physically abuse Ventura and threaten to release sex tapes of her if she didn't do what he demanded. But when the verdict was handed down, jurors largely cleared Combs, acquitting him on the core RICO and sex trafficking charges that could have seen him sentenced to prison for life. He was convicted only on two lesser counts of transporting Ventura and others across state lines for prostitution. His lawyers asked the judge Monday to sentence him to 14 months in prison — a sentence that would see him released almost immediately on time served. Several have been dismissed in recent months, including one case filed by Making the Band 2 contestant Sara Rivers and another case by a John Doe plaintiff, but many others remain pending.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Denis Villeneuve will embark on the search for an actor to play the world's most famous fictional spy, James Bond, next year when he completes production on Dune: Part Three. Also, Bond … James Bond will be male, as written by creator Ian Fleming, and importantly, will be an actor who hails from the British isles. Yes, they want a Brit to play Bond. That rules out fanciful speculation that the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Glen Powell, Austin Butler, Jacob Elordi and others who don't hail from UK shores are in the running. Those in the know tell us the ideal approach is to cast “an unknown,” possibly in his late 20s or early 30s, to play what Fleming called “a blunt instrument” — the lethal but “extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened.” If that criteria is stuck to, that means favourites such as Tom Hardy, aged 47, Idris Elba at 53 and Henry Cavill, aged 42, presumably don't match what Villeneuve, producers David Heyman and Amy Pascal, and execs at Amazon MGM Studios are leaning towards. Also, consider that by the time Bond 26 begins shooting in 2027, both Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jack Lowden will be 37 years of age. How rugged and imposing will this Bond be? Fleming describes Bond as being over 6 foot tall, even taller in his best Jermyn Street brogues. Knight's work includes SAS Rogue Heroes, Peaky Blinders and Eastern Promises, all of them featuring kick-ass, bone-crunching scenes. “Whoever it is, has to look like he could kill you with his bare hands in a trice. From the moment you see him, that has to be readily apparent,” a person close to discussions tells us. Online speculators and betting companies throw out names without thinking who Bond is. Knight will be going back to Fleming's earliest novels — Casino Royale (1953), Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia, with Love (1957), Doctor No (1958) and Goldfinger (1959) — to help remind us who Fleming's protagonist is. Might the new Bond be more in the mould of a younger Sean Connery who originated 007 in 1962's Dr. No? There's a sense from the many conversations I've had that Knight's going back to Bond's beginnings as a Royal Navy Commander before being recruited by MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence agency, to perhaps chart how Bond attained 007 status. I want to stress that this is what I'm hearing but to caution that none of this is confirmed or fully formed because the script is still being written and the direction of travel is still up for grabs. Could Bond be played by a non Caucasian, I asked sources? Are they right for the story that Villeneuve and screenwriter Knight will be telling? While we're here, it's worth pointing out the obvious: Bond 26 will not take up where No Time to Die, the final iteration in the franchise under Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, left us; with Bond dead. That said, I suspect a few old Bond hands might well be consulted on the quiet in the snug of a private club in Pall Mall, London. An unprecedented number of applicants have already sent in their pitch to play James Bond to the production. But understand that the casting process has not begun and it won't until Denis finishes the Dune movie,” they continued. It pays to remember that  Craig, who, although famous to those of us who followed his career on stage and in independent and Hollywood movies, was not a household name when he was picked to play Fleming's approved British government assassin. I know that Broccoli knew of Craig's theater history but it wasn't until she saw Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake that she became convinced he should be cast for Casino Royale. British actors in their mid 20s to early 30s, with stellar acting chops, who fit the Bond mould, are going to be under an intense spotlight for the next 12 months. There's a lot of talk about the movie premiering in the November slot favored by past Bond movies. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. I say he should bring back one person from the previous regime: Daniel Kleinman to do the opening titles. Given the lead time on this, even if they cast a young-ish guy, he'll probably age out before the picture is released.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He does, however, feel he is qualified to tell American women that if they take it during pregnancy they might give their children autism. The declaration came during a joint press event on Monday. Trump — flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz — said that “effective immediately” the Food and Drug Administration “will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen,” commonly sold under the brand name Tylenol, “during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.” The existing body of research is limited, contradictory, and difficult to replicate. The president, who once suggested using bleach to kill Covid-19, and Kennedy, a raw milk evangelist who seems allergic to academic research, are nevertheless charging ahead with the dubious advice. Fight like hell not to take it.” he said, suggesting women simply “tough it out” through pain or fever during pregnancy. Kennedy added that “clinical laboratory studies” suggested a “potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.” “Paracetamol (acetaminophen) does not cause autism, ADHD, or learning disabilities,” Dr. Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, tells Rolling Stone. Botha, whose work and research focuses on Autism Spectrum Disorders, adds that the studies suggesting correlation — not causation — did not control for things like genetics and family history: “As soon as you control for those things, any correlation like that essentially disappears.” It's a reality even the FDA acknowledged in its announcement of the administration's new guidance. “It is important to note that while an association between acetaminophen and neurological conditions has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,” the FDA wrote in its public statement. Kennedy has, for decades now, promoted claims that vaccines are responsible for increased rates of autism diagnoses in children, a phenomenon experts agree is more closely related to increased awareness and ability to identify the condition. In April, Kennedy publicly vowed to conduct a “massive testing and research effort” through HHS to find the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders. “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,” Kennedy said at the time. Botha notes that the causes of autism have been researched for decades, and largely point to a multi-factor originating largely based on biology — not pharmaceutical exposure. Gavin Newsom Says His Social Media Strategy Reveals ‘the Absurdity of Donald Trump' Donald Trump Threatens to Sue ‘ABC Fake News' Over Jimmy Kimmel's Return Trump's Attacks on the First Amendment Aren't Over Kamala Harris Acknowledges Campaign Mistakes, Slams Trump's ‘Fragile Ego' on ‘The View' What's more concerning in Botha's view is that the administration's description of Autism Spectrum Disorders as an “epidemic” — as something to pin blame for and eliminate — is dehumanizing language that veers into eugenics. “Autistic people are dehumanized, we know that from other research, as well,” Botha says. … Autistic people and their families, are deserving of respect, are deserving of adequate support, this is the last thing those families need” “You have certain groups, the Amish, as an example, they have essentially no autism.” Trump added that “there's a rumor” that there is “virtually no autism” in Cuba because “they don't have money for Tylenol.” (This is false.) (Last year, researchers at Drexel University conducted a large-scale study of 2.5 million births in Sweden between 1995 to 2019, and found no direct causal risk related to the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.) “Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy,” ACOD President Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement. In a statement provided to Rolling Stone, Kenvue — the manufacturer of Tylenol — indicated their belief that “independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. “The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,” Kenvue continued. Public health experts, research, and medical professionals have long been struggling to compete with outright falsehoods being broadcast at max volume from the most powerful political office on the planet.

Kimmel had made a joke about the man alleged to have shot and killed right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, prompting Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr to threaten the network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, with retaliation. Find Kimmel's complete opening monologue from his return below. Jimmy!” He began by remarking, “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol,” and expressed his gratitude to his fellow late-night talk show hosts and the audience for their support. Kimmel made a point to thank conservative pundits and politicians including Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz by name: “Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects—some of the things they say even make me want to throw up—it takes courage for them to speak up against this administration, and they did and they deserve credit for it.” Kimmel continued, “I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He also acknowledged CBS' recent cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East,” Kimmel remarked. “Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country, and that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities you live in to take my show off the air. At one point, Kimmel quoted a 2022 social media post from Brendan Carr during his tenure as FCC commissioner: “Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while humor to draw more people into the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.” A later segment featured Robert De Niro loosely impersonating the now-FCC chair—a reference to De Niro's role in Martin Scorsese's 1990 mob drama Goodfellas and a recent comment from Cruz comparing Carr to a “mafioso.” Unfortunately, and, I think, unjustly, this puts them at risk. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. It touches many, and, if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, it should be that, and not this.” Notably, this evening's episode of Kimmel did not air on all ABC stations nationwide. Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Kimmel tonight. McLachlan recently canceled her scheduled performance at the premiere event for Disney+'s Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery documentary, which took place on Sunday, September 21, “in support of free speech.” Watch her sing “Better Broken” below.

Those serviced by Sinclair and Nexstar will have to search it out on YouTube. “This country has become so authoritarian,” Kimmel said, “That Germans are like, ‘Come here. But while many reached out to Kimmel with kind words, the host had even kinder ones for those who were not fans. “I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” he said. “I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human,” he said. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some, it felt either insensitive or unclear, or maybe both. Not to mention, he thanked his viewers for the revolt and demanded that those same people show up for Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers should the president target them. “Our leader celebrates Americans losing their jobs because he can't take a joke.” He also continued his tradition of saying things that would irritate the president. “You almost have to feel sorry for him,” said Kimmel.

After the series petered out with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, which revealed Finn to be a space equestrian, Boyega made his issues with Disney, particularly its handling of non-white characters, very well known. Appearing at Florida Supercon 2025, per Popverse, Boyega, once again, got candid about how the sequel trilogy and how he would've made a “whole completely different thing” had he been a producer. “They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it,” he said. I would want to give those characters way more way more.” It's not too surprising that most of his complaints, like those of many fans, are about The Last Jedi.
