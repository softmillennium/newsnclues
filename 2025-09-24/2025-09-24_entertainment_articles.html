                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As viewers of the ceremony know, first-time Emmy's host Nate Bargatze came up with a novel (if mildly controversial) method to get award recipients to cut their acceptance speeches short at this year's show: Every second winners went over their allotted 45-second window, Bargatze would deduct a thousand dollars from a planned $100,000 donation he intended to make to the Boys & Girls Club Of America. Which wasn't exactly how it was supposed to go down, according to an appearance that the comic made on his own Nateland podcast this week. Saying he “almost sent an email out” ahead of the show to try to explain his intent, Bargatze says he initially envisioned the studios stepping up—or being encouraged to step up by their stars—to cover when talent overran their time. “If someone was giving these long speeches, I just thought they could be like, ‘and Netflix is gonna cover my overage,'” Bargatze explained, saying it would have allowed stars to “Go long, but then be a hero.” To be clear, Bargatze isn't complaining about having to pony up himself: He's one of the most successful stand-ups on the planet, with Billboard estimating that he's made something north of $80 million from touring alone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kostanski's deliberate and detailed aesthetic choices are proof that there's an encompassing plan, but the playful daring emanating from each of his low-budget projects also feels tougher to sustain as the films get larger. With Deathstalker, Kostanski attempts to bring his loose, gleeful style to the sword and sorcery genre, and mostly succeeds, giving us another midnight movie essential. Based on the 1983 Roger Corman film of the same name, Kostanski's version follows Deathstalker (action staple Daniel Bernhardt), a warrior and scavenger living in a world beset by war. He spends his days roaming battlefields and picking valuables off the corpses. There are a lot of classic sword-and-sorcery beats here, from the reluctant hero to the quest for redemption to a weird little guy named “Doodad” just following you around, helping out with magic. But Deathstalker is at its best when Bernhardt plays the title role like a put-upon, working-class grave robber just trying to get a monkey off his back, and Kostanski knows when to step back and let that irreverence shine through. Irreverence is a key part of the Psycho Goreman filmmaker's toolkit, and Deathstalker‘s weak point is that these moments have never felt less at home. Certain scenes featuring grand pronouncements from villains while the heroes are talking like regular people are a chuckle-worthy juxtaposition, but Kostanski's script wants to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to serious fantasy and scattershot comedy. Yet these growing pains, as a filmmaker stretches his shtick into a new genre, are often overshadowed by the sheer force of the primary-colored mayhem erupting onscreen. Though his pop culture homages are often what get viewers in the door, Kostanski has always been after something more than revitalizing old aesthetics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 100 former ABC News employees including Sam Donaldson, Tom Bettag and Judy Muller have signed on to a letter urging Disney CEO Bob Iger to step it up when it comes to publicly defending journalists under political attacks and the company itself against government pressure. “We want to acknowledge and commend your decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's show,” the ABC News employees wrote in the letter, first reported by CNN. “It was the right call and an important statement that political intimidation should not dictate ABC's programming. “Yet, it must be just the first step in a concerted effort to defend free speech and press freedom against political intimidation. The $16 million settlement with Donald Trump, combined with the absence of a strong public defense of ABC News journalists under attack, has emboldened Administration efforts to intimidate the press.” Also signing on to the letter was Kayce Freed Jennings, the widow of World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings. The letter was organized by Lisa Stark, a former correspondent, and Ian Cameron, a former executive producer, per CNN. We urge you now to reaffirm that legacy by: Making clear that ABC News—and Disney—will not be silenced or intimidated by political pressure; Publicly and unequivocally defending ABC journalists against political attacks; Aggressively pushing back against government efforts to undermine the First Amendment.” In December, just before Donald Trump took office, ABC settled his defamation lawsuit for $16 million. In fact, Trump was found liable to sexual assault. Last week, hours after FCC chairman Brendan Carr warned ABC stations over a remark that Jimmy Kimmel made on his ABC late-night show, the network pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live! But that action generated a backlash against Disney, with Barack Obama and former CEO Michael Eisner calling on corporate executives to stand up to the administration. Just before Kimmel returned to the air on Tuesday, Trump posted a new threat to the network, vowing to take action alleging that his show was an “illegal campaign contribution.” “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. The Federal Election Commission has a news media exemption, and a campaign finance expert, Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said that the network and Disney also would fall under an exemption for commercial activity. “There is no indication the decision [to bring Kimmel back] is being driven by anything other than a commercial decision. That is not even close to a campaign contribution,” Ghosh said. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. In the ABC markets where Sinclair and Nextar refused to air Kimmel, Iger should have offered up the show to other competing networks. Watch how fast they'd suddenly want the show back. What about the $16 million settlement with Donald Trump? Well let's see, Trump clearly doesn't like Jimmy or anyone who pokes fun at him,so y is it funny when Trump nicknames people and thinks it's funny and calls other people criminals, with ni evidence what so ever,one person is joking and the other is being a bully, so I think our president has more important things to do. So all his yes people around him should concentrate on that and let's actually make America great again,we have to stop and start living like the constitution was written.

We've all watched the credits to a movie and passed some degree of judgment when the star of the movie is also listed as a producer of some sort. We'll sometimes jump to the conclusion that it must be a vanity credit, one that was offered as sweetener in order to close an actor's deal. Opening Sept. 26 in movie theaters, The Strangers: Chapters 2 once again chronicles Petsch's Maya as she's pursued across a small Oregon town by the titular serial killers. Petsch, along with director Renny Harlin and producer Courtney Solomon, managed to shoot an entire trilogy in just 52 days. That figure ultimately changed once they addressed fan criticism of Chapter 1, adding three-to-four weeks of additional filming on Chapter 2 and 3. 'The Strangers: Chapter 2' Director Renny Harlin Says Fan-Driven Additional Photography Retooled Upcoming 'Chapter 3' Madelaine Petsch Faces Masked Pursuers Again in 'The Strangers: Chapter 2' Trailer “I did not have the credit at first. “And that ultimately became [producer] Courtney Solomon and I editing the script every day after set, going through shot lists with Renny [Harlin] and being more sewn into the fabric of the story in a producorial way. Petsch adds that vanity credits are often a necessity for smaller productions. “Usually, they'll do that to pay actors less money because they don't have a lot of money,” Petsch says. Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Petsch also previews the concluding chapter of her Strangers trilogy and why she hopes it'll break the fall release pattern of Chapter 1 and 2. When we spoke last year for The Strangers: Chapter 1, I asked you what scene will likely linger for years to come, and you said you'd tell me after I saw Chapter II. I have a feeling that the boar sequence is really important to Maya's overall arc. Am I correct or incorrect to draw that conclusion? Does no dialogue make your job all the more difficult, since you have to sell each moment physically? I would say there's probably an hour of this film with no dialogue in it, and it's just a different challenge that's not done very often. For example, there's an interesting moment where she silently takes inventory of her wounds and scars in front of a mirror. What was on your mind in that moment? It's like, “This is my reality now.” When you're in this state of fight or flight, and survival, you're not really thinking, “I can't believe this is happening to me.” You're just thinking, “I've got to survive.” So in that moment when she stops and catches herself in the mirror, she's taking inventory of every single attack and every single thing she's been through in the last 24-to-48 hours that has changed her innately as a human being. And ultimately, I think she is, in real time, saying goodbye to that final piece of humanity. Lionsgate released a clip of the morgue scene where Maya encounters her deceased fiancé (Froy Gutierrez's Ryan). It really didn't affect us at all. When you're shooting a movie like this, that's the least of your concerns. You told me previously that you helped punch up the 278-page script for all three chapters and suggested scenes like the shower scene in Chapter 1. I actually did not have the credit at first. Would you be willing to listen to them?” And that ultimately became [producer] Courtney Solomon and I editing the script every day after set, going through shot lists with Renny [Harlin] and being more sewn into the fabric of the story in a producorial way. Usually, they'll do that to pay actors less money because they don't have a lot of money. They'll be like, “We'll give you an EP credit, which will help you, but it's a vanity credit.” So I got offered this credit because I was actually doing the work. It made both films amazing and way stronger. There's a trailer for Chapter 3 in the mid-credits of Chapter 2, and there's a very tantalizing glimpse at what's to come. The trailer has a moment where my jaw dropped about what was revealed, but then I noticed a little detail that made me second-guess what I saw. So I'm very curious how everything is going to shake out. It's so funny because somebody else brought that moment up and didn't notice that, so I was like, “Go back and watch her wrists again.” But it's about whatever Lionsgate feels and what fits into their release schedule the best. It's also about what other movies are already releasing during those weekends, so that's up to the Lionsgate Gods. All I know is that we are done, and we are ready to show it as soon as possible. At the Chapter 1 premiere, your former Riverdale castmates, Lili Reinhart and Camila Mendes, showed up to support you, and I thought that was a really lovely gesture. It's so easy to lose track of friends as time passes, so did the three of you make a pact to not let that happen? Those two girls are still my absolute best friends in the whole world. It can go one of two ways when you shoot a show like that, and it went the right way with us. We had each other to constantly lean on in any scenario. We still call each other to be like, “I am doing this movie. Have you heard of this director?” And someone will say, “Oh, I met with him.” And someone will ask, “What was your experience like?” We're a unit. It's rare in Hollywood to find people who don't feel competitive with you and support you so unabashedly, so I'm really lucky to have found my people. You also starred in and EP'd a romcom that's coming out on Oct. 8. Was Maintenance Required meant to be a palate cleanser after all the fictional trauma you endured in your Strangers trilogy? It was not meant to be a palate cleanser. So I love the idea of being in an Amazon romcom where I get to play a mechanic and do something completely different. But I think it'll be fun for audiences to be able to go see me in this horror film — and go through the PTSD of it — before coming home to cuddle up and watch something that's sweet and cozy.

According to Page Six, the former “Jon & Kate Plus 8” star is dating Steve Neild, her longtime former bodyguard. The pairing has sparked warm reactions from fans who remember Neild as a steady presence during Gosselin's early years in the spotlight. He became her bodyguard in 2008 and has been photographed with the reality TV star many times throughout the years. For years, she kept her dating life almost entirely private, focusing on raising her eight children while managing the challenges of reality TV fame. Now, reports suggest that her bond with Neild has grown beyond the professional, blossoming into something more personal and supportive. “There's no doubt that Kate is crazy about him … things are serious, they have discussed wedding plans and moving on that next stage,” the source told the outlet. Hints of Gosselin's new romance surfaced earlier in the week when she surprised fans during a TikTok Q&A session.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In an eight-figure deal, understood to be the biggest out of this year's TIFF market so far, new U.S. distributor Row K has taken rights to the Cliffhanger reboot starring Pierce Brosnan and Lily James. The reimagining of the 1993 classic, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Carry-On), is currently in post-production and is being lined for a 3,000 screen stateside theatrical release in 2026. The film will follow a seasoned mountaineer, Ray Cooper (Brosnan), who operates a luxury chalet in the Dolomites with his daughter, Sydney. Ray's other daughter Naomi (James), still haunted by a past climbing accident, witnesses the attack and escapes. Row K Entertainment Acquires Indie Romance 'Charlie Harper' Starring Nick Robinson & Emilia Jones In Second Deal Out Of TIFF Buyer Row K Makes First Acquisition Gus Van Sant's 'Dead Man's Wire' The pic is written by Ana Lily Amirpour, Sascha Penn, Mark Bianculli and Melanie Toast. The deal marks Row K's third buy out of TIFF since its launch in August, following Gus Van Sant's Dead Man's Wire starring Bill Skarsgård, Dacre Montgomery, Cary Elwes, Myha'la, Colman Domingo and Al Pacino, and Tom Dean and Mac Eldridge's Charlie Harper starring Nick Robinson and Emilia Jones. “Cliffhanger is an exciting addition to Row K's growing slate and a clear example of the kind of event-level films we are bringing to the marketplace,” said MCT Principals and Row K Co-Chairman Christopher Woodrow and Raj Singh. “We are building a pipeline of star-driven titles made for the big screen, and Cliffhanger checks every box. Our third acquisition underscores the momentum we're generating and the type of ambitious, audience-forward distribution model Row K was designed to deliver.” Added Row K President Megan Colligan: “What drew me to Jaume Collet-Serra's Cliffhanger is how it blends the adrenaline and scale of a classic action movie with a fresh, modern twist – exactly the experience that younger audiences are showing up for. The original Cliffhanger was celebrated for its mountain cinematography, and this reimagining honors that legacy with sweeping backdrops across Europe – the result is a stunning production built for theaters.” The 1993 original, which took $255M global, starred Sylvester Stallone with Renny Harlin directing.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The dispute stems from a soured partnership between Insomniac, the global dance music events company partly owned by Live Nation, and Miami club and festival operators David Sinopoli, Davide L. Danese and Jose Gabriel Coloma Cano, who are best known for operating the city's famed Club Space venue and their work on the city's III Points festival. Insomniac brought a lawsuit last month against Sinopoli, Danese and Coloma Cano (referred to as “CDD” in legal papers), claiming the group tried to “bully” its way into more control over upstart Miami club Factory Town. But in counterclaims filed Wednesday (Sept. 24), CDD says it's actually Insomniac and Rotella who brought down their partnership with bad faith business practices. The countersuit cites social media comments critiquing Insomniac, as well as a 2012 criminal indictment that charged Rotella with bribing an event manager at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The charges were later dismissed, with Rotella pleading no contest to a misdemeanor conflict of interest and getting probation. He is also insufferable to work with,” write CDD's lawyers. Reached for comment on these new counterclaims on Wednesday, Insomniac's attorney Jordan Shaw says he's confident in their legal position and that CDD's personal attacks are irrelevant. “Their counterclaim is exactly what we expected, and the fact that they're relying on social media posts and dropped charges from 20 years ago tells you everything you need to know about their current claims,” says Shaw. Insomniac's original lawsuit against CDD claims the promoters made “outrageous demands” last year for more money and control of Factory Town. The two sides went into mediation this summer and emerged with a settlement, under which Insomniac would buy out CDD for $3 million and assume control of Factory Town. The Insomniac lawsuit alleges the CDD parties have since breached this settlement agreement by interfering in its planning of Factory Town's Hocus Pocus Halloween party and programming for Art Basel Miami in December. CDD says Insomniac has breached the deal by booking talent without their approval and ignoring myriad emails from CDD, copies of which are included in the suit. In one example, CDD claims Insomniac made an offer to party brand CircoLoco “that represented a 44% increase from the prior year's deal.” CDD objected to this offer, saying that it did “not reflect historical performance, venue capacity, or the reality of our shared structure.” The countersuit alleges that subsequent emails about the details of this deal were ignored by Insomniac. CDD's lead attorney, Bruce Weil, said in a statement on Wednesday that his clients have “established themselves as respected and valuable members of Miami's community through years of supporting local artists and boosting the local economy.” “It is disappointing that Pasquale Rotella and Insomniac are manipulating the facts by accusing CDD of the exact misconduct they themselves have inflicted, while retaliating against Club Space by attempting to obstruct and undermine CDD's ability to operate and manage it during a period of unprecedented success,” Weil added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this week's Trending Up, we look at how listeners have responded to disturbing headlines reportedly related to the alt-pop hitmaker. Welcome to Billboard Pro's Trending Up newsletter, where we take a closer look at the songs, artists, curiosities and trends that have caught the music industry's attention. This week: Gruesome headlines lead to rising streams for alt-pop hitmaker D4vd, while performers at the Charlie Kirk memorial service and songs featured in a much-anticipated Amazon Prime series finale see gains. Stevie Wonder Joins All-Star Cast for 'Perfect Angel: The Definitive Minnie Riperton Tribute' Aaliyah Lands Her First Adult R&B Airplay No. The human remains were uncovered inside an impounded Tesla on Sept. 8, and last Wednesday (Sept. 17), the body was identified as Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl who had previously been reported missing and, as Internet sleuths pointed out, had multiple connections to D4vd prior to her disappearance. Within that total, “Romantic Homicide,” which reached No. “Romantic Homicide” and other D4vd tracks have popped up on the Spotify daily top 50 chart as this tragic story has developed. On Sunday (Sept. 21), a memorial service for the assassinated conservative media figure and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Az. — with over 90,000 in attendance, and speakers who included both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as well as Kirk's widow Erika. As Kirk had been outspoken in his Christian faith, contemporary Christian music featured prominently in the proceedings — including performances from some of the biggest names in contemporary worship music, paying tribute to Kirk. Several of those performers experienced notable catalog gains following their performances. After seven years, Cardi B's long-awaited sophomore album Am I the Drama?,is finally here — and it's already having quite the impact on streaming. Released on Sept. 19, Drama has earned 78.3 million official on-demand U.S. streams in its first three days of release, according to Luminate. That set earned 4.15 million official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21), marking a 31% increase from the 3.17 million streams it collected the previous weekend (Sept. 12-14). Drama is filled with nifty samples, but two particular flips have boosted their original tracks: On the Lizzo-assisted “What's Going On,” Cardi sources 4 Non Blonde's “What's Up,” helped the 1993 track pull over 981,00 official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21). Over three seasons, Amazon Prime's romantic coming-of-age drama series The Summer I Turned Pretty proved itself not only one of the biggest shows of the decade, but one of the most prominent users of music synchs in recent TV history — with synch-tracking website Tunefind listing 104 songs used in its third season alone. That third and final season came to an end last Wednesday (Sept. 17) with 11 synchs used the season finale — all of which of course saw major bumps on streaming following their usage. More in the show's typical musical wheelhouse were synchs from Noah Kahan (“Everwhere, Everything,” also featuring Gracie Abrams) and Phoebe Bridgers (“Scott Street”), with the songs rising 45% and 79% to 1.9 million and 1.5 million streams over the same period, respectively. And even more impressively, Swift's Reputation highlight “Dress” saw gains of 666% after being used in a dramatic finale makeout scene, rising to 436,000 to 3.4 total million streams over the same period. And in case your hearts and/or Spotify playlists are hurting following the show's series finale, fret not: it was announced during the finale's red carpet celebration that The Summer I Turned Pretty would be returning for a franchise-concluding feature-length film, at a date to be determined.

Since its inception way back in 2012 (truly a different time), the “V/H/S” horror anthology series has delivered a reliable selection of thrills and chills with only slightly truncated regularity (the first three films arrived in 2012, 2013, and 2014, before putting a pause on the whole caboodle, only to come roaring back in 2021 and banging out entry out a year). Related Stories The 2025 — 2026 Film Awards Calendar Stretches Out the Season ‘Dead of Winter' Review: Emma Thompson Goes ‘Fargo' Mode in a Fun and Frigid Minnesotan Thriller The film just had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest over the weekend, and early reviews have been largely positive, hailing its combination of laugh-out-loud jokes and gory scares. Per usual, the anthology film is built on found-footage conceits, offering up five horror shorts and sixth that serves as both the frame for the entire endeavor and its own chilling entry. On offer this time around: stories about the evils of diet soda, suburban moms, crime scenes, Halloween candy, video stores, and even a cursed LP. The full trailer for “V/H/S/Halloween” leans way into its perfectly calibrated scary setting, but for all the obviously dark stuff this new look shows off (dark spaces, bone-crunching sound effects, and what is clearly a super evil crime scene), it's the specific Halloween stuff that really pops.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Chastain expressed her disappointment with Apple's decision to postpone the release of her upcoming limited series The Savant — about an undercover investigator who goes after online extremist groups — in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. In a statement shared on social media the following day, Chastain wrote, “I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. While AppleTV+ did not mention Kirk or cite any specific reasons behind its decision, it's widely believed that it stemmed from concerns over the show's content in relation to recent events. Based on descriptions of the series, there are no plot lines or characters that directly parallel Kirk or his death, but the show does contend with online extremism and political violence. But as Chastain seemed to suggest in her statement, Kirk's death isn't necessarily an isolated act of political violence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up nearly 12 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube. since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. “Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.” This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled. Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. He added: “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars.

However, if more than 11 million people are willing to tune in online as well, his fight can't be with the networks. That would make for a great Jimmy Kimmel Live!

But actors have to act (we love them for that, and that for them), and even a screen icon of Thompson's cachet is powerless to pass up the prospect of saying dialogue like “Freakin' fiddlesticks shitBUNS!” in a Marge Gunderson-thick Brainerd accent. So while the rest of us might have been happy to stay warm at home, Thompson hoofed it out to the snowy wilds of Finland in order to film “Dead of Winter,” a programmatic but tightly plotted thriller — set amidst a brutal Minnesota blizzard — in which she plays a widowed ice fisher who asks the wrong guy for directions on the way to a certain lake (he's not quite in the middle of feeding a human body into a wood chipper, but he might as well be). Hardly a scene goes by where Thompson isn't beaten, chased, and/or shot at in sub-zero temperatures, but you get the sense that all of the frostbite in the world couldn't have stopped her from getting her own little taste of “Fargo.” Related Stories Harris Dickinson Curates Roxy Film Series Ahead of His Directing Debut ‘Urchin': Varda, Tarkovsky, and More ‘Slow Horses' Season 5 Is an Invigorating Rebuke to Anti-Intellectualism Amid a World Gone Mad If only they could find a way forward for themselves. All “Minnesota nice” and quiet sorrow, she planned to start her search at a fishing spot that was especially meaningful to her late husband; the only problem is that she can't find it. Minutes later, after Barb's truck breaks down, she watches Camo Jacket hunt down and hand-tie a young woman (Laurel Madsen) who escaped from his house. But sneaking into Camo Jacket's basement and stealing the girl won't be easy, because Camo Jacket is married to Purple Lady (played by a rifle-toting Judy Greer, a fentanyl lollipop always lodged in her mouth), and she isn't quite as helpless as her husband. The action is taut, the stakes are clear, and Kirk never misses a chance to remind us that all of these are just regular people who've crossed paths in a dark place. These are humble Americans more accustomed to baiting fish than shooting humans, and while that may not excuse all of the thriller cliches this movie indulges when push comes to shove during its do-or-die third act (i.e. someone running out of ammo right when they've lined up a certain kill shot), every Coen brothers-esque blunder reinforces the idea that these characters have been forcibly diverted from the lives they were meant to live. To that end, the movie's greatest conflict might be that between their folksy earnestness and their flinty desperation, and it's a conflict that every member of the cast is able to articulate within themselves without resorting to caricature. The mystery as to why Purple Lady and Camo Jacket have kidnapped a suicidal woman is too opaque at first (something to do with organ harvesting, it seems? ), and then too impractical by the end (she's getting a doctor to do what? Recurring flashbacks — in which a younger Barb is embodied by Thompson's own daughter Gaia Wise — do more to disrupt the film's suspense than to meaningfully complicate its protagonist, but the most impactful of these glimpses into her marriage offer some insight into the various roles she hoped to play over the course of her life (wife, mother, entrepreneur, etc. ), and hint at the difficulties that have come from being recast against her will. If Thompson exudes too much tenacity for us to need such labored glimpses into her character's past, the extra insight makes it that much easier to buy her character's transformation into a badass good Samaritan, and “Dead of Winter” never loses sight of what its backwoods shenanigans mean to Barb on a deeper level. People will do anything to survive, but a life without purpose can be worse than death; watching Emma Thompson bleed, shiver, and shoot her way through a movie this cold is proof enough of that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>was pulled by ABC last week under pressure from the Trump administration. Kimmel had made a joke about the man alleged to have shot and killed right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, prompting Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr to threaten the network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, with retaliation. Find Kimmel's complete opening monologue from his return below. Jimmy!” He began by remarking, “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol,” and expressed his gratitude to his fellow late-night talk show hosts and the audience for their support. Kimmel made a point to thank conservative pundits and politicians including Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz by name: “Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects—some of the things they say even make me want to throw up—it takes courage for them to speak up against this administration, and they did and they deserve credit for it.” Kimmel continued, “I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He also acknowledged CBS' recent cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East,” Kimmel remarked. “Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country, and that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities you live in to take my show off the air. At one point, Kimmel quoted a 2022 social media post from Brendan Carr during his tenure as FCC commissioner: “Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while humor to draw more people into the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.” A later segment featured Robert De Niro loosely impersonating the now-FCC chair—a reference to De Niro's role in Martin Scorsese's 1990 mob drama Goodfellas and a recent comment from Cruz comparing Carr to a “mafioso.” Unfortunately, and, I think, unjustly, this puts them at risk. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. It touches many, and, if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, it should be that, and not this.” Notably, this evening's episode of Kimmel did not air on all ABC stations nationwide. Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Kimmel tonight. McLachlan recently canceled her scheduled performance at the premiere event for Disney+'s Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery documentary, which took place on Sunday, September 21, “in support of free speech.” Watch her sing “Better Broken” below.
