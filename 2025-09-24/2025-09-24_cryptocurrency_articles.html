                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hedera (HBAR) is gaining traction in global finance, integrating into CBDC pilots like Project Acacia, the AUDD stablecoin, and Australia's AP+ network. With upcoming exposure at SIBOS 2025 alongside Citi and Deutsche Bank, analysts see strong technical upside. Key support near $0.16 and Fibonacci targets up to $3.30 signal potential for a major breakout, positioning it as a leading blockchain for tokenization and real-world digital payment solutions. Analyst ChartNerd reports that the native token may be preparing for a strong upward cycle similar to 2021. The analysis identifies $0.16 (20-week EMA) and $0.11 (0.5 Fibonacci retracement) as critical support levels forming a launchpad for potential growth. The asset trades near $0.22, where maintaining strength above these support levels could signal renewed momentum toward higher Fibonacci extension targets of $1.20, $1.77, and $3.09. HBAR has recorded a modest 0.82% increase in 24 hours, trading around $0.22. Price movement during this period fluctuated between $0.223 and $0.218 before recovering to current levels, indicating buyer activity around key support. Trading volume reached $210.6 million, reflecting steady participation despite intraday swings. Beyond technical analysis, the memecoin is strengthening its position within global finance. This initiative explores tokenized assets, stablecoins, and wholesale CBDC use cases on its network. Hedera also powers the AUDD stablecoin, enabling real-time payments and atomic settlement. These developments demonstrate the enterprise-grade governance and secure, high-speed network built for regulated financial environments. The platform's global reach will be visible at SIBOS 2025, where Hedera will share the stage with leading financial institutions, including Citi, Lloyds, and Deutsche Bank. With technical setups pointing to a bullish market cycle and expanding adoption in CBDC and stablecoin infrastructure, the asset continues to establish the technological base for digital finance. By combining reliable on-chain settlement with regulatory engagement, the network is positioning itself as a key component in the next generation of payment and tokenization systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another crypto treasury company is betting on stock buybacks to appease investors, with Thumzup Media Corporation—which is currently stockpiling Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE)—the latest to see its share price climb after revealing such plans. This follows the recent completion of an initial $1 million buyback program this month, as the company repurchased 212,432 shares at a weighted average price of $4.71 per share. TZUP was recently trading for $4.82 per share, up about 6% on the day. Thumzup stock is down about 20% over the last month, continuing a decline after peaking at $16.49 in early August. "We believe our balanced approach, combining strategic accumulation of digital assets with investment in its underlying infrastructure, positions us well for sustained growth." The firm's board has also authorized purchases of Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and USDC stablecoin for its treasury. DeFi Development Corp. Stock Rises as Solana Firm Boosts Buyback Plan to $100 Million The social media marketing tech company has also signed a definitive agreement to acquire DogeHash Technologies, a Dogecoin mining operation with 2,500 active rigs and 1,000 additional rigs scheduled for delivery. This acquisition, subject to shareholder approval and closing conditions, would expand Thumzup's cryptocurrency mining capabilities. Other crypto treasury companies recently instituting stock buyback schemes include Ethereum-focused firms SharpLink Gaming and ETHZilla, along with Solana treasury company DeFi Development Corporation—the last of which revealed plans on Wednesday to repurchase up to $100 million worth of shares.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin bulls are trying to seize control but are expected to face strong selling at $117,500. Will altcoins capitalize on BTC's potential range-bound price action? Bitcoin made a strong comeback on Wednesday, but the buyers are expected to face heavy selling near $117,500. Several major altcoins are likely to face selling on rallies, but BNB and AVAX may resume their uptrend. Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $113,900 on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls continue to buy on dips. Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said on CNBC that consistent buying by large BTC exchange-traded funds on behalf of institutional investors and increased corporate adoption of BTC could resume the BTC rally toward the end of the year. Glassnode also said in its weekly report that BTC could hit a new all-time high, but added that history shows the cycle is in its late phase. BTC's current cycle shows similarities with the 2015–2018 and 2018–2022 bull runs, where all-time highs “occurred only 2–3 months beyond where we currently stand when measured from the cycle low.” However, not everyone is bullish on BTC's prospects in the future. CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno said in a post on X that whales have net sold 147,000 BTC since Aug. 21. Could BTC overcome selling by the bears and rise to $117,500? BTC has started a relief rally, which is expected to face strong selling at the moving averages. Buyers are expected to defend the $107,000 level with all their might because a break below it will complete a bearish double-top pattern. Sellers could pose a substantial challenge at $117,500, but if the bulls overcome it, the Bitcoin price could reach $120,000. Buyers are trying to maintain Ether (ETH) above the $4,060 level but are expected to face heavy selling on relief rallies. If that happens, the ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $3,745 and then to the pattern target of $3,426. The Ether price could swing between $4,060 and $4,957 for some time. XRP (XRP) has been trading inside a descending triangle, which usually acts as a topping pattern. If that happens, the selling could pick up and the XRP/USDT pair could move downward toward $2.20. If buyers want to prevent the downside move, they will have to swiftly drive the XRP price above the downtrend line. BNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($957) on Tuesday, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That signals the Solana price may extend its stay inside the large $110 to $260 range for a few more days. Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA indicates solid buying on dips. That suggests the DOGE/USDT pair may remain inside the large $0.14 to $0.29 range for a while longer. Contrary to this assumption, a break above the 20-day EMA shows demand at lower levels. This is a crucial level for the bears to defend because a break above $0.29 clears the path for a rally to $0.35 and then to $0.44. Buyers are trying to defend the $0.78 support in Cardano (ADA), but the relief rallies are likely to be sold into. If they can pull it off, the Cardano price could tumble to $0.68. Buyers are likely to have other plans. The up move is expected to pick up momentum above the resistance line. That opens the gates for a rally to $1.02. Related: XRP price prepares for ‘major trend shift' with $4 in reach: Analyst Sellers will try to halt any recovery attempt at the 20-day EMA. Buyers have successfully defended the uptrend line in Chainlink (LINK) but are struggling to start a strong bounce off it. Any recovery is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($23.11). The LINK/USDT pair may then descend to $18. Avalanche (AVAX) turned up sharply from the 20-day EMA ($30.71) on Monday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead hurdle at $36.17 on Tuesday. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That suggests profit booking by short-term traders. AVAX price could then slump to $27.38. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"What": a simple reply by crypto influencer Gainzy pretty much summed up the sentiment when the notorious convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF, seemingly posted on social media after a long hiatus (and despite being in jail). To make matters worse, the token linked to defunct crypto exchange FTX surged nearly 24% in the last 24 hours, after his X account posted a simple "gm" on Tuesday. This simple post seems to have been taken as an opportunity by speculative crypto traders to pump the FTT token, which now has no value associated with it, nearly 50%-60% within minutes, reaching a peak of around $1.20-$1.23. Despite his incarceration and clarification that the post was made by a "friend" on his behalf, the token is still up 25%, trading around $1.014, according to CoinDesk data. The crypto community on X reacted swiftly with anger, skepticism and humor to SBF's post. One of the most scathing replies came from on-chain investigator ZachXBT. His view reflects a segment of the community's lingering resentment towards FTX's collapse, which hurt investors who are still waiting for some of their funds from its bankruptcy estate and the broader crypto community. Read more: Who Won and Lost Most in Sam Bankman-Fried's Criminal Scheme? Other community members, including Laura Shin, mocked SBF's sudden social media activity, saying, "That's so 2021." Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder who now runs crypto venture fund Maelstrom, took a humorous jab, replying “Wen memecoin?” — a likely playful reference to the speculative, meme-driven nature of the surge in FTT token after SBF's unexpected post. This potentially underscores a view that the price movement was more about market psychology than substance. The surge in FTT token — once a key utility token for trading fee discounts and staking benefits on the FTX exchange — has been largely dormant since the platform's spectacular implosion that ushered in a brutal crypto winter that devastated many investors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wondering what's next after one of the largest long liquidation events of the year this week? In today's newsletter, Tom Lee says Wall Street's blockchain of choice is Ethereum, Flare launches a wrapped version of XRP for DeFi, Tether seeks to raise at a $500 billion valuation, and more. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid's home-grown stablecoin USDH goes live after Native Markets' winning bid. Don't forget to check out The Funding, a biweekly rundown of crypto VC trends. It's a great read — and just like The Daily, it's free to subscribe! Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee called Ethereum a "truly neutral chain" and said Wall Street and the White House are coalescing around it as their blockchain of choice. Flare Network has launched FXRP, a non-custodial, overcollateralized wrapped version of XRP that can be minted and used across DeFi protocols. Tether is reportedly in talks with investors to raise as much as $20 billion at a $500 billion valuation — which would place it among the world's most valuable private companies, ranking alongside Sam Altman's OpenAI and Elon Musk's SpaceX. The FTX Recovery Trust sued Genesis Digital Assets, calling Sam Bankman-Fried's investment from sister firm Alameda in the bitcoin miner one of his most reckless uses of commingled funds. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission unveiled a new initiative to let derivatives traders post tokenized assets like stablecoins as collateral, Acting Chair Caroline Pham announced Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Fox Business that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030, while warning of resistance from the banking industry. “I think Bitcoin could reach $1M by ~2030 based on current conditions and progress,” Armstrong posted this week along with an interview on Fox Business. Armstrong pointed to regulatory clarity, U.S. government Bitcoin reserves, and ETF adoption as key drivers of demand. His optimism comes as Congress works with two major pieces of crypto legislation: the Genius Act, providing rules for stablecoins was signed into law earlier this year, and the broader Clarity Act, which establishes market structure for all non-stablecoin assets. But he warned that big banks are already trying to derail progress. “Every company should be able to have reward programs, just like credit card points or airline miles,” Armstrong said on Fox Business. Allowing crypto rewards is a step toward normalizing an alternative financial infrastructure — one that doesn't run through the big banks. Coinbase itself has ambitions to be more than an exchange. Armstrong described the company as building a “super app” to replace legacy banks, offering trading, custody, payments, savings, and bitcoin-denominated rewards. “Ultimately we want to be a bank replacement for people.

CoinResearch is designed to provide users with in-depth analysis, accurate ratings, and expert recommendations for cryptocurrency investments. Its advanced algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to deliver actionable insights that can help users make informed trading decisions. “A lot of people in the crypto space will typically raise and have nothing,” Wright said.

The trend reflects diverse use cases from remittances to gaming, but regulatory uncertainty could limit long-term potential, analysts say

The Asia-Pacific region has become the world's fastest-growing hub for cryptocurrency transactions, with on-chain activity surging despite inconsistent oversight and varied pathways to adoption, according to a new report.

Analysts say the trend reflects not only diverse use cases – from remittances and savings to gaming and speculative trading – but also regulatory uncertainty across the region, which could limit long-term potential even as momentum builds.

The report, released on Wednesday by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, found that during the 12 months ending June 2025, Asia-Pacific had emerged as the fastest-growing region for on-chain crypto activity, with a 69 per cent year-over-year increase in value received.

Total crypto transaction volume in the region grew from US$1.4 trillion to US$2.36 trillion, driven by robust engagement across major markets including India, Vietnam and Pakistan.

Monthly on-chain value received grew from about US$81 billion in July 2022 to peak at US$244 billion in December 2024, a threefold increase over 30 months. Transaction volumes have since remained robust at above US$185 billion per month through mid-2025.

In contrast to North America, where cryptocurrency activity is largely driven by institutional investment, Asia-Pacific's growth is fuelled by broader, more retail-oriented demand, according to Chengyi Ong, head of Asia-Pacific policy at Chainalysis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A digital euro could be rolled out in the middle of 2029, European Central Bank Executive Board Member Piero Cipollone reportedly said Tuesday (Sept. 23). Speaking at a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt, Cipollone said the effort to create a digital euro had a “major breakthrough” last week when relevant finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to set customer holding limits, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. In February, it was reported that the European Central Bank was hoping that progress on legislative approval for a digital euro would be spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of dollar-pegged stablecoins. The European Commission put forward digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress had been sluggish. In March, it was reported that European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said that Europe's monetary autonomy and financial stability could be threatened by the Trump administration's interest in cryptocurrencies and dollar-denominated stablecoins. Cipollone said Sept. 4 that the European Union should accelerate its efforts to introduce a digital euro, in part because this technology would support resilience and inclusiveness. A digital euro would complement physical cash, which remains essential for resilience and inclusion, and would provide another universally accepted means of payment, Cipollone said. “In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times,” Cipollone said.

We have issued an enforcement notice to Bristol City Council (BCC) for failing to comply with its legal obligations to respond to people who asked for the personal information the council held on them – known as a subject access request (SAR). Sally-Anne Poole, Head of Investigations at the ICO, said: “Subject access requests are a fundamental right that allows people to know what information organisations hold about them and how it is being used. Despite our repeated engagement with Bristol City Council over a sustained period of time, limited progress has been made to clear a backlog of requests. Our investigation has found that the Council's approach towards compliance demonstrates a poor organisational attitude towards data rights and compliance with the law. This enforcement notice requires them to clear their SAR backlog in a timely manner, and make lasting improvements to bring their practices in line with the law.” The full enforcement notice can be read here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's recent 10% fall from its all-time high of $124,500 in early August has sparked speculation about whether this is just a healthy pullback or the beginning of a market top. Now, popular analytics firm Glassnode has released its latest report suggesting that we could actually be witnessing a ‘historically late phase' of Bitcoin's current market cycle. And in both cases, Bitcoin went on to reach an ATH within the following 2-3 months, which then marked the cycle's market top. Read on as we unpack Bitcoin's latest fundamental signals with the help of DeepSeek. And with that in mind, we'll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy right now. Although institutional and long-term Bitcoin holders have grown increasingly wary of getting in at all-time highs, short-term holders have been aggressively adding the digital gold to their portfolios. All in all, it's clear that Bitcoin is in a sensitive position right now, with macroeconomic factors like rate cuts and growing crypto clarity working in its favor, while exchange numbers and on-chain data also suggest we could see a potential deeper correction before rebounding. Whatever the case, it's hard to argue against Bitcoin and crypto in general heading toward a brighter future. If you want to ride that particular tailwind without getting caught up in short-term corrections or volatility, you'll be better off picking low-cap, high-potential gems that can deliver not only on hype but also on long-term vision. Here are our top 3 suggestions, based on DeepSeek AI's expert analysis. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is easily the best crypto presale on the market right now, having already raised nearly $18M from early investors in just a few weeks. Even better, there's no shortage of whale participation in this presale. For instance, two large whale buys scooped up nearly $100K worth of $HYPER just yesterday. A game-changing mission to turbocharge the Bitcoin blockchain with Solana-like speed, scalability, and programmability. Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer-2 solution that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), ditching the popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), in order to execute thousands of transactions simultaneously, effectively solving Bitcoin's age-old issue of sluggish speeds. Even better, developers and users on Bitcoin won't have to sacrifice Bitcoin's native security to reap the benefits of Hyper's lightning-fast execution. You can interact with these applications by simply converting your Layer-1 Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer-2 compatible $BTC tokens via Bitcoin Hyper's non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 – so a massive 2,300% ROI could be yours if you get in now. Visit Bitcoin Hyper's official website to learn more about how its canonical bridge ensures seamless access to Bitcoin's new Web3 environment. While many might believe that Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a slightly out-of-the-pocket suggestion when crafting a long-term crypto portfolio, DeepSeek points out that its Dogecoin theme and rampant hype could make it the next 1000x crypto. Maxi's plan is to dominate the meme coin market, potentially even surpassing Dogecoin in both market cap and raw returns. This mission is fueled by a roadmap that focuses on virality. The developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total token supply for promotional activities, including PR campaigns, influencer partnerships, and social media blitzes. At the time of writing, the Maxi Doge presale has accumulated over $2.4M from early investors, with each token available for just $0.000259. Check out Maxi Doge's official website to learn all about its hatred for Dogecoin, roadmap, and tokenomics. $BNB‘s recent run-up to new all-time highs, at a time when other mainstream tokens like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP are all either in red or barely in green for the month, have made it one of the best cryptos to watch right now. Although conventional investing wisdom advises against getting in at ATHs, there's a high likelihood $BNB might not churn out the pullback you're waiting for. Since this breakout, $BNB is up over 50%, and according to this trading pattern, we can expect the token to charge toward $2,000 in the coming weeks. Buy $BNB today on Binance, or any of the other major crypto exchanges. The crypto market is highly volatile, so kindly do your own research before investing.
