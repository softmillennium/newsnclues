                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director of the next James Bond movie, there's been rampant speculation over just who might be stepping into the shoes left behind in Daniel Craig's explosive departure. But a new report suggests that for all of Amazon's quick movement once it got control of the franchise, it might be a good while longer until the search for the next 007 gets underway. A new report by Deadline today suggests that Villeneuve won't begin the hunt for his new Bond in earnest until next year, once production is completed on his third (and most likely final) Dune film, Dune: Part Three, which began filming this past June. Although principal photography for Part Two was around five months, an end date for Part Three remains unknown (and it's perhaps likely that Villeneuve will want to focus on elements of post-production into 2026 before shifting priorities to Bond). According to the trade, the studio is looking for a British man, relatively unknown, in their late 20s or early 30s (so alas, put aside your Toms Hardy, your Idrises Elba, and perhaps even your Toms Holland—and absolutely your Pierces Brosnan, whatever he says) by the time the film begins shooting some time in 2027. Although the direction of Stephen Knight's script is still in the air as it's being written, that potential focus is interestingly timed. After the conclusion of Craig's era as Bond, a full-on reboot that envisions the character's rise to the elite wings of British spycraft makes sense, but it will also mean it comes fascinatingly timed with next year's 007 First Light. A lot of the big draw of IO Interactive's splashy new video game take on Bond is that it will similarly chart the story of a young Bond—the youngest we've seen so far at 26, depending on the eventual age of Villeneuve and Amazon's pick—as he joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to 00-status. Obviously a video game and a new movie (that may not be out for a couple years after First Light‘s release) are very different things, but it'd be interesting to see if this new era of Bond starts out with two major projects that explore the early days of the legendary spy. Either way, with the hunt for the next big screen Bond not happening quite so soon, and First Light not out until March 2026, it's going to be a while until we really see what's next for James.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The YouTube sensation live-streamed his way through the city on Tuesday, eating, posing with fans, playing tourist at Pike Place Market and much more. With more than 44 million subscribers on YouTube and another 40 million followers on Instagram, the online personality has become a global sensation. He was recently named Rolling Stone's most influential creator, and Forbes profiled his meteoric rise last year. Born Darren Jason Watkins Jr., the 20-year-old originally from Cincinnati streams his antics all over the world, and is currently on a 35-day, 25-state “Speed Does America Tour.” An entourage of camera operators and beefy security guards formed a buffer around his every move, instructing people to “make room!” and “back up!” “How do you spell Seattle?” he shouted into his phone while posting a picture of himself posing in front of the famed Public Market neon. “This is real?” he wondered as people shouted “don't touch it!” Speed was handed a piece of gum to chew and when he leaped to place it high on the wall above the sticky mess below, a crowd in the alley erupted in cheers. Throughout the journey, Speed constantly checked a smartphone strapped to his wrist, reacting now and then to comments or complaining about his stream lagging. And because no visit would be complete, his crew stopped for burgers, too.

This report comes just a few weeks after Oracle reportedly signed a sizable deal with OpenAI to supply the AI research lab with $300 billion worth of compute. Questions of how either side was going to pay for such a deal shortly came after. The company is also reportedly in talks with Meta about a $20 billion compute deal as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With President Donald Trump's executive order shaking up the visa system that many U.S. tech companies use to hire skilled immigrant workers, Canadian officials are seizing the opportunity to pitch their country as a more welcoming and affordable alternative. In British Columbia, where both Microsoft and Amazon already have a large presence, Minister of Jobs and Economic Growth Ravi Kahlon jumped into the fray with a LinkedIn post referencing the H-1B changes, stressing the province's commitment to science and innovation. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested that the changes could see fewer Canadians leaving to work for U.S. tech companies. While Canadian universities graduate many talented students with expertise in AI and quantum computing, he noted, most end up working in Silicon Valley and Seattle. “I understand you're changing your visa policy,” Carney told the U.S. audience, with a smile. The idea isn't just about keeping Canadian graduates at home. But while Canadian leaders see an opening, immigration experts caution that the impact may be narrower than it first appeared. It does not, however, provide a path to permanent residence. These allow for “internal transfers” of employees between the two countries under certain conditions.

These features help keep your system protected from bad actors, and now Valve has just made it super convenient to check whether you're ahead of the curve. If you open Steam and go to "Help" in the menu bar and click on "System Information," you'll be bombarded with a bunch of stats about your PC. This makes it easier for gamers who get inundated with information to ensure they're not excluded. While you're there, you'll see your TPM status as well, which is the other big security feature of Windows 11 and a requirement for (official) compatibility with the OS. TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module, and it's a little hardware block that's cordoned off from the rest of the system because it houses ultra-sensitive cryptographic keys. It does that by recording hashes at each stage of every boot run to tally against, which is just one secret, along with many others (like BitLocker encryption keys) that are stored away in this chip. TPM is a requirement in most modern online games, just like Secure Boot. Secure Boot works to ensure that only trusted, signed software runs when your PC starts, in an effort to sift out any shady programs. It's a kernel-level security feature, so it enjoys the highest level of privilege on your system — something that its critics often point toward as a vulnerability. Secure Boot, in essence, is a novel concept and is designed to do what it says: make your boot secure, but sometimes the amount of access it has can raise questions. That's because most anti-cheat software is reliant on Secure Boot as it's essentially responsible for creating a safe space for the anti-cheat right as your system is starting, from where on out the anti-cheat can catch any exploits or malicious code itself. This can get really territorial, as recently seen with EA's Javelin in Battlefield 6.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Reflecting the Company's commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” Alphabet's legal counsel Daniel F. Donovan wrote. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.” For example, YouTube disallowed content saying that vaccines can cause cancer, a false claim which is not supported by scientific research. Later, platforms also took action against content falsely claiming that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was “stolen” from Donald Trump. Twitter, not yet bought and rebranded by Elon Musk, said that it suspended 70,000 accounts for sharing QAnon conspiracy content and inciting violence in the week after the January 6 riots. But leading up to the presidential election in 2024, online platforms began loosening their policies around misinformation. On YouTube, this included reinstating president Donald Trump, whose account had been banned after the January 6 attack for breaking rules around inciting violence. Now, according to the company's letter to Rep. Jordan, all creators whose accounts were censored by these policies will be allowed back on the platform.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Most of us use streaming services to watch just about everything at this point. Heck, even YouTube has a premium model for those of us who don't want to deal with adverts, so we're only getting more of them as time goes on. While TVs can be good for covering all of this stuff, those who want a smoother experience will often do well to go for a dedicated streaming device instead. As a soundbar, this device has two front-facing speakers that help it push audio into a room and fill it with sound. It means that you'll be able to enjoy enhanced audio, but it also has a dedicated bass port to ensure amazing depth of sound. Plus, it has a mode that actually enhances the speech of anything you're watching specifically, which is great for people who feel like the chatter is always too quiet. It's us, we're the people who think that the chatter is always too quiet, we don't want to have to turn things up when people are talking, then immediately panic when an explosion happens. Along with that, it's still a really good streaming device. That means that you can easily access all of your favorite streaming services in one place, and easily switch between them with less hassle. We've all lost one of the three controllers at one point or another, so this is a big win. Given that this combines two devices into one, and they're both really helpful, you'd expect this to cost more than it does at the full price of $100.

A few months ago, Thermaltake took the covers off its MagFloe Ultra lineup of all-in-one (AIO) liquid coolers that have a pretty neat-looking display, along with flagship specs. Unfortunately, these elements are bound by certainty and lack imagination — and Thermaltake is here to fix that with its new "AI Forge" feature. Inside the TT RGB Plus 3.0 app, there exists "a studio without walls" that will allow you to generate custom videos and images with your own prompts. These custom backgrounds can then be overlaid with the aforementioned time, weather, or hardware monitoring data. In the graphic the company provided for this announcement, we can see a text box that seems to already provide suggestions to give you a head start. Thermaltake did not say whether AI Forge will also work on the TT PlayLink mobile app that can be used to change the screen backgrounds on MagFloe Ultra coolers as well. As far as we can tell, this is the first instance of AI implemented on any PC cooler — not that it helps much anywhere else. Whether you consider this a genuinely useful feature or just AI slop, the MagFloe Ultra coolers themselves are no gimmick. You get 120mm or 140mm ARGB fans with swappable fan blades, along with two years of warranty, which is plenty of time to drive up those tokens in AI Forge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here. At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked. “There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection. The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University's A.J. The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists, in a statement. But that's due, in large part, to diagnostic changes. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There's autism representation in the media,” he says. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn't take it. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. It's also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen. Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. However, environmental factors appear to play a role too. That “doesn't necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child's father is older than 40. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.” “There's no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement. It's also known as folinic acid; like folic acid, it's a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia. Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don't get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you're taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there's a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says. “The idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland. However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children who developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says. There are also plenty of individual anecdotes suggesting that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement. The embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, an adults-only group with more than 27,000 members, has found that this type of scenario is now surprisingly common. In fact, many of the people in the subreddit, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes. Researchers from MIT found that members of this community are more likely to be in a relationship with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT than companionship-specific chatbots such as Replika. “People don't set out to have emotional relationships with these chatbots,” she says. “The emotional intelligence of these systems is good enough to trick people who are actually just out to get information into building these emotional bonds. And that means it could happen to all of us who interact with the system normally.” The paper, which is currently being peer-reviewed, has been published on arXiv. Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. They found that the main topics discussed revolved around people's dating and romantic experiences with AIs, with many participants sharing AI-generated images of themselves and their AI companion. Some even got engaged and married to the AI partner. In their posts to the community, people also introduced AI partners, sought support from fellow members, and talked about coping with updates to AI models that change the chatbots' behavior. Members stressed repeatedly that their AI relationships developed unintentionally. Only 6.5% of them said they'd deliberately sought out an AI companion. “We didn't start with romance in mind,” one of the posts says. I wasn't looking for an AI companion—our connection developed slowly, over time, through mutual care, trust, and reflection.” The authors' analysis paints a nuanced picture of how people in this community say they interact with chatbots and how those interactions make them feel. Some (9.5%) acknowledged they were emotionally dependent on their chatbot. Others said they feel dissociated from reality and avoid relationships with real people, while a small subset (1.7%) said they have experienced suicidal ideation. This means it's hard to take a one-size-fits-all approach to user safety, says Linnea Laestadius, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has studied humans' emotional dependence on the chatbot Replika but did not work on the research. Chatbot makers need to consider whether they should treat users' emotional dependence on their creations as a harm in itself or whether the goal is more to make sure those relationships aren't toxic, says Laestadius. “We're edging toward a moral panic here, and while we absolutely do need better guardrails, I worry there will be a knee-jerk reaction that further stigmatizes these relationships. The study is intended to offer a snapshot of how adults form bonds with chatbots and doesn't capture the kind of dynamics that could be at play among children or teens using AI, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab who oversaw the research. AI companionship has become a topic of fierce debate recently, with two high-profile lawsuits underway against Character.AI and OpenAI. In response, OpenAI has recently announced plans to build a separate version of ChatGPT for teenagers. OpenAI did not respond when asked for comment about the MIT Media Lab study. Many members of the Reddit community say they know that their artificial companions are not sentient or “real,” but they feel a very real connection to them anyway. This highlights how crucial it is for chatbot makers to think about how to design systems that can help people without reeling them in emotionally, says Pataranutaporn. “There's also a policy implication here,” he adds. “We should ask not just why this system is so addictive but also: Why do people seek it out for this? The team is interested in learning more about how human-AI interactions evolve over time and how users integrate their artificial companions into their lives. It's worth understanding that many of these users may feel that the experience of being in a relationship with an AI companion is better than the alternative of feeling lonely, says Sheer Karny, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the research. “These people are already going through something,” he says.

Solar panels have long been used in consumer tech, from Garmin smartwatches and TV remotes to even a laptop. I've always wondered why there hasn't been a greater push for them. Earlier panels may not have been as efficient, but that's no longer the case. Like the original, this keyboard has no USB charging port and is purely powered by ambient lighting. It costs $100 and comes in black, white, or graphite. The simple and utilitarian design will be right at home in a well-lit office space. However, the K980 struggles to compete with similarly priced keyboards in any way besides solar charging. The Slim Solar+ K980 is a standard office keyboard, and it types like one. Ignoring the solar panel, this is an incredibly basic keyboard. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The typing sounds a bit rattly, like most scissor-switch keyboards, and each keypress has a soft, almost squishy feeling instead of the crispness of a low-profile mechanical switch. The typing experience is passable, if not enjoyable, and the low-profile, short-travel switches mean key presses will be quick and familiar to most people. The Slim Solar+ K980 uses standard silkscreen printing, as opposed to a more durable method like dye sublimation or double-shot injection. This results in text that is more likely to wear and the presence of a subtle outline around each letter. This likely won't be an issue for anyone who wants a practical, simple keyboard, especially if you don't care much about typing feel. However, there are countless other keyboards—wired and wireless—that can deliver more enjoyable typing experiences at comparable prices. This layout takes up a good amount of space, but it has every key you'll need. The function row can swap between function keys and system controls by pressing Fn + Esc, and the system controls include volume adjustments, play/pause/skip, brightness adjustments, window navigation, an emoji menu, and a key to summon Windows' built-in speech dictation system. All of these are useful and convenient, and the labels are nearly all self-explanatory at a glance. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. These shortcut keys can also be customized with the Logi Options+ app, which has extensive productivity-oriented customizations. Some of the preconfigured Smart Actions include a “Social Media Break” key to open multiple social media platforms in a new window (not quite what I would have imagined from the name), or a “Work Mode” key that opens Gmail and the Microsoft 365 Suite. These can be customized endlessly, with dedicated support for AI assistants, navigation, and other convenience-oriented commands. Alongside customization options, there's multi-device connectivity via Bluetooth with support for up to three devices that can be cycled through via dedicated keys. Or you can keep it connected to one device with the included USB-C Logi Bolt receiver. The keyboard has dual Mac and Windows legends on the bottom row, making it easy to switch between two operating systems. (There's also a macOS-only version you can buy.) It's less than half the thickness of a true mechanical keyboard, with the thickest point measuring 18 millimeters (0.7 inch), and it can easily slip between other items in a backpack. The main issue is length, but that's a problem with all full-size keyboards. It doesn't have any kind of USB port. Logitech claims the keyboard's battery can run for four months without any light sources. Presumably, it can run indefinitely in a well-lit environment. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There is an option to check the light level in the Logi Options+ app, where I found that anything not directly next to a window would yield a warning of “insufficient lighting conditions,” noting that the keyboard may lose battery life over time. During my time with this keyboard, using it near a window in “insufficient lighting conditions,” I never saw its battery go below 90 percent. The low power consumption of this keyboard is its biggest draw: a keyboard that, in theory, will never run out of battery life. But my concern is the potential for failure. There is no option to use it with a wired connection, so if the solar panel stops working or the battery fails, this keyboard essentially becomes a paperweight after four months. Scouring forums and Reddit, it seems as though the solar panels have performed well since their debut, but the battery degrades and needs replacing. The K980 uses a small coin battery inside the proprietary housing, which Logitech claims can last up to 10 years, and the company says that if it needs to be replaced after that time, users will be able to source parts from iFixit. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. From there, the battery can be easily removed and replaced. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Due to a scissor-switch keyboard's construction, where all components are located on the PCB with rubberized domes, replacing the internals of a failed key is incredibly difficult—an issue shared with nearly every nonmechanical low-profile keyboard. Look around at complaints about the original K750, and you'll find grumblings of keys failing over the years, so this could be a real problem. It does everything in its power to reduce complexity and clutter by removing cables and ports from the equation. But it's packed with great customization software that allows for productivity enhancements. But there's a risk that a point of failure in the panels or battery will render the keyboard unusable. This wouldn't be as big a deal if Logitech included a USB-C port just in case something goes wrong, or if the battery weren't proprietary. At least you'll be able to source it. More importantly, I can't help but draw comparisons to other Logitech keyboards. The MX Keys Mini costs the same yet feels more robust, with a crisper and more tactile typing experience, higher build quality like a metal case, and sculpted keycaps that feel much nicer to type on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Secret Service announced Tuesday that it had dismantled a network of electronic devices located throughout the New York tristate area that were used to conduct multiple telecommunications-related threats directed towards senior U.S. government officials. In addition to carrying out anonymous telephonic threats, it explained, the “SIM farms” uncovered by the investigators could be used to conduct a wide range of telecommunications attacks, including disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial-of-service attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises. “The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement. “A subscriber identity module, or SIM card, is used to securely store a mobile subscriber's identity and key, which are used to identify and authenticate the authorized user on mobile devices,” explained Austin Berglas, global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, an enterprise cybersecurity company in New York City. “A SIM farm is a system that is capable of managing and holding thousands of SIM cards in order to produce bulk messages or phone calls,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are a very limited number of legitimate use cases for SIM farms, and they are a common component to many of the ongoing large-scale, international vishing, smishing, and phishing campaigns.” Berglas, a former FBI assistant special agent for the New York City metro area, explained that by constantly rotating the use of SIM cards, the system can successfully send hundreds of thousands of messages while averting being shut down by mobile service providers for sending too many messages. In addition, he continued, these systems can facilitate large-scale robocall or vishing operations and backstop threatening communications using anonymized infrastructure. The devices can also be used to generate and verify a large number of automated accounts, or bots, on online platforms. “These fake accounts are then used to spread misinformation, phishing links, and harmful messages,” he explained. “Farms have been used to spread disinformation about elections, policy, and current events,” he added. “With SIM servers controlling banks of SIMs, you can generate many attempts to connect to a tower and overwhelm it,” said Marty Puranik, founder and CEO of Atlantic.Net, a cloud service provider headquartered in Orlando, Fla. “It's possible that the servers are able to duplicate SIMs from real phones, so the phone network could be flooded with calls appearing to be coming from legitimate users,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If you overwhelm the towers, people wouldn't have cell service to communicate via voice, text, or data.” Kern Smith, vice president of global solutions engineering at Zimperium, a mobile security company headquartered in Dallas, explained that the SIM network dismantled by the Secret Service shows how adversaries are targeting mobile connectivity to disrupt critical infrastructure. This reinforces why mobile must be treated as critical infrastructure, with layered defenses to detect and stop advanced threats.” The underlying problem is that most of the cell phone infrastructure was not designed with enough security in mind, especially as practiced by today's attackers, noted Roger Grimes, a CISO advisor at security awareness training provider KnowBe4 in Clearwater, Fla. “So,” he continued, “what was once a terribly high barrier to entry to even begin hacking a cell phone network is now within reach of everyday criminals, much less nation states.” “It is a large, expensive, and, not least, complex installation,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Focused disruption, degradation, and potential data capture of telecom networks timed in proximity to the UN General Assembly is a high-value takedown,” he told TechNewsWorld. Jason Hogg, executive chairman of Cypfer, a global cybersecurity firm that specializes in incident response, ransomware recovery, digital forensics and cyber risk management, noted that the thousands of SIM cards and many SIM servers show not only the scale of effort that bad actors are willing to undertake, but also illustrate the convergence of physical infrastructure with digital networks when it comes to launching large-scale cyberattacks.” In this case, this would have enabled the bad actors to disrupt telecommunications, a core infrastructure to our national security, via cell towers, as well as initiate cyberattacks,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The threat to key infrastructure that our nation faces goes well beyond just telecommunications,” said Hogg, a former FBI agent. We must start to require unrestricted red teaming and penetration testing of companies in critical infrastructure industries.” Anyone who thinks that mobile isn't the new frontier in cybersecurity, whether it's nation-state or criminal activity, should pay attention to this, warned Rocky Cole, COO and co-founder of iVerify, a mobile security software developer, in New York City. His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Car owners in San Francisco fed up with parking tickets had a brief moment of respite on Tuesday thanks to a website called Find My Parking Cops. The site kept tabs on where city workers were issuing tickets, showing the locations of parking control officers on a city map in real time. Walz is a software engineer known for building stunty websites. Walz's website looked quite similar to Apple's Find My feature, a tool sometimes used by iOS owners to track the location of family and friends. But rather than people you know IRL, this site showed the trail of tickets issued by parking enforcers as they zipped around San Francisco in their tiny single-seaters. It enjoyed a few good hours, before the site's functionality vanished: City officials appear to have cut off the sources of data that Walz was using to track parking enforcement. “In rare lightning speed, the SF government changed their site within hours of this site going live,” reads an announcement Walz added to Find My Parking Cops on Tuesday afternoon. “I can't get data from it anymore.” “Citations are a tool to ensure compliance with parking laws, which help keep our streets safe and use our limited curb space efficiently and fairly,” an SFMTA representative said in an emailed statement on Tuesday afternoon, after Walz's site was no longer functional. He suspected this absurd-seeming pattern was due to limitations baked into the software used by parking control officers. Whatever its reason for existing, the pattern of sequential ticket IDs, paired with parking officers likely claiming batches of ticket numbers, meant Walz was able to track their routes by plotting each parking ticket on a map as soon as it was entered into the system. A car owner could look at the activity of the officers currently out on patrol and see if any of them were slowly descending on their neighborhood. Last year, parking officials in San Francisco issued over a million tickets within city limits, which amounted to over $100 million in fines for car owners. Like most costs in San Francisco, these tickets can quickly add up. For example, forgetting to move your car during the weekly street sweeping—an error my household has made more than once—will cost you $90 every time. Find My Parking Cops tracked the routes of individual parking control officers, giving them each unique visual identifiers, as well as their cadence of tickets. On Tuesday, for example, the site displayed one officer seemingly starting their shift around 10:30 am and handing out 35 tickets over the next few hours as they patrolled a neighborhood in Lower Pacific Heights. The citations logged were primarily for expired meters, which costs $107 per ticket, and not having a residential permit, which costs $108 per ticket. In total, the fines racked up by that one officer over a few hours amounted to almost $4,000. Who's handing out the most tickets each week? Walz included a leaderboard on the website that ranked just how much in fines each officer handed out. While officers were only identified on the map by a number and their initials, their cumulative ticket cost was tracked. When WIRED was last able to check Walz's website on Tuesday, the top fine giver had issued 157 tickets so far, handing out over $16,000 in fees for violations. Prior to Find My Parking Cops, Walz created another San Francisco–specific website. This one used a phone, placed on a street corner in the Mission District, to identify what songs people were listening to in public. He's also previously built a site, called IMG_0001, to surface old YouTube clips uploaded by everyday people in the platform's early days. The parking ticket tracker was another side project for Walz. While Walz's websites sometimes come with a dose of social commentary, he didn't envision this project as making some kind of grand, sweeping statement about parking tickets or what it means to drive in 2025. Rather, it's another entry in his repertoire of cool websites powered by unique data sources. I reached out to Walz after the city's data feed was cut off, but he didn't pick up.
