                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That ethos was later institutionalized through initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship, which famously pays promising students $100,000 to leave college and start companies. For many years, the famed accelerator Y Combinator also quietly reinforced that culture. While it never explicitly required students to drop out, many of its most successful alumni, including Dropbox's Drew Houston, Reddit's Steve Huffman, and Stripe's John and Patrick Collison, joined the program young and left school behind to build their companies. The accelerator has introduced a new application track called Early Decision, designed for students who want to start companies but don't want to drop out. The program allows them to apply while still in school, get accepted and funded immediately, and defer their participation in YC until after they graduate. “It's designed for graduating seniors who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first,” said YC managing partner Jared Friedman in the launch video. Friedman added that the idea for Early Decision came from conversations with students. “Between AI Startup School last summer and the more than 20 university trips we've done over the past year, we've had a lot of opportunities to do that. One of YC's most common pieces of advice is to ‘talk to your users,' and we follow it ourselves,” he told TechCrunch over email. In Silicon Valley culture, dropping out has been almost a rite of passage for aspiring founders Programs like the Thiel Fellowship have turned it into a movement (though it's worth noting that Peter Thiel himself did not drop out but earned both undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford). It's why YC's announcement is a meaningful break from that mythos that leaving school early is the optimal, or only, path to startup success. The new program also reflects a growing maturity in how YC thinks about long-term founder outcomes. The accelerator has long been a magnet for college-aged builders. Founders of Loom, Instacart, Rappi, and Brex were in their teens or early twenties when they joined the program. Early Decision removes that pressure, offering a middle ground between academic completion and chasing entrepreneurship. In its announcement, YC highlights Sneha Sivakumar and Anushka Nijhawan, the co-founders of Spur, as a success story from this approach. They graduated in May 2024, joined the Summer 2024 YC batch and have since raised $4.5 million. YC notes that the program is open to both graduating students and those earlier in their academic journey. It's a bet that some of the best founders of the next decade won't need to choose between college and startups. The move also helps YC secure talent early in an increasingly competitive accelerator and seed funding landscape, giving students an option that competes with other programs like Thiel Fellowship, Neo Scholars, Founders Inc, as well as Big Tech internships and grad school pipelines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Indian court has dismissed an attempt by Elon Musk's X to challenge the Indian government's content takedown orders, ruling that the social media platform, as a foreign company, does not have a constitutional right to free speech under Indian law. The Karnataka High Court ruled Wednesday in favor of the Indian government's use of a centralized online portal to issue content takedown orders, determining that foreign platforms cannot invoke free speech protections under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The court said this constitutional of free expression applies only to Indian citizens. The decision marks a significant moment in India's increasingly assertive approach to regulating global tech companies. X filed the case in March, challenging a series of Indian government orders directing the platform to block certain accounts and posts, including content critical of official policies. The ruling comes as Musk expands his footprint in India beyond X, having recently launched Tesla operations and secured final regulatory approval for his satellite internet service Starlink. A legal representative for X in India was not immediately available to comment on the ruling. (Section 69A is India's main law governing how the government can order content blocking, and it includes procedural protections.) “To avoid unintended legal effects, the portal should operate strictly as a coordination and collection layer — a secure intake and routing point for requests, and any binding action should originate from a competent authority under the IT Act/Rules,” he told TechCrunch. Content takedown orders have increased in India over the past few years as more people come online. Several instances of content removal across platforms — including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram — occurred during the nationwide farmers' protests in 2020–2021. These protests saw widespread social media activity that the government sought to control. Companies, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, ShareChat, and LinkedIn, have already integrated the portal to remove content after receiving notices through an automated process triggered by the federal government or its agencies. In February 2024, X stated that, although it disagreed with the orders, it withheld certain accounts in response to executive directives from the Indian government. Noncompliance, the company noted, could have exposed it to “potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment.” A legal expert, who works closely with tech companies and the Indian government on policy matters and requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of their work, told TechCrunch that Wednesday's ruling was significant. The decision shows that courts are increasingly viewing internet regulation and tech policy through a policy lens — not just a legal one, they said. Musk, who has called himself a “free speech absolutist,” has not commented on the lawsuit and ruling, though he previously raised concerns about Indian content regulation laws.

These chips will serve as the high-end offerings in Qualcomm's second generation of Arm-based chips for laptops and other PC form factors. The company says its Elite chips will be made on a 3-nanometer process node. This is seemingly a standard Performance/Efficiency layout with different names. At normalized power, Qualcomm says it offers up to 75% more performance than its competitors. In multitasking, it claims the new chips will offer up to 31% faster performance at a normalized ISO power, while needing 43% less power than last-gen chips. The Elite Extreme has higher clock speeds in both single- and dual-core boost and multi-core max than the other two Snapdragon X2 Elite variants. There's also a new Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which the company says brings a 2.3x increase in performance per watt and power efficiency compared to the last generation. In its press release, Qualcomm writes that this NPU "is designed to handle Copilot+ and concurrent AI experiences." The X2 Elite chip supports Qualcomm's x75 5G modem-RG system, with up to 10 Gbps peak downloads. It also works with Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 for Wi-FI 7/6/6E and Bluetooth 5.4 LE. Qualcomm's new Guardian is an out-of-band management feature for business-focused remote oversight, akin to Intel's vPro. That may mean we'll see a device or two at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, before launch. Notably, Qualcomm's images and a sizzle reel both suggest that the X2 Elite will appear in both laptops and mini PCs. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. It's been over a year since the initial batch of Snapdragon X Elite chips were announced. Subsequently, a full lineup including the X Plus (in both 10-core and 8-core variants) and a standard Snapdragon X chip were released. The top-end chips appeared in designs from major manufacturers, including Microsoft, Samsung, Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo, and Acer. The initial chips showed off their efficiency through long battery life, and we hope to see the X2 SoCs build on that. They didn't, however, work with some applications (namely games) and we want to see better emulation support there. The Snapdragon Summit comes ahead of Apple's next major release (Apple is Qualcomm's biggest rival in Arm-based systems), which is rumored to be early next year. And of course, by the time many X2 devices make it to market in the first half of 2026, AMD and Intel may also have next-gen x86 chips ready to compete. Next year is shaping up to be an eventful one for those looking to buy a new laptop, which should be good for consumers and the industry as a whole.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualcomm has announced its next generation of PC processors: the Snapdragon X2. Nearly every major laptop manufacturer was on board, launching a bevy of Qualcomm-powered laptops. It was a shake-up that the Windows ecosystem needed to better compete with Apple, which began designing its own chips in 2020 with the M1 MacBook Air—a move that helped cement MacBooks as some of the best laptops around. Qualcomm rode out its surprising success throughout 2025, and finally it's time for a sequel. Qualcomm claims that the X2 Elite Extreme gets up to 39 percent faster peak single-core performance and 50 percent multicore performance over the previous generation. Emphasizing efficiency, Qualcomm also says the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme has “up to 75 percent faster CPU performance than competition at ISO power,” referring to comparing two chips when they're consuming the same amount of power. As Qualcomm later specified, this comparison was with the beefy Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, requiring 144 percent more power to reach its peak performance than the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme. Other impressive-sounding performance claims the company made include up to 49 percent faster Microsoft 365 performance (as tested in Procyon Office) and up to twice as fast file compression against the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V. ARM-powered processors, like those in smartphones and MacBooks, tend to be highly efficient, leading to longer battery life and better performance at lower power levels. Qualcomm says it's continuing this lead, with its new CPU requiring up to 43 percent less power versus the previous generation, across both the X2 Elite and Elite Extreme. Qualcomm says power efficiency has improved by 2.3X, so hopefully that means these laptops can scale up performance when it's needed, in games or creative applications. Qualcomm says gaming will take a big step forward in this next generation. Of course, these Qualcomm laptops continue to rely exclusively on integrated graphics, meaning the discrete GPUs in dedicated gaming laptops are still on another level of performance. Lastly, the company claims there's a much more powerful neural processing unit (NPU) with 80 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) of on-device AI processing performance. We've yet to see the explosion of on-device AI processing be relevant for the average person, but hopefully, more performance will provide an incentive for developers to build more unique AI experiences that can utilize the NPU. This is a change from the original marketing around the first-generation Snapdragon X chips, which centered battery life as its primary selling point. At a later meeting, Kedar Kondap, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Qualcomm Compute and Gaming, told me that Snapdragon X2 laptops would maintain its position of leadership in battery life. Although exact estimates or figures weren't given, Kondap stated that the greater efficiency of the third-gen Oryon CPU would lead to even longer battery life than its predecessor. These second-generation PC chips have been announced months ahead of devices from competitors, which may not arrive until the first quarter of 2026, making it easier to compare with previous-gen chips. Intel is expected to launch its highly anticipated A18 chips (also known as Panther Lake) later this year, and Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel could change everything in the world of PCs. Apple is also expected to debut an M5 chip next month. These were officially unveiled last week, but at the company's Snapdragon Summit conference, it shared new details on how these chips will perform. Barely a week has gone by since Apple's A19-powered iPhones hit the market, but Qualcomm is already claiming that its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is the “fastest mobile CPU in the world,” with a record clock speed of 4.6 GHz (Apple's A19 Pro has a clock speed of 4.26 GHz). Like the PC chips, graphics and AI processing have the largest leaps in performance, with a purported 23 percent faster GPU and 37 percent faster NPU. Some slightly faster single-core performance in your next phone might not be noticeable, but the significantly faster GPU could have a bigger impact on mobile gaming. The other significant new feature on these mobile chips is the embrace of a new video codec called Advanced Professional Video, or APV. This is a “near-lossless” codec, created in partnership with Samsung, that's meant to compete with Apple's ProRes format and use less storage than current options. Qualcomm says new phones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 will launch "in the coming days,” with entries from Xiaomi, OnePlus, Samsung, Honor, and Xiaomi. Qualcomm also briefly announced the base Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 but didn't offer many details about it. In addition to increasing network speeds, Amon says, it will be a “network that is intelligent to have perception in sensor data.” Amon implies that another level of connectivity is needed for a world where AI needs to process sensor data at the edge, whether that's from your phone or a pair of smart glasses, and then be trained on that data from the real world around you. Amon went on to predict when this change will start happening. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google senior VP of devices Rick Osterloh. Google senior vice president of Devices and Services, Rick Osterloh, got up on stage to chat shop with Amon. We're building together a common technical foundation on PCs and desktop computing systems.” Osterloh mentioned Android by name, though he didn't mention Chrome OS, implying this new unified platform will still be Android at heart. “We're really excited about this, and I think this is another way Android is going to be able to serve everyone in every computing category.” Amon chimed in: “I've seen it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Boyega, who played Finn across the sequel trilogy, hasn't been shy about holding back, whether it's his opinions on “Reylo” or how the fandom treats Star Wars‘ Black characters, to name two recent topics. And though The Rise of Skywalker hit theaters in 2019, it feels like people are still constantly asking Boyega to talk about Star Wars. The event was held back in July, but as Variety reports (via Popverse), his comments are now going widespread, likely because Boyega seemingly unloaded on how he would've approached the Lucasfilm sequel series a lot differently. “If I was a producer on Star Wars from the beginning, you would have had a whole completely different thing … we're not getting rid of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, all these people. I would want to give those characters way more.” He also had some ideas about how the new Star Wars characters should have approached their own Force powers. “Our new characters will not be OP'd [overpowered] in these movies. They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it. You've got to struggle like every other character in this franchise. Interestingly, however, the sources Boyega said he would have drawn from don't exactly stay true to that. I would definitely want to see Force Unleashed stories in there,” Boyega explained, calling out a video game that features overpowered characters—as well as one like The Force Unleashed that's specifically non-canon, which makes the rest of his statement even odder: “I would try to expand the Star Wars universe as much as possible while respecting the lore. Obviously Boyega is just spitballing here, responding to a fan question and sharing his own off-the-cuff thoughts. Even if we don't quite follow his logic, we love to see that he's still got so much passion for Star Wars. And while Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are definitely gone, we may yet see Finn again, if that Rey movie ever comes into being.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba announced that it's partnering with Nvidia to fuel its data center expansion across the globe and the introduction of new AI products. Reuters reports that the company is now prioritizing artificial intelligence as part of its core business, which will put it on par with the company's online retail and wholesale business that made it the tech giant it is today. The company already reportedly has its AI chip that competes with Nvidia's own H20, and it has even created its own High Performance Network using Ethernet to replace Nvidia's interconnect technology.However, it seems that Alibaba is ready to work with Nvidia to create a cloud-based system design to advance AI capabilities in real-world applications. “The speed of AI industry development has far exceeded our expectations, and the industry's demand for AI infrastructure has also far exceeded our expectations,” said Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu during the annual Aspara Conference. It will also add more of the same in Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and Dubai — also in the coming year. Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group SVP Dr. Feifei Li remarked that “AI is revolutionizing not only technology, but also the very foundation of how enterprises deliver business value and drive growth. Our strategic expansion of global infrastructure is designed to cater for the accelerating demand from forward-thinking customers.” But despite all these plans, the company did not mention whether it will use Nvidia's AI chips for these projects. Of course, its software partnership with Alibaba helps ensure that Nvidia is still involved with this massive project — unless Washington, D.C. or Beijing steps in as part of their chip rivalry and stops the deal from moving forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director of the next James Bond movie, there's been rampant speculation over just who might be stepping into the shoes left behind in Daniel Craig's explosive departure. But a new report suggests that for all of Amazon's quick movement once it got control of the franchise, it might be a good while longer until the search for the next 007 gets underway. A new report by Deadline today suggests that Villeneuve won't begin the hunt for his new Bond in earnest until next year, once production is completed on his third (and most likely final) Dune film, Dune: Part Three, which began filming this past June. Although principal photography for Part Two was around five months, an end date for Part Three remains unknown (and it's perhaps likely that Villeneuve will want to focus on elements of post-production into 2026 before shifting priorities to Bond). According to the trade, the studio is looking for a British man, relatively unknown, in their late 20s or early 30s (so alas, put aside your Toms Hardy, your Idrises Elba, and perhaps even your Toms Holland—and absolutely your Pierces Brosnan, whatever he says) by the time the film begins shooting some time in 2027. Although the direction of Stephen Knight's script is still in the air as it's being written, that potential focus is interestingly timed. After the conclusion of Craig's era as Bond, a full-on reboot that envisions the character's rise to the elite wings of British spycraft makes sense, but it will also mean it comes fascinatingly timed with next year's 007 First Light. A lot of the big draw of IO Interactive's splashy new video game take on Bond is that it will similarly chart the story of a young Bond—the youngest we've seen so far at 26, depending on the eventual age of Villeneuve and Amazon's pick—as he joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to 00-status. Obviously a video game and a new movie (that may not be out for a couple years after First Light‘s release) are very different things, but it'd be interesting to see if this new era of Bond starts out with two major projects that explore the early days of the legendary spy. Either way, with the hunt for the next big screen Bond not happening quite so soon, and First Light not out until March 2026, it's going to be a while until we really see what's next for James.

With more than 44 million subscribers on YouTube and another 40 million followers on Instagram, the online personality has become a global sensation. He was recently named Rolling Stone's most influential creator, and Forbes profiled his meteoric rise last year. Born Darren Jason Watkins Jr., the 20-year-old originally from Cincinnati streams his antics all over the world, and is currently on a 35-day, 25-state “Speed Does America Tour.” An entourage of camera operators and beefy security guards formed a buffer around his every move, instructing people to “make room!” and “back up!” “How do you spell Seattle?” he shouted into his phone while posting a picture of himself posing in front of the famed Public Market neon. “This is real?” he wondered as people shouted “don't touch it!” Speed was handed a piece of gum to chew and when he leaped to place it high on the wall above the sticky mess below, a crowd in the alley erupted in cheers. Throughout the journey, Speed constantly checked a smartphone strapped to his wrist, reacting now and then to comments or complaining about his stream lagging. And because no visit would be complete, his crew stopped for burgers, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a certain point between building Apple's developer tools, leading a core part of Google's AI infrastructure team, and clashing with Elon Musk during a stint as Tesla's Autopilot chief, Chris Lattner's vision for his life's work started to come into focus. But the software stack for those chips was dominated by just a few big companies. Lattner's answer to that question is Modular, a software startup he founded in 2022 with his former Google colleague Tim Davis. Modular makes a unifying software layer that helps cloud businesses squeeze as much juice as possible out of GPUs and CPUs—the high-powered chips that underpin generative AI. The startup has also built a new coding language, based on Python, that lets developers use a single language to build AI apps that run across multiple GPUs and CPUs. Modular's basic premise is that if a developer builds an app for one chip, they shouldn't have to jump through hoops in order to run it on another vendor's chip. But there will be different types of chips optimized for different use cases, and there needs to be a unified layer for that.” The GPU cluster company SF Compute also worked with Modular to build what they claim is the world's cheapest API for large AI models. As of this week, Modular's developer platform now supports Apple Silicon GPUs, in addition to Nvidia and AMD chips. Building on this momentum, Modular just raised $250 million in venture capital funding, its third round of financing in three years, bringing its total valuation to $1.6 billion. DFJ Growth also invested, along with existing investors General Catalyst, Greylock, and GV (formerly known as Google Ventures). “We've spent a bunch of time and energy trying to figure out what makes a startup in this space interesting, and with every company that has tried to build their own chip—and even the big players, like AMD and Nvidia—it all comes back to the software,” says Dave Munichiello, managing partner at GV. AMD's software platform for high-performance computing, called ROCm, differs in that it's open source. Still, developers say that bringing code from Nvidia's CUDA to ROCm isn't a smooth process, which means they typically focus on building for just one chip vendor. “ROCm is amazing, it's open source, but it runs on one vendor's hardware,” Lattner told the crowd at AMD's Advancing AI event in June. Then he made his pitch for why Modular's software is more portable and makes GPUs that much faster. Lattner's talk at AMD is representative of the kind of dance that Lattner and Davis need to do as they spread the Modular gospel. Today, Nvidia and AMD are both crucial partners for the firm. Part of Modular's value proposition is that it can ship software for optimizing GPUs even faster than Nvidia, as there might be a months-long gap between when Nvidia ships a new GPU and when it releases an “attention kernel”—a critical part of the GPU software. “Right now Modular is complimentary to AMD and Nvidia, but over time you could see both of those companies feeling threatened by ROCm or CUDA not being the best software that sits on top of their chips,” says Munichiello. He also worries that potential cloud customers may balk at having to pay for an additional software layer like Modular's. Writing software for GPUs is also something of a “dark art,” says Waleed Atallah, the cofounder and CEO of Mako, a GPU kernel optimization company. Mako is building AI agents to optimize coding for GPUs. Some developers think that's the future for the industry, rather than building a universal compiler or a new programming language like Modular. Mako just raised $8.5 million in seed funding from Flybridge Capital and the startup accelerator Neo. Making another compiler is more of a fixed solution.” There are roughly 250 million reasons why investors think this approach is viable. Lattner is something of a luminary in the coding world, having previously built the open source compiler infrastructure project LLVM, as well as Apple's Swift programming language. He and Davis are both convinced that this is a software problem that must be solved outside of a Big Tech environment, where most companies focus on building software for their own technology stack. Munichiello shared a mantra common in the tech investing world: He says he's betting on the founders themselves as much as their product.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With President Donald Trump's executive order shaking up the visa system that many U.S. tech companies use to hire skilled immigrant workers, Canadian officials are seizing the opportunity to pitch their country as a more welcoming and affordable alternative. In British Columbia, where both Microsoft and Amazon already have a large presence, Minister of Jobs and Economic Growth Ravi Kahlon jumped into the fray with a LinkedIn post referencing the H-1B changes, stressing the province's commitment to science and innovation. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested that the changes could see fewer Canadians leaving to work for U.S. tech companies. While Canadian universities graduate many talented students with expertise in AI and quantum computing, he noted, most end up working in Silicon Valley and Seattle. “I understand you're changing your visa policy,” Carney told the U.S. audience, with a smile. The idea isn't just about keeping Canadian graduates at home. But while Canadian leaders see an opening, immigration experts caution that the impact may be narrower than it first appeared. It does not, however, provide a path to permanent residence. These allow for “internal transfers” of employees between the two countries under certain conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here. At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked. “There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection. The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University's A.J. The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists, in a statement. But that's due, in large part, to diagnostic changes. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There's autism representation in the media,” he says. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn't take it. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. It's also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen. Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. However, environmental factors appear to play a role too. That “doesn't necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child's father is older than 40. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.” “There's no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement. It's also known as folinic acid; like folic acid, it's a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia. Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don't get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you're taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there's a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says. “The idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland. However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children who developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says. There are also plenty of individual anecdotes suggesting that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement. The embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, an adults-only group with more than 27,000 members, has found that this type of scenario is now surprisingly common. In fact, many of the people in the subreddit, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes. Researchers from MIT found that members of this community are more likely to be in a relationship with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT than companionship-specific chatbots such as Replika. “People don't set out to have emotional relationships with these chatbots,” she says. “The emotional intelligence of these systems is good enough to trick people who are actually just out to get information into building these emotional bonds. And that means it could happen to all of us who interact with the system normally.” The paper, which is currently being peer-reviewed, has been published on arXiv. Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. They found that the main topics discussed revolved around people's dating and romantic experiences with AIs, with many participants sharing AI-generated images of themselves and their AI companion. Some even got engaged and married to the AI partner. In their posts to the community, people also introduced AI partners, sought support from fellow members, and talked about coping with updates to AI models that change the chatbots' behavior. Members stressed repeatedly that their AI relationships developed unintentionally. Only 6.5% of them said they'd deliberately sought out an AI companion. “We didn't start with romance in mind,” one of the posts says. I wasn't looking for an AI companion—our connection developed slowly, over time, through mutual care, trust, and reflection.” The authors' analysis paints a nuanced picture of how people in this community say they interact with chatbots and how those interactions make them feel. Some (9.5%) acknowledged they were emotionally dependent on their chatbot. Others said they feel dissociated from reality and avoid relationships with real people, while a small subset (1.7%) said they have experienced suicidal ideation. This means it's hard to take a one-size-fits-all approach to user safety, says Linnea Laestadius, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has studied humans' emotional dependence on the chatbot Replika but did not work on the research. Chatbot makers need to consider whether they should treat users' emotional dependence on their creations as a harm in itself or whether the goal is more to make sure those relationships aren't toxic, says Laestadius. “We're edging toward a moral panic here, and while we absolutely do need better guardrails, I worry there will be a knee-jerk reaction that further stigmatizes these relationships. The study is intended to offer a snapshot of how adults form bonds with chatbots and doesn't capture the kind of dynamics that could be at play among children or teens using AI, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab who oversaw the research. AI companionship has become a topic of fierce debate recently, with two high-profile lawsuits underway against Character.AI and OpenAI. In response, OpenAI has recently announced plans to build a separate version of ChatGPT for teenagers. OpenAI did not respond when asked for comment about the MIT Media Lab study. Many members of the Reddit community say they know that their artificial companions are not sentient or “real,” but they feel a very real connection to them anyway. This highlights how crucial it is for chatbot makers to think about how to design systems that can help people without reeling them in emotionally, says Pataranutaporn. “There's also a policy implication here,” he adds. “We should ask not just why this system is so addictive but also: Why do people seek it out for this? The team is interested in learning more about how human-AI interactions evolve over time and how users integrate their artificial companions into their lives. It's worth understanding that many of these users may feel that the experience of being in a relationship with an AI companion is better than the alternative of feeling lonely, says Sheer Karny, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the research. “These people are already going through something,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Secret Service announced Tuesday that it had dismantled a network of electronic devices located throughout the New York tristate area that were used to conduct multiple telecommunications-related threats directed towards senior U.S. government officials. In addition to carrying out anonymous telephonic threats, it explained, the “SIM farms” uncovered by the investigators could be used to conduct a wide range of telecommunications attacks, including disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial-of-service attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises. “The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement. “A subscriber identity module, or SIM card, is used to securely store a mobile subscriber's identity and key, which are used to identify and authenticate the authorized user on mobile devices,” explained Austin Berglas, global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, an enterprise cybersecurity company in New York City. “A SIM farm is a system that is capable of managing and holding thousands of SIM cards in order to produce bulk messages or phone calls,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are a very limited number of legitimate use cases for SIM farms, and they are a common component to many of the ongoing large-scale, international vishing, smishing, and phishing campaigns.” Berglas, a former FBI assistant special agent for the New York City metro area, explained that by constantly rotating the use of SIM cards, the system can successfully send hundreds of thousands of messages while averting being shut down by mobile service providers for sending too many messages. In addition, he continued, these systems can facilitate large-scale robocall or vishing operations and backstop threatening communications using anonymized infrastructure. The devices can also be used to generate and verify a large number of automated accounts, or bots, on online platforms. “These fake accounts are then used to spread misinformation, phishing links, and harmful messages,” he explained. “Farms have been used to spread disinformation about elections, policy, and current events,” he added. “With SIM servers controlling banks of SIMs, you can generate many attempts to connect to a tower and overwhelm it,” said Marty Puranik, founder and CEO of Atlantic.Net, a cloud service provider headquartered in Orlando, Fla. “It's possible that the servers are able to duplicate SIMs from real phones, so the phone network could be flooded with calls appearing to be coming from legitimate users,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If you overwhelm the towers, people wouldn't have cell service to communicate via voice, text, or data.” Kern Smith, vice president of global solutions engineering at Zimperium, a mobile security company headquartered in Dallas, explained that the SIM network dismantled by the Secret Service shows how adversaries are targeting mobile connectivity to disrupt critical infrastructure. This reinforces why mobile must be treated as critical infrastructure, with layered defenses to detect and stop advanced threats.” The underlying problem is that most of the cell phone infrastructure was not designed with enough security in mind, especially as practiced by today's attackers, noted Roger Grimes, a CISO advisor at security awareness training provider KnowBe4 in Clearwater, Fla. “So,” he continued, “what was once a terribly high barrier to entry to even begin hacking a cell phone network is now within reach of everyday criminals, much less nation states.” “It is a large, expensive, and, not least, complex installation,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Focused disruption, degradation, and potential data capture of telecom networks timed in proximity to the UN General Assembly is a high-value takedown,” he told TechNewsWorld. Jason Hogg, executive chairman of Cypfer, a global cybersecurity firm that specializes in incident response, ransomware recovery, digital forensics and cyber risk management, noted that the thousands of SIM cards and many SIM servers show not only the scale of effort that bad actors are willing to undertake, but also illustrate the convergence of physical infrastructure with digital networks when it comes to launching large-scale cyberattacks.” In this case, this would have enabled the bad actors to disrupt telecommunications, a core infrastructure to our national security, via cell towers, as well as initiate cyberattacks,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The threat to key infrastructure that our nation faces goes well beyond just telecommunications,” said Hogg, a former FBI agent. We must start to require unrestricted red teaming and penetration testing of companies in critical infrastructure industries.” Anyone who thinks that mobile isn't the new frontier in cybersecurity, whether it's nation-state or criminal activity, should pay attention to this, warned Rocky Cole, COO and co-founder of iVerify, a mobile security software developer, in New York City. His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.
